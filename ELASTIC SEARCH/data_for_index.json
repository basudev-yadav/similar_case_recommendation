        "p_2": "1. The plaintiff is a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act which is carrying on business, inter alia, of manufacturer and seller of pharmaceuticals and medicinal preparations. It claims to be a well known pharmaceutical company enjoying very high reputation for its products because of excellent quality and efficacy. Total turnover of plaintiff company for the year 2000-2001 was more than 35 crores. One of its drugs is under the Trade MarkCEFI. This medicine is used for the treatment of typhoid, lower Respiratory Tract Infection, urinary Tract Infection and OtIT is Media and contains cefixime. The plaintiff has filed present suit for permanent injunction restraining, passing off, delivery of infringing goods, rendition of accounts etc. against the defendant with the allegations that in relation to same medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations defendant has adopted the Trade Mark ZIFI which is phonetically similar to that of plaintiff's Trade Mark CEFI and, therefore, is bound to cause confusion in the minds of consumers as they may treat the defendant's goods as that of the plaintiff. Thus, according to the plaintiff, defendant's Trade Mark ZIFI being similar to Trade Mark CEFI, sale of medicines under the Trade Mark ZIFI by the defendant amounts to an act of passing of their goods as that of the plaintiff. \n",
        "p_3": "2. Facts are more or less admitted. It is the case of the plaintiff that in July, 2000 it conceived and invented the Trade Mark CEFI for its medicinal preparations. Application for registration of this Trade Mark was submitted to Trade Mark Registry on 17-8-2000. On 24-11-2000 the Food and Drug Administration granted permission to the plaintiff to manufacture the drug cefixime tablets USP 200 mg and cefixime Dispersible Tablets 100 mg and cefixime for Oral Suspension USP. On 23-4-2001 the plaintiff launched its preparations under the Trade Mark CEFI and CEFI DT as well as CEFI Dry Syrup. The plaintiff further claims that it spent huge amount in popularizing its said product through advertisements etc. and that because of well established and reputed pharmaceutical concern, the Trade Mark CEFI has also attained high reputation and goodwill for its products. During April, 2001-July, 2001 the plaintiff sold their products worth Rs. 1,99,61,290/-. It is further alleged that on 23-7-2001 plaintiff came across the defendant's product bearing the trade mark ZIFI-100 DT and ZIFI-200 which also contains cefixime and the two products being phonetically and deceptively similar to the trade mark CEFI, present suit is filed. \n",
        "p_4": "3. By order dated 1-8-2001 in IA. 6867/2001, the ex-parte ad-interim injunction order was granted restraining the defendants from using the trade mark ZIFI and/or any other trade mark deceptively similar to the plaintiff's trade mark CEFI in respect of medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations. The defendant, after it was served with the summons in the suit and notice in the aforesaid injunction application filed IA. 7146/2001 under Order XXXIX Rule 4 CPC for vacation of the said ex-part ad interim injunction granted on 1-8-2001 by alleging that plaintiff had obtained the injunction by making mis-representation. The opposition of the defendant to the grant of injunction is founded on the following submissions: \n",
        "p_5": " 1. The defendant has a family of trade marks starting with the letter 'Z' including ZOCON, ZOSPAR, ZO, ZOXAN AND ZEFRICH. The adoption of the trademark ZIFI is bonafide and not driven by an attempt to copy or take undue advantage of the plaintiff. \n",
        "p_6": " 2. The plaintiff's user is just about two months (i.e. 23rd April, 2001) prior to the date of institution of the suit. This is about the shortest user possible in an action for passing off. \n",
        "p_7": " 3. The plaintiff's mark CEFI is derived from the Chemical compound or salt Cefixime and there are umpteen authorities on the proposition that where marks are derived from such pharmaceutical salts, these are weak trademarks. Here the plaintiff has taken the first four letters of the name of the salt and this is therefore a weak trademark [F. Hoffman La Roche Vs. Geoffrey Manners, 1982 PTC 335; Panacea Biotec Vs. Recon 1996 PTC 561]. \n",
        "p_8": " 4. Even prior to the plaintiff's adoption of the trade mark CEFI, there have been several other pharmaceutical companies using marks derived from the Chemical salt Cefixime, namely:- \n",
        "p_9": "  - CEFO of Medley   \n\n \n\n",
        "p_10": " - CEFIX of Cipla   \n\n \n\n",
        "p_11": " - CEFO adopted by Alembic for the salt Cefuroxime  \n\n \n\n",
        "p_12": " - CEFU adopted by Prem Pharma for the salt Cefuroxime  \n\n \n\n",
        "p_13": " - CEFF adopted by Lupin for the salt Cephalexin  \n\n \n\n Others whose name appearing in the trade mark search reports given by the plaintiff's own attorney to the defendant two months prior to the date of launch of the plaintiff's project, include:- \n",
        "p_14": " - CEFEX of Parke Davis  \n\n \n\n",
        "p_15": " - CEFIXE of Nicholos Piramal  \n\n \n\n",
        "p_16": " - CEFOX of Siscon  \n\n \n\n",
        "p_17": " - CIFEX of Orion  \n\n \n\n",
        "p_18": " 5. The bonafides of the defendants are clear from the fact that it obtained a clear search report as regards conflicts with CEFI from its Attorney. Further the packaging of both products are completely different. \n",
        "p_19": " 6. The trademarks are different as the letter 'Z' is one of the highly distinctive letters in the English alphabet and has a powerful distinguishing capacity as held in Cadila Vs. Dabur 1997 PTC (17) 417 where the learned judge held: \n",
        "p_20": " \"....the defendant has independently opted for 'Z' which is a highly distinct letter among all the syllables of the English language.\"\n",
        "p_21": " 7. Quite apart from the above CEFI and ZIFI are pronounced differently and visually appear quite different particularly when pronounced in the Devnagri script and being scheduled drugs can only be purchased through a written prescription of a doctor or a registered medical practitioner and dispensed by a chemist or a registered pharmacist. Therefore, there are inherent checks and balances within the pharmaceutical industry which would ensure that the competing marks would not be confused. \n",
        "p_22": " On the other hand learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that ex-parte injunction order dated 1-8-2001 warrants to be confirmed and the sole emphasis was on the phonetic similarity between the two trade marks. It was submitted that the argument that cefixime is a generic word was of no avail to the defendant inasmuch as defendant had not adopted the word CEFI from the aforesaid word cefixime. The examples of other companies using similar trade mark was also of no consequence as all those companies were using the word CEFI and combining the same with some other word for their products. On the other hand the trade mark used by the defendant, namely, ZIFI had no relationship with the generic word cefixime. Thus what needed to be examined was to whether there was phonetic similarity between the two trade marks, namely, CEFI and ZIFI and it was likely to cause deception. The comparison was not between two generic words. It was submitted that it was a clear case of similarity with same structure of word in respect of same medicine. In case of such phonetic similarity, it was argued that the Plaintiff was entitled to injunction and following judgments were cited in support of this: \n",
        "p_23": " 1. . [TISCO : FISCO] \n\n \n\n",
        "p_24": " 2. AIR 1986 Delhi 345 [DOUBLE : BUBBLE] \n\n \n\n",
        "p_25": " 3.  [CHARMIS : FORMIS] \n\n \n\n",
        "p_26": " 4. 1987 PTC 47 [EXIDE : ROXIDE] \n\n \n\n",
        "p_27": " 5. 1997 (28) Arb. LR 25 [CASTROL : BESTROL] \n\n \n\n Relying upon the recent Supreme Court judgment in the case of Cadila Healthcare Ltd. Vs. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd. IPLR 2001 APR. 87 it was submitted that there may be a bar on claiming trade mark rights in a generic word or a phonetic equivalent thereof but there is no bar in claiming trade mark right in a mark derived from the generic word. This emerges from the reading of CADILA Judgment\" where the basic plea taken by the defendant was that the competing trade marks were \"FALCIGO\" and \"FALICITAB\" derived from \"FALCIPHARUM\", a disease of cerreberal malaria. There was nothing similar between the trade marks except prefix \"FALCI\" derived from the generic name \"FALCIPHARUM\". Despite the defense taken of the generic nature of the trade mark, the Supreme Court excluded the said plea to be taken into consideration in determining deceptive similarity between competing trade marks derived from generic names of the drugs or diseases. Hence, it is perfectly permissible in law. There is also no such bar under Trade and Merchandise Marks Act. It was also submitted that following case of Amritdhara Pharmacy Vs. Satya Deo Gupta  the Supreme Court held that \"the court is not to go into etymological meaning of the words used as trade mark. The reason being that such meanings are not known to the consumers\". In the present case from claiming proprietary right in the trade mark \"CEFI\" on the ground that it is derived from the generic name of the drug \"CEFIXIME\". Such contention is against \"CADILA judgment\". The plaintiff is not claiming any trade mark right in the generic name \"CEFIXIME\". The mark \"CEFI\" is not a phonetic equivalent of the generic name \"CEFIXIME\". The layman or consumer would not know or is concerned with the salt used in the drug. \"CEFI\" is, therefore, a valid trade mark and is to be protected like any other trade mark. Reliance was also placed in the case of Win-Medicare Ltd. Vs. Somacare Laboratories 1997 PTC (17) 34 where \"DICLOMOL\" was held to be an inventive trade mark though derived from the salt diclophenyl sodium and paracetamol. It is a common practice in the drug industry to derive trade marks from the name of drug or disease. It was submitted that the law in respect of trade marks derived from generic drugs has been put to rest after the \"CADILA Judgment\". It was submitted that in this case the factor of \"scheduled drug\" has been considered as irrelevant by the Supreme Court which was also the law laiddown in the case of K.R. Chinna Krishna Chettiar Vs. Sri Ambal & Co., and another  and in the case of Amritdhara Pharmacy Vs. Satya Deo Gupta . The other submission of learned counsel for the plaintiff was that the proprietary right in a trade mark is acquired by prior use irrespective of length of use (Century Traders Vs. Roshan Lal Duggar & Co. and others ) and that goodwill can be acquired within the short span of time (1998 PTC 698), which the plaintiff was able to prove in this case. The learned counsel concluded his submissions in the following manner: \n",
        "p_28": " a. Law does not prohibit coining a trade mark from generic name as long as the coined trade mark does not convey the same meaning as the generic name to a consumer. \n",
        "p_29": " b. It the trade mark is not itself a generic word or phonetic equivalent thereof, it is to be considered as a fancy trade mark which would be protected like any other trade mark.  \n",
        "p_30": " c. While determining the deceptive similarity of competing trade marks, the letters derived from generic word and forming part of the trade mark are not to be excluded. The trade marks are to be compared as a whole. \n",
        "p_31": " d. The meaning conveyed by the trade marks, if not known to the consumer is an irrelevant factor. It is the phonetic similarity which is relevant consideration.  \n",
        "p_32": " e. CEFI does not convey any meaning by itself unless explained. CEFI by itself is not generic word. \n",
        "p_33": " f. The trade mark CEFI  and ZIFI are deceptively similar on account of phonetic similarity. \n",
        "p_34": " There is no quarrel about the propositions of law which are argued by either side. Of course, principles laid down by Supreme Court in Cadila case (supra) have to be kept in mind. However, one need not deal with the various arguments advanced by both the sides at this stage. Central issue, after all, is limited in its scope. Admittedly, the core issue to be examined is whether there is phonetic similarity between the two trade marks CEFI and ZIFI. After all the plaintiff's own case is founded on this argument. Therefore, it is this aspect which needs to be examined at this stage while considering the application for grant of ad-interim injunction. Before deciding this aspect, few salient facts are to be borne in mind. The plaintiff's trade mark CEFI is derived from Chemical bound cefixime as it is not in dispute that the drugs manufactured and sold by the plaintiff contained cefixime. It is also not in dispute that for same medicine many other pharmaceutical companies are using the trade marks derived from cefixime. Many of these companies launched their medicines in the market much prior to the launching of its product by the plaintiff. Therefore, the plaintiff cannot claim itself to be the first user of such a trade mark. On the contrary as per plaintiff's own showing its products under the trade mark CEFI was launched only in April, 2001. When there can be same medicinal products marketed by different companies with the use of CEF as part of the trade name, namely, cefo, cefix, cefu, ceff, ceffex, cefixe, cefox and cifex etc. which are more similar or nearer to the plaintiff's trade mark phonetically as well as alphabetically, and when all such trade marks can co-exist in the market without causing any deception or confusion it is beyond comprehension that the defendant's trade mark ZIFI which starts with alphabet-Z would cause any confusio of deception. Coupled with this, one has to keep in mind that the drug in question is a scheduled drug and can only be purchased through a written prescription of a doctor or a registered medical practitioner and dispensed by a chemist or a registered pharmacist. The argument of scheduled drug, by itself alone, may not be sufficient to dislodge the case of the plaintiff once the principle laid down in Cadila (supra) is kept in mind. However, when this aspect is considered along with other factors weighing favor of the defendant it assumes some significance at least. One cannot at this stage lose sight of the fact that defendant is not a fly-by-night type of company but also been able to sell the medicine in question to the tune of approximately Rs. 90 lakhs in 15 days i.e. 16-7-2001 to 31-7-2001. The defendant also claims that the price of its product is lowest in the industry and with a view to eliminate the defendant from the market the plaintiff has filed the present suit. It is also explained that defendant has a family of trade mark beginning with 'Z' which encompasses ZOXAN, ZOXAN-TZ, ZOXAN Eye and Ear Drops, ZOXAN Eye Ointment, ZOXAN-D Eye Drops, ZOSPAR, ZO ZO-T, ZOCON, ZOCON-T ZOCON Eye Drops, ZEFRICH. These claims are also not disputed by the plaintiff. Therefore, prima facie it appears that the use of trade mark ZIFI by the defendant for its medicine or products is not going to cause any confusion and/or deception in the mind of consumers. When there are many products in the market having similar name as that of plaintiff than that of the defendant, it would be improper to continue the interim injunction as the balance of convenience is also in favor of the defendant. The inconvenience and the loss which may be caused to the defendant is likely to be much more in case the injunction is continued than the so called inconvenience to the plaintiff if the following observations of Supreme Court in the case of Wander Ltd. & Anr. Vs. Antox India (P) Ltd. reported in 1990 (Supp) SCC 727: \n",
        "p_35": " \"Usually, the prayer for grant of an interlocutory injunction is at a stage when the existence of the legal right asserted by the plaintiff and its alleged violation are both contested and uncertain and remain uncertain till they are established at the trial on evidence. The court, at this stage, acts on certain well settled principles of administration of this form of interlocutory remedy which is both temporary and discretionary. The objection of the interlocutory injunction, if is stated  \n\n \n\n \"..is to protect the plaintiff against injury by violation of his rights for which he could not adequately be compensated in damages recoverable in the action if the uncertainty were resolved in his favor at the trial. The need for such protection must be weighed against the corresponding need of the defendant to be protected against injury resulting from his having been prevented from exercising his own legal rights for which he could not be adequately compensated. The court must weigh one need against another and determine where the 'balance of convenience lies.\" \n",
        "p_36": " The interlocutory remedy is intended to preserve in status quo, the rights of parties which may appear on a prima facie case. The court also, in restraining a defendant from exercising what he considers his legal right but what the plaintiff would like to be prevented, puts into the scales, as a relevant consideration whether the defendant has yet to commence his enterprise somewhat different from those that apply to a case where the defendant is yet to commence his enterprise, are attracted.\" \n",
        "p_37": " Accordingly, I.A. 6867/2001 filed by the plaintiff is dismissed and I.A. 7146/2001 filed by the defendant is allowed. Ex-parte ad interim injunction granted on 1st August, 2001 is hereby vacated. \n",

To extend this\n                  use to answer this, focus has to be on\n                  the aspect as to whether the Defendant\n                  is making some representation in\n                  course     of  trade  to prospective\n                  customers which is calculated to injure\n                  the business or goodwill of the\n                  Plaintiff thereby causing damage to\n                  him. In the process, difference\n                  between the confusion and deception\n                  is to be understood. This difference\n                  was explained by Lord Denning in\n                  \"Difference: Confusion & Deception\"\n                  in the following words:\n",

It is its probable effect on\n                  ordinary people which you have to\n                  consider. No doubt if you find that he\n                  did intend to deceive or cause\n                  confusion, you will give him credit for\n                  success in his intentions.

The\n                  difference is this: when you deceive a\n                  man, you tell him a lie.

A court should not\n                       engage \"technical gymnastics\" in\n                       an attempt to find some minor\n                       differences between conflicting\n                       marks. However, where there are\n                       both similarities and differences\n                       in the marks, there must be\n                       weighed against one another to\n                       see which predominate.\"\n",

        "p_5": "4. In nutshell the plaintiff's case is as under:\n",
        "p_6": "4.1. Plaintiff, SM Dyechem Limited, is a Public Limited Company incorporated under the provisions of the Companies Act and is carrying on their business of manufacturing and marketing of chemicals and chemical products and food products, including ready to eat snacks, such as potato crisps, potato chips, potato wafers, corn puffs, preparations made from rice and rice flour, preparations made from cereal, etc.\n\n \n\n4.2. Defendant, Cadbury India Limited, is also a Public Limited Company incorporated under the provisions of the Companies Act and is carrying on business of manufacturing and selling chocolate preparations/wafer biscuits, snacks, etc.\n\n \n\n4.3. In 1988, the plaintiff started business in the field of processing of food products, more particularly known as ready to eat snacks as mentioned hereinabove in their food division known as \"SM Foods\". In 1989, the plaintiff's said division developed and adopted a trade mark, in the name and style of \"PIKNIK\", in relation to ready to eat snacks processed by them.\n",
        "p_7": "4.4. After adoption of the said trade mark \"PIKNIK\", the plaintiff commenced use of the said trade mark in relation to ready to eat snacks processed by them and marketed the goods in the name and style of \"PIKNIK\".\n",
        "p_8": "4.5. The plaintiff is the lawful proprietor of the said trade mark since February 1989 and, therefore, on 17.2.1989 the Food Division of the plaintiff applied for registration of a label mark, containing the word \"PIKNIK\", under the Act, in class 29 in respect of preserved, dried and cooked fruits and vegetables, etc. under application No. 505531B. The plaintiff also applied for registration of the said trade mark in class 30 in respect of tea, coffee, etc. under application No.505532. The plaintiff also applied for registration of the said trade mark in class 32 in respect of beverages, beers, mineral and aerated waters, soda water, etc. under application No.505533.\n",
        "p_9": "4.6. The aforesaid three applications were processed and pursuant to the orders passed by the Registrar of Trade Marks, the plaintiff became the registered proprietor of said trade mark \"PIKNIK\" under Nos.505531B, 505532 and 505533 in Classes 29, 30 and 32 respectively. Since the plaintiff became the proprietor of the said trade mark, they are entitled to use exclusively the said trade mark in relation to the aforesaid goods and the plaintiff has a right to restrain others from using the same and/or similar trade mark.\n",
        "p_10": "4.7. It was further case of the plaintiff that since 1989, on an extensive and ever growing scale, the plaintiff has been expanding from time to time its range of ready to eat snacks and has been selling their goods bearing the said trade mark throughout the country with the help of wide network of stockists and dealers.\n",
        "p_11": "4.8. By virtue of intensive and extensive sales promotional efforts, adequately supplemented by widespread publicity all over the country, coupled with high standard of quality and controls adhered to by the plaintiff, the plaintiff's said goods have become very popular and acquired tremendous reputation and goodwill all over the country and the said goods became distinctive with the plaintiff and is exclusively identified by the trade and public with the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_12": "4.9. In sum and substance, the plaintiff's case is that they have painstakingly built up formidable reputation and goodwill in respect of the said trade mark \"PIKNIK\" and the enormous reputation and goodwill is reflected from the fact that the plaintiff's sale of said goods have been growing by leaps and bounds year after year.\n",
        "p_13": "4.10. The plaintiff's attention was drawn on a food product, being a chocolate preparation/wafer biscuits snacks marketed under the trade mark \"PICNIC\" purported to be manufactured by the defendant. As the trade mark used in respect of the goods being an eatable and was similar to the plaintiff's trade mark, which was also used for eatables, and the same was violating the rights of the plaintiff in respect of the said trade mark \"PIKNIK\", the plaintiff, through their trade mark attorney, caused a letter dated 16.3.1998, to be addressed to the defendant, recording some of the abovesaid facts and calling upon the defendant to cease and desist from the use of the trade mark \"PICNIC\" in relation to the impugned goods forthwith. The plaintiff also informed that the plaintiff is the registered proprietor of the said trade mark \"PIKNIK\" in relation to chocolate, biscuits and other foods products and, therefore, the use of the trade mark \"PICNIC\" by the defendant in respect of their chocolates, etc., was infringing the rights of the plaintiff in respect of the said trade mark \"PIKNIK\". The plaintiff also called upon the defendant to pay Rs.3 crores towards the damages in addition to the notice charges.\n",
        "p_14": "4.11. It was further case of the plaintiff that though the aforesaid letter was received by the defendant they failed to give any considered reply and as a matter of fact the defendant had conclusively failed to assign any cogent and justifiable reason for using the impugned trade mark \"PICNIC\".\n",
        "p_15": "4.12. In spite of the plaintiff calling upon the defendant to discontinue the use of the impugned trade mark, the defendant has continued to use the same and the defendant has failed and neglected to comply with the requisitions contained in the letter dated 16.3.1998 issued by the plaintiff's trade mark attorney and they have continued to openly advertise and sell the impugned goods under the plaintiff's trade mark.\n",
        "p_16": "4.13. According to the plaintiff, notwithstanding the above facts and with full knowledge that the plaintiff's range of food products or ready to eat snacks or eatables are sold under the trade mark \"PIKNIK\", the defendant, with fraudulent and dishonest intention of encashing and trading upon the plaintiff's goodwill and reputation, adopted and introduced chocolate preparations or wafers, biscuits, also being food products or ready to eat snacks or eatables under the same trade mark \"PICNIC\" knowing fully well about the fact that the word PIKNIK irrespective of manners in which it is either spelled or pronounced, the public is likely to be confused and/or deceived as to the origin of the impugned goods and public interest being of considerable importance, should not be allowed to be jeopardized and, therefore, the defendant should not be allowed to encash the reputation and goodwill of the plaintiff, by using the trade mark \"PICNIC\". It was further alleged that by using the trade mark \"PICNIC\", the defendant is violating the plaintiff's exclusive right in respect of said registered trade mark \"PIKNIK\". Hence, the suit was filed for perpetual injunction to restrain the defendant from in any manner using the trademark \"PICNIC\" in relation to chocolates, chocolate preparation, etc., or any other trade mark which is deceptively or confusingly similar in the manner whatsoever to the plaintiff's trademark \"PIKNIK\" so as to infringe the plaintiff's trade mark \"PIKNIK\" registered under No. 505532.\n",
        "p_17": "4.14. Along with the suit, application Ex.6, notice of motion, was also taken out by the plaintiff, wherein, inter alia, it was prayed for temporary injunction restraining the defendant from in any manner using the trade mark \"PICNIC\" or any other trade mark which is deceptively and confusingly similar in any manner whatsoever to the plaintiff's trade mark \"PIKNIK\" so as to infringe plaintiff's trade mark registered under No. 505532, in relation to chocolates, chocolate preparations, etc., and has also prayed for restraining the defendant from passing off the goods as and for that of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_18": "4.15. The defendant hotly contested the application notice of motion- by filing reply at Ex.14, inter alia, contending that the plaintiff is not entitled to any relief on the ground of delay as the 'CADBURY'S PICNIC' was introduced in the market in February 1998. It was further case of the defendant that the trade mark \"PICNIC\" of the defendant was registered in the year 1977. It was contended that the trademark \"PICNIC\" of the defendant was registered by them earlier under No.329970 in Class 30 of the 4th Schedule to the Act. It was further averred that the defendant has filed a subsequent application for registration of the mark CADBURY PICNIC in August, 1996 under application No.712676. It was contended that the defendant's trade mark \"CADBURY'S PICNIC\" was considered by the Registrar who in any case had directed that the registration of the Trade Mark shall give no right to the exclusive use of the word \"PICNIC\", it being a common dictionary word. It was alleged that the plaintiff has obtained registration of a label mark containing the words PIK-NIK knowing fully well that they would never have been able to register the mark PIK-NIK or any imitation or a misspelling thereof as it is considered to be not distinctive. It was further contended that the word CADBURY PICNIC and/or \"PICNIC\" and/or label consisting of the word PICNIC is registered by the defendant's parent company in all over 110 countries all over the world and the application for the same or similar marks are pending in many other countries. It was further averred that by virtue of the existence of the registration world over and use of the mark PICNIC, the defendant's parent company has transborder reputation and goodwill and the plaintiff cannot claim monopoly in an ordinary dictionary word or any misspelling thereof. It was further contended that the plaintiff never intended to be in chocolates or confectionery business and the main business of the plaintiff was dyes and chemical. It was further averred that the business relating to food articles is merely ancillary and primarily confined extruded if it is falling in the category of \"Namkin\" or \"Papads\" and, therefore, it was alleged that the plaintiff has filed a fraudulent and frivolous suit to deliberately and purposely harass and defame and defendant's goodwill and denied that trademark of the defendant is similar to the plaintiff's label mark. It was contended that both the labels are different and distinct from each other. It was further contended that PICNIC or PIKNIK is ordinary dictionary word and ordinary dictionary word cannot be registered as a trademark. The defendant, therefore, contended that the plaintiff is not entitled to any relief and prayed for dismissing the application.\n",
        "p_19": "5. The learned trial Judge, after considering the submissions advanced by learned advocates for both the parties and after appreciating the documents produced before him and on the facts emerging from the record of the case so also considering the case law relied upon by the learned advocates for both the sides, has allowed the application No.6, notice of motion, by granting injunction as prayed for in favour of the plaintiff by holding that the plaintiff's trade mark is registered, the plaintiff has a prima facie case and balance of convenience also tilted in favour of the plaintiff and if the injunction as prayed for is not granted the plaintiff is likely to suffer irreparable loss and its reputation and resultantly the learned trial Judge has restrained the defendant by issuing temporary injunction from using the plaintiff's trade mark in relation to the chocolate, chocolate preparations, etc., so that there may not be any infringement to the plaintiff's trade mark \"PIKNIK\" and also restrained the defendant from passing off the defendant's goods as and for that of the plaintiff. It is this finding and resultant order which is now impugned before this Court at the instance of the defendant.\n",
        "p_20": "6. Learned Senior Counsel Mr.Thakore on behalf of the appellant strenuously assailed the order mainly on the following premise:\n",
        "p_21": "(i) The word 'PIKNIK' is an exact phonetic equivalent of a common dictionary word 'PICNIC' and therefore it cannot be considered as an invented work. Alternatively, if it is considered as an invented word, the plaintiff on the basis of such invented word, cannot stop the defendant from using a common dictionary word like 'PICNIC' which is otherwise unregisterable and can be used by any person.\n",
        "p_22": "(ii) The registration which is granted to the plaintiff is a label containing the word 'PIKNIK' written in a particular manner with a caricature of a little boy above it. Such registration does not prevent any one from using a common dictionary word 'PICNIC' with respect to its goods. Therefore, no infringement would take place since the defendant used the word 'PICNIC' only and not the label registered by the plaintiff and therefore the plaintiff has no prima facie case since there was no infringement of its trade mark.\n",
        "p_23": "(iii) The defendant has trans-border reputation in not only the mark per se 'Cadbury' but also in the mark 'Cadbury Picnic'. In view of the trans-border reputation, there is no scope of passing off since the defendant's sales figures are far excess of the plaintiff's sales figure which clearly establishes that the defendant is not passing of their goods as made by the plaintiff but are effecting sales in view of their reputation as chocolate manufacturers and their goodwill in the mark 'Cadbury'.\n",
        "p_24": "(iv) Balance of convenience is tilted in favour of the defendant since the defendant is capable of compensating the plaintiff if the plaintiff succeeds at the trial, whereas the plaintiff is not capable of compensating the defendant for the loss incurred by the defendant on account of continuation of the injunction during pendency of the suit in case the defendant succeeds.\n",
        "p_25": "(v) The defendant has already applied for rectification of the plaintiff's trade mark label containing the word 'PIKNIK'. There are all good reasons to succeed since the plaintiff has never used label containing 'PIKNIK' for the manufacture of chocolate since registration. On this score also plaintiff is not entitled to ad-interim injunction against defendant for action of infringement.\n",
        "p_26": "(vi) The plaintiff is not entitled to any ad-interim or interim injunction on the principle of delay, laches or acquiescence as well.\n",
        "p_27": "7. On the aforesaid premise, learned Senior Counsel Mr.Thakore contended that the learned Chamber Judge has overlooked all the above aspects and committed serious error both of law and facts and misdirected himself about the crucial question on the basis of phonetic similarity between the two words which, according to the learned trial Judge, is likely to create confusion in the mind of buyers but in reality it is not so and on the basis of the aforesaid finding, the learned Chamber Judge has recorded erroneous finding with respect to prima facie case, balance of convenience and irreparable injury in favour of the plaintiff contrary to the settled canons of law and, therefore, the order recorded by the learned Chamber Judge is bad in law and, therefore, it is liable to be quashed and set aside by allowing this appeal and thereby vacating the injunction granted by the learned Chamber Judge by dismissing the application notice of motion.\n",
        "p_28": "8. In counter submissions, learned Senior Advocate Mr.S.B. Vakil for the respondent while supporting the impugned order throughout has repelled all the aforesaid contentions raised by the learned Senior Counsel Mr.Thakore for the appellant and submitted as under:\n",
        "p_29": "(i) The word 'PIKNIK' is an invented word. The word 'PICNIC' may be a common word but not the word 'PIKNIK'. Since the word 'PIKNIK' is registered, the plaintiff has a proprietary right over the same, therefore, infringement action will lie.\n",
        "p_30": "(ii) Registration of plaintiff's trade mark has become conclusive in view of expiry of statutory period of seven years from the date of registration and therefore it should be considered as a valid one.\n",
        "p_31": "(iii) Goods and labels of the defendant are different is no ground to escape action of infringement since action of infringement is a statutory remedy available in favour of proprietor of registered trade mark.\n",
        "p_32": "(iv) Trans-border reputation of the defendant's product cannot give way to Indian law of trade mark.\n",
        "p_33": "(v) Since in an action of infringement there is a recurring cause of action, the principle of delay cannot be invoked as it is not fatal in an action of infringement. Same is the position with laches and acquiescence. The suit is filed by the plaintiff in a period of ten months after serving the seizure and desist notice to the defendant and the said period cannot be construed as delay, laches or acquiescence.\n",
        "p_34": "(vi) Pendency of rectification petition is no ground to refuse injunction and on the basis thereof, defendant cannot claim equity in an action of infringement of registered trade mark.\n",
        "p_35": "(vii) The submission about the registered trade mark 'PIKNIK' is invalid since it is contrary to Section 9 of the Trade Mark Act is not correct as it is not open to challenge for any party once trade mark is registered. The work 'PIKNIK' is the essential feature of the plaintiff's trade mark, therefore, anyone who uses the said trade mark is liable for action of infringement under the law.\n",
        "p_36": "9. On the aforesaid premise, learned Senior Advocate Mr.Vakil has contended that the impugned order is just and proper and in accordance with law which does not require any interference at the hands of this Court. Since the finding and the resultant order recorded by the learned Chamber Judge is not perverse, arbitrary, unjust or unreasonable, this Appeal from Order is liable to be dismissed having no merits in it by affirming the impugned order.\n",
        "p_37": "10. Before examining the rival contentions of both the parties, let us highlight the undisputed aspects of the case which are incapable of being disputed.\n",
        "p_38": "(i) Plaintiff company is dealing in the business of processing food products and in January 1989, they got registered their trade mark in the name and style of label mark having a caricature of a little boy above it with word 'PIKNIK' in Class 29, 30 & 32 respectively. They are, therefore, the registered proprietor of the said trade mark of label mark having a caricature of a boy with word 'PIKNIK'.\n",
        "p_39": "(ii) Defendant marketed Cadbury Picnic chocolate in February 1998.\n",
        "p_40": "(iii) Plaintiff served notice on the defendant on 16.3.1998 alleging action of infringement of their trade mark by the defendant.\n",
        "p_41": "(iv) Defendant gives reply to the said notice refuting charge of infringement and passing off on 7.4.1998.\n",
        "p_42": "(v) From 7.4.1998 to 10.2.1999, plaintiff takes no action and allow defendant to market their products.\n",
        "p_43": "(vi) During the interregnum period, defendant incurred sales promotional expenditure i.e. selling cost of Rs.6.75 crores on the total sales of Rs.18 crores.\n",
        "p_44": "(vii) Plaintiff issues fresh notice dated 10.2.1999.\n",
        "p_45": "(viii) Plaintiff filed suit on 18.2.1999 i.e. almost after ten months after the defendant has started its business of manufacturing chocolate in the name of Cadbury Picnic.\n",
        "p_46": "(ix) Defendant has not so far started manufacturing of chocolate though the trade mark is registered in Class 30.\n",
        "p_47": "(x) Products of the plaintiff and the defendant are different. At present, plaintiff is marketing under trade mark of label mark with the word 'PIKNIK' potato chips, wafers etc. whereas defendant is manufacturing and marketing chocolate in the name of Cadbury Picnic. The said mark is unregistered.\n",
        "p_48": "(xi) Plaintiff registered their trade mark Cadbury Picnic as back as in 1977 in the name and style of Cadbury Picnic which was lapsed in 1984. Thereafter, again they applied for registration of the said trade mark Cadbury Picnic in the year August 1996. The said application is still awaiting its final decision.\n",
        "p_49": "(xii) Rectification application filed by the defendant against the plaintiff seeking rectification of their trade mark having label with a caricature of a boy and the word PIKNIK is still awaiting its final decision before the Hon'ble High Court of Bombay.\n",
        "p_50": "11. First contention of learned Senior Advocate Mr. Thakore is that the word PIKNIK which is an exact phonetic equivalent of a common dictionary word like picnic is unregisterable. The word PIKNIK is an exact phonetic equivalent of a common dictionary word and, therefore, cannot be considered as an invented word. Alternatively he has submitted that if the word PIKNIK is considered as an invented word, the plaintiff, on the basis of such invented word, cannot stop the defendant from using a common dictionary word like PICNIC, which is otherwise unregisterable and can be used by any person.\n",
        "p_51": "11.1. To bring home the aforesaid submissions, Mr. Thakore has placed reliance on the decision in the case of Electrix & Electrics, reported in 1959 RPC 283, wherein the House of Lords has held that a word not being an invented word, ought not to be put on the Register if the spelling is phonetic and resembles in sound a word which in its proper spelling could not be put on the Register. The question before the House of Lords was with respect to the similarity of words Electrix and Electrics.\n",
        "p_52": "11.2. Mr. Thakore has also placed reliance on the judgment of the Bombay High Court in the case of Mrs. Anneliese Huckmann v. Registrar of Trade Marks, AIR 1962 Bombay 88. In that case the Bombay High Court has held that the word 'Patentex\" is neither an invented word nor a coined word and as such it is not registerable. A word would not be invented which with some trifling addition or very trifling variation, still leaves the word one which is well known or in ordinary use. In that judgment, the Bombay High Court has held that there is so much resemblance between the word 'patentex' and the word \"patended\".\n",
        "p_53": "11.3. Relying upon the aforesaid two decisions, it was contended by Mr. Thakore that the word which is unregisterable is registered by the Registrar of Trade Marks which is a common dictionary word and hence cannot claim to be an invented word and on the basis of that word, action of infringement cannot lie against the use of the similar word either by a trader or manufacturer.\n",
        "p_54": "12. Learned advocate Mr. S.B. Vakil has contended that PIKNIK is an invented word and once the word is registered, the said contention is not open for the defendant against the action of infringement. He further contended that the registration of the plaintiff's mark has become conclusive in view of the expiration of seven years from the date of registration and should be considered as a valid one. He further contended that the said registration is not contrary to the provisions of Section 9 of the Act. He then contended that the aforesaid two decisions relied upon by learned advocate Mr. Thakore is of no avail or assistance to the defendant as both the decisions are irrelevant to the facts of the case. In both the aforesaid decisions, question of cancellation of registration of trade mark was before the House of Lords and the Bombay High Court, by way of appeal. Here that is not the question. This Court is not deciding the validity of the registration of Trade Mark PIKNIK registered in favour of the plaintiff. He further contended that so far as the instant case is concerned, the plaintiff has to establish the mark used by the defendant is deceptively similar to the plaintiff's mark or not. The plaintiff has used the mark PIKNIK while defendant has started using the mark PICNIC and both the marks are deceptively and phonetically similar. Therefore, the word PIKNIK is the essential feature of the mark.\n",
        "p_55": "12.1. In support of the aforesaid contention, Mr. Vakil has placed reliance on the decision of the Honourable Apex Court in the case of Corn Products v. Shangrila Food Products, AIR 1960 SC 142, wherein the Honourable Supreme Court has held that the question whether the two marks are likely to give rise to confusion or not is a question of first impression. It is for the court to decide that question. English cases proceeding on the English way of pronouncing an English word by English Men, which is not always the same, may not be of much assistance in our country in deciding questions of phonetic similarity. It is well recognized that in deciding a question of similarity between two marks, the marks have to be considered as a whole.\n",
        "p_56": "12.2. He then placed reliance on another decision of the Honourable Supreme Court in the case of Amritdhara Pharmacy v. Satya Deo Gupta, AIR 1962 SC 449. The Honourable Supreme Court in that case has held that to a man of average intelligence the overall structure and phonetic similarity of two names 'Amritdhara' and 'Lakshmandhara' was likely to deceive or cause confusion.\n",
        "p_57": "12.3. He also pressed into service the decision of the Honourable Apex Court in the case of K.R. Chinna Krishna Chettiar v. Sri Ambal and Co., AIR 1970 SC 146, wherein it was held that there was a striking similarity and affinity of sound between the words \"Ambal\" and \"Andal\" and it could cause real danger and confusion between the two marks.\n",
        "p_58": "12.4. Lastly Mr. Vakil relied upon the decision of this Court in the case of Rupa & Co. v. Dawn Mills Co. Ltd., AIR 1998 Gujarat 247. In that case, this Court had an occasion to deal with the meaning of 'deceptively similar' as defined in Section 2(d) of the Act which postulates that a mark shall be deemed to be deceptively similar to another mark if it so nearly resembles that other mark as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion.\n",
        "p_59": "13. From the aforesaid decision relied upon by learned advocate Mr. Vakil, there cannot be two opinion that the Act does not lay down any criteria for determining what is likely to deceive or cause confusion. Every case must depend upon its own peculiar facts and value of the validity lies in not actual decision in determining what is likely to deceive or cause confusion.\n",
        "p_60": "14. It is true that so far as the judgments relied upon by learned advocate Mr. Thakore are concerned, the legality and validity of the trade mark either by way of appeal or by way of petition was challenged on the ground that the trade mark claimed by the claimants was not an invented word whereas in the instant case the question is as to whether trade mark claimed by the plaintiff is an invented word or an ordinary word found in the dictionary which can be allowed to be used by the defendant as well.\n",
        "p_61": "15. It is equally true that the defendant had intended to use the trade mark PICNIC as back as in 1977 and has been using the said mark all over the world. When the defendant had applied for the trade mark PICNIC, the trade mark registry specifically observed that PICNIC is not adapted to distinguish and that cadbury will not be entitled to exclusive use of the word picnic per se.\n",
        "p_62": "16. Relying upon the aforesaid undisputed facts, learned advocate Mr.Thakore contended that the plaintiff also could not have obtained registration of the word mark 'PIKNIK' and hence sought only registration of label containing the word PIKNIK written in a particular script with a caricature of a little boy above it. It is this label which has been registered by the Registrar of Trade Marks and action of infringement would lie only if the defendant uses the said label. The defendant is not using the said label of the plaintiff but using the word PICNIC prefixing the word Cadbury. Therefore, there is no question of infringement qua the label of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_63": "17. Learned advocate Mr. Vakil has contended that the label mark is registered and, therefore, question of infringement does not arise is a misconceived submission. He further submitted that since the essential feature of the label mark is PIKNIK any part of that label used by defendant is violative of the trade mark registered by the plaintiff and, therefore, infringement action would lie against any person who uses any part of that label mark and since the defendant is using the word PICNIC though with different spelling phonetically both words are equivalent and, therefore, action of infringement would definitely lie against the defendant.\n",
        "p_64": "18. There cannot be two opinion with regard to the proposition of law that while comparing mark essential feature must be seen and so far as the plaintiff's trade mark is concerned, the word PIKNIK cannot be called essential feature. It is the script of a word along with a caricature of a little boy which is the essential feature of the trade mark and, therefore, the plaintiff cannot place reliance on the mere word PIKNIK and claim infringement. In the case of Corn Products (supra), which is relied upon by learned advocate Mr. Vakil, the Honourable Supreme Court has held that it is well recognized that in deciding a question of similarity between two marks, the marks have to be considered as a whole.\n",
        "p_65": "19. In the case of an exclusive trade mark, the same must consist of some arbitrary or fanciful term, figure, or device, and words or phrases, in order to constitute a trade mark, must be used in a purely arbitrary or fanciful when they do not by their usual and ordinary meaning, denote or describe products to which they are applied, but rather come to indicate their purposes by application and association. In other words, the principle or settled rule would be that either in the case of goods or business the plaintiff has to show that his mark has become so distinctive that the public regard the same as belonging to a particular source. The plaintiff has to further prove that the offending mark or name is likely or calculated to deceive and cause confusion among the public thereby injuring the plaintiff's business.The test in this regard necessarily would be of a normal prudent person as to whether the defendant is selling the goods so marked as by design or calculated the public to believe that they are the goods of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_66": "20. The plaintiff's trade mark is a label having script PIKNIK with caricature of a little boy above it and it is marketing the goods i.e., potato chips and potato wafers in a polythene pouch. The plaintiff has registered the trade mark under class 30 and chocolates are also included under the said class. Defendant is marketing Cadbury chocolates under the trade label Cadbury's PICNIC and marketing the same in polythene pouch. It is, therefore, clear that both the articles are different. It is also equally true that the defendant is not using their label, that is, having a caricature of a little boy. Therefore, there is absolutely no similarity in product, label and the pouch of plaintiff and defendant which is likely to deceive or cause confusion in the mind of common buyer. Therefore, no action of infringement of the plaintiff's Trade Mark is committed by the defendant.\n",
        "p_67": "21. Learned advocate Mr. Vakil has contended that identity of the goods has absolutely no relevance and in support of his submission he has placed reliance on various judgments to show that despite different products injunction was granted. Mr. Vakil has pressed into service judgment of the Allahabad High Court in the case of Bata India Limited v. M/s. Pyare Lal & Co., AIR 1985 Allahabad 242. In that case Bata Company has filed suit for permanent injunction against the company using mark 'Batafoam' because use of word 'Bata' in 'Batafoam' could cause deception in mind of ordinary customer and, therefore, injury to 'Bata' company also would be caused and, therefore, interim injunction was granted in favour of Bata company in that case.\n",
        "p_68": "21.1. Reliance was also placed upon the judgment of the Delhi High Court in the case of Daimler Benz Aktiegesellschaft and another v. Hybo Hindustan, reported in AIR 1994 Delhi 239. In that case it was held by the Delhi High Court that the trade mark namely three pointed star in circle/ring and word 'Benz' is associated with name of world famous car 'Mercedes Benz'. The defendant was using word 'Benz' and three pointed Human Being in a ring, on undergarments. In that case the Delhi High Court has held that it amounts to infringement even though the products are different.\n",
        "p_69": "22. The aforesaid submissions and the judgments relied upon by learned advocate Mr. Vakil have been seriously assailed by learned advocate Mr. Thakore. According to him, the judgments relied upon by learned advocate Mr. Vakil are clearly distinguishable on following three counts:\n",
        "p_70": "(i) Firstly the said judgments relied upon by Mr.Vakil are of very renowned mark and therefore anybody copying such mark even for a different product is likely to create an impression that the product has relation to such renowned mark or is being manufactured by the person owning such renowned mark. Bata, Mercedes, Kirloskar, Kodak, Cibaca are some of such renowned marks. He submitted that PIKNIK or S.M. Dyechem cannot be compared with Mercedes, Bata, etc.\n\n \n\n",
        "p_71": "(ii) Secondly the judgments relied upon by Mr. Vakil are in connection with either identical goods or closely connected goods or common field of activity.\n",
        "p_72": "(iii) Thirdly, in absence of renowned marks or common field of activity no injunction can be granted when the products are different. The judgments relied upon by Mr. Vakil have absolutely no relevance in the present case when the label of the plaintiff is not renowned. Therefore, according to Mr. Thakore, the judgments relied upon by Mr. Vakil have absolutely no relevance in the present case as the label of the plaintiff is not renowned.\n",
        "p_73": "23. On having perusal upon the judgment in the case of Bata India Limited (supra), it was observed by the High Court of Allahabad that the name of 'Bata' was registered under the Trade Marks Act, 1940 in respect of canvas, rubber, leather shoes, rubber footwear, rubber soles, rubber heels and leather soles, etc. It was well established that the word \"Bata\" was a word known all over the country and was in use even prior to 1940. The word \"Bata\" was a fancy name inasmuch as the word was not associated with any Indian name, place, object or term. 'Bata' was the surname of a foreigner of central Europe who started his business in India making shoes and rubber products. The word 'Bata' was associated with his name. The defendants named their product as 'Batafoam' the spelling of 'Bata' being the same as used by the plaintiff Company. Therefore, it was held that the plaintiff had made out a case for issuance of an interim order of injunction in respect of the user of the name \"Bata\" to any of their products by the defendants.\n",
        "p_74": "24. Now, having a look upon the judgment of the Delhi High Court in the case of Daimler Benz Aktiegesellschaft (supra) wherein the Delhi High Court has held that there are names and marks which have become household words. 'Benz' as name of a car would be known to every family that has ever used a quality car. The name 'Benz' as applied to a car, has a unique place in the world. There is hardly one who is conscious of existence of the cars/automobiles who would not recognize the name 'Benz' used in connection with cars.\n",
        "p_75": "25. There is much substance and force in the submission of Mr. Thakore that the judgments relied upon by Mr. Vakil are of company having renowned reputation and the mark if it is used by someone would definitely create an impression in the mind of the buyer that the particular article belongs to that company. So far as the instant case is concerned, S.M. Dyechem Limited has not acquired that much reputation in the country and it is using only the trade label PIKNIK, which is a misspelling of the dictionary word PICNIC.\n",
        "p_76": "26. Relying upon the judgment in the case of Rupa & Company (supra) it was submitted by Mr. Vakil that there is a phonetic similarity between PIKNIK and PICNIC and mere fact that plaintiff's registered mark is a label will make no difference and, therefore, the ratio laid down in the said judgment is applicable to the present case also. In view of the aforesaid judgment, action of infringement would definitely lie against the respondent. It is true that there is phonetic similarity. But the word PIKNIK is a misspelling of a common dictionary word PICNIC and hence does not entitle the plaintiff any proprietary right over the said trade mark. The said judgment relied upon by learned advocate Mr. Vakil is clearly distinguishable on following score:\n",
        "p_77": "(i) Firstly, in the said judgment, the registered trade mark was depicting the figure of sun at dawn with prominently displayed word 'dawn' and subsidiary word hosiery beneath and the word mark 'dawn hosiery' per se while there is no word mark registered in the instant case.\n",
        "p_78": "(ii) Secondly, the word 'dawn' has absolutely no reference to the character and quality of the goods which are under-garments while picnic/piknik has direct reference to the character and quality of the goods namely packed foods which can be taken for a picnic and hence an unregistered word over which nobody can have a proprietary right.\n",
        "p_79": "(iii) Thirdly, the user by Dawn Mills Company Limited is over 40 years with very good reputation in the manufacture of hosiery while in the instant case the user is for a very few years and the reputation is not of similar nature.\n",
        "p_80": "(iv) Fourthly, in the said case the products of the defendant and the plaintiff are identical. Both Dawn and Rupa were manufacturing hosiery. Therefore, there was very good chance of confusion and deception. In the instant case the two products are distinct and there is no scope of confusion and deception. On the aforesaid premise, the judgments relied upon by Mr. Vakil in the case of Rupa & Company (supra) would not apply to the facts of the present case and it is of no avail or assistance to the plaintiff's case to justify the action of infringement.\n",
        "p_81": "27. As already pointed out above and rementioned at the risk of repetition that one has firstly to see whether phonetically the words are similarly used and whether it could mislead a common person or not? The leading case on the subject available is the decision of the Honourable Supreme Court in the case of J.R. Kapoor v. Micronix India, 1994 Supp (3) SCC 215. In respect of certain electrical and electronic apparatus the trade marks used were Microtel and Micronix. In a suit filed under the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958, a similar question cropped up. The appellant before the Honourable Supreme Court was one of the partners of M/s. Micronix India. Another business was started under the name and style of M/s. Microtelmatrix with the trade name Microtel. The Honourable Supreme Court held that the word Micro was descriptive and otherwise it does not mislead the other person. The findings of the Supreme Court are as under:-\n",
        "p_82": " \".......Further, the word 'micro' being descriptive of the micro technology used for production of many electronic goods which daily come to the market, no one can claim monopoly over the use of the said word. Anyone producing any product with the use of micro-chip technology would be justified in using the said word as a prefix to his trade name. What is further, those who are familiar with the use of electronic goods know fully well and are not likely to be misguided or confused merely by the prefix 'micro' in the trade name. Once, therefore, it is held that the word 'micro' is a common or general name descriptive of the products which are sold or of the technology by which the products are manufactured, and the user of such products are, therefore, not likely to be misguided or confused by the said word, the only question which has to be prima facie decided at this stage is whether the words \"tel\" and \"nix\" in the trade names of the appellant and the respondent are deceptive for the buyers and users and are likely to misguide or confuse them in purchasing one for the other. According to us, phonetically the words being totally dissimilar are not going to create any such confusion in the mind of the user....\"\n",
        "p_83": "28. Similarly, reliance can also be placed on a decision of the Madras High Court in the case of Parle Products Limited v. Bakemans Industries Limited, 1998 Patent and Trademarks Cases, 662 (Madras) wherein similar question was called for determination. In that case the applicant was a registered proprietor of the trademark GLUCO. The respondent was selling biscuits under the mark GLUCO GOLD. Madras High Court considered this controversy and held that the packets were different and the products were also not similar. It is not likely to mislead an ordinary person. Merely because GLUCO word was common was not enough for the grant of ad interim relief.\n",
        "p_84": "28.1. Similar question arose before the High Court of Punjab & Haryana in the case of Punjab State Co-operative Supply and Marketing Federation Limited v. Sona Spices Private Limited, 1987 Patents and Trademarks Cases 294 (Punjab & Haryana). In that case Punjab & Haryana High Court has refused the injunction as claimed for as there was no similarity to deceive an ordinary customer in the words 'Sohna' and 'Sona Spices'.\n",
        "p_85": "28.2. Similar view was taken by the Madras High Court in the case of Indo-Pharma Pharmaceuticals Works Limited v. Citadel Fine Pharmaceuticals Limited, AIR 1998 Madras 347 = 1998 Patents and Trade Marks Cases 775. In that case the appellant had filed the suit for injunction restraining the respondents from infringing its registered trademark 'ENERJASE'. The other company was using the name of \"ENERJEX'. The Court held that no person can claim exclusive right of descriptive name. Similarly, Delhi High Court in the case of Rupee Gains Tele-Times Pvt. Ltd. v. Rupee Times, 1995 Patents and Trade Marks Cases, 384, held that the word \"Rupee\" is not distinctive word and it is connected with trade and business.\n",
        "p_86": "29. What is the position here? The plaintiff is having trade mark label containing the word PIKNIK written in a particular script with a caricature of a little boy above it. The plaintiff is manufacturing and marketing potato chips and potato wafers in a polythene pouch whereas defendant is not using similar label. The word the defendant is using is Cadbury's PICNIC and they are manufacturing and marketing chocolate. Therefore, both the products are different. Labels are different. Words are different. Only word used by the plaintiff is PIKNIK whereas the defendant uses the word PICNIC having phonetic similarity. But since both the words are of common dictionary word plaintiff cannot claim exclusive right over the said word.\n",
        "p_87": "30. Relying upon the aforesaid observations, if we examine the case then at the cost of repetition I may say that here the plaintiff's label mark is registered with the word PIKNIK and, therefore, PIKNIK cannot be separated from the label mark and on the basis of that word alone the plaintiff cannot claim action against the defendant which uses the common dictionary word PICNIC prefixed by the name of the company 'Cadbury'.\n",
        "p_88": "31. Learned advocate Mr. Thakore then contended that the defendant has moved an application for rectification of plaintiff's Trade Mark in the High Court of Bombay on various grounds and there are all fair chances for it to succeed in getting the rectification of the trade mark of the plaintiff and, therefore, since there are fair chances to succeed in that application, on that ground also injunction cannot be granted in favour of the plaintiff. In support of the aforesaid contention, he has placed reliance on the judgment of the Honourable Supreme Court in the case of Vishnudas Trading v. Vazir Sultan Tobacco Co. Ltd., (1997) 4 SCC 201 and contended that if the trader or manufacturer actually trading in or manufacturing only one or some of the articles or goods under a trade mark and has no bona fide intention to trade in or manufacture the other articles or goods falling under that class but has obtained registration of its trade mark under that class which covers several other articles or goods, the registration is liable to be rectified by confirming it to the specific articles or goods which are actually intended to be traded in or manufactured. He further contended that plaintiff is manufacturing and marketing only potato chips and potato wafers whereas they are not manufacturing and marketing chocolate though registration is obtained for that in that very class for the purpose of manufacturing chocolate as well. Therefore, the registration is liable to be rectified qua chocolate.\n",
        "p_89": "32. He has also pressed into service the judgment of the High Court of Delhi in the case of R.J. Reynods Tobacco Company v. I.T.C. Limited, 1987 PTC 57, wherein it was held that keeping in view the facts that the plaintiff company admittedly having not sold any cigarettes under the trade mark NOW before or even after the registration of the trade mark and the fact that the defendant company has applied for the rectification of the impugned trade mark from the Register and it being not disputed that the design, lettering, lay out, colour scheme and general get up of the packets in which the respondents are marketing its NOW brand cigarettes is entirely different, no serious case of passing off is made out and accordingly in view of the section 111 of the Act, the suit is stayed. As the plaintiff had never used the mark in India, prima facie case has been made out by the defendants for rectification of the register. As regards the question of balance of convenience, the plaintiff having never used the mark in India the question of injury to the reputation does not arise and accordingly the application for grant of injunction is dismissed with directions to maintain and file account in the Court. \n",
        "p_90": "33. Relying upon the aforesaid two judgments he further contended and reiterated that the defendant has a very good prima facie case for rectification of the trade mark of the plaintiff since the plaintiff is not manufacturing chocolate and on the basis of the same the plaintiff is not entitled to interim injunction for the action of infringement against the defendant.\n",
        "p_91": "34. Learned advocate Mr. Vakil has assailed the aforesaid submission by relying upon the pronouncement of the Honourable Supreme Court in the case of Tube Investments of India Limited v. Trade Industries, (1997) 6 SCC 35. In that case the Honourable Supreme Court has held that the mark used by the respondent prima facie is similar to the mark used by the appellant. The appellant's right in respect of its trade mark is violated and, therefore, interim relief restraining the defendant from using trade mark should be issued.\n",
        "p_92": "35. It is true that as per the say of the defendant, rectification petition has already been launched against the plaintiff company and the plaintiff is not manufacturing and marketing chocolate for which they have obtained registration under class 30. In the case of Vishnudas Trading (supra), the issue before the Honourable Supreme Court was of rectification of the trade mark on the ground that no evidence showing that the defendant intended or intending to manufacture any other product of tobacco and, therefore, rectification was granted by the Apex Court. So far as the rectification petition filed by the present defendant against the plaintiff is concerned, it is pending before the Bombay High Court and evidence is yet to be led and, therefore, whether plaintiff intended or intending to manufacture chocolate is a subject matter of leading evidence and without leading evidence it is very difficult to jump to any conclusion. Therefore, I do not deem it expedient to express any opinion about the rectification petition which is pending and on that score whether defendant can claim that plaintiff is not entitled to injunction against the defendant.\n",
        "p_93": "36. It was also submitted by learned advocate Mr. Thakore that the plaintiff is not entitled to any ad-interim or interim injunction on the principle of delay, latches and acquiescence. Relying upon the important events which I have adverted in the foregoing paragraphs in respect of undisputed aspects, he contended that since after expiry of ten months of the notice, suit was filed and meantime, during that ten months' period, that is from 7.4.1998 to 18.2.1999, the plaintiff took no action and allowed the defendant to market their product and establish a market with substantial sales to the tune of Rs.18 crores and incurred sales promotional expenditure by way of advertisement of Rs.6.75 crores approximately. It clearly tantamounts to delay, latches and acquiescence on the part of the plaintiff. In support of the aforesaid contention, learned advocate Mr. Thakore has placed reliance on the judgments of the Honourable Supreme Court in the case of -\n",

        "p_97": "36.1. Relying upon the aforesaid three decisions, it was contended by Mr. Thakore that no injunction should be granted to the plaintiff when the defendant has already been marketing its product since February 1998. According to him, granting of injunction would result in serious damage to the defendant as the defendant will perforce be required to adopt a new mark and again spend huge sum of money on advertisement and promotion of the product with such new mark while the plaintiff can be well compensated in the form of damages in the event the plaintiff succeeds.\n",
        "p_98": "37. In reply to the aforesaid submission, learned advocate Mr. Vakil has contended that delay is not fatal in infringement case as there is recurring cause of action. I do not deem it expedient to answer the aforesaid question canvassed by Mr. Thakore for the reason that I have already discussed in earlier paragraphs of this judgment that the word PIKNIK is not an invented word and, therefore, no infringement action would lie.\n",
        "p_99": "38. Now this takes me to the last question of passing off the goods of the defendant as and for that of the plaintiff. It is well settled proposition of law that the action for passing off is a Common Law remedy being in substance an action for deceit, that is, a passing off by a person of his own goods as those of another. But that is not the gist of an action for infringement. The action for infringement is a statutory remedy conferred on the registered proprietor of a registered trade mark for the vindication of 'the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods'. The use by the defendant of the trade mark of the plaintiff is not essential in an action for passing off, but is the sine qua non in the case of an action for infringement. No doubt, where the evidence in respect of passing off consists merely of the colourable use of a registered trade mark, the essential features of both the actions might coincide in the sense that what would be a colourable initiation of a trade mark in a passing off action would also be such in an action for infringement of the same trade mark. But there the correspondence between the two ceases. In an action for infringement, the plaintiff must, no doubt, make out that the use of the defendant's mark is likely to deceive, but where the similarity between thee plaintiff's and the defendant's mark is so close either visually, phonetically or otherwise and the Court reaches the conclusion that there is an imitation, no further evidence is required to establish that the plaintiff's rights are violated. Expressed in another way, if the essential features of the trade mark of the plaintiff have been adopted by the defendant, the fact that the get up, packing and other writing or marks on the goods or on the packets in which he offers his goods for sale show marked differences, or indicate clearly a trade original different from that of the registered proprietor of the mark would be immaterial, whereas in the case of passing off, the defendant may escape liability if he can show that the added matter is sufficient to distinguish his goods from those of the plaintiff (see Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma v. Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories, AIR 1965 SC 980.\n",
        "p_100": "39. Keeping in forefront the aforesaid principle if we examine the case on hand then there cannot be any two opinion about the trans-border reputation not only in the word mark per se 'Cadbury' but also in the mark 'Cadbury picnic'. Cadbury is a household name in India and has been marketing chocolate since 1948. The word cadbury is synonymous with the word chocolate in India and on all of its products cadbury uses the same lettering on the top along with the name of the products like 'Cadbury Dairy milk', 'Cadbury Five Star' and 'Cadbury Picnic'. Cadbury products are bought not on the basis of the name given to the product but because of the reputation of Cadbury. In these circumstances, there is absolutely no scope of any deception or confusion or passing off. The products of the defendant and the plaintiff are distinct and there is also no scope of passing off because the defendant's products are bought because of the defendant's reputation as cadbury. In the instant case, even the labels of the defendant and the plaintiff are different and distinctive and there is no scope of confusion and deception in the mind of an average buyer. In view of the aforesaid discussion, there is no scope of passing off the defendant's goods as and for that of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_101": "40. In view of the discussion made in the foregoing paragraphs, following aspects are high-lighted:\n",
        "p_102": "(i) Plaintiff's trade mark having a label containing the word 'PIKNIK' written in a particular script and manner with a caricature of a little boy above it though registered having a phonetic similarity to the word found in dictionary word picnic.\n",
        "p_103": "(ii) The word PIKNIK on that label is neither invented nor a distinctive word and it is also not an essential feature of the plaintiff's trade mark which is a label. Therefore, no action for infringement against the defendant can lie.\n",
        "p_104": "(iii) Since registration which is granted to the plaintiff is a label mark such registration does not prevent any one from using the dictionary word Picnic with respect to its goods and therefore also no action of infringement would take place.\n",
        "p_105": "(iv) The articles manufactured and marketed by both the plaintiff and defendant are different and therefore also no action of infringement would arise.\n",
        "p_106": "(v) So far as passing off is concerned, both the products are different, labels are different and, therefore, no scope of confusion or deception in the mind of common buyer. Therefore, there is no scope of passing off the goods of the defendant as and for that of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_107": "(vi) Since there is no infringement, there is no prima facie case.\n",
        "p_108": "(vii) In view of the new formula elucidated in the case of American Cyanamid (supra) balance of convenience is tilted in favour of the defendant. If it appears that the damages awarded at the trial will adequately compensate the plaintiff and the defendant is likely to be able to pay, then, interlocutory relief should not normally be granted. Applying this principle to the present case it appears to me that to grant an injunction will be to cut off for good the road to commercial success of a business competitor. In the event of the plaintiff's success damages will be an adequate remedy. The defendant's financial position to pay damages has not been questioned before me and they are prepared to give an undertaking. Therefore, the balance of convenience lies in favour of refusing the interlocutory relief that is sought.\n",
        "p_109": "41. Since I am of the opinion in view of the discussion made hereinabove, that there is no infringement action of the trade mark of the plaintiff and no question of passing off the goods of the defendant as and for that of the plaintiff and on the facts and in the circumstances of the case no other conclusion can be arrived at except the one reached by me, plaintiff is not entitled to discretionary remedy of injunction. Seen in the above context, the conclusion arrived at by the learned trial Judge is erroneous which is required to be quashed and set aside by refusing injunction as prayed for by the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_110": "42. It will be undesirable to comment more fully on the merits of the application. In an Appeal from Order against an order recorded in notice of motion on the whole, the less said about the merits of the case is better. It is however, made clear that the findings arrived at by me about the action of infringement and passing off are of tentative nature and will be subject to findings that may be arrived at by the learned trial Judge in the suit after the evidence is led. Therefore, it is desirable that the defendant is directed to keep the accounts of all the sales it makes of the impugned products and it shall submit the same every six months in the lower Court and it will also give an undertaking before the lower Court that it will pay damages to the plaintiff if the plaintiff succeeds ultimately.\n",
        "p_111": "43. In the net result, the appeal succeeds and accordingly it is allowed, however, with no order as to costs. Resultantly, the order recorded by the learned trial Judge below notice of motion granting injunction in favour of the plaintiff is quashed and set aside by dismissing the notice of motion application and thereby refused to grant injunction as prayed for and hence there shall be no injunction against the defendant.\n",
        "p_112": "43.1. So far as Civil Application No. 4743 of 1999 which has been filed by plaintiff for relief of restraining the defendant from publishing as well as causing to publish any advertisement in any manner by making use of the impugned trademark PICNIC is concerned, it is rejected. Notice is discharged.\n",
        "p_113": "43.2. Civil Application No. 7428 of 1999 taken out by defendant for producing evidence listed at Annexure A does not survive and hence it is disposed of.\n",

        "p_1": "JUDGMENT\n \n\n D.K. Deshmukh, J. \n",
        "p_2": " 1. This is a Notice of Motion taken out by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff has filed this suit claiming therein that it is a Company incorporated under the Companies Act and that it carries on business of the manufacture and sale of wide range of Industrial and Agro Chemical products and in export market. The Plaintiff claims that it is leading and well-known manufacturer and dealer in wide range of Industrial and Agro Chemical products and are carrying on business for the last nearly 4 decades throughout the country and in export markets. It claims that it is manufacturing and marketing their products under the distinctive trade-mark. It claims that it has 90 products. It claims that the annual sale turnover of all the products of the Plaintiff during the last ten year ranges between Rs. 1.45 crores and Rs. 2.58 crores respectively. It is claiming that one of the Industrial Chemical Products of the Plaintiff; is manufactured and marketed by them under the trade mark RODINE. The product of the Plaintiff bearing the trade mark RODINE is used in the form of Acid Inhibitor for Pickling and for Industrial cleaning. It is claimed that the Plaintiff has manufactured the product RODINE under strict international standard of quality and is marketing the said products continuously, extensively and uninterruptedly throughout the country and in certain export markets for the last nearly four decades. It is further claimed that the trade mark RODINE has come to be exclusively identified and associated by members of trade and consumers with the Plaintiff and no one else. The Plaintiff has annexed to the plaint a statement giving annual sales turnover of all the products and product bearing the trade mark RODINE for the period from December, 1960 to March, 1998, in the affidavit filed in support of the Notice of Motion, in paragraph (7) it is claimed that the Plaintiff has been manufacturing and marketing the product bearing the trade mark RODINE on extensive scale in India and export markets since 1959. The Plaintiff further claims that on 8th April, 1994, the Plaintiff made an application for registration of the trade mark RODINE in their\n\nname in Class-I under No. 626174 in respect of chemical product used in Industries under the 4th Schedule to the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. The Plaintiff further claims that they are also proprietor of the trade mark ROTODINE. The trade mark ROTODINE has been registered in India under No. 378342 dated 13th July, 1981 in Class 1 of the Fourth Schedule to the Trade and Merchandise Marks Rules, 1959. The Plaintiff claims that in or about January, 1998, it came to the knowledge of the Plaintiff that the Defendant No. 1 was selling an identical product as that of the Plaintiffs product RODINE under the trade mark RODINE-58. Therefore, the Plaintiff issued a notice dated 12th January, 1998 to the Defendant No. 1 pointing that use of the trademark RODINE by the Defendant No. 1 amounts to passing off and calling upon the Defendant No. 1 to discontinue the use of the trade mark RODINE. As the Defendant No. 1 did not comply with the Notice, the Plaintiff filed this suit claiming that the plaintiff being the much prior user and the prior applicant for registration of the trade mark RODINE and the prior registered proprietor of the trade mark of the ROTODINE and the Defendant No. 1's trade mark being deceptively identical, phonetically, visually and structurally similar to the Plaintiffs trade mark RODINE and the registered trade mark ROTODINE, the Plaintiff has a right to prevent the Defendants from manufacturing the selling its industrial chemical products under the identical trade mark RODINE. The action of the Plaintiff, therefore, in so far as the trade mark RODINE is concerned, is for passing off and in relation to their trade mark ROTODINE, it is for infringement of their registered trade mark. In substance, therefore, the case disclosed by the Plaintiff in the plaint is that they are using the trade mark RODINE right from the year 1959. In 1994, they have applied for registration of that trade mark and, therefore, they have acquired a common law rights to prevent the Defendants from passing of its products by using the trade mark RODINE as that of the Plaintiff. It is further the case of the Plaintiff that the trade mark of the Defendant RODINE-58 is deceptively similar to the registered trade mark of the Plaintiff namely ROTODINE and, therefore, the Defendants have infringed the registered trade mark of the Plaintiff and, therefore, on both these counts the Plaintiffs are entitled to a perpetual injunction against the Defendants preventing them from selling their product under the trade mark RODINE. \n",
        "p_3": " 2. The Plaintiffs by this Notice of Motion claim temporary injunction in the same terms in which a perpetual injunction is claimed in the plaint. \n",
        "p_4": " 3. The Defendants filed their first affidavit in the Notice of Motion, which is dated 29th June, 1999. The Defendants disputed the claim of the Plaintiffs that it is using the trade mark Rodine exclusively in proprietary rights since 1959. The Defendants contend that a U.S. based Company having world wide presence by name Amchem Products Incorporated was the inventor and the proprietor of the know-how\n\nand the trade name of the product since more than four decades. The said company was the proprietor in India of the registered Trademark Rodine No. 117735 (Rodine) since 5th January, 1946. It is further claimed that the said company had invested in the Plaintiff and had permitted the Plaintiff in or about 1963 to use its know-how and trade mark of the product in question and for that purpose, the company had on 15th May, 1963 formally assigned its trade mark with a right to obtain reassignment to the Plaintiff. It is claimed that the Plaintiff by an agreement dated 16th August, 1973 had reassigned the trade mark to the said Company and by an agreement of the same date namely 16th August, 1973 the said Company granted the Plaintiff permissive right to use the trade mark RODINE alongwith other trade mark. It is further claimed that in or about 1980 World-wide operation of the said US company Amchem including the said product and other were acquired and taken over by Henkel product and since then, Henkel is the proprietor of know-how and the trade mark of the said product. It is claimed that on or about 26th December, 1988, the formal merger took place of Amchem Product and Parker Chemical Company into Henkel Corporation. It is further claimed that Henkel has formed a joint venture company in India with the Defendant and has granted to the Defendant No. 1 with Reserve Bank of India permission, rights to use the know-how and trade name of the product in question by an agreement. It is claimed that the Defendant No. 2 is thus exclusively entitled to the use of the know-how and trade name of the said product under licence from the owner and proprietor. According to the Defendants, it is the Plaintiffs/Company, which are pirating and are in default and are liable to be dealt with in accordance with law. The Defendants alongwith their affidavit have filed a copy of an agreement dated 15th May, 1963, which shows that number of trade mark including the trade mark Rodine were assigned by the Amchem Corporation to the Plaintiff. The Defendants have also filed with their affidavit-in-reply a copy of an agreement dated 16th August, 1973, by which several trade marks including the trade mark Rodine were reassigned by the Plaintiffs to Amchem Corporation. After this affidavit in reply was filed, on behalf of the Plaintiff rejoinder was filed, which is dated 6th August, 1999. In rejoinder, the plaintiffs admitted the fact of assignment of trade mark by Amchem to the Plaintiffs in the year 1963 and reassignment of the trade mark by the Plaintiff to the said Amchem Corporation. It was claimed, however, that the assignment deed has not been recorded with the Trade Mark Registrar. It is also claimed that the Plaintiff/company is the owner of the trade mark Rodine, which is being used by it for the last 40 years, without any obstruction and it's application for registration of that trade mark is also pending. One more affidavit-in-rejoinder came to be filed by the Plaintiff dated 30th August, 1999. In that affidavit, it is claimed on behalf of the Plaintiff that the said Amchem Corporation as also its successors are not the owner of the impugned mark Rodine in India since they have not used the said trade mark and also in\n\nview of the fact that the registration of the said trade mark has not been renewed by them from the year 1977. The Plaintiffs have reiterated that the Plaintiffs have been using the trade mark Rodine since the year 1959 continuously. The Plaintiffs have filed one more affidavit dated 14th August 2000 reiterating their claim that the Plaintiffs have been using the trade mark Rodine from 1959. It is stated in that affidavit that \"Even after 1973 royalty statement continued to be sent to Amchem by the Plaintiff and Amchem was well aware of the use of the trade mark Rodine by the Plaintiff even beyond 1978 i.e. even after royalty payments ceased.\" The Plaintiffs claim that reassignment of the trade mark by the Plaintiffs to the said Amchem Corporation was merely a formality. In this affidavit, it is claimed that Amchem abandoned the trade mark by its conscientious and deliberate act of non-renewal of the Trade mark Rodine in 1977 when it became due. The Defendants have claimed in their reply that the Plaintiff is guilty of suppressing relevant and material facts from the Court and, therefore, it is not entitled to any temporary injunction, grant of which is in the discretion of the court. According to the Defendants, Henkal, which is a successor of Amchem Corporation is a necessary party to the suit and as Henkel Corporation has not been joined as a Defendants in this suit, the suit is bad for non-joinder of necessary party and, therefore, for these reasons also the Plaintiff is not entitled to temporary injunction, which it is seeking by this Notice of Motion. \n",
        "p_5": " 4. Apart from the documents, which are annexed to the plaint as also the documents, which have been filed alongwith the affidavits at the hearing of the Motion, a copy of an agreement dated 16th August, 1973 between the Plaintiff and the said Amchem Corporation has been placed on record. By that agreement, the Amchem Corporation permitted the Plaintiff to use their trademark in India. According to this agreement, the agreement was to be in force for initial period of 5 years from the date of agreement and was to continue thereafter subject to 12 months notice in writing from the either party to the agreement. The Plaintiff by that agreement agreed that they will use the trade marks which are subject-matter of this agreement clearly indicating that Amchem Corporation is the proprietor of the trade mark and that the Plaintiff is using it by way of a licence. The agreement of assignment in the year 1963 shows that the trade mark Rodine was registered in favour of Amchem Corporation on 5th January, 1946. It was stated at the hearing that as per the law then in force, the registration of the trade mark continued for a period of 15 years. Thus, the registration of the trade mark on 5th January, 1946 as per the law then in force would continue till 1961. On behalf of the Defendants, a copy of trade mark journal dated 1st April, 1947 has been producted, which shows that the trade mark Rodine bearing No. 117735 was registered in favour of the Amchem Corporation. On behalf of the Defendants, a copy of trade mark journal dated 1st April, 1975 has been produced, which shows that the trade mark was renewed in the year 1975. It was, thus claimed\n\non behalf of the Defendants that registration of the trade mark Rodine in favour of Amchem Corporation was current till January, 1982. This position was not disputed by the Plaintiffs. \n",
        "p_6": " 5. The learned Counsel appearing for the Plaintiffs submits that this Defendants are passing of their business and goods, as that of the Plaintiffs by using the trade mark Rodine. The learned Counsel submits that in a passing off action the Plaintiffs are required to establish three things. \n",
        "p_7": " According to the Plaintiffs, these three ingredients have to be established by the Plaintiffs in order to entitled them to an injunction against the Defendants on the material date and historical reference to the origin are immaterial. According to the Plaintiff, the material date is February, 1998, the time when the Plaintiff found that the Defendants are passing of their goods as that of the Plaintiff. According to the learned Counsel, who so ever might have been the registered owner of the trade mark previously, in the year 1998, the Plaintiff had become the proprietor of the trade mark by long user thereof and, therefore, the Plaintiff has established that it has goodwill in the business. In support of this contention, the learned Counsel relied on a judgment of the Court of appeal in the case of Scan Decor Development AB v. Scan Decor Marketing AB and Anr., 1999 (FSR) 26. The learned Counsel mainly relied on the following observations from the judgment: \n",
        "p_8": "  \"Although the Judge carefully traced the history of the relationship of the parties and their trading activities in different territories and in different products, he focused mainly on entitlement to the goodwill at the time of the proceedings. As a general rule, the goodwill which it is sought to protect must exit at the date of proceedings. That is therefore the correct date on which to concentrate.\" \n",
        "p_9": " 6. The learned Counsel further submits that the Plaintiff has used the trade mark as registered proprietor from 1963 till 1973. He submits that even on reassignment of the trade mark on 16th August, 1973, the goodwill in the business continued to remain with the Plaintiff. The learned counsel submits that subsequent to 16th August, 1973 the Plaintiff used the trade mark in their own right, independently and without any control of the Defendants. Hence, he submits that goodwill for the period from (1973 to 1978 also accrued to the Plaintiffs. The learned Counsel contended that in 1978 the said Amchem Corporation abandoned their business in India and severed their connection with the Plaintiff. According to the learned Counsel,\n\nafter the Amchem Corporation abandoned their business in India, the Plaintiff continued to use the trade mark Rodine and, therefore, because of the continued user of the trade mark by the Plaintiff from 1978 onwards, the Plaintiff acquired common law rights to prevent anybody else from using that trade mark. The learned counsel submits that the property in a trade mark is a transitory and not permanent and, therefore once that trade mark was abandoned in India by Amchem Corporation and the Plaintiff picked it up and continued using it the Plaintiff by long user became the proprietor of that trade mark. In support of this proposition, the learned Counsel relies on a judgment of the Privy Council in the case of Star Industrial Company Limited v. Yap Kwee Kor (trading as New Star Industrial Company), 1976 FSR 256 and especially on following observations from that judgment :- \n",
        "p_10": "  \"A passing-off action is a remedy for the invasion of a right of property not in the mark, name or get-up improperly used, but in the business or goodwill likely to be injured by the misrepresentation made by passing-off one person's goods as the goods of another. Goodwill, as the subject of proprietary rights, is incapable of subsisting by itself. It has no independent existence apart from the business to which it is attached. It is local in character and divisible ; if the business is carried on in several countries a separate goodwill attaches to it in each. So when the business is abandoned in one country in which it has acquired a goodwill the goodwill in that country perishes with it although the business may continue to be carried on in other countries.\" \n",
        "p_11": " The learned Counsel also relies on a judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of S.C. Cambatta and Co. Pvt. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Excess Profits Tax, Bombay,  to point out what amounts to the goodwill. The learned Counsel also relies on a judgment of the Delhi High Court in the case of The Indian Association of Thermometry and Ors. v. Hicks Thermometers (India) Ltd. and Anr., 1981 (PTC) 121. He relies especially on the following observations from that judgment :- \n",
        "p_12": "  \"At this stage, it is only the validity of his claim, which is to be considered. The respondents were in fact within the trade mark, first as a registered users and, thereafter, without registration. After 4.2.1972 the foreign proprietors abandoned the trade mark. They did not renew the registration although the respondents informed them about it. They also did not raise any objection to the respondent's filing an application for the registration of the trade mark in its own name, although an express notice was sent by the respondents. This is sufficient evidence of abandonment. The respondents were first person to pick up this abandoned trade mark. They had reasons to do it.\"\n",
        "p_13": " The learned Counsel also relies on a judgment of the Madras High Court in the case of Lavergne and Anr. v. Hooper, ILR VIII Madras 149. In nut shell, the submission of the learned Counsel is that in 1978, Amchem Corporation abandoned their trade mark, in as much as they did not renew it. The Plaintiff continued its business in that trade mark without any objection from the Amchem Corporation, with the result in 1994 the Plaintiff applied for registration of its own trade mark Rodine and by 1998 the Plaintiff had established its goodwill and its proprietary rights in the trade mark Rodine and, therefore, the Plaintiff had acquired a common law right to prevent the Defendants from passing off its goods under that trade mark. \n",
        "p_14": " 7. The learned Counsel further submits that they are registered owner of trade mark Rotodine. The trade mark Rodine being used by the Defendants is deceptively similar to the registered trade mark of the Plaintiff and, therefore, the Plaintiff is entitled to an injunction restraining the Defendants from infringing the trade mark of the Plaintiff namely Rotodine. The learned counsel submits, relying on the judgment of the Single Judge of this Court in the case of Biochem Pharmaceutical Industries v. Bioche Synergy Limited, 1998 PTC (18), that a registered proprietor is also entitled to an injunction to enforce his right as a registered owner of the trade mark and that at interlocutory stage the Court will not go into the conduct of the registered owner in getting his trade mark registered. \n",
        "p_15": " 8. On behalf of the Defendants, the learned Counsel for the Defendants, submits that the Plaintiff is guilty of suppressing the relevant and material facts from this Court. It is submitted that so far as the claim of the Plaintiff in relation to passing off is concerned, in a suit for passing off the Plaintiff has to establish the Plaintiffs own reputation, the Plaintiff is first required to establish its ownership of the trade mark and thereafter reputation of it mark. The ownership of a mark can be acquired either by independently adopting the mark and using the same or by adopting a mark and by applying for registration of the same with intention to use it. In support of this proposition, the learned counsel relies on a judgment of this Court in the case of Consolidated Foods Corporation v. Brandon and Co. Pvt. Ltd., . Thus, in order to succeed in a passing-off action, according to the learned Counsel, the Plaintiff has to first plead as to how he acquired the trade mark. In support of this proposition, the learned Counsel relies on a judgment of this Court in the case of Abdul Cadur Allibhoy v. Mahomedally Hyderally, 3 Bombay Law Reporter 220. The learned Counsel further submits that in so far as averments in the plaint and the affidavit filed in support of the motion are concerned, the Plaintiff has pleaded that it started using the trade mark in 1959 and it has acquired proprietary rights in the said trade mark by using it from 1959. The learned Counsel submits that thus the Plaintiff made the claim of using the trade mark since 1959 exclusively, however, while making that claim the Plaintiff omitted to state and disclose a fact, which was within their\n\nknowledge that the said trade mark was registered in favour of Amchem Corporation  in the year 1946. That in the year 1963, Amchem Corporation assigned that trade mark to the Plaintiff, that in the year 1973 that trade mark was reassigned by the Plaintiff to Amchem Corporation and that in the same year 1973 the Plaintiff entered into the user agreement with the said Amchem Corporation. The learned Counsel thus submits that the Plaintiff suppressed from the Court these facts, which were relevant to their claim of claiming ownership and proprietary rights in the trade mark Rodine from the year 1959. The learned Counsel, therefore, submits that thus the Plaintiff is guilty of suppression of material facts, which were within the knowledge of the Plaintiff. The learned Counsel relying on the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu v. Jagannath, , submits that as the Plaintiff had suppressed these material and relevant facts from this Court, the Plaintiff is not entitled to any relief at the hands of this Court. In any case, the Plaintiff is not entitled to grant of temporary injunction, grant of which is in the discretion of the Court. The learned Counsel also relies on the observations of the Supreme Court it is judgment in the case of Gujrat Bottling Co. Ltd. and Ors. v. Coca Cola Company and Ors., . The learned Counsel submits that in the affidavit, the Plaintiff has modified its case and now the Plaintiff is claiming that it acquired the trade mark after it was abandoned by the Amchem Corporation. According to the learned Counsel an inference of abandonment of the trade mark by the Amchem Corporation is drawn by the Plaintiff, because according to the Plaintiff the said Amchem Corporation did not take any steps for renewal of its trade mark Rodine in the year 1978. The learned Counsel submits that the statement that the trade mark Rodine was due for renewal in the year 1978 is factually wrong. It was within the knowledge of the Plaintiff that the registration of the trade mark Rodine in favour of the said Amchem Corporation was current till the year 1982, because the Plaintiff had entered into the user agreement in the year 1973 and it was using the trade mark from 1973 pursuant to the licence granted by Amchem Corporation. Therefore, the Plaintiff has made deliberate mis-statement of the fact. The learned Counsel submits that in the affidavits, the Plaintiff has drawn inference of abandonment of the trade mark by Amchem Corporation, because of their not taking any steps in the year 1978 for renewal of the trade mark and as now it is established on record that renewal of that trade mark was not due in 1978, as the trade mark continued to be registered till 1982, there is no material on record placed by the Plaintiffs to draw any inference about the abandonment of the trade mark by Amchem Corporation. The learned Counsel submits that, in any case now if the basis of the claim made by the Plaintiff is alleged abandonment of the trade mark by Amchem Corporation, a finding of abandonment of the trade mark by Amchem Corporation in the year 1977 cannot be recorded by this Court in the absence of the Plaintiffs joining the said\n\nAmchem Corporation or its successor as a Defendant in the suit. The learned Counsel submits that thus the successor of Amchem Corporation is a necessary party to the suit. The learned counsel submits that the Defendants have also disclosed in their first affidavit itself that they are not using the trade mark in their own right, but they are using the trade mark as licensee of the successor of the Amchem Corporation. Despite disclosure of this fact the Plaintiff has very promptly refused to join the successor of Amchem Corporation as a Defendant in this suit. According to the learned Counsel, therefore, as the suit is bad for non-joinder of necessary party, the Plaintiff is not entitled to any relief at the hands of this Court. \n",
        "p_16": " In so far as the aspect of suppression of material facts by the Plaintiff is concerned, the learned Counsel appearing for the Plaintiff submits that registration of the trade mark in favour of Amchem Corporation in the year 1946, its assignment by the Amchem Corporation in favour of the Plaintiff in 1963, reassignment of the trade mark by the Plaintiff to Amchem Corporation in the year 1973 and the user agreement entered into between the Plaintiff and Amchem Corporation in the year 1973 are not relevant and material facts. The Plaintiffs case of passing off is based on the rights that it has acquired by the year 1998, when the Defendants started using the trade mark. Therefore, the only relevant facts to be considered in this suit are whether the Plaintiff has been using the trade mark in his own right for a considerable long period before 1998. Historical origin of the trade mark and the transaction entered into by the parties previously in relation to that trade mark are not relevant. The learned Counsel also submits that the successors of Amchem Corporation are also not a necessary party to this suit. In support of that submission the learned Counsel relies on a judgment of the Rajasthan High Court in the case of Shankerlal and Anr. v. Jethmal and Anr., , a judgment of the Allahabad High Court in the case of Maqsood Ali v. Zahid Ali Sabzposh, , as also a judgment of Allahabad High Court in the case of Mt. Zabaishi Begam v. Naziruddin Khan . \n",
        "p_17": " 9. The learned Counsel for the Defendants submits that mere non-renewal of the trade mark does not amount to abandonment and that there has to be material placed, which will indicate definite intention to abandon the use of the trade mark in the trade mark Rodine. He relies on a judgment of the Chancery Division in the case of Mouson & Co. v. Boehm. \n",
        "p_18": " The learned counsel submits that exclusive use by the Plaintiff of the trade mark Rodine from 1959 is incapable of being accepted, as it was since 1946 a registered trade mark of the Amchem Corporation. The Plaintiffs claim of proprietorship in the trade mark will depend on the Plaintiff establishing abandonment of the trade mark by the Amchem Corporation. Acquisition of the title in the trade mark by the Plaintiff depends on the divestment of the title by Amchem Corporation. Therefore, for\n\nholding in favour of the Plaintiff, this Court will have to record a finding that Amchem Corporation abandoned the mark, that it ceased to be the owner of the trade mark, that the licence granted by Amchem Corporation in favour of the Plaintiff came to an end. According to the learned counsel, finding on these questions which are necessary to be recorded for accepting the case of the Plaintiff cannot be recorded in the absence of Amchem Corporation or its successor as a Defendant. \n",
        "p_19": " 10. The learned Counsel further submits that in so far as the case of the Plaintiff that he is entitled to an injunction as registered owner of the trade mark Rotodine is concerned, according to the learned Counsel, the conduct of the Plaintiff disentitles him to injunction. The learned Counsel submits that it is now established on record that the Plaintiff had entered into user agreement with Amchem Corporation on 16.8.1973. According to clause (8) of that agreement, the Plaintiff was under a duty to bring to the notice of the Amchem Corporation all the cases of passing off and infringement of the said trade mark. It was further provided in the agreement that in case any proceedings are required to be instituted by Amchem Corporation in relation to infringement or passing off of their trade mark, the costs of the proceedings are to be born by the Plaintiff. The learned counsel submits that thus under that agreement it was the duty of the Plaintiff to bring to the notice of Amchem Corporation, if anybody infringes their trade mark. Despite, this duty being imposed on the Plaintiff by the agreement entered into by the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff while the registration of Amchem Corporation of their trade mark was current till 1982 made an application in the year 1981 for registration of his own trade mark Rotodine, which according to the Plaintiff himself is deceptively similar to the trade mark Rodine. The learned counsel submits that the conduct of the Plaintiff of making an application for registration of his trade mark Rotodine was in breach of his contractual duty to Amchem Corporation. The learned Counsel further submits that even if it is assumed that for the purpose of this suit, despite his conduct, the Plaintiff has to be considered as a registered proprietor of the Trade mark Rotodine, in view of the fact that the Plaintiff is using the trade mark as a licensee of Henkel Corporation, which is a successor of Amchem Corporation, which was using the trade mark since prior to the date of the registration of the trade mark Rotodine in favour of the Plaintiff in terms of the provisions of Section 33 of the Trade Marks Act the Plaintiff is not entitled to injunction, which he is claiming. The learned Counsel, in support of this submission, relies on a judgment of this Court in the case of Indo-Pharmaceutical Works Pvt. Ltd. v. Pharmaceutical Company of India, 1977 (Vol. LXXX) B.L.R. 73. \n",
        "p_20": " 11. The learned Counsel appearing for the Plaintiff, on the other hand, submits that Section 33 of the Act would not prevent this Court from granting injunction for infringement of the registered trade mark Rotodine on the basis of prior user of the trade mark by the Defendants. According to the learned Counsel, Section 33 has to\n\nbe read with Section 12(3) of the Act. In the submission of the learned Counsel, Section 33 operates only in favour of those persons, who are entitled to concurrent registration in terms of the provisions of Section 12(3) of the Trade Marks Act. \n",
        "p_21": " 12. Now, the Plaintiff has instituted this suit under Section 105 of the Act. Section 105 of the Trade Mark Act lays down that a suit can be instituted in a Court, which is not inferior to the District Court, by the Plaintiff, who alleges that his registered trade mark has been infringed or the Defendant is passing of his goods under the trade mark which is identical with or deceptively similar to the Plaintiffs trade mark, whether registered or unregistered. In the plaint, the Plaintiff claims that he is the proprietor of the trade mark Rodine, which is not registered trade mark, though he has applied for registration of the same and that the Defendants are marketing their products under a trade mark which is identical with or deceptively similar to the unregistered trade mark of the Plaintiff namely Rodine. In short, according to the Plaintiff, the Defendants are passing off their goods as that of the Plaintiffs under the Trade mark Rodine. It is further the case of the Plaintiff that the Defendants have infringed their registered trade mark Rotodine by marketing their goods under the trade mark Rodine-58. According to the Plaintiff, trade mark Rodine is deceptively similar to the registered trade mark of the Plaintiff Rotodine. \n",
        "p_22": " 13. In order to entitle the Plaintiff to temporary injunction in terms in which it is sought in this Notice of Motion, the Plaintiff will have to establish, prima facie, that they have proprietary right in the trade mark Rodine. A person can acquire proprietary right in a trade mark by establishing that the mark was originated by him or that he has acquired it . In so far as the present case is concerned, the Plaintiff does not claim that he originated the trade mark. According to the averments in the plaint and the affidavit filed in support of the motion, the Plaintiff claims that it is manufacturing and marketing their product under the trade mark Rodine since 1959. Thus, the Plaintiff claims that they adopted trade mark Rodine in the year 1959 and thereby they acquired proprietary rights in that trade mark. Now an inquiry has to be made to find out as to whether the Plaintiff has established this case of acquisition of proprietary rights in the trade mark by user since 1959. It is now revealed on record that the trade mark Rodine was registered in favour of Amchem Corporation in January, 1946. I have already observed above that it is common ground before me that according to law then in force, the registration granted in 1946 was for a period of 15 years and obviously, therefore, the registration in favour Amchem Corporation of the trade mark Rodine was current and in force in 1959. Section 28 of the Act gives exclusive right to the registered proprietor of the trade mark to use the trade mark in relation to the goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered. Therefore, even if it is assumed that the Plaintiff started using the trade mark Rodine in the year 1959, the use of the trade mark Rodine by the Plaintiffs in the year 1959 was\n\ncontrary to law and, therefore, it will not confer any rights on the Plaintiffs. The trade mark was assigned to the Plaintiff in the year 1963 by Amchem Corporation and from 1963 till August, 1973 the Plaintiff was using the trade mark Rodine as assignee of the trade mark. However, in the month of August, 1973, the trade mark was reassigned to Amchem Corporation by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff, however, in its affidavit date 6th August, 1999 in paragraph 4 stated. \n",
        "p_23": "  \"It is true that assignment of trade mark between the Plaintiff and Amchem Products Inc. (as it were prior to 26th April, 1977), took place in the years 1963 and 1973, but the Plaintiff is enjoying uninterrupted usage of the trade mark Rodine for the past four decades without any objection whatsoever from any quaters much less from Amchem Products, Inc. or any of its successors, if any. As a matter of fact, none of the assignment deed has been recorded with the Trade Marks Registry.\" \n",
        "p_24": " Thus, according to affidavit filed by the Plaintiff, the assignment of the trade mark by Amchem Corporation in favour of the Plaintiff in the year 1963 is not recorded with the Registrar of Trade Mark. In this connection, therefore, provisions of Section 44 of the Act become relevant. Section 44 of the Act reads as under : \n",
        "p_25": " (1) Whether a person becomes entitled by assignment or transmission to a registered trade mark, he shall apply in the prescribed manner to the Registrar to register his title, and the Registrar shall, on receipt of the application and on proof of title to his satisfaction, register him as the proprietor of the trade mark in respect of the goods in respect of which the assignment or transmission has effect, and shall cause particulars of the assignment or transmission to be entered on the register : Provided that where the validity of an assignment or transmission is in dispute between the parties, the Registrar may refuse to register the assignment or transmission until the rights of the parties have been determined by a competent Court. \n",
        "p_26": " (2) Except for the purpose of an application before the Registrar under Sub-section (1) or an appeal from an order thereon, or an application under Section 56 or an appeal from an order thereon, a document or instrument in respect of which no entry has been made in the register in accordance with Sub-section (1), shall not be admitted in evidence by the Registrar or any Court in proof of title to the trade mark by assignment or transmission unless the Registrar or the Court, as the case may be, otherwise directs.\" It is, thus, clear that a person in whose favour trade mark has been assigned has to mark an application for getting assignment recorded in the register in his favour. If the document of assignment in relation to which the entry has not been made by the Registrar in accordance with the provisions of Sub-\n",
        "p_27": "section (1) of Section 44 of the Act, the document cannot be admitted in the evidence, in any Court in proof of title of the trade mark, unless the Registrar or the Court otherwise directs. Thus, so far as assignment of trade mark by Amchem Corporation in favour of the Plaintiff in the year 1963 is concerned, the position that emerges on the basis of the above referred statement of the Plaintiff is that though agreement of assignment was entered into, the assignment was never recorded in the register, with the result Amchem Corporation continued to be the registered proprietor of the trade mark and the user of the trade mark by the Plaintiff from 1963 would, at best, be termed as a permissive user. In any case, in the year 1973, the trade mark was reassigned by the Plaintiff to Amchem Corporation and an agreement was entered into between Amchem Corporation and the Plaintiff, whereby the Plaintiff was to be permitted by Amchem Corporation to use the trade mark. It is further to be seen here that it is also clear from record that the registration of the trade mark in favour of Amchem Corporation was in force till the year 1982. The Plaintiff in its affidavit dated 14th August, 2000 in paragraph 39 has stated : \n",
        "p_28": "  \"The Defendants have conveniently lost sight of the situation that existed all along right from 1959. Even after 1973 royalty statement continued to be sent to Amchem by the Plaintiff and Amchem was well aware of the use of the Trade mark Rodine by the Plaintiff even beyond 1978 i.e. even after royalty payments ceased.\"  \n",
        "p_29": " It appears from this statement that the Plaintiff is suggesting that from 1959 the Plaintiff was sending royalty statement and was making payment of royalty to the Amchem Corporation and that it continued to make that payment even after 1973 and that the Plaintiff ceased to make payment of royalty after 1978. It, thus, appears that the user of the trade mark by the Plaintiff, if at all from 1959, was permissive user. So far as the position after 1973 is concerned, there is an agreement on record by which Amchem Corporation permitted the Plaintiff to use the trade mark. Now so far as 1973 agreement is concerned, in paragraphs 2, 6, 7 & 8 it is stated as under : 2. The permitted User are desirous of using the said trade marks in respect of the goods for which they are respectively registered (hereinafter termed \"the contract products\") and the Proprietors are agreeable to their using the said Trade marks to supplement such use of the said trade marks as the proprietors themselves may wish to make in India as import restrictions and other conditions combine to permit. \n",
        "p_30": " 6. The said Trade marks shall not be used in close proximity to any other trade mark and shall at all times be so described as clearly to indicates that\n\nthey are the Trade Marks of the Proprietors and are being used only by way of licensed use by the Permitted Users. \n",
        "p_31": " 7. This agreement shall be for an initial period of five years from the date of the Agreement above-mentioned and shall continue thereafter subject to twelve months' notice in writing from either party, hereto to the other. \n",
        "p_32": " 8. The Permitted Users shall be the sole registered users of the said trade marks but nothing contained or implied herein shall be constructed as preventing the Proprietors from using the said trade marks in India as import restrictions and other circumstances combine to permit.\" It is clear from the terms quoted above that under this agreement the Plaintiff was using the trade mark subject to the control by Amchem Corporation and the agreement permitted Amchem Corporation to use the said trade mark in India, in case the import regulations so permit. It is, thus, clear that the use of the trade mark by the Plaintiff from 1959 appears to be permissive use and not an exclusive use in its own rights. Thus, prima facie, it is clear that the Plaintiff has failed to establish that they were exclusively using the Trade mark Rodine as proprietor thereof since 1959.  \n",
        "p_33": " 14. Now, in the affidavit filed in the motion, the Plaintiff has slightly modified its case and according to them now Amchem Corporation abandoned the trade mark in the year 1978, the Plaintiff picked up that trade mark and started using it exclusively and this exclusive user of the trade mark since 1998 by the Plaintiff confers on the Plaintiff common law right to prevent the Defendant from using that trade mark in the year 1978. Thus, the foundation of acquisition of this common law right by the Plaintiff is abandonment of the trade mark by Amchem Corporation in the year 1978. As observed above, there are no averments to be found in this regard in the plaint. The averments in this regard have been made for the first time in the affidavit filed in the motion, after reply was filed by the Defendants to the motion. In paragraph 39 of the affidavit dated 14th August, 2000, filed on behalf of the Plaintiff, it is stated that by agreement dated 15th May, 1963, the Trade mark Rodine was absolutely and totally assigned in favour of the Plaintiff, however, reassignment made by the Plaintiff in favour of Amchem Corporation was only a formality with the sole purpose of enabling the Amchem Corporation to obtain any new trade mark registration without any hindrance. Thereafter, it is stated. \n",
        "p_34": " What followed thereafter is history in the sense that Amchem did not care to renew the Trade mark Rodine when it became due in 1977. In the meantime, the uninterrupted use of the Trade mark Rodine by the Plaintiff continued and its right to use the same even after the reassignment did not get extinguished. Further, the question of recording the plaintiff only as a registered user of the Trade mark Rodine did not arise at all Amchem abandoned the trade mark by its conscientious and deliberate act of non-renewal of the Trade mark Rodine in 1977 when it became due.\" \n",
        "p_35": " It is clear from the statement made on oath by the Plaintiff thatthe Plaintiff draws an inference of abandonment of the trade mark by Amchem Corporation on two counts. Firstly, according to the Plaintiff, the assignment of trade mark in favour of the Plaintiff in 1963 was absolute and reassignment of the year 1973 in favour of Amchem Corporation was a formality. In support of its claim that reassignment in favour of Amchem Corporation in the year 1973 was a formality, the Plaintiff relies on a paragraph in a letter dated 7th July, 1973 addressed to the Plaintiff by M/s. Remfry & Sons Patent and Trade Marks Attorneys, Calcutta, who were acting for Amchem Corporation. Now, perusal of the letter dated 7th July, 1973, which is at Exh. B to the affidavit dated 14th August, 2000 filed on behalf of the Plaintiff shows that this letter is in reply to the letter of the Plaintiff dated 28.6.1973. It goes without saying that the contents of a reply cannot be understood properly, unless the letter to which this reply was sent is also placed before the Court. The Plaintiff, however, while relying on reply sent on behalf of the Amchem Corporation to their letter dated 28.6.1973 have chosen not to place that letter on record. The Plaintiffs have relied on following paragraph from the reply. \n",
        "p_36": " Turning to the second enquiry we advise that Amchem Products, Inc., have applied for registration of certain trade marks and have run into difficulty because the Registrar has objected that they conflict with marks previously assigned to you by \"AMCHEM\". Even if you were to grant a letter of consent to the registration of the marks concerned the Registrar would not withdraw the objection of, the ground of conflict and for that reason it is proposed that the registered marks concerned should be reassigned by you to Amchem and that application should thereafter be filed for your record as registered users.\"  \n",
        "p_37": " Now, this above quoted paragraph suggests that assignment of trade mark by Amchem Corporation in favour of the Plaintiff was recorded with the registrar in the year 1963. However, there is a clear conflict between this version to be found in the letter and the statement made in the affidavit dated 6th August, 1999 on behalf of the Plaintiff, which has been quoted above, where the Plaintiff has clearly stated that assignment was not recorded with the Trade Mark Registrar. Now, if according to the Plaintiff the assignment was not registered, then, it is for the Plaintiff to explain as how it became necessary for the Amchem Corporation to have the trade mark reassigned by the Plaintiff to get other trade mark registered. No such explanation is given by the Plaintiff. Therefore, in the face of this clear conflict, it is not clearly established by the Plaintiff that the reassignment of the trade mark in favour of Amchem Corporation was merely a formality. In any case, in the face of this conflict and contradictory versions being placed before the court, it is not possible for the Court\n\nto come to a definite conclusion as to the real nature of the transaction between the parties. So far as the second ground on which the Plaintiff draws an inference of abandonment on the part of the Amchem Corporation is their failure to take steps for renewal of the Trade mark Rodine in the year 1977. The Plaintiff, in its affidavit, dated 14th August, 2000 has stated at more than one places that renewal of the registration of the Trade mark Rodine became due in 1977. In paragraph 57 of that affidavit the Plaintiff has claimed thus: \n",
        "p_38": "  \"Assuming that the Defendants' alleged predecessor enjoyed some right to use the mark sometime in the past, the said right is and was not an absolute right. The registration of the mark in favour of Amchem lapsed in 1977. The Plaintiff has used the mark prior thereto and subsequent thereto and is as such the proprietor in India and is entitled to sue Amchem and/or persons claiming through or under Amchem. The right if any of Amchem came to an end in 1977 when the said mark was surrendered or abandoned by them.\" Thus, the Plaintiff is repeatedly saying that renewal of the trade mark became due in 1977 and because in 1977 Amchem Corporation did not take steps to renew its trade mark, an inference has to be drawn that it abandoned that trade mark. However, at the hearing of the motion, it was agreed by both sides that the first registration of the trade mark in favour of Amchem Corporation was in January, 1946. The registration was for a period for 15 years. The Defendants have produced before the Court a document which was not disputed by the plaintiff, which showed that the registration was renewed in the year 1975 for a term of seven years. Thus, renewal of the trade mark became due in the year 1982 and in no case in 1977. Thus, the very foundation of the case of the Plaintiff in relation to abandonment disappears. It is further to be noted here that according to a statement made on oath in paragraph 39 of the affidavit dated 14th August, 2000, the Plaintiff was making payment of royalty to Amchem Corporation till 1978. If, according to the Plaintiff, the trade mark was abandoned by Amchem Corporation in 1977, the Plaintiff does not explain as to how royalty statements were sent and royalty payments were made till 1978. It is, thus, clear that on this count also the Plaintiff has not made clear and unambiguous statements before the Court. Therefore, it cannot be said that the Plaintiff has established abandonment of the Trade mark by Amchem Corporation in the year 1977. To my mind, therefore, it is clear that the Plaintiff has not established clearly on record either the case pleaded by them in relation to acquisition of proprietary right in the trade mark in the plaint or in the affidavit filed in the motion. The Plaintiff cannot succeed in establishing the prima facie case unless it presents before the Court a clear case. In the present case, I find that the Plaintiff has made contradictory statements and has not presented before the Court a clear case and, therefore, it cannot be said that the Plaintiff has been able to make out prima facie in its favour.\n",
        "p_39": " 15. As I have found that the Plaintiff has not been able to establish the case pleaded by the Plaintiff in the plaint and the affidavit filed in the motion, it is not necessary for me to refer to the authorities relied on by the learned Counsel for both sides to show as to when the trade mark is said to be abandoned, regarding acquisition of goodwill, as also whether after the Amchem Corporation, allegedly did not renew its trade mark, its common law rights in the trade mark continues. \n",
        "p_40": " 16. It is further to be seen here that the Plaintiff has come to the Court with a case that it is exclusively using the Trade mark Rodine since 1959. According to the learned counsel for the Plaintiff, in order to be entitled to establish before the Court that he has acquired a common law right in the Trade mark Rodine by exclusive user thereof, at the time when the Defendants used that mark i.e. in the year 1998, the Plaintiff has to establish his exclusive user of the mark, at the time of its use by the Defendant. Historical origin of the trade mark and its user by others, previously is not relevant. In my opinion, the submission is not well-founded. Had there been no agreement dated 16th August, 1973, which permitted the Plaintiff to use the trade mark, there would have been something in the submission of the learned Counsel. However, there is on record an agreement which the Plaintiff has entered into with Amchem Corporation in the year 1973 and that agreement permits the Plaintiff to use the trade mark. Therefore, for establishing the claim of the Plaintiff of exclusive use of the trade mark, the agreement dated 16.8.1973 between the Plaintiff and Amchem Corporation was relevant and it was for the Plaintiff to plead as to how that agreement came to an end and since what date exclusive user of the trade mark by the Plaintiff started. The Plaintiff was a party to the agreement dated 16.8.1973, therefore, the agreement was within the knowledge of the Plaintiff and as observed above for establishing the case pleaded by the Plaintiff of his exclusive user of the trade mark, the fact that the agreement was entered into by the Plaintiff with the registered proprietor was relevant. The Supreme Court in its judgment in S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu's case referred to above, has held that a litigant approaching the Court is bound to produce all the documents executed by him which are relevant to the litigation. The relevant observations are to be found in paragraphs 7 & 8, which reads as under: \n",
        "p_41": " 7. The High Court, in our view, fell into patent error. The short question before the High Court was whether in the facts and circumstances of this case, Jagannath obtained the preliminary decree by playing fraud on the Court. The High Court, however, went haywire and made observations which are wholly perverse. We do not agree with the High Court that \"there is no legal duty cast upon the plaintiff to come to Court with a true case and prove it by true evidence.\" The principle of \"finality of litigation\" cannot be pressed to the extent of such an absurdity that it becomes an engine of fraud in the hands of dishonest litigants. The Courts of law are meant for imparting justice between the parties. One who comes to the Court, must come with clean hands. We are constrained to say that more often than not, process of the Court is being abused. Property-grabbers tax-evaders, bank-loan-dodgers and other unscrupulous persons from all walks of life find the Court process a convenient lever to retain the illegal-gains indefinitely. We have no hesitation to say that a person whose case is based on false-hood, has no right to approach the Court. He can be summarily thrown out at any stage of the litigation. \n",
        "p_42": " 8. The facts of the present case leave no manner of doubt that Jagannath obtained the preliminary decree by playing fraud on the Court: A fraud is an act of deliberate deception with the design of securing something by taking unfair advantage of another, it is a deception in order to gain by another's loss. It is a cheating intended to get an advantage, Jagannath was working as a clerk with Chunilal Sowear. He purchased the property in the Court auction on behalf of Chunilal Sowear. He had, on his own volition, executed the registered release deed (Exhibit B-15) in favour of Chunilal Sowear regarding the property in dispute. He knew that the appellants had paid the total decretal amount to his master Chunilal Sowear. Without disclosing all these facts, he filed the suit for the partition of the property on the ground that he had purchased the property on his own behalf and not on behalf of Chunilal Sowear. Non-production and even non-mentioning of the release deed at the trial tantamounts to playing fraud on the Court. We do not agreed with the observations of the High Court that the appellants-defendants could have easily produced the certified registered copy of Exhibit B-15 and non-suited the Plaintiff. A litigant, who approaches the Court, is bound to produce all the documents executed by him which are relevant to the litigation. If he withholds a vita document in order to gain advantage on the other side than he would be guilty of playing fraud on the Court as well as on the opposite party.\"  \n",
        "p_43": " The document of agreement dated 16.8.1973 was a relevant document, to which the Plaintiff was a party and the document was relevant for establishing the claim of the plaintiff that he is exclusively using the Trade mark Rodine. In my opinion, therefore, for this reason also the Plaintiff is not entitled to the discretionary relief of temporary injunction. \n",
        "p_44": " 17. It is further to be seen here that there is a considerable force in the submission of the learned Counsel for the Defendant that if acquisition of the proprietary rights in the Trade mark Rodine by the Plaintiff is dependent on abandonment of rights in the trade mark by the Amchem Corporation, then for recording a finding that Amchem Corporation has abandoned its rights in trade mark, successor of Amchem Corporation is a necessary party, may be, when the suit was filed the Plaintiff\n\nwas not aware that the Defendants claim to be a licensee of the successor of the Amchem Corporation. However, once it is disclosed to the Plaintiff; that the Defendants claim to be a licensee of the successors of the Amchem Corporation, in my opinion it was necessary for the Plaintiff to join successors of Amchem Corporation as a Defendant in the suit. It is pertinent to note here that the Defendants claim to be mere licensee of the successors of Amchem Corporation. They did not claim to be assignee. Therefore, mere licensee will not be able to effectively represents the interest of the successors of the Amchem Corporation. On behalf of the Defendant it has been stated that the successor of the Amchem Corporation has applied to the Registrar of Trade Marks for registration of Trade mark Rodine. This is not disputed by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff also has applied for registration of the same trade mark. The question whether the Amchem Corporation had abandoned the use of the trade mark is bound to arise in the proceedings before the Registrar. Any finding recorded in this suit by this Court against the successor of the Amchem Corporation on that question, would definitely cause prejudice to their interest in the proceedings before the Registrar. Therefore, when the Plaintiff is inviting that finding from the Court in this suit, the principle of natural justice requires that the Plaintiff must join the successor of the Amchem Corporation as a Defendant in this Suit. \n",
        "p_45": " 18. Now, so far as the contention of the Plaintiff that they are registered proprietor of the trade mark Rotodine and that the Defendants are using Trade mark Rodine, which is deceptively similar to their trade mark and, therefore, their trade mark is infringed is concerned, it is established on record that the trade mark Rotodine was registered in favour of the Plaintiff in the year 1981, though it is admitted that they have never used it. It is also established on record that till 1982 Amchem Corporation was registered owner of the Trade mark Rodine, which according to the Plaintiff itself is deceptively similar to their registered trade mark Rotodine. Section 33 of the Act reads as under :- \n",
        "p_46": "  Saving for vested rights. - Nothing in this Act shall entitle the proprietor or a registered user of a registered trade mark to interfere with or restrain the use by any person of a trade mark identical with or nearly resembling it in relation to goods in relation which that person or a predecessor in title of his has continuously used that trade mark from a date prior,- \n",
        "p_47": " (a) to the use of the first-mentioned trade mark in relation to those goods by the proprietor or a predecessor in title of his; or  \n \n\n",
        "p_48": " (b) to the date of registration of the first-mentioned trade mark in respect of those goods in the name of the proprietor or a predecessor in title of his ; whichever is the earlier, and the Registrar shall not refuse (on such use being proved) to register the second-mentioned trade mark by reason only of the registration of the first-mentioned trade mark.\n",
        "p_49": " It is clear from the provisions of Section 33 that the registered proprietor of the trade mark does not get a right to interfere with or restrain the use of the same trade mark by a person, if that person or his predecessor in title was using that trade mark prior to the date of the registration of the trade mark in favour of the proprietor. Thus, it is clear that if on the date on which the trade mark is registered in favour of a person, another person is using same or similar trade mark, then the registration of the trade mark does not give the proprietor of that trade mark a right to claim an injunction against the other persons, who is using the trade mark on the date of registration. In my opinion, the heading of Section 33 which is \"Saving for Vested rights\" also suggests the same interpretation of the provisions of this section. The intention behind incorporating this provisions appears to be to protect the right which are vested in other person on the date of registration of the trade mark. In other words, the registration of the trade mark becomes effective from the date of its registration and registration of the trade mark cannot be used by the proprietor to interfere with the use of similar or same trade mark by others who were using it on the date of the registration of the trade mark. I find that same view has been taken by the learned Single Judge of this Court in its judgment in Indo-Pharmaceutical Works Pvt. Ltd. The learned Counsel for the Plaintiff, however, submits that this construction put on the provisions of Section 38 is unreasonable. He submits that suppose a person was using the same trade mark on the date of registration, but after the registration of the trade mark in favour of another person he abandons the use of that trade mark and again starts using that trade mark after a considerable long time, according to interpretation which is indicated above according to the learned counsel, even that person cannot be restrained from readopting the trade mark. The learned counsel submits that Section 38 has to be read with Sub-section (3) of Section 12 of the Act. Sub-section (3) of Section 12 of the Act permits the Registrar to register more than one proprietors of trade mark, if he satisfied that both of them were concurrently using that trade mark. The learned counsel submits that if a person is not entitled to claim concurrent registration under Section 12(3), on the date on which he is readopting the mark, he would not be entitled to protection of Section 33 of the Act. It cannot be denied that there is some substance in the submission made by the learned counsel for the Plaintiff. However, perusal of the judgment of learned single Judge of this Court in Indo Pharmaceutical Works Pvt. Ltd. referred to above shows that this Court has already held that if a person is shown to be using the trade mark on the date of registration of the trade mark, then the registered proprietor is not entitled to an injunction restraining him from using the trade mark. It is further to be seen that even if the interpretation put on the provisions of Section 33 of the Act by the learned counsel for the Plaintiff is accepted, then also for holding that the provisions of Section 33 of the Act do not protect the defendant, a finding will have\n\nto be recorded that the use of the Trade mark Rodine was abandoned by the Amchem Corporation. I have already held above that the Plaintiff has not been able to\nestablish the case of abandonment of the trade mark by the Amchem Corporation or its successors. May be, in case the Plaintiff after joining the successors of the Amchem Corporation, at the final hearing of the suit, succeeds in establishing the abandonment of the trade mark by the Amchem Corporation, the interpretation suggested by the learned Counsel can be examined. At this stage however it is clear that in view of the provisions of Section 33 of the Act an order of temporary injunction can't be made against the Defendant in relation to the trade mark Rotodine. \n",
        "p_50": " 19. Taking over all view of the matter, therefore, in my opinion, the Plaintiff has not been able to establish that he is entitled to the temporary injunction in the terms in which it is seeking. \n",

        "p_2": "1. Appellant Shri VishwaMitter, a dealer in beedies and cigarettes as also the constituted attorney of M/s. Mangalore Ganesh Beedies Works, Mysore filed a complaint in the Court of Sub Divisional Magistrate, 1st Class, Pathankot on December 6, 1977 complaining of commission of offences by the four respondents impleaded as accused Under Sections 78 and 79 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 ('Act' for short) and Section 420 IPC. It was alleged in the complaint that the principals of the complainant M/s. Mangalore Ganesh Beedies Works, Mysore are the registered owners of four trade marks in respect of beedies manufactured by them. The name under which beedies manufactured by the principals of the complainant are sold in the market is 'Mangalore Ganesh Beedies' having a registered trade mark in the wrapper being pink colour wrapper containing the motif of Lord Ganesha and the numeral '501'. One additional registered trade mark used by the manufacturers of the beedies is theGanesh Beedies' wrapped in a wrapper as mentioned above and bearing a multy-colour seal label containing the numeral '501' at its center. The owners of the registered trade mark came to know that respondent No. 4-M/s. Shri Ganesh Beedi Works, Chakradhapur, Bihar were guilty of infringing the trades mark by using a wrapper and seal label identical with or deceptively similar to the registered trade mark and the principals of the complainant filed a suit complaining of infringement and passing off against the 4th respondent. There was a prayer for perpetual injunction in the suit. The suit ended in a decree in favour of the owners of the registered trade mark. Somewhere in August 1977, the complainant who is a dealer in the beedies manufactured by the owners of the registered trade mark came to know that the 4th respondent was selling beedies of inferior quality after wrapping them in a wrapper and using the trade mark deceptively similar to that of the registered trade mark. A complaint thereupon was filed which led to the seizure of some goods. Subsequently, the complainant came to know that the 4th respondent in league with the 2nd and 3rd respondents were storing for sale and selling beedies of inferior quality wrapped in deceptively similar wrapper and were thereby infringing the registered trade mark despite the injunction of the Court. It was alleged that respondents Nos. 1 to 3 knowing of the registered trade mark in favour of the principals of the complainant were storing for sale and selling beedies of inferior quality manufactured by the 4th respondent and wrapped in wrappers \" falsifying the registered trade mark and thereby it was alleged that respondents committed offences Under Sections 78 and 79 of the Act and Section 420 of the I.P.C.\n",
        "p_3": "2. On this complaint being filed after a preliminary enquiry, the learned Magistrate directed process to be issued to the accused. The accused moved revision petition in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh with a request to quash the proceedings. The learned Single Judge of the High Court accepted the revision petition on the narrow ground that the order issuing the process is not a speaking order and directed the learned Magistrate to consider the question of issuing process afresh, When the matter came back to the learned Magistrate, he after hearing the parties held that no case was made out for issuing the process and proceeded to dismiss the complaint. The reasons which impelled the learned Magistrate to reach the aforementioned conclusion may better be extracted in his own words:\n",
        "p_4": " That complainant who has filed the present complaint is not the holder of the Trade Marks which is said to have been impugned by the accused, in collaboration with each other. He is only a sub-dealer of M/s. Mangalore Ganesh Beedies Works, Vinoba Road Mysore, and there must be hundred and thousand dealers of this firm like him. It is only M/s. Mangalore Ganesh Beedies Works, who are holders of the Trade Mark and it is only they who are competent to file the complaint against the accused. The complainant has got no any cause of action, because the trade mark which is impugned by the accused does not belong to him, but belongs to M/s. Ganesh Beedies Works, Mysore, Karnataka State. As no trade mark of the complainant has been violated by the accused as he is only a sub-dealer and not holding any trade mark. I find no reason absolutely to issue the process and the complaint is hereby dismissed. \n",
        "p_5": "The complainant moved the High Court of Punjab and Haryana in Revision Petition No. 652 of 1980, which was dismissed in limine. Hence this appeal by special leave.\n",
        "p_6": "3. The reasons which appealed to the learned Magistrate to come to the conclusion that the complaint filed by the complainant cannot be entertained because he is not registered owner of the trade mark is clearly erroneous\n \n\n",
        "p_7": "4. Section 4 of the CrPC, 1973 provides for trial of offences under the Indian Penal Code and other laws, Sub-section (1) of Section 4 deals with offences under the Indian Penal Code. Sub-section (2) of Section 4 provides that all offences under any other law (other than offences under the Indian Penal Code) shall be investigated, inquired into, tried and otherwise dealt with according to the same provisions, but subject to any enactment for the time being in force regulating the manner or place of investigating, inquiring into, trying or otherwise dealing with such offences. Fasciculus of sections included in Chapter XIV of the Criminal Procedure Code set out conditions requisite for initiation of proceedings. Section 190 provides for cognizance of offences by Magistrates which inter alia provides that subject to the provisions of Chapter XIV, an Magistrate of the first class, and any Magistrate of the second class specially empowered in this behalf under Sub-section (2), may take cognizance of any offence-(a) upon receiving a complaint of facts which constitute such offence;... Section 190 thus confers power on any Magistrate to take cognizance of any offence upon receiving a complaint of facts which constitute such offence. It does not speak of any particular qualification for the complainant. Generally speaking, anyone can put the criminal law in motion unless there is a specific provision to the contrary. This is specifically indicated by the provision of Sub-section (2) of Section 4 which provides that all offences under any other law-meaning thereby law other than the Indian Penal Code-shall be investigated, inquired into, tried, and otherwise dealt with according to the provisions in the CrPC, but subject to any enactment for the time being in force regulating the manner or place of investigating, inquiring into, trying or otherwise dealing with such offences. It would follow as a necessary corollary that unless in any statute other than the CrPC which prescribes an offence and simultaneously specifies the manner or place of investigating, inquiring into, trying or otherwise dealing with such offences, the provisions of the CrPC shall apply in respect of such offences and they shall be investigated, inquired into, tried and otherwise dealt with according to the provisions of the CrPC. One such provision in the CrPC in Section 190 which empowers any Magistrate of the class specified therein to take cognizance of any offence upon receiving a complaint of facts which constitutes such offence. Tf after taking cognizance of an offence it is permissible Under Section 192, such. Magistrate may make over the case to other Magistrate therein specified. Therefore, from a combined reading of Section 4(2) with Section 190 of the CrPC, it transpires that upon a complaint filed by a person setting-out facts therein which constitutes the offence before a Magistrate specified in Section 190, the Magistrate will be competent to take cognizance of the offence irrespective of the qualifications or eligibility of the complainant to file the complaint. It must, however, be conceded that where a provision to the contrary is made in any statute, which may indicate the qualification or eligibility of a complainant to file the complaint, the Magistrate before taking cognizance is entitled and has power to inquire whether the complainant satisfies the eligibility criteria. One illustration would indicate what can be a provision to the contrary as contemplated by Sub-section (2) of Section 4 of the CrPC. Section 195(1) provides that no Court shall take cognizance of any offence set out therein except on the complaint in writing of the public servant concerned or of some other public servant to whom he is administratively subordinate. Similarly Sub-section (2) of Section 195 provides that no Court shall take cognizance of any of the offences specified therein except on the complaint in writing to that Court, or to some other Court to which that Court is subordinate. Section 198 provides that no Court shall take cognizance of an offence, punishable under Chapter XX , of the Indian Penal Code, except upon a complaint made by some ' person aggrieved by the offence. Section 199 provides. that no Court shall take cognizance of an offence punishable under Chapter XXI of the Indian Penal Code, except upon a complaint made by some person aggrieved by the offence. Section 20 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 provides that no prosecution for an offence under the Act, not being an offence Under Section 14 or Section 14-A, shall be instituted except by, or with the written consent of the Central Government or the State Government or a person authorised in this behalf, by general, or special order, by the Central Government or the State Government. Section 621 of the Companies Act, 1956 provides that no Court shall take cognizance of any offence against the Act (other than an offence with respect to which proceedings are instituted Under Section 545), which is alleged to have been committed by any company or any officer thereof, except on the complaint in writing of the Registrar, or of a shareholder of the company, or of a person authorised by the Central Government in that behalf. It is not necessary to multiply the illustration.\n",
        "p_8": "5. It is thus crystal clear that anyone can set the criminal law in motion by filing a complaint of facts constituting an offence before a Magistrate entitled to take cognizance Under Section 190 and unless any statutory provision prescribes any special qualification or eligibility criteria for putting the criminal law in motion, no Court can decline to take cognizance on the sole ground that the complainant was not competent to file the complaint. Section 190 of the CrPC clearly indicates that the qualification of the complainant to file a complaint is not relevant. But where any special statute prescribes offences and makes any special provision for taking cognizance of such offences under the statute, the complainant requesting the Magistrate to take cognizance of the offence must satisfy the eligibility criterion prescribed by the statute. Even with regard to offences under the Indian Penal Code, ordinarily, anyone can set the criminal law in motion but the various provisions in Chapter XIV prescribe the qualification of the complainant which would enable him or her to file a complaint in respect of specified offences and no Court can take cognizance of such offence unless the complainant satisfies the eligibility criterion, but in the absence of any such specification, no Court can throw-out the complaint or decline to take the cognizance on the sole ground that the complainant was not competent to file the complaint.\n",
        "p_9": "6. Section 89 of the Act provides that no Court shall take cognizance of an offence Under Section 81, Section 82 or Section 83 except on a complaint in writing made by the Registrar or any officer authorised by him in writing. This provision manifests the legislative intention that in respect of the three specified offences punishable Under Sections 81, 82 and 83, the Registrar alone is competent to file the complaint. This would simultaneously show that in respect of other offences under the Act, the provision contained in Section 190 of the CrPC read with Sub-section (2) of Section 4 would permit anyone to file the complaint. The indication to the contrary as envisaged by Sub-section 2 of Section 4 of the CrPC is to be found in Section 89 and that section does not prescribe any particular eligibility criterion or qualification for filing a complaint for contravention of Sections 78 and 79 of the Act. Therefore, the learned Magistrate was in error in rejecting the complaint on the sole ground that the complainant was not entitled to file the complaint.\n",
        "p_10": "7. Even otherwise in the absence of a specific qualification, if the person complaining has a Subsisting interest in the protection of the registered trade mark, his complaint cannot be rejected on the ground that he had no cause of action nor sufficient subsisting interest to file the complaint. M/s. Mangalore Ganesh Beedies Works, a partnership firm is the registered owner of trade marks, falsification and infringement of which is complained by the present complainant, who is not only a dealer in these beedies manufactured and sold by the registered owner of the trade marks, but he is also the constituted attorney of the owners of the registered trade mark. To say that the owner of the registered trade mark can alone file the complaint is contrary to the provisions of the statute and commonsense and reason. Therefore, the order of the learned Magistrate dismissing the complaint at the threshold on the ground that the present appellant has no cause of action to file the complaint is utterly unsustainable and must be quashed and set aside. Surprisingly, the High Court dismissed the revision petition of the complainant in limine which order is equally unsustainable and must be set aside.\n",
        "p_11": "8. This appeal is accordingly allowed and order of the learned Magistrate dismissing the complaint and refusing to issue process dated February 20, 1980 and the order of the High Court rejecting the revision petition in limine dated November 4, 1980 are set aside and the matter is remanded to the learned Magistrate to proceed further according to law in the light of the observations made in this judgment.\n"

It  is  for  the court  to  decide  that\tquestion.\nEnglish\t cases\tproceeding on the English way of  pronouncing  an\nEnglish\t word by Englishmen, which it may be stated is not always\nthe  same,  may\t not  be of much assistance  in\t our  country  in\ndeciding   questions  of  phonetic   similarity.   It  cannot  be\noverlooked  that the word is an English word which to the mass of\nthe  Indian people is a foreign word.  It is well recognised that\nin deciding a question of similarity between two marks, the marks\nhave to be considered as a whole.  So considered, we are inclined\nto  agree  with Desai,J., that the marks with which this case  is\nconcerned  are\tsimilar.   Apart from the syllable  co\tin  the\nappellants  mark, the two marks are identical.\tThat syllable is\nnot in our opinion such as would enable the buyers in our country\nto distinguish the one mark from the other. (emphasis added)\n\n      In  Amritdhara Pharmacy Vs.  Satya Deo, AIR 1963 SC 449 the\nrespondent  had\t applied for the registration of the  trade  name\nLakshmandhara  in  respect of a medicinal preparation  for  the\nalleviation  of\t various  ailments.   This  was\t opposed  by  the\nappellant   whose  trade  name\t Amritdhara  had  already  been\nregistered  in\trespect\t of similar medicinal  preparation.   The\nquestion,  which arose, was whether the name Lakshmandhara  was\nlikely\tto  deceive the public or cause confusion to  the  trade.\nWhile  interpreting Sections 8 & 10 of the Trade Marks Act,  this\nCourt observed at pages 452-454 as follows:\n",
        "p_19": "      It will be noticed that the words used in the sections and\nrelevant  for  our  purpose  are  likely  to  deceive  or  cause\nconfusion.   The  Act  does  not   lay\tdown  any  criteria  for\ndetermining  what  is  likely  to  deceive  or\tcause  confusion.\nTherefore,  every  case must depend on its own particular  facts,\nand  the  value\t of authorities lies not so much  in  the  actual\ndecision  as in the tests applied for determining what is  likely\nto  deceive  or cause confusion.  On an application to\tregister,\nthe  Registrar\tor an opponent may object that the trade mark  is\nnot  registrable  by  reason  of  clause (a)  of  Section  8,  or\nsub-section  (1) of Section 10, as in this case.  In such a  case\nthe  onus  is on the applicant to satisfy the Registrar that  the\ntrade  mark  applied  for  is  not likely  to  deceive\tor  cause\nconfusion.   In cases in which the tribunal considers that  there\nis  doubt  as  to whether deception is\tlikely,\t the  application\nshould\tbe  refused.  A trade mark is likely to deceive or  cause\nconfusion  by its resemblance to another already on the\t Register\nif it is likely to do so in the course of its legitimate use in a\nmarket where the two marks are assumed to be in use by traders in\nthat market.  In considering the matter, all the circumstances of\nthe case must be considered.  As was observed by Parker,J.  in Re\nPianotist  Co.s\t Application (1906) 23 RPC 774 which was also  a\ncase of the comparison of two words\n\n      You must take the two words.  You must judge them, both by\ntheir  look  and by their sound.  You must consider the goods  to\nwhich  they are to be applied.\tYou must consider the nature  and\nkind of customer who would be likely to buy those goods.  In fact\nyou  must  consider all the surrounding circumstances;\t and  you\nmust  further consider what is likely to happen if each of  those\ntrade marks is used in a normal way as a trade mark for the goods\nof the respective owners of the marks. (p.777)\n\n      For deceptive resemblance two important questions are:  (1)\nwho  are  the  persons\twhom the resemblance must  be  likely  to\ndeceive\t or  confuse, and (2) what rules of comparison are to  be\nadopted\t in  judging  whether  such resemblance\t exists.   As  to\nconfusion,  it is perhaps an appropriate description of the state\nof  mind  of  a\t customer who, on seeing a mark\t thinks\t that  it\ndiffers\t from  the mark on goods which he has previously  bought,\nbut  is doubtful whether that impression is not due to\timperfect\nrecollection.  (see Kerly on Trade Marks, 8th Edition, p.  400)\n\n      Let us apply these tests to the facts of the case under our\nconsideration.\t It is not disputed before us that the two  names\nAmritdhara  and\t Lakshmandhara are in use in respect  of  the\nsame  description  of goods, namely, a medicinal preparation  for\nthe  alleviation of various ailments.  Such medicinal preparation\nwill  be  purchased  mostly by people who instead of going  to\ta\ndoctor\twish to purchase a medicine for the quick alleviation  of\ntheir  suffering, both villagers & townsfolk, literate as well as\nilliterate.   As  we  said  in Corn Products  Refining\tCo.   Vs.\nShangrila  Food\t Products Ltd., (1960) 1 SCR 968:  (AIR\t 1960  SC\n",
        "p_20": "142)  the question has to be approached from the point of view of\na  man\tof average intelligence and imperfect  recollection.   To\nsuch  a man the overall structural and phonetic similarity of the\ntwo  names  Amritdhara and Lakshmandhara is, in our  opinion,\nlikely\tto  deceive  or cause confusion.  We  must  consider  the\noverall\t similarity  of the two composite words Amritdhara  and\nLakshmandhara.\t WE do not think that the learned Judges of the\nHigh  Court were right in saying that no Indian would mistake one\nfor  the other.\t An unwary purchaser of average intelligence  and\nimperfect  recollection\t would not, as the High\t Court\tsupposed,\nsplit  the  name  into\tits  component\tparts  and  consider  the\netymological  meaning thereof or even consider the meaning of the\ncomposite  words as current of nectar or current of Lakshman.\nHe  would  go  more  by\t  the  overall\tstructural  and\t phonetic\nsimilarity  and\t the  nature of the medicine  he  has  previously\npurchased,  or has been told about, or about which has\totherwise\nlearnt\tand which he wants to purchase.\t Where the trade  relates\nto goods largely sold to illiterate or badly educated persons, it\nis  no answer to say that a person educated in the Hindi language\nwould  go by the etymological or ideological meaning and see  the\ndifference between current of nectar and current of Lakshman.\nCurrent of Lakshman in a literal sense has no meaning;\tto give\nit  meaning one must further make the inference that the current\nor stream is as pure and strong as Lakshman of the Ramayana.  An\nordinary  Indian villager or townsman will perhaps know Lakshman,\nthe story of the Ramayana being familiar to him;  but we doubt if\nhe  would  etymologise\tto  the extent of  seeing  the\tso-called\nideological  difference between Amritdhara and Lakshmandhara.\nHe  would  go  more  by the similarity of the two  names  in  the\ncontext\t of the widely known medicinal preparation which he wants\nfor his ailments.\n",
        "p_21": "      We  agree that the use of the word dhara which  literally\nmeans  current\tor  stream  is not by itself  decisive\tof  the\nmatter.\t  What we have to consider here is the overall similarity\nof  the\t composite words, having regard to the circumstance  that\nthe goods bearing the two names are medicinal preparations of the\nsame  description.  We are aware that the admission of a mark  is\nnot  to\t be refused, because unusually stupid people,  fools  or\nidiots, may be deceived.  A critical comparison of the two names\nmay disclose some points of difference but an unwary purchaser of\naverage intelligence and imperfect recollection would be deceived\nby  the overall similarity of the two names having regard to  the\nnature\tof  the medicine he is looking for with a somewhat  vague\nrecollection  that  he\thad  purchased a similar  medicine  on\ta\nprevious  occasion  with a similar name.  The trade mark  is  the\nwhole  thing - the whole word has to be considered.  In the  case\nof  the\t application  to  register  Erectiks  (opposed\tby  the\nproprietors  of\t the trade mark Erector) Farwell, J.   said  in\nWilliam\t Bailey\t (Birmingham) Ltd.s Application,  (1935)  R.P.C.\n136:\n",
        "p_22": "      I\t do not think it is right to take a part of the word and\ncompare\t it  with  a part of the other word;  one  word\t must  be\nconsidered  as\ta  whole and compared with the other  word  as\ta\nwhole..I  think it is a dangerous method to adopt to divide  the\nword up and seek to distinguish a portion of it from a portion of\nthe other word.\n",
        "p_23": "      Another case relating to medicinal product is that of Durga\nDutt  Sharma  Vs.  N.P.\t Laboratories, AIR 1965 SC 980.\t In  that\ncase the respondent, who manufactured medicinal products, had got\nthe  word Navaratna registered as a trade mark.\t The appellant,\nwho  was carrying on the business in the preparation of Ayurvedic\npharmaceutical\tproducts  under\t the name  of  Navaratna  Kalpa\napplied\t for  registration  of the words Navaratna Kalpa  as  a\ntrade  mark for his medicinal preparations.  The objection of the\nrespondent  to the proposed registration prevailed.  This led  to\nproceedings  which culminated in the appeals to this Court.   The\nobservations  by  this Court on two aspects are\t very  pertinent.\nFirstly\t with  regard  to the difference between  an  action  for\npassing\t off  and  action  for infringement  of\t trade\tmark,  it\nobserved at page 990 as follows:\n",
        "p_24": "      While  an\t action for passing off is a common  law  remedy\nbeing  in substance an action for deceit, that is, a passing  off\nby a person of his own goods as those of another, that is not the\ngist  of an action for infringement.  The action for infringement\nis a statutory remedy conferred on the registered proprietor of a\nregistered trade mark for the vindication of the exclusive right\nto the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods (Vide S.\n21  of\tthe Act).  The use by the defendant of the trade mark  of\nthe  plaintiff is not essential in an action for passing off, but\nis  the\t sine qua non in the case of an action for  infringement.\nNo  doubt, where the evidence in respect of passing off\t consists\nmerely\tof  the\t colourable use of a registered trade  mark,  the\nessential  features  of\t both the actions might coincide  in  the\nsense  that what would be a colourable imitation of a trade  mark\nin  a  passing\toff action would also be such in  an  action  for\ninfringement   of   the\t same  trade   mark.\tBut   there   the\ncorrespondence\tbetween\t the  two  ceases.    In  an  action  for\ninfringement, the plaintiff must, no doubt, make out that the use\nof  the\t defendants  mark is likely to deceive,\t but  where  the\nsimilarity between the plaintiffs and the defendants mark is so\nclose  either  visually, phonetically or otherwise and the  court\nreaches\t the  conclusion that there is an imitation,  no  further\nevidence is required to establish that the plaintiffs rights are\nviolated.   Expressed in another way, if the essential\tfeatures\nof  the\t trade\tmark of the plaintiff have been\t adopted  by  the\ndefendant, the fact that the get-up, packing and other writing or\nmarks on the goods or on the packets in which he offers his goods\nfor  sale  show marked differences, or indicate clearly\t a  trade\norigin\tdifferent  from that of the registered proprietor of  the\nmark  would  be immaterial;  whereas in the case of passing  off,\nthe  defendant may escape liability if he can show that the added\nmatter\tis sufficient to distinguish his goods from those of  the\nplaintiff.\n",
        "p_25": "      Secondly,\t while\tdealing\t with the question of  burden  of\nproof  in an action for infringement of trade mark, this Court in\nDurga Dutt Sharmas case (supra) held as under:\n",
        "p_26": "      When  once  the use by the defendant of the mark which  is\nclaimed\t to infringe the plaintiffs mark is shown to be in  the\ncourse\tof  trade,  the\t question  whether  there  has\tbeen  an\ninfringement  is  to be decided by comparison of the  two  marks.\nWhere  the  two marks are identical no further\tquestions  arise;\nfor  then  the infringement is made out.  When the two marks  are\nnot  identical,\t the plaintiff would have to establish\tthat  the\nmark  used  by the defendant so nearly resembles the  plaintiffs\nregistered  trade mark as is likely to deceive or cause confusion\nand  in\t relation to goods in respect of which it  is  registered\n(Vide  S.  21).\t A point has sometimes been raised as to  whether\nthe words or cause confusion introduce any element which is not\nalready\t covered by the words likely to deceive and it has some\ntimes  been answered by saying that it is merely an extension  of\nthe  earlier test and does not add very materially to the concept\nindicated  by  the earlier words likely to deceive.   But  this\napart,\tas the question arises in an action for infringement  the\nonus  would be on the plaintiff to establish that the trade  mark\nused  by  the  defendant in the course of trade in the\tgoods  in\nrespect\t of which his mark is registered, is deceptively similar.\nThis has necessarily to be ascertained by a comparison of the two\nmarks\tthe degree of resemblance which is necessary to exist to\ncause  deception  not being capable of definition by laying  down\nobjective  standards.  The persons who would be deceived are,  of\ncourse,\t the purchasers of the goods and it is the likelihood  of\ntheir  being deceived that is the subject of consideration.   The\nresemblance  may  be  phonetic,\t visual\t or  in\t the  basic  idea\nrepresented  by\t the  plaintiffs  mark.\t   The\tpurpose\t of  the\ncomparison  is for determining whether the essential features  of\nthe  plaintiffs\t trade mark are to be found in that used by  the\ndefendant.   The identification of the essential features of  the\nmark is in essence a question of fact and depends on the judgment\nof  the Court based on the evidence led before it as regards  the\nusage  of  the trade.  It should, however, be borne in mind  that\nthe  object  of the enquiry in ultimate analysis is  whether  the\nmark  used by the defendant as a whole is deceptively similar  to\nthat of the registered mark of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_27": "      Dealing  once again with medicinal products, this Court  in\nF.   Hoffmann-La  Roche & Co.  Ltd.  Vs.  Geoffrey Manner  &  Co.\nPvt.   Ltd.,  1969(2) SCC 716 had to consider whether  the  words\nProtovit  belonging  to the appellant was similar to  the  word\nDropovit  of  the respondent.  This Court, while  deciding  the\ntest to be applied, observed at page 720 as follows:\n",
        "p_28": "      The  test\t for  comparison  of the  two  word  marks  were\nformulated by Lord Parker in Pianotist Co.  Ltd.s application as\nfollows:\n",
        "p_29": "      You must take the two words.  You must judge of them, both\nby their look and by their sound.  You must consider the goods to\nwhich  they are to be applied.\tYou must consider the nature  and\nkind  of  customer  who would be likely to buy those  goods.   In\nfact,  you must consider all the surrounding circumstances;   and\nyou  must  further consider what is likely to happen if\t each  of\nthose trade marks is used in a normal way as a trade mark for the\ngoods of the respective owners of the marks.  If, considering all\nthose  circumstances, you come to the conclusion that there  will\nbe a confusion, that is to say, not necessarily that one man will\nbe  injured  and  the other will gain illicit benefit,\tbut  that\nthere  will  be a confusion in the mind of the public which  will\nlead   to  confusion  in  the\tgoods-then  you\t may  refuse  the\nregistration,  or rather you must refuse the registration in that\ncase.\n",
        "p_30": "      It  is  necessary\t to apply both the  visual  and\t phonetic\ntests.\t In Aristoc Ltd.  v.  Rysta Ltd.  the House of Lords  was\nconsidering  the resemblance between the two words \"Aristoc  and\nRysta.\t The view taken was that considering the way the  words\nwere pronounced in English, the one was likely to be mistaken for\nthe  other.  Viscount Maugham cited the following passage of Lord\nJustice\t Lukmoore in the Court of Appeal, which passage, he said,\nhe completely accepted as the correct exposition of the law:\n",
        "p_31": "      The  answer to the question whether the sound of one  word\nresembles  too\tnearly\tthe sound of another so as to  bring  the\nformer\twithin\tthe limits of Section 12 of the Trade Marks  Act,\n1938,  must  nearly  always  depend   on  first\t impression,  for\nobviously  a person who is familiar with both words will  neither\nbe  deceived  nor confused.  It is the person who only knows  the\none  word and has perhaps an imperfect recollection of it who  is\nlikely to be deceived or confused.  Little assistance, therefore,\nis  to be obtained from a meticulous comparison of the two words,\nletter\tby  letter and syllable by syllable, pronounced with  the\nclarity\t to  be expected from a teacher of elocution.  The  Court\nmust  be careful to make allowance for imperfect recollection and\nthe  effect of careless pronunciation and speech on the part  not\nonly  of  the person seeking to buy under the trade  description,\nbut  also  of  the shop assistant ministering  to  that\t persons\nwants.\n",
        "p_32": "      It  is important that the marks must be compared as wholes.\nIt  is\tnot  right  to take a portion of the word  and\tsay  that\nbecause\t that portion of the word differs from the  corresponding\nportion\t of  the  word in the other case there is  no  sufficient\nsimilarity  to\tcause  confusion.  The true test is  whether  the\ntotality  of the proposed trade mark is such that it is likely to\ncause  deception or confusion or mistake in the minds of  persons\naccustomed to the existing trade mark.\tThus in Lavroma case Lord\nJohnston said:\n",
        "p_33": "\twe are not bound to scan the words as we would in a\nquestion  of  comparatio  literarum.   It is  not  a  matter  for\nmicroscopic inspection, but to be taken from the general and even\ncasual point of view of a customer walking into a shop.\"\n",
        "p_34": "      On the facts of that case this Court came to the conclusion\nthat  taking into account all circumstances the words  Protovit\nand  Dropovit  were so dissimilar that there was no  reasonable\nprobability  of confusion between the words either from visual or\nphonetic point of view.\n",
        "p_35": "      Our  attention was drawn to a recent judgment of this Court\nin  S.M.   Dyechem Ltd.\t Vs.  Cadbury (India) Ltd.  (2000) 5  SCC\n573  where  in\ta passing off action, the  plaintiff,  which  was\ncarrying on the business under the mark of Piknik, filed a suit\nfor  injunction against the defendant which was using the mark of\nPicnic for some other chocolates sold by it.  On the allegation\nthat  the  defendants  mark was deceptively similar,  the  trial\ncourt  had  issued an injunction which was reversed by\tthe  High\nCourt.\t On appeal, the decision of the High Court was\taffirmed.\nOne  of the questions, which this Court considered, was that  for\ngrant  of  temporary  injunction,  should the  Court  go  by  the\nprinciple of prima facie case, apart from balance of convenience,\nor  comparative\t strength  of the case of either  parties  or  by\nfinding out if the plaintiff has raised a triable issue.  While\nconsidering  various decisions on the point in issue, this  Court\nrightly concluded at page 591 as follows:\n",
        "p_36": "      Therefore,  in trade mark matters, it is now necessary  to\ngo  into  the question of comparable strength of the  cases  of\neither party, apart from balance of convenience.\n",
        "p_37": "      On merits of the case, this Court took note of some English\ndecisions and observed in Dyechems case (supra) at page 594 that\nwhere  common marks are included in the rival trade marks,  more\nregard\tis  to\tbe paid to the parts not common\t and  the  proper\ncourse\tis to look at the marks as a whole, but at the same  time\nnot  to disregard the parts which are common.  This Court sought\nto  apply the principle that dissimilarity in essential\t features\nin  devices  and  composite marks are more  important  than  some\nsimilarity.   This  Court,  after considering  various\tdecisions\nreferred  to  hereinabove, observed in Dyechems case (supra)  at\npage 596 as follows:\n",
        "p_38": "      Broadly,\tunder our law as seen above, it can be said that\nstress is laid down on common features rather than on differences\nin  essential  features,  except  for a passing\t reference  to\ta\nlimited extent in one case.\n",
        "p_39": "      Notwithstanding  the  aforesaid observations this Court  in\nDyechems case (supra) proceeded to observe as follows:\n",
        "p_40": "      It  appears to us that this Court did not have occasion to\ndecide,\t as far as we are able to see, an issue where there  were\nalso differences in essential features nor to consider the extent\nto  which  the\tdifferences  are  to  be  given\t importance  over\nsimilarities.  Such a question has arisen in the present case and\nthat  is  why we have referred to the principles of  English  Law\nrelating  to differences in essential features which  principles,\nin our opinion, are equally applicable in our country.\n",
        "p_41": "      We  are unable to agree with the aforesaid observations  in\nDyechems  case (supra).\t As far as this Court is concerned,  the\ndecisions  in  the last four decades have clearly laid down  that\nwhat  has  to be seen in the case of a passing off action is  the\nsimilarity  between the competing marks and to determine  whether\nthere  is likelihood of deception or causing confusion.\t This  is\nevident from the decisions of this Court in the cases of National\nSewing\tThread\tCo.  Ltd.s case (supra), Corn Products\tRefining\nCompanys case (supra), Amritdhara Pharmacys case (supra), Durga\nDutt  Sharmas case (supra), Hoffmann-La Roche & Co.  Ltd.s case\n(supra).   Having  come\t to  the   conclusion,\tin  our\t  opinion\nincorrectly,  that  the\t difference  in\t essential  features   is\nrelevant,  this Court in Dyechems case (supra) sought to examine\nthe  difference\t in  the  two marks Piknic  and\t Picnic.   It\napplied three tests, they being 1) is there any special aspect of\nthe  common feature which has been copied ?  2) mode in which the\nparts are put together differently i.e.\t whether dissimilarity of\nthe  part  or parts is enough to make the whole thing  dissimilar\nand 3) whether when there are common elements, should one not pay\nmore  regard to the parts which are not common, while at the same\ntime  not  disregarding\t the common parts ?.   In  examining  the\nmarks,\tkeeping the aforesaid three tests in mind, it came to the\nconclusion, seeing the manner in which the two words were written\nand  the peculiarity of the script and concluded that  the above\nthree  dissimilarities have to be given more importance than  the\nphonetic  similarity  or  the similarity in the use of\tthe  word\nPICNIC for PIKNIK.\n",
        "p_42": "      With  respect, we are unable to agree that the principle of\nphonetic similarity has to be jettisoned when the manner in which\nthe  competing words are written is different and the  conclusion\nso  arrived  at is clearly contrary to the binding  precedent  of\nthis  Court  in\t Amritdharas  case (supra)  where  the\tphonetic\nsimilarity  was\t applied  by  judging the  two\tcompeting  marks.\nSimilarly,  in Durga Dutt Sharmas case (supra), it was\tobserved\nthat  in  an  action for infringement, the  plaintiff  must,  no\ndoubt, make out that the use of the defendants mark is likely to\ndeceive, but where the similarity between the plaintiffs and the\ndefendants  mark  is so close either visually,\tphonetically  or\notherwise  and the court reaches the conclusion that there is  an\nimitation,  no further evidence is required to establish that the\nplaintiffs rights are violated.\n",

Snelling, Lampard\t&\nCo.   (1900) 17 RPC 48 that it is a misconception to refer to the\nconfusion  that can be created upon an ignorant customer that the\ncourts ought to think of in these cases is the customer who knows\nthe  distinguishing  characteristics  of the  plaintiffs  goods,\nthose  characteristics\twhich  distinguish his goods  from  other\ngoods in the market so far as relates to general characteristics.\nIf  he\tdoes not know that, he is not a customer whose views  can\nproperly be regarded by the Court.  (See the cases quoted in N.S.\nThread & Co.  Vs.  Chadwick & Bros.  AIR 1948 Mad 481 which was a\npassing-off  action.)  In Schweppes Case (1905) 22 RPC\t601  (HL)\nLord  Halsbury said, if a person is so careless that he does  not\nlook  and  does not treat the label fairly but takes  the  bottle\nwithout\t sufficient  consideration  and without reading\t what  is\nwritten\t very plainly indeed up the face of the label, you cannot\nsay he is deceived.\n",

A trade may relate  to\ngoods  largely sold to illiterate or badly educated persons.  The\npurchaser in India cannot be equated with a purchaser of goods in\nEngland.   While  we  agree  that in trade mark\t matters,  it  is\nnecessary  to  go into the question of comparable  strength,  the\ndecision  on  merits in Dyechems case (supra) does not,\t in  our\nopinion, lay down correct law and we hold accordingly.\n",

While English cases\nmay  be relevant in understanding the essential features of trade\nmark  law but when we are dealing with the sale of consumer items\nin  India,  you\t have to see and bear in mind the  difference  in\nsituation  between  England  and India.\t Can  English  principles\napply  in  their  entirety  in India with  no  regard  to  Indian\nconditions?   We think not.  In a country like India where  there\nis no single common language, a large percentage of population is\nilliterate  and a small fraction of people know English, then  to\napply  the  principles of English law regarding dissimilarity  of\nthe  marks  or\tthe  customer knowing  about  the  distinguishing\ncharacteristics\t of the plaintiffs goods seems to over look  the\nground\trealities in India.

While dealing with cases  relating  to\npassing\t off, one of the important tests which has to be  applied\nin  each  case\tis  whether the\t misrepresentation  made  by  the\ndefendant  is of such a nature as is likely to cause an\t ordinary\nconsumer  to confuse one product for another due to similarity of\nmarks  and  other surrounding factors.\tWhat is likely\tto  cause\nconfusion  would vary from case to case.  However, the appellants\nare  right  in\tcontending  that  where\t medicinal  products  are\ninvolved,  the test to be applied for adjudging the violation  of\ntrade  mark  law  may  not  be\t at  par  with\tcases\tinvolving\nnon-medicinal  products.   A stricter approach should be  adopted\nwhile  applying the test to judge the possibility of confusion of\none  medicinal\tproduct\t for  another  by  the\tconsumer.   While\nconfusion  in  the case of non-medicinal products may only  cause\neconomic  loss\tto  the\t plaintiff,  confusion\tbetween\t the  two\nmedicinal  products may have disastrous effects on health and  in\nsome  cases  life itself.  Stringent measures should  be  adopted\nspecially where medicines are the medicines of last resort as any\nconfusion in such medicines may be fatal or could have disastrous\neffects.   The confusion as to the identity of the product itself\ncould have dire effects on the public health.\n",

Commissioner of \nCommercial Taxes and Anr. (1996) 4 SCC 433 (in so far as \nit affirmed the decision in the  H. Anraj) have been referred to \nthis Bench for re-consideration. \n",
        "p_2": "The question in H. Anraj  was whether sales tax can be \nlevied by States on the sale of lottery tickets.  A bench of two-\nJudges held that a lottery involved (i) the right to participate in \nthe lottery draw, and (ii) the right to win the prize, depending \non chance.  The learned Judges were of the opinion that while \nthe second right was a chose in action and therefore not \n'goods' for the purposes of the levy of Sales Tax, the first was a \ntransfer of a beneficial interest in moveable  goods and was a \nsale within the meaning of Article 366 (29-A)(d) of the \nConstitution and consequently subject to sales tax. \n",
        "p_3": "         The immediate cause for the present reference was a \ndecision of the High Court of Delhi dated 17th July, 1998 in \nHaryana State Lotteries v.

In the \nappeal preferred by Sunrise Associates, the order of reference \nwas made on the prima facie view that there was no good \nreason to split  a lottery into two separate rights and, \ntherefore, the judgment in H. Anraj required reconsideration.  \nSince in the case of Vikas Sales Corporation v. \nCommissioner of Commercial Taxes (supra), a bench of \nthree-Judges had agreed with the decision of H. Anraj,  it was \nnecessary that the appeal should be heard by a Constitution \nBench.\n",
        "p_4": "      The relevant provisions of law which formed the \nbackground in the context of which the decision of H.Anraj  \nwas given are considered by us prior to assessing the \ncorrectness of the decision.  Entry 54 of List II of the Seventh \nSchedule read with Article 246(3) of the Constitution gives the \nStates power to make laws with respect to  \"taxes on the sale \nor purchase of goods other than newspapers subject to the \nprovisions of Entry 92(A) of List I\".  The meaning of the \nexpression \"sale of goods\" was considered by a Constitution \nBench in the The State of Madras v. Gannon Dunkerley & \nCo. Ltd. 1958 SCR 379.  The question arose in connection \nwith assessment of sales tax under the Madras General Sales \nTax Act, 1939  for the year 1949-50 on the value of materials \nused by the respondent-assessee for the execution of a works \ncontract. The Constitution, although it defines 'goods' under \nArticle 366((12) as 'including all materials, commodities and \narticles\", contains no definition of the expression 'sale of \ngoods'.  The Court held that the expression 'sale of goods' in \nthe entry  cannot be construed in its popular sense and it \nmust be interpreted in its legal sense.  After considering \nvarious authorities as well as the provisions of the Sales of \nGoods Act, 1930, the Court held that the expression 'sale of \ngoods' is what it means in the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. A \ncontract for the sale of goods, according to Section 4(1) of the \nSale of Goods Act, 1930 \"is a contract whereby the seller \nagrees to transfer the property in goods to the buyer for a \nprice\".\n",
        "p_5": "          This classical concept of sale was held to apply to the \nentry in the legislative list in that there had to be three \nessential components to constitute a transaction of sale before \ntax could be imposed- namely, (i) an agreement to transfer title \n",
        "p_6": "(ii) supported by consideration, and (iii) an actual transfer of \ntitle in the goods. In the absence of any one of these elements \nit was held that there was no sale.  Therefore, a contract under \nwhich a contractor agreed to set up a building would not be a \ncontract for sale. It was one contract, entire and indivisible \nand there was no separate agreement for sale of goods \njustifying the levy of sales tax by the provincial legislatures. \nParties could have provided for two independent agreements, \none relating to the labour and work involved in the erection of \nthe building and the second relating to the sale of the material \nused in the building in which case the latter would be an \nagreement to sell and the supply of materials thereunder, a \nsale. Where there was no such separation, the contract was a \ncomposite one and it was not classifiable as a sale.\n\tThe narrow definition put on the word \"sale\" by Gannon \nDunkerley was followed by Courts in several cases excluding \nother transactions such as hire purchase, long leases etc. from \nthe scope of \"sale\" on the ground that one or more of the three \ncomponents of sale were absent. Consequently Article 366 of \nthe Constitution was amended by introduction of Clause 29A \nwhich is to the effect that \"tax on the sale or purchase of \ngoods\" for the purposes of the Constitution would include six \nparticular transactions which were, by virtue of judicial \ndecision, excluded from the phrase. We are concerned with the \nfirst class of transaction so included namely:\n",
        "p_7": "(a)\ta tax on the transfer, \notherwise than in \npursuance of a contract, of \nproperty in any goods for \ncash, deferred payment or \nother valuable \nconsideration;\n",
        "p_8": "       xxx\t\txxx\t\txxx\n       xxx\t\txxx\t\txxx\n\nand such transfer, delivery or supply of any \ngoods shall be deemed to be a sale of those \ngoods by the person making the transfer, \ndelivery or supply and a purchase of those \ngoods by the person to whom such transfer, \ndelivery or supply is made;\n",
        "p_9": "Therefore in order to constitute a deemed sale within the \nmeaning of Art. 366(29A) (a), there has to be 1) goods 2) a \ntransfer  of property in the goods  3) valuable consideration. \nThe requirement of an agreement for sale is not necessary for \nconstituting a sale under this sub-clause.  The absence of any \none of these elements would mean that the transaction far \nfrom being a sale within the Gannon Dunkerley definition, \nwould not even be a deemed sale within the extended \ndefinition of sale under Art. 366(29A) (a).  \nFollowing the Constitutional amendment, the States \namended their respective Sales Tax Laws to incorporate the \nconstitutional definition of tax on the sale or purchase of \ngoods. The States of Tamil Nadu and West Bengal were no \nexception. The Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act 1959 and \nthe Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act 1941 were both amended \nto incorporate new definitions of 'sale'. \n Section 2(j) and Section 2 (n) of the Tamil Nadu Act \ndefined 'goods' and 'sale' as noted in H.

It was \ncontended that a sale of a lottery ticket was nothing more than \na sale of a chance to win a prize, and therefore, it was merely a \ncontingent interest in money.   Alternatively it was submitted \nthat the lottery tickets were in fact actionable claims within \nthe meaning of Section 3 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, \nand therefore, outside the definition of \"goods\" under the Sales \nTax Acts. \n",
        "p_19": "The Court in H. Anraj came to the conclusion that the \ntransfer of a lottery ticket upon consideration paid by the \npurchaser was not a mere contract creating an obligation or \nright  in personam between the parties, but was in the nature \nof a grant. The Court noted the various definitions of the word \n\"lottery\" in dictionaries and authoritative text books and \ndecisions of the Courts and held that a lottery was composed \nof three essential elements, namely; 1) chance, 2) \nconsideration; and 3) prize.  As we have mentioned earlier, \naccording to the learned Judges a sale of a lottery ticket \nconferred on the purchaser two rights viz. a) the right to \nparticipate in the draw and b)  the right to claim a prize \ncontingent upon the purchaser being successful in the draw.  \nBoth were held to be beneficial interests in moveable property, \nthe former \"in praesenti\",  the latter in futuro  depending on the \ncontingency. To use the words of the Court:-\n",
        "p_20": "\" Lottery tickets, not as physical articles, \nbut as slips of paper or memoranda \nevidence not one but both these \nbeneficial interests in moveable property \nwhich are obviously capable of being \ntransferred, assigned or sold and on their \ntransfer, assignment or sale both these \nbeneficial interests are made over to the \npurchaser for a price \n......the two entitlements which arise on \nthe  purchase of a lottery ticket are of a \ndifferent character, inasmuch as the right \nto participate arises in praesenti, that is \nto say it is a choate on perfected right in \nthe purchaser on the strength of which \nhe can enforce the holding of the draw, \nwhile the other is inchoate right which is \nto materialize in future as and when the \ndraw takes place depending upon his \nbeing successful in such draw.  Moreover, \non the date of the purchase of the ticket, \nthe entitlement to participate in the draw \ncan be said to have been delivered into \nthe possession of the purchaser who \nwould be enjoying it from the time he has \npurchased the ticket and as such it \nwould be a chose in possession while the \nother would be an actionable claim or a \nchose in action as has been held in \nJones v. Carter  and King v. Connare  \non which counsel for the dealers relied. It \nis thus clear that a transfer of the right to \nparticipate in the draw which takes place \non the sale of a lottery ticket would be a \ntransfer of beneficial interest in movable  \nproperty to the purchaser and therefore, \namounts to transfer of goods and to that \nextent it is no transfer of an actionable \nclaim; to the extent that it involves a \ntransfer of the right to claim a prize \ndepending on a chance it will be an \nassignment of an actionable claim.\" \n",
        "p_21": "It was also said that :-\n",
        "p_22": "\" If incorporeal right like copyright or an \nintangible thing like electric energy can \nbe regarded as goods exigible to sales tax \nthere is no reason why the entitlement to \na right to participate in a draw which is \nbeneficial interest in moveable  property \nof incorporeal or intangible character \nshould not be regarded as 'goods' for the \npurpose of levying sales tax.  As stated \nabove lottery tickets which comprise such \nentitlement do constitute a stock-in-trade \nof every dealer and therefore his \nmerchandise which can be bought and \nsold in the market.  Lottery tickets \ncomprising such entitlement, therefore, \nwould fall within the definition of 'goods' \ngiven in the Tamil Nadu Act and the \nBengal Act.\" \n",
        "p_23": "The Court also rejected the submission of the counsel for \nthe dealers that a sale of a lottery ticket does not involve the \ntransfer of any right. The contention was that just as a  \ncompany before it issues share capital does not hold any of the \nshares which come to exist only in the hands of the \nshareholders  through subscribing for them, so in the case of a \nlottery the promoter sponsoring it, does not have the right to \nparticipate in the draw or the right to claim the prize.  Since \none cannot 'transfer' what one does not have, it was argued \nthat there was no 'transfer' of any right by the promoter to the \npurchaser of the ticket. The submission was rejected on the \nground that the analogy was inapt as Joint Stock Companies \nwere governed by the provisions of the Company's Act and \nMemorandum of Articles of Association of the Company's \nwhereas the issue of lottery tickets was governed by raffle \nschemes and the rules framed therefor by the promoter \ncontaining provisions which were entirely different. Secondly, \nthe context in which lottery tickets were issued was different \nfrom the context in which shares were allotted. Moreover it \nwas said that:-\n",
        "p_24": "\"the agreement that comes into \nexistence as a result of the sale of a \nlottery ticket by a promoter to a buyer is \nin the nature of a grant conferring the \ntwo rights (the right to participate and \nthe right to claim a prize) as distinct from \nthe right to receive  or claim a  prize in \nsuch draw, needs to be highlighted which \nhas a significant bearing on the question \nwhether  the lottery tickets would be \ngoods or not.  It cannot be disputed that \nthis right to participate in the draw under \na lottery ticket remains a valuable right \ntill the draw takes place and it is for this \nreason that licenced agents or \nwholesalers or dealers of such tickets are \nenabled to effect sales thereof till the \ndraw actually takes place and as such till \nthen the lottery tickets constitute their \nstock-in-trade and therefore a \nmerchandise. In other words, lottery \ntickets, not as physical articles but as \nslips of paper or memoranda evidencing \nthe right to participate in the draw must \nin a sense be regarded as the dealer's \nmerchandise and therefore, goods, \ncapable of being bought or sold in the \nmarket.\"\n",
        "p_25": "The Court  also relied upon the decision in United States \nVs. Mueller  to hold that for the purpose of  imposing  levy of \nsales tax lottery tickets comprising  the entitlement to a right \nto participate in a draw will have to be regarded as  goods \nproperly so called.  \n",
        "p_26": "Justice Mukharji (as His Lordship then was) concurred \nwith some hesitation with the decision of Justice Tulzapurkar, \nJ. who delivered the main judgment, particularly with regard \nto the question of transfer of a right by the seller of the lottery \nticket to the purchaser.  This hesitation is more than clearly \nbrought out  in his short judgment where he said:-\n\" I have, however persuaded myself to \nagree with the order proposed by my \nlearned brother because the promoter of \nlottery in the cases involved before us is \nthe State and the grant is in derogation of \nthe rights of the State.  The State in my \nopinion, can create such right for the first \ntime, and such transfer of the right by \nthe state as a promoter would amount to \na transfer of property and being in \nconsideration of a price can be sale of \ngoods.. \n",
        "p_27": "I should, however, not be understood to \naccept the position that if private lotteries \nare permissible and legal, a point which \nneed not be decided in these cases, in \nsuch cases sale of goods was involved or \nnot.\" \n",
        "p_28": "Both learned Judges, however, agreed that the right to \nparticipate in the draw under a lottery ticket was a valuable \nright and that lottery tickets, not as physical articles but as \nslips of paper or memoranda evidencing the right to \nparticipate in the draw can be regarded as dealers \nmerchandise and, therefore goods which are capable of being \nbought or sold in the market.\n",
        "p_29": "        The logical corollary of this was drawn by the Karnataka \nHigh Court in the case of Nirmal Agency v. Commercial Tax \nOfficer 1992 (86) STC 450.  Given the dual nature of the \nrights involved in a lottery as decided by H. Anraj, the High \nCourt said that sales tax could be levied only on that part of \nthe lottery ticket which had been held to amount to a transfer \nof goods.  The Assessing Authority would have to determine \nhow much of the consideration was referable to the right to \nparticipate in the draw and how much to the chance of \nwinning, and thereafter assess  the dealer on the  first part \nalone.\n",
        "p_30": "Vikas Sales Corporation & Anr v. Commissioner of \nCommercial Taxes and Anr.   was a case where the issue \nbefore this Court was whether REP Licenses or replenishment \nlicences were goods so that Sales  tax could be levied on their \ntransfer. The REP licences gave permission to an exporter to \ntake credit for the exports made.  Such credit could be \nadjusted against import duty if and when the exporter wished \nto import goods. The Import and Export Policy, 1993, which \ncontained the relevant provisions relating to REP licences \nspecifically permitted transferability of the licences. This Court \nconsidered the definition of \"goods\" in the Constitution, in the \nSales of Goods Act 1930, the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 the \nTamil Nadu  General Sales Tax Act,  1959, the Karnataka \nSales Tax Act, 1957, as well as the Kerala General Sales Tax \nAct, 1963 and said that all these definitions provided that \ngoods mean inter alia all kinds of moveable property.  The \ndefinition of property in several authorities was thereafter \nconsidered and it was concluded that the material on record \nshowed a uniform emphasis on the expansive manner in \nwhich the expression 'property' was understood.  It was noted \nthat debts, contracts and other choses in action were chattels \nno less than furniture or stock in trade.  Similarly, patents, \ncopyrights and other rights in rem were also included within \nthe meaning of moveable property. The Court rejected the \nargument that REP licences were actionable claims within the \nmeaning of Section 3 of the Transfer of Property Act and said:-\n\"When these licences/scrips are being \nbought and sold freely in the market as \ngoods and when they have a value of \ntheir own unrelated to the goods which \ncan be imported thereunder, it is idle to \ncontend that they are in the nature of \nactionable claims.  Indeed, in H. Anraj \nthe main contention of the petitioners \nwas that a lottery ticket was in the nature \nof an actionable claim.  The said \nargument was rejected after an elaborate \ndiscussion of law on the subject.  We \nagree with the said decision and on that \nbasis hold that  the REP Licences/Exim \nScrips are not in the nature of actionable \nclaims.\" (para 35 pg.449)\n\nRelying on the decision in H. Anraj  and  Vikas Sales \nCorporation  the Delhi High Court in the judgment on which \nthe referral order has been passed, rejected a challenge to the \nconstitutional validity of Section 4(1) (cc) of the Delhi Sales Tax \nAct, 1975 as introduced by the Delhi Sales Tax (Second \nAmendment) Act 1994 with effect from 2.1.1995. The \namendment was challenged by the dealers on various \ngrounds. It was argued inter alia that the sale of lottery tickets \ndid not involve a sale of goods within the meaning of the Sales \nTax Act,  and that even if it did, only that right which was held \nto be a sale namely, the right to participate in the draw could \nbe subject to Sales Tax.  The value  of the right to win the \nlottery prize would have to be segregated. The Delhi High \nCourt rejected the submissions based on its reading of the \ndecision  in H. Anraj and Vikas Sales.\n",
        "p_31": " We are not called upon to decide all the grounds taken \nby the appellants impugning the decision except to the extent \nthat the High Court relied on the two decisions which are \nunder reconsideration before us.  The High Court construed \nthe decision in H. Anraj  and held that it was an authority for \nthe proposition that lottery tickets themselves are goods. It \nwas said:- \n",
        "p_32": "\"A reading of the judgment (in Anraj) in \nits entirety leaves no manner of \ndoubt that the lottery tickets have been \nheld to be merchandise or trading stock \nof the dealer and hence goods properly \nso-called. Undoubtedly, one of the \ncomponents of the lottery tickets  is a \nright to enforce the holding of the draw \nand to claim a prize but that is a right \nrunning along with the lottery tickets.  It \ndoes not detract from the holding that the \nlottery tickets are goods.  Even at the risk \nof repetition we would like to stress that \nin H. Anraj-II their Lordships have held \nthe lottery ticket comprising of two \ncomponents in the process of analyzing \nits juridical concept.  But at more places \nthan one they have clearly said (i) lottery \ntickets are movable property as opposed \nto immovable property, (ii) the \nassumption of lottery tickets being \ncontractual documents cannot militate \nagainst their being goods, (iii) till the \ndraw takes place they are freely marketed \nas goods, and (iv) they must be regarded \nas the dealer's merchandise or stock in \ntrade freely changing hands.  The lottery \ntickets have a value of their own de hors \ntheir components\".  \n",
        "p_33": "Having held that the decision in H. Anraj  decided that \nthe lottery tickets themselves were goods, the High Court \ndiffered with the view expressed by the Karnataka High Court \nin Nirmal Agency v. Commercial Tax Officer (supra) which \nhad proceeded on the basis that H. Anraj  had held that the \ngoods in a sale of lottery tickets comprised of the rights to \nparticipate in the draw and the chance to win.\nBefore us the appellants, who are dealers in the sale of \nlottery tickets, have submitted that H. Anraj wrongly drew a \ndistinction between the right to participate in the draw and \nchance to win the prize.  It was submitted that such \nbifurcation was artificial as both were part of the same \ntransaction. It was submitted that even on the \"two rights\" \ntheory  each of those rights would be choses in action. As far \nas the decision in Vikas Sales  is concerned, it was submitted \nthat the additional reason given namely free transferability for \nholding that a particular thing was goods, was erroneous.  It \nwas pointed out that even actionable claims such as \nnegotiable instruments and debentures may be freely \ntransferable.  As far as the DEPB is concerned, according to \nthe appellants, it was in the nature of a notional credit which \nan exporter acquires on export by way of an entry in a \npassbook. This credit was utilizable by the importer to be \nadjusted against the import duty payable on goods imported. \nThe credit was freely transferable but it could not be said to be \ngoods only by that reason.  At best it was an actionable claim.\nAccording to some appellants, the right to participate in a \ndraw which was held to be a sale of goods by H. Anraj  was \nonly a right to services rendered by the lottery organizers.  \nThere was no transfer of any moveable property in the entire \ntransaction.  It was also submitted that when there were \ndivisible elements in a contract, the predominant element \nwould determine the nature of the right.  As far as lottery \ntickets were concerned, the right to participate in the draw \nwas overwhelmingly dominated by the element of the right to \nclaim the prize by  the prize winner.  It was contended that \nvalue wise the prize money constituted 90% of the total \namount collected from the purchasers whereas the value of \nthe right to participate would be limited to the administrative \nexpenses for holding the draw which accounted for the \nbalance 10% of the monies collected. Several other issues have \nbeen raised on the merits of the decision of the Delhi High \nCourt.  As we have said, those other issues will have to be \nconsidered separately at the time of disposal of the appeals \nafter we have disposed of the subject matter of this reference.\nThe State Governments have not taken consistent \nstands.  As far as the Government of the National Capital \nTerritory of Delhi is concerned, it was submitted that the very \narguments which had been made, considered and rejected in  \nH. Anraj's  case were sought to be reagitated again by the \nappellants.  It was submitted that the reasoning in H. Anraj  \ndid not require reconsideration.  It had held the field for \nseveral decades and had been followed in a number of cases.  \nIt was submitted that a lottery ticket represents a commodity \nwithin the meaning of Article 366 (12).\n",
        "p_34": "The State of Tamil Nadu on the other hand submitted \nthat the lottery ticket itself was a chattel or goods and, \ntherefore, falls squarely within the net of taxation under the \nTamil Nadu Sales Tax Act.  It was submitted that there can be \na value addition to the lottery tickets by valuing all the rights \naccruing to the holder of the ticket, but these additional rights \ndid not detract from the fact that the lottery ticket itself is an \nitem of merchandise and liable to be sold as such.  Reliance \nwas also placed on the General Clauses Act with regard to the \ndefinition of moveable property.  It was contended that since a \nlottery ticket was not immoveable property it was moveable \nproperty and therefore, goods.  \n",
        "p_35": "The State of Maharashtra has addressed us  on the \nquestion whether the sale of a Duty Entitlement Pass Book \n(DEPB) should attract sales tax under the Bombay Sales Tax \nAct, 1959. It was  submitted that considering the valuable \nright conferred by the DEPB, it is an item of movable property \nand therefore 'goods' within the definition of the word in \nSection 2(13) of the Act. The definition in common with other \nState Sales Tax Acts, includes every kind of movable property \nother than actionable claims and money. It was submitted \nthat \"actionable claim\" as defined in Section 3 of the Transfer \nof Property Act, is substantially different from the concept of \n\"chose in action\" in English law and it was submitted that \nwhat is a 'chose in action'  was not necessarily an actionable \nclaim. The reasoning in Vikas Sales (supra) has been relied \non, which it was urged, should be reaffirmed. The other \nappearing States have adopted the arguments made on behalf \nof the NCT, Delhi  and Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra.\n   It is necessary at this stage to clarify that the order of \nreference in Sunrise V. NCT,  Delhi  (supra) is limited to the \nquestion whether lottery tickets are 'goods'.  We have not been \ncalled upon to answer the question whether REP licences (or \nthe DEPB which has replaced the REP licences) are 'goods'.  \nAlthough we have  heard counsel at length on this, having \nregard to the limited nature of the reference, we do not decide \nthe issue.  The decision in Vikas Sales was  referred to only \nbecause it approved the reasoning in Anraj and not because \nthe referring Court disagreed with the conclusion in Vikas \nSales that REP licences were goods for the purposes of levy of \nsales tax.  Indeed REP licences were not the subject matter of \nthe appeal before the referring Court and could not have \nformed part of the reference.  The only question we are called \nupon to answer is whether the decision in H. Anraj that \nlottery tickets are goods for the purposes of Article 366 (29A)(a) \nof the Constitution and the State Sales Tax Laws, was correct.\nThe first dispute which has to be resolved is what H. \nAnraj in fact held.  Did it hold,  as was found by the \nKarnataka High Court in Nirmal Agency Vs. Commercial Tax \nOfficer, that the lottery tickets were goods only because they \nrepresented the right to participate in the draw? Or did it hold, \nas has been found by the Delhi High Court, that the lottery \ntickets themselves were the goods which were sold? The \nconflict is a direct consequence of the somewhat ambiguous \nlanguage used in H. Anraj. \n",
        "p_36": "A:    In paragraph 23 of the report, the Court did say that \nlottery tickets are moveable property and as such would fall \nwithin the expression \"goods\".  However, the Court qualified \nthat statement immediately by saying that the questions \nwhether tickets constituted goods properly so called or are \nslips of paper or memoranda merely evidencing the right to \nclaim a prize by chance and whether these are actionable \nclaims and hence  excluded from the concept of goods, would \nbe considered subsequently in the judgment.  \nB:       In paragraph 27 of the report (which we have quoted \nearlier), the Court categorically stated that a lottery ticket was \ngoods - not as a physical article but as a slip of paper or \nmemorandum evidencing a) the right to participate in the draw \nand b) the right to claim a prize contingent upon the \npurchaser being successful in the draw. This is reiterated in \nparagraph 29 of the report. It was also stated that for the \npurpose of imposing the levy of sales tax, lottery tickets \ncomprising the entitlement to a right to participate  in a draw \nwould have to be regarded as goods properly so called.  \nC:\tIn the same paragraph the Court said what is transferred \nto the purchaser is the right to participate in the draw.  That is \nthe 'goods' which was a chose in possession.  The same right \nhas been later described as the beneficial interest in movable \nproperty, that is to say that the right was not the movable \nproperty itself.\n",
        "p_37": "D:      Then again in paragraph 30 it was said:-\n\"30. It is true that this entitlement to a \nright to participate in the draw is an \nentitlement to beneficial interest which is \nof incorporeal or intangible nature but \nthat cannot prevent it from being \nregarded as goods\".\n",
        "p_38": "This again indicates that it is the right to participate  in \nthe draw which was being described as the goods. Otherwise it \nwas not necessary to refer to other incorporeal rights which \nhad been judicially recognized as goods for the purposes of \nlevying sales tax such as copyrights or intangible rights such \nas electricity.\n",
        "p_39": "  Ultimately, however, clarity in the matter is brought \nabout by the concurring judgment of Justice Sabyasachi \nMukharji (as his Lordship then was), when he said:-\n\"I, however, agree with my learned \nbrother that the right to participate in the \ndraw under a lottery ticket remains a \nvaluable right till the draw takes place \nand it is for this reason that licensed \nagents or wholesalers or dealers of such \ntickets are enabled to effect sales thereof \ntill the draw actually takes place and \ntherefore lottery tickets, not as physical \narticles but as slips of paper or \nmemoranda evidencing the right to \nparticipate in the draw can be regarded \nas dealer's merchandise and therefore \ngoods which are capable of being brought \nor sold in the market\".\n",
        "p_40": "\tIn other words, the second conclusion which we have \nindicated against 'B', was the ratio. The lottery ticket was held \nto be merely evidence of the right to participate in the draw \nand therefore goods  the transfer of which was a sale.  To the \nextent that the lottery ticket evidenced the right to claim the \nprize, it was not goods but an actionable claim and therefore \nnot 'goods' under the Sales Tax Laws. A transfer of it was \nconsequently not a sale.  The lottery ticket per se had no \ninnate value. The interpretation by the Delhi High Court of the \nratio in H. Anraj was in our opinion erroneous.\n\t  Interestingly, some of the States, in particular the State \nof Tamil Nadu have expressly jettisoned the reasoning in H. \nAnraj  and have asserted that the ticket itself is the subject \nmatter of sale which is assessable to Sales tax. The \nsubmission is unacceptable.\n",
        "p_41": "         The word 'goods' for the purposes of imposition of sales \ntax  has been uniformly defined in the various sales tax laws \nas meaning all kinds of moveable property.  The word \n\"property\" may denote the nature of the interest in goods and \nwhen used in this sense means title or ownership in a thing. \nThe word may also be used to describe the thing itself. The two \nconcepts are distinct, a distinction which must be kept in \nmind when considering the use of the word in connection with \nthe sale of goods. In the Dictionary of Commercial law by A.H. \nHudson (1983 Edn.) the difference is clearly brought out.  The \ndefinition reads thus:\n",
        "p_42": "\t\" 'Property' -In commercial law this may carry its \nordinary meaning of the subject-matter of ownership. But \nelsewhere, as in the sale of goods it may be used as a synonym \nfor ownership and lesser rights in goods\". Hence, when used in \nthe definition of 'goods' in the different sales tax statutes, the \nword 'property' means the subject matter  of ownership.  The \nsame word in the context of a 'sale' means the transfer of the \nownership in goods. \n",
        "p_43": "We have noted earlier that all the statutory definitions of \nthe word 'goods' in the State Sales Tax Laws have uniformly \nexcluded, inter alia, actionable claims from the definition for \nthe purposes of the Act.  Were actionable claims etc., not \notherwise includible in the definition of 'goods' there was no \nneed for excluding them. In other words, actionable claims are \n'goods' but not for the purposes of the Sales Tax Acts and but \nfor this statutory exclusion, an actionable claim would be \n'goods' or the subject matter of ownership. Consequently an \nactionable claim is movable property and 'goods' in the wider \nsense of the term but a sale of an actionable claim would not \nbe subject to the sales tax laws. \n",
        "p_44": "Distinct elements are deducible from the definition of \n'actionable claim' in Section 3 of the Transfer of Property Act. \nAn actionable claim is of course as its nomenclature suggests, \nonly a claim.  A claim might connote a demand, but in the \ncontext of the definition it is a right, albeit an incorporeal one. \nEvery claim is not an actionable claim. It must be a claim \neither to a debt or to a beneficial interest in movable property.  \nThe beneficial interest is not the movable property itself, and \nmay be existent, accruing, conditional or contingent.  The \nmovable property in which such beneficial interest is claimed, \nmust not be in the possession of the claimant. An actionable \nclaim is therefore an incorporeal right. That goods for the \npurposes of Sales Tax may be intangible and incorporeal has \nbeen held in Tata Consultancy Services Vs. State of Andhra \nPradesh (2005) 1 SCC 308.\n",
        "p_45": "What then is the distinction between actionable claims \nand other goods on the sale of which sales tax may be levied?\t\nThe Court in Vikas Sales  (supra) said \"when these \nlicenses/scrips are being bought and sold freely in the market \nas goods and when they have a value of their own unrelated to \nthe goods which can be imported thereunder, it is idle to \ncontend that they are in the nature of actionable claims\". It \nwas  assumed  that   actionable  claims    are  not transferable  \nfor  value  and  that   that   was   the   difference between   \n'actionable   claims'  and     those   other    goods which   are    \ncovered    by    the     definition     of     'goods'   in   the  Sale   \nof   Goods   Act,   1930 and the Sales Tax Laws. The \nassumption was fallacious and the conclusion in so far as it \nwas based on this erroneous perception, equally wrong.\n The Transfer of Property Act 1882, deals with transfer of \nactionable claims in Chapter VIII of that Act. Section 130 of \nthe Transfer of Property Act provides that an actionable claim \nmay be assigned for value. A right on the fulfillment of certain \nconditions to call for  delivery of goods mentioned in a contract \nis an actionable claim and assignable under Section 130. (See \nJaffer Meher Ali Vs. Budge-Budge Jute Mills Co.(1906) 33 \nCal.702). There may also be assignments of an actionable \nclaim dehors Section 130 (See Bharat Nidhi Ltd. Vs. \nTakhatmat (1969) 1 SCR 595).  Negotiable Instruments, \nanother species  of actionable claim, are transferable under \nthe Negotiable Instruments Act 1881. Transferability is \ntherefore not the point of distinction between actionable \nclaims and other goods which can be sold. The distinction lies \nin the definition of actionable claim. Therefore if a claim to the \nbeneficial interest in movable property not in the vendee's \npossession is transferred, it is not a sale of goods for the \npurposes of the sales tax laws.\n",
        "p_46": "An actionable claim would include a right to recover \ninsurance money or a partner's right to sue for an account of a \ndissolved partnership or the right to claim the benefit of a \ncontract not coupled with any liability (see Union of India V. \nSarada Mills (1972) 2 SCC 877, 880).  A claim for arrears of \nrent has also been held to be an actionable claim (State of \nBihar V. Maharajadhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh 1952 SCR \n889, 910). A right to the credit in a provident fund account \nhas also been held to an actionable claim ( Official Trustee, \nBengal v. L. Chippendale, AIR 1944 (Cal.) 335; Bhupati \nMohan Das v. Phanindra Chandra Chakravarty & Anr. AIR \n1935 (Cal.) 756). In our opinion a sale of a lottery ticket also \namounts to the transfer of an actionable claim.\n",
        "p_47": "\t   A  lottery ticket has no value in itself.  It is a mere piece \nof paper. Its value lies in the fact that it represents a chance or \na right to a conditional benefit of winning a prize of a greater \nvalue than the consideration paid for the transfer of that \nchance.  It is nothing more than a token or evidence of this \nright.  The Court in H.Anraj,  as we have seen, held  that a \nlottery ticket is a slip of paper or memoranda evidencing the \ntransfer of certain rights.  We  agree.  \n",
        "p_48": "     Webster's Words and Phrases Permanent Edition, Vol. \n25-A Supplement defines a 'ticket' as \" a printed card or a \npiece of paper that gives a person a specific right, as to attend \na theatre, ride on a train, claim or purchase, etc.\" The Madras \nHigh Court in  Sesha Ayyar  vs. Krishna Ayyar AIR 1936 \nMad. 225  also held \"tickets of course are only the tokens of \nthe chance purchased, and it is the purchase of this chance \nwhich is the essence of a lottery\".  \n",
        "p_49": "The sale of a ticket  does not necessarily involve the sale \nof goods.  For example the purchase of a railway ticket gives \nthe right to a person to travel by railway. It is nothing other \nthan a contract of carriage.  The actual ticket is merely \nevidence of the right to travel. A contract is not property, but \nonly a promise supported by consideration, upon breach of \nwhich either a claim for specific performance or damages \nwould lie (Said v. Butt 1920 3 KB 497).  Like railway tickets, \na ticket to see a cinema or a pawn brokers ticket are \nmemoranda or  contracts between the vendors of the ticket \nand the purchasers. Cases on whether  the terms specified on \nsuch tickets bind the purchaser are legion.  It is sufficient for \nour purposes to note that tickets are themselves, normally \nevidence of and in some cases the contract between the buyer \nof the ticket and its seller.  Therefore a  lottery ticket can be \nheld to be goods if at all only because it evidences the transfer \nof a right.  \n",
        "p_50": "\tThe question is, what is this right which the ticket \nrepresents?  There can be no doubt that on purchasing a \nlottery ticket, the purchaser would have a claim to a \nconditional interest in the prize money which is not in the \npurchaser's possession. The right would fall  squarely within \nthe definition of an actionable claim and would therefore be \nexcluded from the definition of 'goods' under the Sale of Goods \nAct and the Sales Tax statutes.  This was also accepted in \nH.Anraj  when the Court said that to the extent that the sale \nof a lottery ticket involved a transfer of the right to claim a \nprize depending on chance, it was an assignment of an \nactionable claim. Significantly in B.R. Enterprises V. State of \nU.P.and Ors. (1999) 2 SCC 700 construing H.Anraj  the \nCourt said \n\"52. \tSo, we find three ingredients in the \nsale of lottery tickets, namely, (i) prize, (ii) \nchance, and (iii) consideration. So, when \none purchases a lottery ticket, he \npurchases for a prize, which is by chance \nand the consideration is the price of the \nticket\".\n",
        "p_51": "           The further distinction sought to be drawn in \nH.Anraj between the chance to win and the right to participate \nin the draw was in our opinion unwarranted.  A lottery having \nbeen held to be in essence a chance for a prize, the sale of a \nlottery ticket can only be a sale of that chance.  There is no \nother element. Every right can be sub-divided into lesser \nrights.   When these lesser rights culminate in a legally \nrecognizable right, it is the latter which defines the right. The \nright to participate in the draw is a part of the composite right \nof the chance to win and it does not feature separately in the \ndefinition of the word \"lottery\".  It is an implicit part of the \nchance to win. It is not a different right.  The separation is \nspecious since neither of the rights can stand without the \nother.  A draw without a chance to win is meaningless and one \ncannot claim a prize without participating in the draw.  In fact \nthe transfer of the chance to win assumes participation in the \ndraw. The Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, in West \nVirginia in State of West Virginia vs. John Wassick 156 \nW.Va.128, 191 S.E.2d 283,  held that \"free plays\" which \ncould be won predominantly by chance for consideration by \noperating multiple coin pinball machines for cash payoffs was \na prize and the pinball machine constituted the lottery.  This \nindicates that a draw is merely a method of holding the lottery \njust as a pinball machine may be a method of holding the \nlottery and does not constitute a separate right.\nThere is no value in the mere right to participate in the \ndraw and the purchaser does not pay for the right to \nparticipate. The consideration is paid for the chance to win.  \nThere is therefore no distinction between the two rights. The \nright to participate being an inseparable part of the chance to \nwin is therefore part of an actionable claim.\n\tThe authorities considered by the Court in H.Anraj do \nnot support the sub division of the chance to win into a \nfurther distinct right to participate .  The Court sought to draw \nthe distinction between the chance to win and the right to \nparticipate by describing the former as a right 'in futuro' and \nthe latter as \"in praesenti\". Both the rights are in fact 'in \nfuturo'.   In any event the distinction is immaterial to the \nquestion as to whether the subject matter of the transfer is an \nactionable claim, since an actionable claim may be existent, \naccruing, conditional or contingent. \n",
        "p_52": "\tEven if the right to participate is assumed to be a \nseparate right, there is no sale of goods within the meaning of \nsales tax statutes when that right is transferred.  When H. \nAnraj  said that the right to participate was a beneficial \ninterest in moveable property, it did not define what that \nmoveable property was. The draw could not and was not \nsuggested to be the moveable property.  The only object of the \nright to participate would be to win the prize. The transfer of \nthe right would thus be of a beneficial interest in movable \nproperty not in possession. By this reasoning also a right to \nparticipate in a lottery is an actionable claim.\n",
        "p_53": "         We may with profit compare the views of other countries \nhaving similar systems of law as our own as to whether the \nsale of a lottery ticket is a sale of goods or an actionable claim.  \nThe High Court of Australia had held in Van Rassel v. Kroon \n[1953] HCA 3: (1953)87 CLR 298 (4 March 1953):\n\"The person in whose name the \nlottery ticket issues obtains the legal \ntitle to what is a chose in action\".\n",
        "p_54": "           In Jones Vs. Carter  8 Q.B. 134 a lottery was held \nregarding the outcome of a horse race.  The subscribers paid a \nsum of money and then drew lots. On each lot was written the \nname of a horse.  If  that horse won, the subscriber  with the \nname of that winning horse got a prize.  The original \nsubscriber sold his ticket to Jones. The horse named on that \nticket won the race.  When Jones approached the organizers of \nthe race for payment, they refused  to pay.  Jones filed a suit \nfor recovery of the money. His suit was dismissed on the \nground that there was no privity between the organizers of the \nrace and Jones.  The court also held :-\n",
        "p_55": "\"Though there may have been a valid \nassignment, it was of a chose in action; \n",
        "p_56": "and the law does not permit the party \ninterested to sue on such a transfer.\"\n",
        "p_57": "\tThe views expressed correctly represent the law in this \ncountry as well. \n",
        "p_58": "         We are therefore of the view that the decision in H. Anraj \nincorrectly held that a sale of a lottery ticket involved a sale of \ngoods.  There was no sale of goods within the meaning of Sales \nTax Acts of the different States but at the highest a transfer of \nan actionable claim. The decision to the extent that it held \notherwise is accordingly overruled though prospectively with \neffect from the date of this judgment.\n",
        "p_59": "     We accordingly answer the question referred to us as \nindicated  above.  Let  the   matters  be   placed     before    an \nappropriate Bench for disposal of the several appeals on \nmerits in the light of this judgment. \n"

The trade mark\nCUTLER-HAMMER is not being used by plaintiffs in India; abandoned by\nplaintiffs and, therefore, no goodwill/reputation vests in the said marks in\nfavour of plaintiffs. The trade mark CUTLER-HAMMER is associated in\nIndia with defendant and its products/business.\n",
        "p_35": "      The trade mark              (CH being the abbreviation of CUTLER-\nHAMMER) is registered under No.582999 in Class 9 in the name of\ndefendant since the year 1992.        Therefore, the plaintiffs have failed to\nestablish even prima facie case of infringement of trademarks.\n",
        "p_36": " 32.   The second submission of Mr.Sethi is that the plaintiffs have also\nfailed to make out any case of passing off as the plaintiffs are not using the\n\n\nmarks CUTLER-HAMMER,                      ,     ,     ,          and/or variants\nthereof in relation to their business/products in India. No products of\nplaintiffs bearing any of the aforesaid trademarks are available for sale in\nIndia. The aforesaid marks have been abandoned by plaintiffs. In fact, no\nproducts bearing the said marks have been produced/filed in the Court.\nThere is no goodwill/reputation vested in favour of plaintiffs in the said\nmarks.\n",
        "p_37": "said products and are distinctive of its products/business by virtue of\ncontinuous and extensive use for several decades. There is no evidence of\nconfusion and deception placed by the plaintiffs on record. There is no\nlikelihood of confusion/deception as plaintiffs\u201f products bearing the said\nmarks are not available in India. Therefore, no damage would be caused to\nplaintiffs on account of use of the said marks by defendant. On the contrary,\ndefendant will suffer irreparable loss, damage and injury, if plaintiffs\ncommence use of the said marks in India. Rather the plaintiffs have\nabandoned their trademarks in India who themselves have allowed removal\nof their following trade marks in India and other countries as admitted by the\nplaintiffs in their rejoinder due to non-payment of their renewal fee and have\nnot taken any steps for restoration. The details are as under:\n",
        "p_38": "      (Hereinafter the abovementioned logos or variant thereof would\n      be referred as \"CH\" logo, and logo of CUTLER-HAMMER as\n      \"CUTLER-HAMMER\")\n\n",
        "p_39": "33.   Despite having incorporated a subsidiary in India i.e. plaintiff No.2 as\nfar back as in the year 1996, plaintiff No.1 has not used the said marks in\nrespect of its products/business and neither raised any objection against\ndefendant\u201fs activities in India. Plaintiffs\u201f products available in India do not\ndepict/bear the trade marks \u201eCUTLER-HAMMER\u201f or \u201eCH\u201f or variants\nthereof. Products purchased by defendant on 22nd, December, 2011 which\ndoes not show use of the said marks. The invoice raised in respect of the\nsaid products also does- not show use of the marks. Plaintiffs have filed few\npurchase orders of 2009, 2010 and 2011 however, the same do not show any\nactual sale of the products in India under the mark CUTLER-HAMMER.\nFurther, plaintiffs have relied on a catalogue of 2001 pertaining to Canada to\ncorrelate the product codes. No document has been placed on record by the\n\n\n\nCS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012                           Page 13 of 72\n plaintiffs establishing use of the marks in question post 1986, thereby\nconfirming that plaintiff No.1 lost interest/rights in the marks CUTLER-\nHAMMER, CH post 1986 and have commenced use only recently so as to\nride on the goodwill and reputation vesting in the defendant\u201fs marks.\n",
        "p_40": "34.   The sales figures provided by plaintiffs for the years 2008-2011 in\nrespect of their products are vague, misleading, unsubstantiated and scanty\ninasmuch as the same are neither indicative of sales in India nor discloses\nuse of these trademarks. The sales figures of Rs.35 lac, which at any rate are\nvague, unsubstainated and denied, provided by plaintiffs towards sale of\nproducts in the year 2008 bearing the marks in question are no match to the\nsales generated by defendant in the year 2008 i.e. `1,94,82,68,813/-.\n",
        "p_41": "35.   No document including promotional materials/advertisements has\nbeen placed on record by the plaintiffs establishing use of the marks in\nquestion post 1986. The Caution Notice published by the plaintiffs on\n19th December, 2011 in the daily, \u201eThe Times of India\u201f was confined to the\ntrade mark CUTLER-HAMMER and there was no whisper of the marks CH\nand/or variants thereof.\n",
        "p_42": "36.   Nothing on record to show that the Registered User Agreement dated\n19th February, 1979 was recorded with the Trade Marks Registry as per\nSection 48 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958, thus, it does not\nlie in the mouth of the plaintiffs to say that \u201euse\u201f would accrue to the\nplaintiffs for the period 1979-1986.\n",
        "p_43": "37.   It is also argued by Mr.Sethi that the present action of the plaintiffs\nsuffers from long delay, laches, acquiesces and waiver on the part of\nplaintiffs. Therefore, the plaintiffs are entitled for the discretionary relief of\ninjunction.\n",
        "p_44": "         It is admitted by the defendants that after the expiry of the\nRegistered User Agreement in 1986, defendant continued to use, inter alia,\nthe trademarks BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER, CUTLER-HAMMER, CH\nwith the full knowledge, consent and encouragement of Plaintiff No.1 by\nway of addressing letters by the plaintiffs themselves and various meetings\nand discussions between the parties at least for the last 25 years.\n",
        "p_45": "38.     Certain following illustrative instances have been given by the\ndefendant in order to show the knowledge of the plaintiffs about the\ncontinuous user of trademarks in question:\n",
        "p_46": "i)      Plaintiffs have admitted to the fact that the letters exchanged between\nPlaintiff No.1 and Defendant reflected Defendant\u201fs use of the trade marks\nBHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER, CUTLER-HAMMER, CH on the letter\nhead.\n",
        "p_47": "ii)     Plaintiff No.1 had entered into Sales Agreements on 13th July, 1988\nand 4th September, 1990 with defendant\u201fs affiliate viz. Bhartia International\nPrivate Limited (which later merged into defendant); License and Technical\nService Agreements dated 10th April, 1990 and 11th December, 1992 with\ndefendant and Export Agreement dated March 16, 1994 between plaintiff\nNo.1 and defendant.\n",

The letters\naddressed by defendant clearly reflected use of the trade marks BHARTIA\nCUTLER-HAMMER, CUTLER-HAMMER, CH on the letterhead.

The plaintiffs\u201f oppositions to\nthe various applications for registration filed by the defendant are pending.\nThe main case of the defendant is that after breaking relation between the\nparties, the defendant has been using the same very trademarks for the last\n25 years within the knowledge of the plaintiffs. The defendant has acquired\nunique and independent goodwill and reputation of trademarks in India and\nabroad. The plaintiffs on the other hand abandoned their trademarks as\nsome of trademarks are not renewed. The plaintiffs have not been using the\ntrademarks in India and other parts of the world.

Rose & Thistle & Anr., AIR\n1994 Calcutta 43 took the view that where an application for removal of\nregistered trade mark was filed for non-user of the same for a long period,\nthe defense of import ban as special circumstance for the said non-user\ncannot be granted when other similar product was manufactured and freely\nsold during that period in spite of the import restriction. Hence the onus has\nnot been discharged by the registered proprietor of trade mark for excusing\nhim from non-user during the prescribed period, preceding the application\nfor removal of registered mark. The existence of special circumstance must\naffect the trade as a whole and the onus of establishing that the case comes\nwithin the ambit of Section 46(3) lies on the registered proprietor of the\ntrade mark. It may be shown that the non-user was due to special\ncircumstance of the trade only and not by reason of some other cause which\n\n\n\nCS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012                         Page 63 of 72\n would have otherwise been inoperative even in the absence of the special\ncircumstances. If the non-user was, in fact, by reason of some other factors\napart from the special circumstances, question of a defense under\nSection 46(3) being made available to the proprietor of the mark does not\nand cannot arise. A specific case shall have to be made and proved with\nnecessary documentary evidence that the non-user was the direct effect of\nthe existence of the special circumstances. The special circumstances cannot\nbe taken note of as a defense if the non-user is by reason of a voluntary act.\nThis view taken by Calcutta High Court might have helped the proceedings\nunder Section 46 of the Act. But here in this case due to special kind of\nrelationship between the respondents No.1 and 2 and between respondent\nNo.2 and the appellant in the trade and there being no intention to abandon\nor not to use the trade mark in relation to the goods to which the registration\nof the trade mark related, the appellant even for that purpose is not entitled\nto claim removal from register of the trade mark the device and word\n\"Synthes\" on the ground of alleged non-user. In the present case, the\nquestion of abandonment has to be judged in the peculiar set of facts. Here\nthe plaintiff/respondent No.1 is one who is not indulging in any trading\nactivities not only in India but also outside India. The plaintiff/respondent\nNo.2 does not have any registration as registered user of the trade marks in\nIndia. It is not the case here where the trade mark has not been got renewed\nby plaintiff/respondent No.1. It is different thing to look at the situation from\nthe point of view of trafficking in trade marks. But in the face of renewal of\nthe trade mark and allowing the plaintiff/respondent No.2 to use the same\nexclusively and further tacitly allowing the appellant to use it, it is difficult\nrather not possible to say that the trade mark in this case has been\nabandoned.\"\n",

In the light of this statement, the consideration in the present case stands confines to the contention of the plaintiff that the use of the trademark, superstar and star is violative of the plaintiff's rights for its trademark Moonstar and device of moonstar and star.\n",
        "p_19": "For these reasons, the prayer of the plaintiff so far as the label is concerned, stands satisfied. However, the plaintiff's grievance with regard to use of the word 'star' as part of the defendant's trademark and display of the device 'star' remains and has to be adjudicated in the light of the law. \n",
        "p_20": "13. In a case of infringement of trademark, the plaintiff may establish that the plaintiff's trademark is identical with or so nearly resembles the plaintiff's work either visually or phonetically or otherwise, that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion in relation to the case in respect of which the plaintiff got his mark registered. The requirement that the plaintiff has to satisfy in order to make out a case of infringement of its mark by the defendant and in a passing of action have been succinctly laid down by the Division Bench of this Court in its pronouncement reported at 2nd 1973 1 Page 2019 Delhi 393 Atlas Cycle Industries Ltd. v. Hind Cycles Limited wherein the court held thus:\n",
        "p_21": " Therefore, the aforesaid requirement in (b) may be made out by the plaintiff by showing that the defendant's mark is identical with or so nearly resembles the plaintiff's mark either visually, phonetically or otherwise that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion in relation to the goods in respect of which the plaintiff got his mark registered. In other words, if the essential features of the trade mark of the plaintiff have been adopted by the defendant,t he fact that there are some additional features in the defendant's mark which show marked differences is immaterial in an action for infringement. An action for passing off, on the other hand, is in substance an action in common law for actual or probable passing of by the defendant of his own goods a those of the plaintiff. In such an action, the use by the defendant of the trade mark of the plaintiff as such is not essential. The plaintiff has only to show that the similarity of the defendant's mark or goods is such that the defendant can pass off his goods as those of the plaintiff. The defendant may escape liability in an action for passing off if he can show that his mark or goods, besides the essential features which are sufficient to distinguish the same from that of the plaintiff. Thus, while in an action for infringement of a registered trade mark the plaintiff has to establish either an use of his registered trade mark as such or of an identical mark or of a deceptively similar mark by the defendant, he has to establish in an action for passing off that the defendant's mark or goods are such that the defendant can pass off his goods as those of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_22": "14. It is equally well settled that what has to be seen is not that there is not a possibility of confusion but that the resemblance is such that there is a reasonable probability of deception. So far as the judgment on this test is concerned, in AIR 1943 Lahore 196 Modi Sugar Mills Limited v. Tata Oil Mills Ltd., the Privy Council approving the test laid down by Niamat Ullah J. in Thomas Bear and Sons (India) Ltd. v. Pravag Narain  observed that \"in the judging of the probability of deception, the test is not whether the ignorant the thoughtless, or the incautious purchaser is likely to be misled, but we have to consider the average purchaser buying with ordinary caution.\" \n",
        "p_23": "15. The principle in this behalf was further elucidated by the Division Bench of this Court in the Atlas Cycle Industries case (supra). Placing reliance on James Chadwick and Bros. Ltd. v. The National Sewing Thread Co. Ltd. , Chagla CJ and Bhagwati; referring to the words \"likely to deceive or cause confusion\" in Section 10 of the Trade Marks Act, 1940, observed at page 152 as follows:\n",
        "p_24": " Now in deciding whether a particular trade mark is likely to deceive or cause confusion, it is not sufficient merely to compare it with the trade Page 2020 mark which is already registered and whose proprietor is offering opposition to the registration of the former trade mark. What is important is to find out what is the distinguishing or essential feature of the trade mark already registered and what is the main feature of the main idea underlying that trade mark, and if it is found that the trade mark whose registration is sought contains the same distinguishing or essential feature or conveys the same idea, then ordinarily the Registrar would be right if he came to the conclusion that the trade mark should not be registered. The real question is as to how a purchaser who must be looked upon as an average man of ordinary intelligence, would react to a particular trademark, what association he would form by looking at the trademark, and in what respect he would connect the trade mark with the goods which he would be purchasing. It is impossible to accept that a man looking at a trade mark would take in every single feature of the trademark. The question would be, what would he normally retain in his mind after looking at the trade mark? What would be the salient feature of the trade mark which in future would lead him to associate the particular goods with that trademark?\n",
        "p_25": "The court had thereafter culled out the principles which would apply as hereunder:\n",
        "p_26": " In an action for an alleged infringement of a registered trade mark, it has first to be seen whether the impugned mark of the defendant is identical with the registered mark of the plaintiff. If the mark is found to be identical, no further question arises, and it has to be held that there was infringement. If the mark of the defendant is not identical, it has to be seen whether the mark of the defendant is deceptively similar in the sense that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion in relation to goods in respect of which the plaintiff got his mark registered. For that purpose, the two marks have to be compared, \"not by placing them side by side, but by asking itself whether having due regard to relevant surrounding circumstances, the defendant's mark as used is similar to the plaintiff's mark as it would be remembered by persons possessed of an average memory with its usual imperfections\", and it has then to be determined whether the defendant's mark is likely to deceive or cause confusion. for such determination, the distinguishing or essential features (and not every detail) of the two marks and the main idea, if any, underlying the two marks which a purchaser of average intelligence and imperfect memory would retain in his mind after seeing the marks, have to be noticed. It has then to be seen whether they are broadly the same or there is an overall similarity or resemblance, and whether the resemblance or similarity is such that there is a reasonable probability of deception or confusion. In doing so, the approach has to be from the point of view of purchaser of average intelligence and imperfect memory or recollection, and not an ignorant, thoughtless and incautious purchaser. In an action for passing off, the test for deceptive similarity, i.e. as to the likelihood of confusion or deception arising from similarity of the marks of the get up, packing Page 2021 etc. is practically the same as in an action for infringement (vide Edwards v. Dennis (1885) 30 Ch.D 454 471(9) Lambert and Butler Ltd. v. Goodbody (1902) 19 R.P.C. 377, 383(10) Addley Bourne v. Swan and Edgar Ltd; (1903) R.P.C.105, 117(11) and Tavener Rut Ledge Ltd. v. Specters Ltd. (1959) R.P.C. 355, 360(12), except that it has also to be seen whether the defendant's mark or the get up, packing, etc. of his goods has besides the essential features of the plaintiff's mark or goods, any additional features which distinguish it from the plaintiff mark or goods, and whether it is likely of reasonably probable that the defendant can pass off his goods as those of the plaintiff to a purchaser of average intelligence and imperfect memory or recollection.\n",
        "p_27": "16. Yet another pronouncement which would have bearing on the issues raised was reported at  Amritdhara Pharmacy v. Satya Deo Gupta. In this case, the question raised was whether the trade name \"Lakshmandhara\" was likely to deceive the public or cause confusion to trade in view of the trade name \"Amritdhara\" which had already been registered as a trade name. The Supreme Court referring to the earlier decision in Corn Products Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food Products Ltd; , held that the overall similarity of the two composite words must be considered, that the question has to be approached from the point of view of a man of average intelligence and imperfect recollection, and that to such a man the overall structural and phonetic similarity of the two names \"Amritdhara\" and \"Lakshmandhara\" was likely to deceive or cause confusion. In the Armitdhara case supra, the court has held thus:\n",
        "p_28": " As we said in Corn Products Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food Products Ltd.  the question has to be approached from the point of view of a man of average intelligence and imperfect recollection. To such a man the overall structural and phonetic similarity of the two names \"Amritdhara\" and \"Lakshmandhara\" is, in our opinion, likely to deceive or cause confusion. We must consider the overall similarity of the two composite words \"Amritdhara\" and \"Lakshmandhara\". We do not think that the learned Judges of the High Court were right in saying that no Indian would mistake one for the other. An unwary purchaser of average intelligence and imperfect recollection would not, as the High Court supposed, slot the name into its component parts and consider the etymological meaning thereof or even consider the meaning of the composite words as 'current of nectar' or 'current of Lakshman'. He would go more by the overall structural and phonetic similarity and the nature of the medicine he has previously purchased, or has been told about, or about which has otherwise learnt and which he wants to purchase.... We are aware that the admission of a mark is not to be refused, because usually stupid people, \"fools or idiots\", may be deceived. A critical comparison of the two names may disclose some points of the two names may disclose some points of difference but an unwary purchaser of average intelligence and imperfect recollection would be deceived by the overall similarity of the two names Page 2022 having regard to the nature of the medicine he is looking for with a somewhat vague recollection that he had purchased a similar medicine on a previous occasion with a similar name.\n",
        "p_29": "17. The principles laid down by the Division Bench in  K.R. Chinna Krishna Chettiar v. Sri Ambal and Co. and Anr. are also topical and instructive in this behalf. The plaintiff had urged that the trademark 'Sri Andal' being adopted by the defendant was deceptively similar to the trademark 'Sri Ambal' of the plaintiff and an injunction was prayed for. It was held by the court that there was striking similarity and affinity of sound between the words 'Andal' and 'Ambal'. The court held that though there was no visual resemblance between the two marks but ocular comparison is not always the decisive test. The resemblance between the two marks must be considered with reference to the ear as well as eye. The name Andal does not cease to be deceptively similar because it is used in conjunction with a pictorial device. The court placed reliance on the observations of the court in De Cordova v. Vick Chemical Coy 68 RPC 103, in which M/s Vick Chemical Coy were the proprietors of the registered trademark consisting of the word 'Vaporub' and another registered trademark consisting of a design of which the words 'Vick Vaporub Salve' formed a part. The defendants had advertised their ointment as 'Karsote Vapour Rub'. It was held that the defendants had infringed the registered marks. In this case, Lord Radcliffe said \"...a mark is infringed by another trader if, even without using the whole of it upon or in connection with his goods, he uses one or more of its essential features. \n",
        "p_30": "The court considered the realities of the fact that even though 'Sri Andal' and 'Sri Ambal' were two divinities and that the pictorial devices on the goods of the respondent were different, however, the fact that the customers of the plaintiff were persons of religious denominations other than Hindus whose business was not confined to South of India where the people may know the difference between the two divinities could not be lost track of. The trademarks had no direct reference to the character and quality of snuff and consequently, the customers would have a recollection of only the essential features. The court was therefore persuaded to grant an injunction in favor of the plaintiff against the use of the trademark by the defendant. \n",
        "p_31": "18. In a Division Bench pronouncement of the Madras High Court reported at 2006 (32) PTC 434 (Madras) (DB) Devi Pesticides Pvt. Ltd. v. Shiv Agro Chemicals Industries, claiming exclusive proprietorship over the trademark BOOMPLUS and BOOM FLOWER, an injunction was prayed for by the plaintiff against the defendant who was selling its goods by use of the trademark SUPERBOOM. The defendant's trademark SUPERBOOM was an unregistered mark. It was also noticed that phonetic similarity would constitute trademark infringement and that the users of the products of the parties being illiterate farmers and the common man, it was held that an ordinary average person would not be able to make out the difference Page 2023 between the plaintiff's goods and the defendant's goods. Placing reliance on Section 29(5) of the Trademark Act, it was held that the statutory provisions make it clear that even if a part of the registered trademark is used by the defendant, it would amount to infringement. In this case, BOOM was an essential part of the registered trademark of the plaintiff which was incorporated in the defendant's trademark. \n",
        "p_32": "19. The courts have also protected rights of a trader who is claiming proprietary rights over numeral trademarks. In 2003 (27) PTC 63 (Delhi) Shaw Wallace & Co. Ltd. and Anr. v. Superior Industries Ltd., the plaintiff had urged that the defendant's trademark 'HAYWARDS 5000' was an illegal infringement of its registered trademark 'HAYAWARDS 5000 SUPER STRONG BEER'. It was primarily urged that the use of the numeral 5000 by the defendant was with the intention of cashing in on the reputation of the plaintiff acquired in the business which it was conducting under its registered trademark of which 5000 was an essential part. Reiterating the test laid down in the judicial pronouncements afore-noticed, apart from regard being had to the relevant surroundings, the consensus in order to assess as to whether the defendant's mark is similar to the plaintiff, the court had emphasised the imperfect memory of an average consumer. In this behalf, it was urged that in an action for infringement, for the success by the plaintiff, he need not prove that the whole of his registered trademark has been copied. He can also succeed, if, he shows that the mark used by the defendant is similar to the mark of the plaintiff as it would be remembered by persons possessed of an average memory with its usual imperfection or that its essential particulars or the distinguishing or essential feature has been copies. Placing reliance on the earlier pronouncement of this Court reported at 2nd 197 (II) Delhi 225 Jagan Nath Prem Nath v. Bhartiya Dhoop Karvalaya, it was held that a person may have right of trademark in a numeral as well. \n",
        "p_33": "20. To the same effect was the pronouncement rendered by the learned single Judge in AIR 1987 Delhi 312 Vrajlal Manilal and Co. v. N.S. Bidi Co. and Anr. In this behalf, I may also usefully advert to the provisions of Section 2(1)(J) wherein the word 'Mark' has been defined to include numeral or any combination thereof.\n",
        "p_34": "21. Learned Counsel for the plaintiff has placed strong reliance on the judicial pronouncement in 1997 PTC 17 134 William Grant and Sons Ltd. v. Mc. Dowell and Co. Ltd.;  Parle Products P. Ltd. v. J.P. and Co., Mysore in support of the submission that the label of the defendant had incorporated all essential features of the plaintiff's label deliberately and dishonestly with the intention of bringing similarity between the products of the plaintiff and defendant so as to confuse the purchasers and the consumers. \n",
        "p_35": "Page 2024\n \n\n",
        "p_36": "22. Learned Counsel for the plaintiff has also placed reliance on the pronouncement of the learned single Judge in  Glaxo Operations UK Ltd. v. Samrat Pharaceuticals, wherein the plaintiff had claimed copyright over its cartons and proprietary rights in the registered trademark Glucose-D and urged that the action of the defendant has infringed the rights of the plaintiff therein.\n",
        "p_37": "Objection to the grant of interim protection was inter alia urged on ground of delay and that the carton of the defendant was also registered as an artistic work under the Copyright Act. It is well settled that copyright exists whether registration is done or not and that registration is merely a piece of evidence as to when the author started copyright in some artistic work or some other work. Further, the court negated the objection of the defendant on the ground that the plaintiff was not entitled to injunction against the defendant on grounds of delay.\n",
        "p_38": "23. Mr. S.K. Bansal, learned Counsel for the plaintiff has placed reliance on the pronouncement of the Apex Court reported at 2004 (28) PTC 121 (SC) Midas Hygiene Industries P. Ltd. and Anr. v. Sudhir Bhatia and Ors., wherein the court has held that delay in bringing the suit shall not defeat an action for infringement of a registered trademark.\n",
        "p_39": "24. So far as the plea of the defendant based on bonafide concurrent user is concerned, in Metro Playing Card Co. v. Wazir Chand Kapoor , it was held by the court that even in a case where the defendant was able to get a registration for a concurrent user but till the date of registration of the trademark, there can be no doubt that the plaintiff's trademark is infringed by the defendant and thereby the plaintiff's statutory rights under Section 28 of the Act are violated. Consequently, so long as the registration of the plaintiff's trademark subsists, it is not open to the defendant to violate the same.\n",
        "p_40": "25. Again in 1996 PTC (16) DB (Delhi) Hitachi Ltd. v. Ajay Kr. Agarwal and Ors., the Division Bench of this Court has held that the courts cannot allow a trader to use a trademark which bears a close or deceptive similarity, affinity and proximity in sound/looks with the trademarks belonging to others, whether by prior use or prior registration, in order to maintain purity and morality in trade and to protect the unaware customers from being misled in buying the product which he did not intend to buy. An infringer or plagiarist of a trademark cannot be allowed to thrive on somebody else's reputation and goodwill. \n",
        "p_41": "26. Before this Court also, an objection has been taken by the defendant that the defendant has been bona fide using the trademark `SUPERSTAR' since 1st April, 1988. I find that the defendant has not disclosed the date on which it adopted the trademark `SUPERSTAR' or commenced its use. The Page 2025 defendant gives no reason as to why the defendant found it necessary to adopt this trademark or device. It has also not disclosed the date on which the label which has been complained of by the plaintiff was created. Not a single document is on record in th is behalf. There is no evidence of any publicity having been undertaken and no advertisements are also forthcoming on record. The few bills and invoices placed by the defendant on record do not disclose the trade of any goods under the offending trademark. Some of the documents do advert to the product `henna' but there is nothing to inducate that this henna was being traded under the trademark `SUPERSTAR'. There is no evidence of concurrent use even let alone the prior use of the trademark adopted by the defendant.\n",
        "p_42": "27. In the facts which have been placed before this Court, I find that there is no evidence of such use as is claimed by the defendant of the trademark complained of. For this reason, the pronouncement reported at  Uniply Industries Ltd. v. Unicon Plywood Pvt. Ltd. and Ors. has no bearing on this matter.\n",
        "p_43": "28. This plank of the defendant's objection is based on the statutory provisions of Sections 12 and 127 of the Trademarks Act, placing reliance on  Rubber Co. Ltd. v. Durex Products (Incorporated) and Anr. and  Gopal Hossiery v. The Dy. Registrar of Trademarks and Ors., it is urged that the Registrar is empowered to register more than one trademark if the same are being concurrently used. \n",
        "p_44": "29. Concurrent use has to be established by documents which may include bills, invoices, transportation and sales proofs etc. Use includes physical and non-physical use. Advertisements and other promotional activities and materials relating to a trade mark are covered under non-physical use. (Ref: Hardie Trading Ltd. v. Addisons Paint and Chemicals Ltd. ). \n",
        "p_45": "30. The defendant has placed reliance on an application made for registration of its trademark. Copy of this document which has been placed on record shows that the application has been filed only on 2nd December, 2005. As discussed hereinabove, there is no evidence placed before this Court of concurrent use, let alone prior use of trademark, in any form by the defendant. In any case, the trademark of the defendant has not been registered till date. The pendency of the application for registration would thus have no bearing on the infringement of the plaintiff's trademark by the defendant.\n",
        "p_46": "This contention of the defendant thus deserves to be rejected. \n",
        "p_47": "31. Mr. A.K. Singla, learned senior counsel for the defendant has also urged that the application of the defendant seeking registration of the trademark Page 2026 is pending before the Registrar and for this reason, this adjudication has to await and abide consideration of such application by the prescribed forum under the competent statute. Placing reliance on the pronouncement of the court reported at  Maddada Chayanna v. Karnam Narayana;  State Electricity Board and Anr. v. Ashwani Kumar; and 1999 (1) SCC 156 State of Mizoram v. Biakchhawna, it has been urged that the present suit ought not to be proceeded with, and the Registrar of Trademarks is the appropriate and competent authority to deal with the matter. In my view, this objection is wholly misconceived.\n",
        "p_48": "32. So long as the plaintiff has registered trademarks, it is legally entitled to seek interim relief against the defendant for infringement thereof under the statute. The plaintiff has placed copies of its trademark registration which prima facie established its legal right to protection of the infringement on the part of the defendant. This issue has in any case been considered in the judicial pronouncements reported at 1996 (16) PTC 262 (DB) (Del) Hitachi Ltd. v. Ajay Kr. Agarwal and Ors. The defendant has no legal right whatsoever in the trademark which may be identical or deceptively similar to a registered trademark till such time it gets registration in accordance with law.\n",
        "p_49": "33. In the instant case, there can be no doubt that the trademark `MOONSTAR' adopted by the defendant is not descriptive of the goods for which it is being used. Both the words `Moon' or `Star' have also no association with the products. They also do not describe the nature or character of the products of the plaintiff in any manner. The plaintiff's registration of this trademark and its device of a star in the lap of the moon remains valid and binding and has not been objected to or revoked by the Registrar of Trademarks. The plaintiff has also prima facie established its extensive trade and reputation in its business under such trademark. The trademark and the device as also the plaintiff's label stands registered thereby conferring enforceable rights on the plaintiff by the present action urging infringement. The word and device of star are certainly essential and distinctive part of the trademark and of the label of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_50": "34. Even in the Atlas Cycle Industries Ltd. case (supra), the plaintiff had alleged that the trademark 'ROYAL STAR' of the defendant No. 1 was an infringement of his registered trademark 'EASTERN STAR'. It was submitted by the defendant in this case, that the plaintiff having admitted the words 'EASTERN STAR' as its trademark, he should not be allowed to make a contrary allegation that it was entitled to the use of the word 'STAR' which was only a part of the registered name, and the name did not consist of any Page 2027 particular part but consisted of the combination of two words 'EASTERN' and 'STAR'. The court stated that the proper approach in deciding the question is to consider the overall and phonetic similarity of the two names 'EASTERN STAR' and 'ROYAL STAR'. The court further stated that the meaning of neither word, whether 'EASTERN' or 'STAR' has any relation at all to cycles, and are thus not descriptive or suggestive of the goods i.e. cycles and therefore, the most important thing that has to be noticed is that both names, when uttered end in the same sound. Therefore, a person of average intelligence and imperfect memory would logically remember only the sound of the ending word 'STAR' and is therefore likely to be deceived or confused between the two names or marks. Therefore, the court held that since the two marks have an overall structural and phonetic similarity and considering their use in respect of the same kinds of goods i.e. cycles, the use of the defendant's trademark is likely to cause deception or confusion as discussed under Section 29 of the Trade and Merchandise Act, 1958. \n",
        "p_51": "35. In the instant case, there is no dispute that the trademark adopted by the defendant is not registered. Therefore, the use of the mark (r) i.e. placing R on its label has been urged to be tainted with dishonesty.\n",
        "p_52": "There is force in this submission inasmuch as by printing this device as part of its trademark, the defendant has attempted to dishonestly create an impression that its trademark was registered. The device is placed at an place identical to where it is placed in the label of the plaintiff which has been urged as infringement of its registered trademark by the defendant.\n",
        "p_53": "Certainly, there is strength to the contention of the plaintiff that these acts of the defendant are tainted with dishonesty and mala fide and intended to cause deception and confusion in the minds of the purchasing public.\n",
        "p_54": "36. The pronouncement reported at  Novartis AG v. Wanbury Ltd. and Anr. therefore would have no application to the instant case.\n",
        "p_55": "37. In the light of the principles laid down in Atlas Cycle Industries Ltd. v. Hind Cycles Industries Ltd. 2nd (1973) I Delhi 393; K.R. Chinna Krishna Chettiar v. Sri Ambal And Co. and Anr.  Devi Pesticides Pvt. Ltd. v. Shiv Agro Chemicals Industries; and the statutory provisions of Section 29(5) of the Trademarks Act, 1999, the plaintiff has a legal right to object to the infringement of even a part of its trademark which is undoubtedly distinctive. \n",
        "p_56": "38. Prima facie, it would appear that the defendant has fraudulently copied an essential part of trademark of the plaintiff when it has used 'STAR' as part of its trademark. It has also dishonestly copied an essential and integral part of the device of the plaintiff when it uses the device of star for Page 2028 its products. From the documents placed on record and the averments made, it is evident that the plaintiff has proprietary rights over the same by virtue of prior user of the trademark since 1917 and registration of its trademark since 1943 and the defendant has not been able to establish any such use. The registration of the plaintiff effected on 5th July, 1943 relates to the product hair dyes and even the device of moon and star also stands registered in its name. There is no force in the defendant's objection that the plaintiff does not hold registration of the trademark or copyright with regard to the label which is the subject matter of the suit.\n",
        "p_57": "39. Placing reliance on the pronouncement reported at AIR 1998 Delhi 114 Mahant Purshottam Dass v. Harnarayan and  Sarjiwan Singh v. Delhi Vidyut Board, it has been urged that the plaintiff has not sought any declaration for labels which are similar to that of the plaintiff and consequently, no injunction could be granted. \n",
        "p_58": "40. The arguments deserve to be noticed only for the sake of rejection. The plaintiff in the instant case is basing its rights on its registered trademark and has urged that the defendant has infringed the same. The plaintiff has based its entitlement to injunction on detailed averments to this effect in its pleadings. In such a case, the findings relating to the acts of the infringement on the part of the defendant in so trading are inherent in the very nature of the lis and consequently, no separate declaration is required to be sought.\n",
        "p_59": "In any case, the legal rights of the plaintiff are based on its registered trademark and are statutorily recognised thereby. There is no declaration of status or title as envisaged under the Specific Relief Act, 1963 is required to be sought. For these reasons, this objection is devoid of substance. \n",
        "p_60": "41. In the light of the well settled principles of law and the above discussion, I find that the plaintiff has prima facie established a case of infringement of its registered trademark by the defendant. The trademark adopted by the defendant contains an essential part of the plaintiff's trademark as also of the device by which the plaintiff is trading.\n",
        "p_61": "42. I also find that the defendant is trading in the same goods as that of the plaintiff and the infringing trademark is being used for the sale of the very goods which are being sold by the plaintiff. The plaintiff has prima facie also established reputation and goodwill in its business under such trademark which would undoubtedly suffer irreparable loss and damage if the defendant is not restrained from continuing with its offending acts. The balance of convenience, interest of justice and equity lie in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant. The purchasing public would consist of literate, semi-literate and even illiterate people who by virtue of the adoption of the word 'Star' as aprt of its trademark by the defendant as also the device star would be persuaded to believe that the product of the defendant is associated with that of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_62": "For all the foregoing reasons, I am of the view that the present application deserved to be allowed.\n",
        "p_63": "Page 2029\n \n\nAccordingly, the defendants, proprietors, promoters, retailers, their agents, partners, servants, assigns, representatives, successors, distributors and all others acting for and on their behalf are hereby restrained from using the plaintiff's trademark 'MOONSTAR' or any part thereof for manufacturing, selling, offering for sale, advertising or displaying directly or indirectly or dealing in any other manner for its products or business. The defendants, proprietors, promoters, retailers, their agents, partners, servants, assigns, representatives, successors, distributors and all others acting for and on their behalf are also hereby restrained from using the device of star in the lap of the moon or any portion thereof for its products or business. The defendants are also restrained from using any other trademark or device identical or deceptively similar to that of the plaintiff amounting to infringement of plaintiff's registered trademark; or violating the plaintiff's common law rights in the trademark. \n",

It  may  be  noted  that  the\tword\n'includes' was\tintroduced by an amendment to sub-clause (b)\nAct 18\tof 1923 instead of the word \"means\". In the Criminal\nProcedure Code\t1974 the word 'means' has been introduced in\nthe place  of 'includes'. To some extent the use of the word\n'includes'  may\t widen\tthe  scope  of\tthe  definition.  In\nHalsbury's Laws\t of England, third edition, volume 9 at page\n342, the  meaning of  court is\tgiven. At  page\t 343  it  is\nstated: \"many  bodies are  not courts, although they have to\ndecide questions,  and in so doing have to act judicially in\nthe sense  that\t the  proceedings  must\t be  conducted\twith\nfairness and  impartiality\".

        "p_29": " In Abhinandan  Jha &  Ors. v.  Dinesh Mishra this Court\nhas pointed  out the  difference between  the report  by the\npolice filed  under Section  170 of  the Criminal  Procedure\nCode which  is referred\t to as\ta charge-sheet\tand a report\nsent  under   Section  169  which  is  termed  variously  in\ndifferent States as either 'referred charge', 'final report'\nor\n728\nsummary. This  court observed that when the police submitted\na report  that no  case has  been made\tout for\t sending  up\naccused for trial it is not open to the Magistrate to direct\nthe  police   officer  to   file  a   chargesheet.  In\tsuch\ncircumstances the  Magistrate is not powerless as it is open\nto him\tto take\t cognizance of\tan  offence  on\t the  report\nsubmitted by  the Police  under\t Section  190(1)(c)  of\t the\nCriminal Procedure  Code. Dealing  with the  position of the\nMagistrate when\t a report is submitted by the police that no\ncase is\t made out  for sending\ta case\tfor trial  the court\nobserved that it is open to the magistrate to agree with the\nreport and close the proceedings. Equally it will be open to\nthe  Magistrate\t if  he\t takes\ta  different  view  to\tgive\ndirections to  the  police  under  Section  163(1)  to\tmake\nfurther investigations.\t After receiving  a report  from the\npolice on  further investigation  if the Magistrate forms an\nopinion on  the fact  that it  constitutes an offence he may\ntake cognizance\t of an\toffence\t under\tSection\t 190(1)\t (c)\nnotwithstanding the opinion of the police expressed in final\nreport. This court held in conclusion that there is no power\nexpressly or impliedly conferred on the Magistrate under the\nCode to\t call upon  the police to submit a charge-sheet when\nthey have  sent a  report under Section 169 of the Code that\nthere is  no case  made out  for sending the case for trial.\nThe same  view is  expressed in the decision in Kamla Prasad\nSingh v.  Hari Nath Singh and another. In R. N. Chatterji v.\nHavildar Kuer  Singh, A.  N. Ray J. as he then was, followed\nthe decision  in Abhinandan  Jha &  Ors.  v.  Dinesh  Mishra\n(supra)\t and  held  that  the  provisions  of  the  Criminal\nProcedure Code\tdo not\tempower the Magistrate to direct the\npolice officer\tto submit a charge-sheet but if he is of the\nopinion that  the repot\t submitted by  the  police  requires\nfurther\t  investigation,    the\t  Magistrate\tmay    order\ninvestigation, under  Section 163  of the Criminal Procedure\nCode. It was held that directing further enquiry is entirely\ndifferent from\tasking police  to submit a charge-sheet. The\nonly source  open for  the Magistrate if he is not satisfied\nwith  the  police  report  under  Section  169\tis  to\ttake\ncognizance of  an offence  under Section  190(1) (c)  of the\nCriminal Procedure Code. It may be noted that in M. L. Sethi\nv. R.  P. Kapur\t & Anr.,  it was held that if the Magistrate\ndisagrees with\tthe opinion  of the police he may proceed to\ntake cognizance\t on the\t facts stated  in the  police  under\nSection 190(1) (b).\n",
        "p_30": "     It is  clear that when a Magistrate applies his mind to\nthe contents  of a  complaint before  him for the purpose of\nproceeding under Section\n729\n200 and the other provisions of the Code following it, he is\ntaking cognizance of an offence as held by five judges Bench\ndecision of  this  Court  in  Mowu  v.\tThe  Superintendent,\nSpecial\t Jail,\tNowgong,  Assam\t and  Others.  The  position\nregarding the  case in\twhich Magistrate  accepts  a  report\nunder Section  169 Criminal  Procedure Code is different. On\nan analysis  of the  various sections,\tit  appears  that  a\nreport under Section 169 of the Cr. P. C. and the magistrate\nagreeing with  it, are\tproceedings under  Chapter XIV which\nrelates to  information to  the police\tand their  power  to\ninvestigate. The  Chapter provides  for supervision  by\t the\nMagistrates of\tthe investigation by the police. It has been\nlaid down that Magistrate has no option except to agree with\nthe report  of the Police Officer unless he proceeds to take\ncognizance of  the offence  under Section 190(1) (c). Though\nthe Magistrate\tin deciding  whether to accept the report or\nnot may\t be exercising\this judicial mind, it cannot be said\nthat he\t is acting as a court. The Magistrate acting at this\nstage cannot  be said  to fulfil  the positive\trequirements\nenumerated by  Venkatarama Ayyar,  J. in Shri Virinder Kumar\nSatvawadi v.  The State\t of Punjab (supra). To be classified\nas court  it must  be charged with a duty to decide disputes\nin a  judicial manner and declare the rights of parties in a\ndefinitive judgment  and to  decide in a judicial manner. It\ninvolves that  the parties are entitled as a matter of right\nto be heard in support of their claim and to adduce evidence\nin proof  of it\t and  an  obligation  on  the  part  of\t the\nauthority to  decide the  matter on  a consideration  of the\nevidence adduced  and in accordance with law. As pointed out\nby Lord Sankey in Shell Co. case (supra) though there may be\nsome of\t the trappings\tof the\tcourt the magistrate at this\nstage cannot  be termed\t as a court within the provisions of\nSection 195(2)\tCr. P.\tC. The\tmagistrate  may\t decide\t the\nquestion finally  which may  affect parties  but that is not\nenough. Even  when a  tribunal bears  witnesses on  oath and\ndecides rights of parties and a right of appeal is provided,\nit may not, as observed by Lord Sankey, become a court. Most\nof requirements\t of a  court are lacking when the Magistrate\nagrees with  the report\t of the police officer under Section\n",
        "p_31": "169. At this stage the rights of the parties are not finally\ndecided as  the complainant  is entitled to file a complaint\ndirectly to  the Magistrate.  The persons  accused  are\t not\nbefore the  Magistrate and  neither the\t complainant nor the\naccused are  entitled to  be heard  or\tto  adduce  evidence\nbefore the  Magistrate at this stage. It cannot be said that\nthe Magistrate\thas  a\tduty  to  decide  the  matter  on  a\nconsideration of the evidence adduced before him.\n",
        "p_32": "     Taking  into   account  the   scheme  of  the  Criminal\nProcedure Code,\t the function  of the Magistrate in agreeing\nwith a\treport under  Section 169  can only be said to be in\nthe course  of investigation  by the  police. In Chapter XIV\nwhich relates  to information to the police and their powers\nto investigate,\t the Magistrate having jurisdiction over the\narea and  empowered to\ttake  cognizance  is  given  certain\nsupervisory powers.  Thus the  Police  Officer\tincharge  of\nPolice Station\tis required  to refer  the informant  to the\nMagistrate when\t information as\t to a non-cognizable offence\nis received by him. The Police Officer shall not investigate\na non-cognizable  case without\tthe orders of the Magistrate\nthough the  Police Officer  is\tentitled  to  investigate  a\ncognizable offence  without the order of the Magistrate. The\nMagistrate  under  Section  190\t is  entitled  to  order  an\ninvestigation into  a cognizable  offence. Section  157\t Cr.\nP.C. requires  the officer incharge of the Police Station to\nsend a report to the Magistrate empowered to take cognizance\nof the\toffence of  which he has received information. Under\nSection 159 Crl.P.C. the Magistrate receiving a report under\nSection 157 may proceed or depute any magistrate subordinate\nto him\tto proceed  to hold  a preliminary  inquiry into the\ncase. Section  164 empowers  Presidency\t Magistrate  or\t any\nMagistrate of  first-class or any Magistrate of second class\nspecially empowered  by the  State Government  to  record  a\nstatement or  confession made  to him  in the  course of  an\ninvestigation under this Chapter. When a search is conducted\nby a  Police Officer,  he is  required to send copies of the\nrecord\tto   the  nearest   Magistrate\tempowered   to\ttake\ncognizance. Section  167 of  the Crl.P.C. requires that when\ninvestigation cannot  be completed  within 24 hours and when\nthere are  grounds  of\tbelieving  that\t the  accusation  or\ninformation is\twell-founded, the  Officer incharge  of\t the\nPolice Station\tshall transmit to the nearest Magistrate the\ncopy of\t the entries  in the  diary relating to the case and\nforward the  accused to\t such Magistrate.  The Magistrate to\nwhom the  accused is forwarded is empowered to authorise the\ndetention of  the accused  in such  custody as he thinks fit\nfor a term not exceeding 15 days. If the period is to exceed\n15 days\t he is\trequired  to  forward  the  accused  to\t the\nMagistrate having  jurisdiction. When  an  investigation  is\ncompleted and when the Police Officer is of the opinion that\nthere is  sufficient evidence,\the shall forward the accused\nto the Magistrate along with his report. The final report of\nthe Police  Officer is to be submitted under Section 173. It\nmay be\tnoticed that Section 169 does not require the Police\nOfficer to send a report as he is required under Section 170\nwhen he\t is of\tthe opinion  that  there  is  no  sufficient\nevidence or  reasonable ground\tof suspicion  to justify the\nforwarding of  the  accused  to\t the  Magistrate.  The\tonly\nprecaution he  has to  take is\tto take\t steps to ensure the\nappearance of\n731\nthe accused in the event of the Magistrate empowered to take\ncognizance wants  his presence.\t A perusal  of\tthe  various\nSections under\tChapter XIV  shows that\t the  Magistrate  is\nassociated  with  the  investigation  by  the  Police  in  a\nsupervisory capacity.  It has  been laid  down that when the\nMagistrate applies  his mind  for ordering  an investigation\nunder Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C. or for issue of a search\nwarrant for  the purpose of investigation, he cannot be said\nto have\t taken cognizance  of the  offence.  The  Magistrate\nduring\tthis   stage  functions\t  as  a\t  Magistrate  during\ninvestigation. As the trial has yet to commence it cannot be\nsaid that he is acting as a court.\n",
        "p_33": "     Before leaving this aspect of the case I would refer to\nsome of\t the decisions\twhich were  cited before  us on this\npoint. Strong reliance was placed by the learned counsel for\nthe appellant  on a  decision in  J. D.\t Boywalla  v.  Sorab\nRustomji Engineer.  Boywalla, the  appellant  in  the  case,\nlodged a  complaint with  the police  against the respondent\nSorab Rustomji\tEngineer for  cheating in  respect of  three\nrupees. The  police after  investigation submitted  a report\nstating that  no offence has been disclosed against him with\na request  that he  may be  discharged\tand  his  bail\tbond\ncancelled.  On\t receipt  of   the  report   the  Magistrate\ndischarged the\taccused and  cancelled the  bail bond. Sorab\nRustomji Engineer,  against whom  the complaint\t was  filed,\nfiled a\t case under  Section 211 of the I.P.C. alleging that\nthe  appellant\t Boywalla  instituted  criminal\t proceedings\nagainst him  knowing that  there is no just or lawful ground\nfor such proceedings. The appellant contended that it is the\nMagistrate that\t can lodge a complaint under Section 195 (b)\nof the\tCr.P.C. and  that no  court shall take cognizance of\nthe offence  punishable under Section 211 of the I.P.C. when\nsuch offence  is alleged  to have  been committed  in or  in\nrelation to  any proceeding to a court except on a complaint\nin writing  of such  court. John Beaumont Chief Justice held\nthat in\t doing what  he had  done the  Magistrate had  taken\ncognizance of  the case\t and therefore\tunder Section 195(b)\nCr.P.C. it  was the  Magistrate\t alone\twho  could  lodge  a\ncomplaint. Two\treasons were given by the Chief Justice. The\nsecond ground  with which  we are  concerned at\t the  moment\ndeals as  to the  capacity in which Magistrate acted when he\naccepted the  police report under Section 169 and discharged\nthe  accused.\tThe  Chief   Justice  expressed\t that  after\nconsidering the\t report if  the Magistrate thinks that there\nis no  sufficient ground  of proceeding he may discharge the\naccused and though the Code does not expressly provide there\ncan be\tno doubt  that when  the Magistrate can act upon the\nreport of the\n732\npolice officer\tand  discharge\tan  accused  person  without\nfurther inquiry\t only by  acting in  his  judicial  capacity\nwhich should  be open  to review  by  the  High\t Court.\t The\nlearned Chief  Justice proceeded  on the basis that before a\nmagistrate passed  orders on  the report of the police under\nSection 169  he should\ttake cognizance\t of the offence. The\nChief Justice  thus took  the view  that (1)  the Magistrate\nbefore discharging  the accused\t in pursuance  of  a  police\nreport under  Section 169  takes cognizance  and (2) acts in\nhis judicial  capacity. While  there could  be no doubt that\nthe magistrate\tis acting  judicially, I  am unable  to hold\nthat before a magistrate discharges an accused agreeing with\nthe report  of the  police under  Section 169  Cr. P.C.,  he\ntakes cognizance.  This Court  has held\t that the  stage  of\nlaking cognizance  arises only\twhen he\t acts under  Section\n190(1) (b).  Further this  Court has  taken the view that if\nthe magistrate\tdoes not  agree with  a police\treport under\nSection 169  Cr.P.C., he  can  only  proceed  under  Section\n190(1)(c). The\tfacts of  the  case  were  the\taccused\t was\narrested and  later after  the order  of discharge  the bail\nbond was  cancelled. The  circumstances of the arrest of the\naccused his  being released on bail during investigation and\nhis discharge  after the  police report were the reasons for\nthe learned  Chief Justice coming to the conclusion that the\nMagistrate was\tacting in  a judicial  capacity. The learned\nJudge observed\t\"indeed it  is a  novelty to  me to  hear it\nsuggested that\tthere is  any authority\t which can  make  an\nadministrative order  discharging the  arrested person\tfrom\njudicial capacity\".  But as  he has  pointed out acting in a\njudicial capacity  alone is not enough. The Supreme Court in\nM. L.  Sethi's case  (supra) expressed\tits dissent from the\nview taken  in Ghulam  Rasul v.\t Emperor where\tthe  learned\nJudge held  that a  complaint by criminal court is necessary\nwhen a\tfalse report  is made  in an  investigation  by\t the\npolice. The  facts of  the case are that Ghulam Rasul made a\nreport to  the police  that a certain person stole his watch\nfrom his  car. On  investigation  the  police  came  to\t the\nconclusion that\t the report was false and that the watch had\nbeen  removed  by  the\tpetitioner  himself.  The  case\t was\nreported to the Magistrate for cancellation. A complaint was\ngiven against  Ghulam Rasul  for offence  under Sections 193\nand 211\t I.P.C.\t and  the  Magistrate  took  cognizance\t and\nrecorded the  evidence\tof  the\t prosecution  witnesses\t and\nframed charge  against\thim.  Accepting\t the  contention  on\nbehalf of  Ghulam Rasul\t the High Court held that in view of\nsection\t  195(1)   (b),\t  Criminal   Procedure\t Code,\t the\nMagistrate's taking  cognizance of  the offence was illegal.\nThe Court  observed: \"I am clear that the words in this sub-\nsection 'in  relation to  any proceeding in any court' apply\nto this case of a false report or a false\n733\nstatement made\tin an  investigation by\t the police with the\nintention that\tthere shall  in consequence  of this,  be  a\ntrial in  the Criminal\tCourt\". The  facts of  the case show\nthat a report under Section 169, Criminal Procedure Code was\nsubmitted by  the police for cancellation and the Magistrate\ndropped further\t proceedings. The Supreme Court referring to\nthe view  of the  High Court  observed: \"He  appears to have\nheld the  view that the Magistrate having passed an order of\ncancellation, it  was necessary that the complaint should be\nfiled by  the  Magistrate,  because  section  195(1)(b)\t had\nbecome inapplicable.  If the  learned Judge  intended to say\nthat without any proceeding being taken by the Magistrate in\nthe case  which was  investigated by the police it was still\nessential that a complaint should be filed by the Magistrate\nsimply because\ta subsequent proceeding following the police\ninvestigation was contemplated we consider that his decision\ncannot be accepted as correct\". This decision makes it clear\nthat  even   though  the   Magistrate  passed  an  order  of\ncancellation on\t the report  by the police under section 169\nif the\tMagistrate has not taken any proceeding, a complaint\nby the\tMagistrate is  not necessary.  The decision  of\t the\nSupreme Court covers the facts of the present case so far as\nthe discharge  of the  accused\ton  a  police  report  under\nsection\t 169,\tCriminal  Procedure   Code,  is\t  concerned.\nReferring to the Bombay decision, the Supreme Court observed\nthat \"the  decision of\tthe  Bombay  High  Court  in  J.  D.\nRoywalla  v.   Sorab  Rustomji\t Engineer  (supra)  is\talso\ninapplicable because in that case also orders were passed by\na Magistrate  on the  final report  made by the police after\ninvestigation of  the facts  in the  report, in\t respect  of\nwhich complaint\t under section\t211 I.P.C.  was\t filed\".  In\nSethi's case  (supra) at  the stage  when the  complaint was\nfiled by the respondent under Section 211 I.P.C., the police\nwere enquiring into the appellant's report. When there is no\nproceeding pending  before any\tcourt at  the time  when the\napplicability of  section 195(1)  (b) is to be determined, a\ncomplaint by  the court\t is not\t necessary. The\t decision in\nBombay case  is therefore  not applicable  to the  facts  in\nSethi's case as in the Bombay case orders were passed by the\nmagistrate on the final report of the police.\n",
        "p_34": "     There is  a conflict  between various High Courts as to\nwhether a  complaint is\t necessary when\t on a  police report\nunder Section  169 the\tMagistrate does not take any further\naction. The  Bombay,  Saurashtra  and  Andhra  Pradesh\tHigh\nCourts in 1946 Bombay 7(11), 1952 Saurashtra 67(68) and 1969\nA.P. 281  (287) have held that a Magistrate passing an order\non a  final report of police under Section 173 referring the\ncase as\t false should  be deemed  to be\t a Court  passing  a\njudicial order\tdisposing of  the information to the police,\nand\n734\nthat in\t such a\t case, the  complaint of  the Magistrate  is\nnecessary for the prosecution of the informant under Section\n211 of\tthe I.P.C.  The Madras,\t Calcutta and Allahabad High\nCourts in  A.I.R. 1934 Madras 175, A.I.R. 1948 Allahabad 184\nFull Bench and A.I.R. 1916 Calcutta 593 following 1921 Patna\n302 and\t 1917 Calcutta 593 have held the other view. For the\nreasons\t already   stated  I   hold  that  when\t no  further\nproceedings are\t taken by  the Magistrate  on receipt  of  a\npolice report under Section 169 there is no proceeding in or\nin relation to any court and, therefore, no complaint by the\ncourt is necessary.\n",
        "p_35": "     The next  question which  arises in  this case  is that\nwhether a complaint by the court is necessary because of the\narrest and  release on\tbail of\t the accused  Satya  Narayan\nPathak\tin   consequence  of  the  complaint  given  by\t the\nappellant.  The\t  police  after\t taking\t cognizance  of\t the\ncomplaint by  Kamlapati Trivedi, the appellant in this case,\ntook cognizance\t under Sections\t 147, 448  and\t379  I.P.C.,\nregistered a  case and\tissued a  warrant of  arrest against\nSatya Narayan  Pathak and  five others. They all surrendered\nin court  on 6-5-1970 and were released on bail on a bond of\nRs. 200/-  each. They  attended court on 21-5-1970 and 21-7-\n1970 when  the police  report was  expected to be filed. The\nHigh Court  found that\tthere was a police investigation and\nduring investigation Satya Narayan Pathak surrendered before\nthe Magistrate who released him on bail and police submitted\na final\t report and  the Magistrate  discharged him from his\nbail bond.  On this  evidence the  High Court  came  to\t the\nconclusion that\t the proceedings  before the  court become a\ncriminal proceeding only when the court takes cognizance and\nnot before.  On these  facts the question arises whether the\nproceedings when the accused were released on bail and later\nafter the  receipt of  the report  from the police they were\ndischarged, would  be in  or in\t relation to a court. It was\nsubmitted that\twhen in pursuance of a complaint the accused\nwas  arrested\tand  remand   and  bail\t  proceedings\twere\nsubsequently taken  before a  Magistrate in  connection with\nthe report to the police, they were proceedings in court and\na complaint  by the  court was\tnecessary. In support of the\nproposition a decision in Badri v. State was relied upon. In\nthat case  the Allahabad  High Court  held that\t an  offence\nunder section  211, Indian  Penal Code, alleged to have been\ncommitted by  the appellant by making a false report against\nthe complainant\t and others to the police, was an offence in\nrelation to  the remand proceedings and the bail proceedings\nbecause those  proceedings were\t a direct consequence of the\nmaking\tof   the  report  and  the  subsequent\tarrest\tand,\ntherefore, the case is governed by section 195(1)(b) of Code\nof\n735\nCriminal  Procedure.  The  Supreme  Court  in  Sethi's\tcase\n(supra) at page 538 did not consider it necessary to express\nany opinion  whether remand  and bail proceedings before the\nMagistrate can\tbe held to be proceedings in a court nor did\nthey consider  the question  whether the  charge of making a\nfalse report  could be\trightly held  to be  in relation  to\nthese proceedings.  The position, therefore, is the question\nwhether remand and bail proceedings before the Magistrate in\npursuance of information given to the police of a cognizable\noffence are proceedings in or in relation to a court is left\nopen.\n",
        "p_36": "     To determine whether the remand or bail proceedings are\nproceedings in\ta court\t it is\tuseful\tto  refer  again  to\nChapter XIV  of the  Criminal Procedure Code. On a complaint\nby an  informant relating  to a\t commission of\ta cognizable\noffence the investigation starts. The information may not be\nagainst\t any   person.\tWhen   an  investigation  cannot  be\ncompleted in  24 hours\tafter the  arrest of the accused and\nwhen the  officer is  of the view that there are grounds for\nbelieving that the accusation or information is well-founded\nthe  officer   is  required   to  transmit  to\tthe  nearest\nMagistrate a copy of the entries in the diary and to forward\nthe accused  to the Magistrate. When the accused is produced\nthe Magistrate\tis required  to act  under Section 167(2) of\nthe Criminal  Procedure Code.  The Magistrate  to  whom\t the\naccused\t is   produced\tcan  from  time\t to  time  authorise\ndetention of  accused in  such custody\tas  such  Magistrate\nthinks fit  for a term not exceeding 15 days in whole. If he\nhas not\t the jurisdiction  to try  the case or commit it for\ntrial but  considers further  detention is necessary, he may\norder the  accused to  be forwarded  to a  Magistrate having\njurisdiction. We  have seen  that in  investigation  by\t the\npolice\tthe   Magistrate  is  associated  in  a\t supervisory\ncapacity. The action taken by the Magistrate cannot be taken\nto be  that of\ta  court  for  the  Magistrate\twho  has  no\njurisdiction to\t try the  case has a limited power. Even the\nMagistrate who\thas jurisdiction  to try  the  accused\twhen\nacting under  the Section  is not  acting as a court for the\nwords used are the Magistrate having jurisdiction. The trial\ncommences only\tafter the  offence has been taken cognizance\nof.  The   proceedings\tunder\tSection\t  167,\t is   during\ninvestigation. But it has to be noted that when the bail and\nremand proceedings  are before the Magistrate, he has to act\njudicially. If\tthe accused  applies for bail the Magistrate\nhas to act judicially and take into account the facts of the\ncase before  he decides\t to release  the accused  on bail or\nrefuse bail.  Chapter XXXIII  Cr. P.  C.  deals\t with  bail.\nSection 496  provides as  to when  bail may be taken of non-\nbailable offences.  The provisions  of Sections\t 496 and 497\nspeak of  an accused  person in\t custody charged with a non-\nbailable offence\n736\nbeing produced before court at any stage of the proceedings.\nThe Section  deals with the exercise of the power of a court\nat any\tstage of  proceedings when  the accused\t is  brought\nbefore a  court while  in the custody of the police officer.\nAccording to  the wording  of Section,\tthe bail proceedings\nwould be  before a court even though the accused is produced\nwhile in  custody of  a police officer. Even though the word\n'court' is used in Sections 496 and 497, we have to consider\nwhether proceedings  can be  said to be taken before a court\nas defined  in Section\t195(2) of  Cr. P. C. In deciding the\nquestion we  have to  bear in  mind the\t restricted  meaning\ngiven to  the word  in the  observations of  Lord Sankey  in\nShell Company's case reported in Shell Co. of Australia Ltd.\nv. Federal  Commissioner of  Taxation (supra)  and the tests\nlaid down  by Venkatarama  Ayyar, J.  in Shri Virinder Kumar\nSatyawadi v.  The State\t of Punjab  and Hidayatullah,  J. in\nSmt. Ujjam  Bai v.  State of  Uttar Pradesh  (supra). Though\nthere may  be some  trappings of  a court  and\tthe  section\nitself\tmentions   the\tword   'court',\t I   feel  that\t the\nrequirements for  being a  court for  the purpose of Section\n195(2)\thave  not  been\t satisfied.  The  intention  of\t the\nlegislature in\tprescribing a  bar  when  an  offence  under\nChapter XI  of I.P.C.  is committed,  that  is,\t when  false\nevidence is  given or  offence\tagainst\t public\t justice  is\ncommitted  is\tthat  the  court  should  decide  whether  a\ncomplaint should be given for an offence committed before it\nand if\tsatisfied should prefer the complaint itself. Before\na court\t gives a  complaint, it\t will have to satisfy itself\nthat a\tprima facie  case is  made out and that it is in the\ninterest of  justice that  a complaint should be lodged. The\npurpose, therefore,  is that  a private\t party should not be\npermitted to  make a  complaint regarding offences committed\nin or  in relation to court proceedings. In an investigation\nby the\tpolice the complainant is only in the background. He\nmight not  have mentioned  the name  of any  person as being\ninvolved in  the crime.\t Taking all  the circumstances\tinto\naccount, I  am, in the absence of the complainant, unable to\nhold that  remand and  bail proceedings before cognizance of\nthe offence  is taken could be held to be proceedings before\na court\t bearing in mind the restricted meaning given to the\nword 'court'.\n",
        "p_37": "     The second\t question is whether the charge of making of\nthe false  report could be rightly held to be in relation to\nproceedings in\tcourt. When  an information  is given  of  a\ncommission of  a cognizable  offence, the  police register a\ncase  and   start  investigation.   For\t  facilitating\t the\ninvestigation provision\t for remand  is provided for. If the\ninvestigation is  not completed\t within 24  hours the police\nmay ask for further remand and the court may grant according\nto provisions of section 167 of\n737\nCriminal Procedure Code. At this stage though the remand and\nbail proceedings  arise as a consequence of complaint given,\nit cannot  be said  that it  is the direct result of a false\nreport to  a court  for no  one might have been mentioned in\nthe complaint  as a  suspect. Further,\tit will be seen that\nthe complainant\t is not\t entitled to  appear  in  court\t and\noppose grant  of bail.\tThe court dealing with the remand or\nbail proceedings  cannot be  said to  fulfil the  conditions\nlaid down  by Venkatarama  Ayyar  as  the  parties  are\t not\nentitled as  a matter  of right\t to be\theard in  support of\ntheir claim and adduce evidence in proof of it.\n",
        "p_38": "     The Magistrate  dealing with  remand proceedings  or  a\nbail petition  does not hear the complainant. He acts on the\nmaterial that  is placed  before him  by the  police  during\ninvestigation.\tThe   complainant  has\t no  opportunity  of\nsubstantiating or  presenting his case before the Magistrate\nat this\t stage. If  the action of the Magistrate in agreeing\nwith  the   report  under  section  169\t Cr.  P.C.  and\t the\nproceedings taken  during investigation\t by way of remand or\nbail are  understood to\t be proceedings in or in relation to\ncourt a complaint may be preferred by the Magistrate without\ngiving an  opportunity to  the complainant  to\tsatisfy\t the\nMagistrate about  the truth of his case. In this connection,\nit is  useful to  refer to  section 476 of the Cr. P. C. The\nsection provides  that when  any Civil,\t Revenue or Criminal\nCourt is,  whether on  application made to it in this behalf\nor otherwise,  of  opinion  that  it  is  expedient  in\t the\ninterests of justice that an inquiry should be made into any\noffence referred  to in section 195, sub-section (1), clause\n",

Before  making  a\ncomplaint a  preliminary inquiry  is contemplated. Normally,\nit would  mean that  the person\t against whom a complaint is\npreferred has  an opportunity to show why a complaint should\nnot be\tpreferred against  him. These stages are not reached\nin a  case when\t the Magistrate has still to take cognizance\nof an  offence. The  restricted meaning given to the Code in\nsection 195(2) Cr. P.C. read along with the conditions to be\nspecified before  a complaint  is preferred  by\t the  court,\ninclines me to hold that the proceedings before a Magistrate\nin which  he agrees  with the  report by  the  police  under\nsection 169, Criminal Procedure Code, and the proceedings in\nremand or  bail applications  during investigation  will not\namount to proceedings in or in relation to court.\n",

        "p_43": "     The police\t held  an  investigation  culminating  in  a\nreport dated  the 25th\tof July, 1970 which was submitted to\nthe  SDJM   under  section  173\t of  the  Code\tof  Criminal\nProcedure, 1898\t (the Code,  for short).

Before\tus the\targument which\twas put\t forward  on\nbehalf of  Trivedi for\tthe consideration  of the High Court\nhas been  repeated and\tit has been urged strenuously by his\nlearned counsel\t that in  so far as the SDJM passed an order\non the\t6th of\tMay, 1970  releasing him  on bail  and\tthen\nanother on  the 31st of July, 1970 discharging him, the SDJM\nacted judicially  and therefore\t as a  Court, that it cannot\nbut be\theld that these orders were passed in proceedings in\nrelation to  which the\toffence under  section\t211  of\t the\nIndian Penal  Code was\talleged to  have been  committed and\nthat consequently  the SDJM  had  no  jurisdiction  to\ttake\ncognizance of that offence.\n",
        "p_50": "     4. The points requiring determination therefore are:\n",
        "p_51": "\t  (a) Whether  the SDJM\t acted as  a Court  when  he\n     passed the\t orders dated  the 6th\tof May, 1970 and the\n     31st of July, 1970 or any of them?\n",
        "p_52": "\t  (b) If  the answer  to  question  (a)\t is  in\t the\n     affirmative, whether  the offence\tunder section 211 of\n     the Indian\t Penal Code  attributed to  Trivedi could be\n     regarded as  having been  committed in  relation to the\n     proceedings culminating  in either\t or both of the said\n     orders?\n",
        "p_53": "     5. In  finding an answer to question (a) I attach quite\nsome importance\t to the provision of sections 6, 496 and 497\nof the Code. These sections are extracted below:\n",
        "p_54": "     Magistrates are  specifically labelled as Courts by the\nstatutory provisions  of section  6 and therefore have to be\nregarded as  such. It is no doubt true that the Code assigns\nto a  Magistrate various  functions which do not fall within\nthe sphere  of judicial\t duties and  are, on the other hand,\nfunctions of  an executive  nature such\t as the\t exercise of\nsupervisory  jurisdiction   in\trelation   to  investigation\ncarried out by the police or work done on the administrative\nside; and  it may  plausibly be argued that in the discharge\nof such\t functions a Magistrate does not act as a Court. But\nthen in\t my opinion a Magistrate cannot but be regarded as a\nCourt  when  he\t acts  judicially.  This  follows  from\t the\nprovisions of  section 6  itself. The  Code does not contain\nany provision to the effect that no functions performed by a\nMagistrate  in\trelation  to  criminal\tproceedings  whether\nhandled by him or dealt with by the police would be regarded\nas functions  performed by a Court unless they are posterior\nin point of time to the stage when he acts under section 190\nof the\tCode. On  the contrary,\t sections 496  and 497 which\nembrace bail  matters  specifically  describe  a  Magistrate\nwhile dealing  therewith  as  a\t Court\tand  these  sections\noperate fully  at all  stages of  a case including that when\nthe investigation  has just started. There is nothing in the\ncontext in  which the  word `Court'  is used  in  these\t two\nsections and  section 195  which would provide an indication\nthat it\t has been  used in two different senses therein, and\nin such\t a situation  the legislature must be deemed to have\nused it\t in one and the same sense wherever it occurs in the\nCode. While  deciding the  question of\tbail,  therefore,  a\nMagistrate must be held to be\n743\nacting\tas   a\tCourt\tand  not   in  any  other  capacity,\nirrespective of\t the stage  which the  case has\t reached  by\nthen, that  is, whether\t it is\tstill under investigation by\nthe police  or has  progressed to the stage of an inquiry or\ntrial by  the Magistrate. It at once follows that the taking\nof cognizance  of any  offence by a Magistrate under section\n190 of\tthe Code  is not a condition precedent for him to be\nregarded as a Court.\n",
        "p_55": "     6. Nor  do\t I  feel  that\tthe  opinions  expressed  by\nHalsbury and  Lord Sankey  lay down any different principle.\nThose opinions appear to me to cover only cases of tribunals\nwhich  perform\t quasi-judicial\t functions   but   are\t not\nstatutorily recognised\tas `Court'.  At page 342 of Volume 9\nof Halsbury's  Laws of\tEngland (third\tedition) appears the\nfollowing passage in Para 809 :\n",
        "p_56": "     In para 810 the learned author proceeds to lay down the\ncriteria which\tdetermine when\ta tribunal would be regarded\nas a  Court. In\t his opinion,  the elements to be considered\nare :\n",
        "p_57": "     The  learned   author   then   quotes   Lord   Sankey's\nobservations in\t Shell Co.  of\tAustralia  Ltd.\t v.  Federal\nCommissioner of Taxation and then gives numerous examples of\ntribunals which\t are not  regarded  as\tCourts.\t One  common\nfeature of  such tribunals is that they are not described as\nCourts by  statute and\tare charged  with the performance of\nadministrative or  executive functions as distinguished from\njudicial functions.\n",
        "p_58": "     Paragraph 812 on page 344 of the same Volume deals with\nthe subject of creation of Courts and lays down :\n",
        "p_59": "     Reference may usefully be made to Section 6 of the same\nChapter in which the above paragraphs occur. That Section is\nheaded \"Magistrates' Courts\". The relevant part of paragraph\n1041 with  which the  Section begins  is  to  the  following\neffect:\n",
        "p_60": "     The combined  effect of  the various paragraphs forming\npart of the treatise and noticed above would be that a Court\nmay be\tcreated by  a statute  and that\t when such  a  Court\nperforms judicial  functions, it  will be deemed to act as a\nCourt and  further, that Magistrates' Courts are regarded as\nsuch   unless\tperforming   executive\t or   administrative\nfunctions. That\t is how\t the position  stands in England and\nthere is  nothing in  the case of Shell Company of Australia\nLtd. v.\t Federal Commissioner of Taxation (supra) which runs\nto the\tcontrary. It  may be  noted that  in that  case\t the\nquestion for  decision was as to whether the Board of Review\nwhich had  been constituted  under the Australian Income Tax\nAssessment Act\tto review  the decisions of the Commissioner\nof Taxation  was or  was not  a Court  and it  was  in\tthat\ncontext that Lord Sankey expressed his opinion. Obviously he\nwas\n745\nnot dealing  with the functions of a tribunal which had been\nstatutorily labelled as a Court.\n",
        "p_61": "     7. What I have said of Lord Sankey's opinion is true of\nthe decisions  of this\tCourt in Virinder Kumar Satyawadi v.\nThe State  of Punjab  and Smt.\tUjjam Bai  v. State of Uttar\nPradesh. In  the former\t the question for decision was as to\nwhether a  returning officer discharging functions under the\nRepresentation of  the People  Act, 1951  was a Court and in\nanswering the  same the\t Court referred to the case of Shell\nCompany\t of   Australia\t (supra)   and\tother\tEnglish\t and\nAustralian authorities and then observed :\n",
        "p_62": "     In Ujjam  Bai's case (supra) this Court was resolving a\nquestion  as   to  whether  an\tofficer\t of  the  income-tax\ndepartment was\ta Court and replied in the negative, broadly\nfor the\t reason that even though taxing authorities follow a\npattern of action which is considered judicial, they are not\nconverted into\tCourts of  civil judicature  and that  their\nactions are executive in nature.\n",
        "p_63": "     Neither of these cases deals with an authority on which\nthe status  of a Court is conferred by statute, nor with one\nforming part of the judiciary, such as a Magistrate in whose\ncase the  opinion of  this  Court  would  surely  have\tbeen\ndifferent as  is apparent from the judgment of Hidayatullah,\nJ., in\tUjjam Bai's  case (supra) which quotes the following\npassage from Gullapalli Nageswara v. State of Andhra Pradesh\n746\n\t  \"The concept\tof a quasi-judicial act implies that\n     the act  is not  wholly judicial,\tit describes  only a\n     duty cast on the executive body or authority to conform\n     to norms  of judicial procedure in performing some acts\n     in exercise of its executive power.\"\n",
        "p_64": "and then proceeds :\n",
        "p_65": "     It is  thus clear that the source of power exercised by\nthe authority,\tthat is, whether it is an executive power or\njudicial  power\t  would\t make  all  the\t difference  in\t the\ndetermination of  the question\tas to  whether the authority\nacts as\t a Court  or merely as a quasi-judicial tribunal not\nfunctioning as\ta Court.  In this connection a reference may\nalso be\t made to section 19 of the Indian Penal Code coupled\nwith  illustration  (b)\t appended  thereto  and\t section  20\nthereof :\n",

Now  I proceed\tto examine  the relevant  provisions\ncontained in  Chapter XIV  of the  Code\t which\tcarries\t the\ncaption \"INFORMATION  TO THE  POLICE  AND  THEIR  POWERS  TO\nINVESTIGATE\". It  may be  stated at  once that\talthough the\nChapter is  headed as  stated, it is not confined to matters\nwhich are  strictly concerned  with the\t investigation stage\nbut  also  deals  with\tsituations  which  arise  after\t the\ninvestigation has  been finalized.

        "p_73": "     The contents  of sections\t169, 170 and 173 of the Code\nmay now be scrutinised. They are re-produced below :\n",
        "p_74": " Section 169  and 170  do not  talk of the submission of\nany report by the police to the Magistrate, although they do\nstate what  the police\thas to\tdo short  of such submission\nwhen it\t finds at  the conclusion  of the  investigation (1)\nthat there  is not  sufficient evidence or reasonable ground\nof suspicion  to justify  the forwarding of the accused to a\nMagistrate  (section  169)  (2)\t that  there  is  sufficient\nevidence or reasonable ground as aforesaid (section 170). In\neither case  the  final\t report\t of  the  police  is  to  be\nsubmitted to the Magistrate under sub-section (1) of section\n",
        "p_75": "173.

        "p_77": "     The appropriate  course has  to be decided upon after a\nconsideration of  the report and the application of the mind\nof the\tMagistrate to  the contents  thereof.

        "p_78": "(a). The order passed by the Magistrate in each of the other\ntwo courses,  that is, (1) and 2(b), follows a conclusion of\nthe investigation  and is  a judicial  order determining the\nrights of  the parties\t(the State  on the  one hand and the\naccused on the other) after the application of his mind. And\nif that\t be so,\t the order  passed by  the Magistrate in the\nproceeding before us must be characterised as a judicial act\nand therefore as one performed in his capacity as a Court.\n",
        "p_79": "     9. The  reasons which have weighed with me in coming to\nthe conclusion\tarrived at in the last paragraph are equally\napplicable to  the consideration  of the question whether an\norder  of   bail  passed  by  a\t Magistrate  calls  for\t the\nperformance by\thim of his judicial functions. Such an order\nalso decides  the rights of the State and the accused and is\nmade by the Magistrate after the application of his mind and\ntherefore in  the discharge  of his  judicial duties,  which\nfactor constitutes it an act of a Court.\n",
        "p_80": "     10. For  a tribunal  to be acting as a Court, it is not\nnecessary that\tthe parties  must have a right of hearing or\nadducing evidence  at every  stage of the proceedings before\nit. This  is specially true of Courts constituted as such by\nthe legislature. Reference may here be made to interlocutory\norders issuing temporary injunctions or staying\n752\nproceedings in\ta subordinate  Court or\t dispossession of  a\nparty by  Civil Courts\tat the\tinstance of  a plaintiff  or\nappellant and  in the  absence of  the opposite\t party which\ncomes into  the picture\t later on  after it is served with a\nnotice. And  even subsequent  to the appearance of the party\nadversely affected,  the existence  of a  prima\t facie\tcase\nwould till  the scales\tagainst it so that the order earlier\npassed in  favour of  the other\t party is confirmed till the\nconclusion of  the case\t on merits, even though the case may\nfinally be  decided otherwise  and the\tinterlocutory  order\nfound to  be unjust  and then vacated. And yet it can hardly\nbe argued  that the  presiding officer of the Court does not\nact as a Court when passing such an order. Really, the right\nto adduce  evidence  and  be  heard  is\t to  be\t taken\tinto\nconsideration  as  being  available  at\t one  stage  of\t the\nproceedings or\tthe other.  Thus in  the case  of  an  order\npassed by  a Magistrate under sub-section (3) of section 173\nof the\tCode in\t agreement with\t the police  report does not\ncall for  any hearing  or the  production of any evidence on\nthe part  of the  accused, as  it goes in his favour. If the\nMagistrate, on\tthe other  hand, disagrees  with the  report\nsubmitted by the police and takes cognizance of the offence,\nthe accused comes into the picture and thereafter shall have\nthe right  to be  heard and to adduce evidence in support of\nhis innocence.\tViewed in this context, all orders passed by\na Magistrate  acting judicially\t (such as orders of bail and\nthose passed under subsection (3) of section 173 of the Code\ndischarging an\taccused or  orders taking  cognizance of the\noffence complained  of) are parts of an integral whole which\nmay end\t with a\t definitive judgment  after an\tinquiry or a\ntrial,\tor  earlier  according\tto  the\t exigencies  of\t the\nsituation  obtaining   at  a  particular  stage,  and  which\ninvolves, if  need be,\tthe adducing  of  evidence  and\t the\ndecision of  the Magistrate on an appreciation thereof.

In  the view  that I have taken of the matter, I do\nnot consider  it necessary  to go  into the  details of\t the\nconflict of  opinion amongst  the High\tCourts in  India  in\nrelation there to but I would touch briefly thereupon. In J.\nD. Boywalla  v. Sorab  Rustomji\t Engineer  Beaumont,  C.

        "p_83": "     These three  decisions, in\t my opinion,  lay  down\t the\ncorrect law  on the  point and\tthe view  expressed  to\t the\ncountry by the Madras, Calcutta and Patna High Court as also\nby a  Full Bench  of the  Allahabad High Court in Hanwant v.\nEmperor and  by a  Full Bench  of the  Lahore High  Court in\nEmperor v.

        "p_84": "     12. In  so far  as this  Court is\tconcerned, the point\ndebated before\tus has\tnot been  the subject  matter of any\ndecision and was expressly left open in M. L. Sethi v. R. P.\nKapur &\t Anr. In that case the appellant had lodged a report\nwith  the  police  charging  the  respondents  with  certain\ncognizable offences.  While the\t police\t were  investigating\ninto the  report, the  respondent filed\t a complaint  in the\nMagistrate's Court alleging that the appellant had committed\nan offence  under section  211 of  the Indian  Penal Code by\nfalsely charging  the respondent  with having  committed  an\noffence. The  Magistrate took cognizance of the respondent's\ncomplaint under section 190 of the Code. At that stage there\nwere no\t proceedings in\t any Court  nor\t any  order  by\t any\nMagistrate for\tarrest, remand\tor bail of the respondent in\nconnection with the appellant's report to the police. Later,\nhowever, the  police arrested  the respondent  in connection\nwith the appellant's report and filed a charge sheet against\nhim,  but   the\t case\tended  in  an  order  of  discharge.\nThereafter, the\t appellant raised  an objection in the Court\nof the\tMagistrate to  the effect  that\t cognizance  of\t the\noffence under section 211 of the Indian Penal Code could not\nbe taken  in view  of the  provisions of  clause (b) of sub-\nsection (1)  of section\t 195 of\t the  Code.  The  Magistrate\nrejected the  contention and  the order was confirmed by the\nSessions Court\tand the\t High Court.  While  dismissing\t the\nappeal, this  Court held  that the  complaint filed  by\t the\nrespondent was\tcompetent and  that clause (b) aforesaid did\nnot stand in the way of the Magistrate taking cognizance, in\nas much\t as, there  had been  no  proceedings  of  any\tkind\nwhatsoever before  the Magistrate  in relation to the report\nlodged by  the appellant  with the police till the complaint\nwas\n754\nfiled by  the respondent.  Reliance was\t placed on behalf of\nthe appellant in that case on Badri vs. State (supra) and J.\nD. Boywalla  v. Sorab  Rustomji\t Engineer  (supra)  but\t the\npoints decided\tin those cases were held not to arise in the\ncase  then   before  the  Court\t which\tmade  the  following\nobservations in relation thereto :\n",

This  is  apparent  from  the\tlast\nsentence of the passage just above extracted which indicates\nthat all  that was  meant was  that if Blacker, J., meant to\nsay that  even though no proceeding at all had been taken by\nthe Magistrate, clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 195\nof the\tCode would  be attracted  merely for the reason that\nthe police  had held an investigation which would at a later\npoint  of   time  result   in  any  proceedings\t before\t the\nMagistrate this Court could not agree with him. Another fact\nwhich may  be noted  in this  connection is that judgment in\nGhulam\tRasul\tvs.  Emperor   (supra)\tdoes  not  state  in\nunmistakable terms that any order\n756\nof cancellation\t of the\t case was  passed by  the  concerned\nMagistrate and\tall that is mentioned is that the police had\nreported the  case for\t\"cancellation\", which  may well mean\nthat really  no order  of cancellation had in fact been made\nby the Magistrate.\n",

The registration of the trade mark 'FIELD MARSHAL' has been periodically renewed from time to time and the same is valid and effective. The applicant as well as their predecessor in title incurred huge expenses by way of advertisements to popularise the impugned trade mark 'FIELD MARSHAL' and by the long and continuous use of the said trade mark, the same has acquired unique reputation and goodwill in the public. The said trade mark 'FIELD MARSHAL' is always identified with the applicant and their goods.\n",
        "p_4": "2. The impugned trade mark 228867 was registered in the name of Puran Chand Jain and Kailash Chand Jain trading as M/s Jain Industries. The said trade mark was registered in class 7 in respect of flour mills, circulation and centrifugal pumps, couplings for machines, pulleys included in class 7 and valves being parts of machines. The impugned trade mark 'FIELD MARSHAL' was never used by the proprietors in respect of centrifugal pumps and the registered proprietors used the mark only for flour mills. The first respondent herein M/s Thukral Mechanical Works infringed the registered trade mark of the applicant by using the same in respect of centrifugal pumps or agricultural pumps. On coming to know about the infringement by the respondent and misuse of the same, the applicant filed Suit No. 2408 of 1985 on the file of the High Court of Delhi against the first respondent herein. In the said suit the first respondent herein contended that they used the trade mark 'FIELD MARSHAL' since the year 1973. The first respondent also claimed the use of the trade mark 'FIELD MARSHAL' since the year 1973 before the Registrar of Trade Marks, New Delhi in the proceedings in opposition No. DEL-4109 filed by the first respondent. The applicant filed criminal miscellaneous petition No. 934 of 1986 before the High Court of Delhi to initiate criminal prosecution against the first respondent for fabricating the documents. Having contested the suit, which is still pending, the first respondent got the assignment of the impugned registered trade mark No. 228867 from M/s Jain Industries. The said assignment in favour of the first respondent is a mala fide one and with the dishonest intention of defeating the ends of law and to continue the trade upon the goodwill and reputation of the applicant.\n",
        "p_5": "3. The applicant filed C.O. No. 9 of 1989 for rectification of the impugned trade mark No. 228867 against M/s Jain Industries, the original registered proprietors. The said petition was withdrawn by the applicant with the permission of the High Court of Delhi to file the present rectification petition against the first respondent, since it was represented that the first respondent became the registered proprietor of the impugned trade mark by way of assignment. The said representation was made in January 1987. The grounds on which the present rectification petition filed are;\n",
        "p_6": "(i) The registration of the impugned trade mark under No. 228867 was made without sufficient cause and it is wrongly remaining on the Register of Trade Marks and the assignment of the impugned trade mark in favour of the first respondent also amounts to fraud and is not sustainable under law. (ii) The existence of the impugned trade mark on the Register of Trade Marks is an obstacle in the use and registration of the trade mark 'FIELD MARSHAL' of the applicants.\n",
        "p_7": "(iii) The impugned registered trade mark is being misused by the first respondent who are  infringers and offenders.\n",
        "p_8": "(iv) The registered proprietors M/s Jain Industries never used the impugned trade mark till the date of filing of the petition either before grant of impugned registration or after in respect of circular or centrifugal pumps.\n",
        "p_9": "(v) The impugned trade mark was obtained without any bona fide intention on their part to use the same in relation to circulation/centrifugal pumps or parts thereof and there is no bonafide use of the impugned trade mark in relation to the said goods by the then registered proprietors for the time being up to a period of five years and one month before the date of the present petition within the meaning of Section 46 (1) of the said Act.\n",
        "p_10": "(vi) The entry relating to the impugned trade mark was wrongly made on the register on the date of registration there of, the said persons were not the proprietors of the impugned trade mark within the meaning of Section 18(1) of the Act. (vii) The assignment of the impugned trade mark and recordal there of by the second respondent in the name of the first respondent is illegal, invalid and contrary to the provisions of the Act.\n",
        "p_11": "(viii) The assignor was not the proprietor of the impugned trade mark at the time of its assignment in favour of the first respondent and as such the instrument through the assignment was made is illegal and void in the eye of law.\n",
        "p_12": "(ix) For the reasons stated above the applicant seeks rectification of the Register of Trade Marks by deletion or expunge of the impugned trade mark so far as it relates to the circulation or centrifugal pumps are concerned.\n",
        "p_13": "4. The first respondent filed the reply wherein they refuted all the averments of the applicant made in their application. Further the first respondent asserted that in the applicant's trade mark application 389729 dated 10.05.82 which was advertised in the Trade Mark Journal No. 902 dated 1.1.87, the applicant has admitted that they are not using the trade mark 'FIELD MARSHAL' in respect of centrifugal pumps. On the contrary they made a false' claim for having used the trade mark FIELD MARSHAL' in respect of centrifugal pumps since 1963. First respondent further asserted that they were using the trade mark 'FIELD MARSHAL' continuously and widely since 1973. They further contended that there is no mala fide intention or any fraud in the assigned of the impugned trade mark in favour of the first respondent. The original registered proprietors of the impugned trade mark were using the said trade mark well within the knowledge of the applicant and as such the plea of non-user is without any basis and consequently prayed for dismissal of the application.\n",
        "p_14": "5. Before the High Court of Delhi the documents were filed and oral evidence was let in by both the parties. On behalf of the applicant four witnesses were examined. It may be pertinent to note that the applicant wanted to examine Mr. Kailash Chand Jain, one of the partners of M/s Jain Industries, the assignor of the first respondent and subsequently on 6.2.96 made a representation that they did not want to examine him. On behalf of the first respondent three witnesses were examined. C.O. No. 6/87 was transferred to this Board pursuant to Section 100 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999.\n",
        "p_15": "6. The learned counsel for the applicant contended that C.O. No. 9/86 was filed against M/s Jain Industries, the registered proprietor of the impugned trade mark 'FIELD MARSHAL' on the ground that the registered owners did not use the trade mark for a period of five years and one month prior to the date of filing of the petition, as contemplated under Section 46 (1) and consequently the remaining of the said trade mark in the trade mark register is wrong or invalid. When the said C.O. 9/86 was pending the impugned trade mark was assigned in favour of the first respondent on 30.5.86. The assignment in favour of the first respondent was brought to the notice of the Court and also to the applicant in January 1987 and immediately the applicant withdrew the rectification petition C.O. 9/86 filed against M/s Jain Industries with liberty to file fresh rectification petition against the first respondent on the same cause of action. This rectification petition was filed mainly on the ground that the original registered proprietors M/s Jain Industries as well as the first respondent never used the impugned trade mark for a period of five years and one month and consequently the same is liable to be removed from the Register of Trade Marks. He also contended that the assignment in favour of the first respondent is invalid since on the date of assignment the assignors were not the owners of M/s Jain Industries. There is absolutely no evidence on behalf of the first respondent for the use of the impugned trade mark from the date of assignment till the date of filing of this rectification petition. Hence, it is a clear case of non-user for the statutory period as contemplated under Section 46(1) of the Act and as such the petition is to be allowed.\n",
        "p_16": "7. The learned counsel for the first respondent contended that the applicant filed the Suit No. 2408/85 on the file of High Court of Delhi and obtained ex parte injunction on 19.12.85. The said ex parte injunction was vacated on 19.1.88. The first respondent got the assignment of the impugned trade mark on 30.5.86. C.O. No. 9/86 filed against M/s Jain Industries was withdrawn on 16.1.87 by the applicant. The present rectification petition was filed on 19.1.87. In the present rectification petition in para 8 the applicant made an averment that the first respondent imitated and infringed the registered trade mark 'FIELD MARSHAL' of the applicant and started using the same in respect of centrifugal pumps and agricultural pumps and this statement of the applicant makes it clear that the first respondent was using the trade mark 'FIELD MARSHAL'. Hence, the plea of non-user will not arise in view of the admission of the applicant about the use of 'FIELD MARSHAL' Trade Mark by the respondent. Similarly in the legal notice issued by the first respondent in the year 1982 there is a specific mention about the use of the trade mark 'FIELD MARSHAL' by the first respondent. Apart from this the first respondent had stated in the oral evidence about the use of the trade mark 'FIELD MARSHAL' and the said statement in the chief examination was not challenged in his cross-examination and as such use of the trade mark 'FIELD MARSHAL' by the first respondent has to be taken as established by the admissions of the applicant as well as by the oral evidence of the first respondent. In such circumstances there is no need for the first respondent to let any independent evidence to establish their case of user. Further, during the period in which the order of injunction passed by the Court was in force, the respondent was restrained from using the said trade mark and hence that period has to be deducted as per Section 46(3) of the Act while calculating the statutory period prescribed under Section 46(1) of the Act as the first respondent had been prevented from using the said trade mark by the order of the Court. If that period is excluded then the statutory period of five years and one month is not satisfied and as such the petition is liable to be dismissed. We considered the above contentions of the respective counsel.\n",
        "p_17": "8. The applicant firm adopted the trade mark 'FIELD MARSHAL' in respect of diesel oil engines and parts thereof in the year 1963. The applicant firm was established in the year 1963. Originally Patel Manufacturers were the users of the trade mark. The firm Patel Manufacturers was taken over by the applicant in the year 1981. The trade mark 'FIELD MARSHAL' was registered under 224879 claiming user since 1963. The trade mark stylish 'FIELD MARSHAL' registered under 252070 and the trade mark logo 'FIELD MARSHAL' registered under 252071. The first respondent since copied the trade mark of the applicant and infringed the same, the applicant filed the suit against the first respondent for passing-off in Suit No. 2408/85 and obtained an order of injunction on 19.12.85.\n",
        "p_18": "9. The applicant came to know that one M/s Jain Industries, Agra had obtained registration of the same trade mark 'FIELD MARSHAL' in class 7. The applicant filed rectification petition C.O. 9/86 on 31.5.86 for the removal of the said Trade Mark 228867, the impugned one in the present proceedings. On 30.5.86 first respondent got the assignment of the impugned trade mark and filed the request in TM-24 on 17.6.86 before the Registrar of Trade Marks, Mumbai for transfer of the said trade mark in their name during the period when the injunction order in favour of the first respondent was in force. On 24.10.86 the Registrar of Trade Marks passed an order and allowed the assignment in favour of the first respondent and entered the same in the name of the first respondent. On 16.1.87 M/s Jain Industries, respondents in C.O. No. 9/86 brought to the notice of the High Court of Delhi about the fact of assignment and on the same day the High Court permitted the applicant to withdraw the said C.O. No. 9/86 with liberty to file fresh C.O. against the first respondent herein on the same cause of action. On 19.1.87 the present rectification application was filed against the first respondent.\n",
        "p_19": "10. It may be appropriate to make a mention here that the first respondent filed the application No. 363764 for registration of the trade mark 'FIELD MARSHAL' in class 7 in the year 1978. The same was advertised in the Trade Marks Journal on 16.11.84. The first respondent withdrew the said application on 20.3.87 i.e., subsequent to the assignment of the impugned Trade Mark 228867 in their favour.\n",
        "p_20": "11. Though several contentions were raised by both the counsel, we are of the view that there is absolutely no necessity to discuss any of them as they are unnecessary. The only relevant question to be considered in this rectification petition is whether the impugned trade mark 228867 'FIELD MARSHAL' is liable to he removed from the Register of Trade Marks due to non-use for a period of five years and one month prior to the filing of this petition. This is the main ground on which the present rectification petition was filed. The averments made by the applicant in the petition is that the impugned trade mark though registered in the name of M/s Jain Industries long back still they have not used the trade mark for the purpose of manufacturing centrifugal pumps. Though the first respondent got assignment of the said impugned trade mark in their favour as early as 30.5.86 they also did not use the said trade mark for manufacture of the centrifugal pumps till the filing of the petition, and as such the said impugned trade mark is liable to be removed from the Register of Trade Marks or in alternate the registration be rectified with the expression 'circulation or centrifugal pumps' are deleted or expunged from the specification of goods in respect of which the impugned trade mark is registered.\n",
        "p_21": "12. In order to consider this question we have to first see the provision under Section 46(1). Section 46(1) of the Act is as follows:-\n",
        "p_22": "\"46. Removal from register and imposition of limitations on ground of non-use.-\n",
        "p_23": "(1) Subject to the provisions of Section 47, a registered trade mark may he taken off the register in respect of any of the goods in respect of which it is registered on application made in the prescribe manner to a High Court or to the Registrar by any person aggrieved on the ground either-\n",
        "p_24": "(a) that the trade mark was registered without any bona fide intention on the part of the applicant for registration that it should be used in relation to those goods by him or, in a case to which the provisions of Section 45 apply, by the company concerned, and that there has, in fact been no bona fide use of the trade mark in relation to those goods by any proprietor thereof for the time being up to a date one month before the date of application; or\n \n\n",
        "p_25": "(b) that upto a date one month before the date of application, a continuous period of five years or longer had elapsed during which the trade mark was registered and during which there was no bona fide use thereof in relation to those goods by any proprietor thereof for the time being.\"\n",
        "p_26": "The above provision empowers the High Court or the Registrar to remove from the Register of Trade Marks or impose any limitation on the ground of non-use. Sub-clause (b) of Sub-section (1) prescribes a period of five years and one month or longer for the non-use of the said trade mark to suffer the removal. Hence, what we have to consider is whether the applicant had established the non-use of the impugned trade mark by the first respondent within the period of five years and one month prior to the filing of the present rectification petition.\n",
        "p_27": "13. The learned counsel for the respondent contended that the averments in para 8 in the rectification petition that the first respondent had been using the trade mark 'FIELD MARSHAL' in respect of centrifugal pumps must be construed that the applicant has admitted use of the impugned registered trade mark by the 1st respondent. The learned counsel for the first respondent also relied upon a legal notice dated 22.6.82 issued by the applicant for the use of the impugned trade mark. In the notice the applicant has called upon the first respondent to stop the use of the infringed trade mark 'FIELD MARSHAL'. Hence, the request of the applicant to stop the use of trade mark makes clear about the use of the trade mark 'FIELD MARSHAL' by the first respondent.\n",
        "p_28": "14. So far as the use of the trade mark 'FIELD MARSHAL' by the first respondent is concerned, there is slight intrinsic difference which has to be clearly made out, as the first respondent was using the trade mark 'FIELD MARSHALL' in respect of their goods as infringe which in quite different from the use of the registered mark 'FIELD MARSHALL' in No. 228867 as assigned proprietor. Both are distinct and cannot he clubbed together. The registered Trade Mark 'FIELD MARSHAL' in No. 228867 is totally a different one from the unregistered Trade Mark 'FIELD MARSHAL' used by the first respondent by way of infringing the applicant's registered Trade Mark.\n",
        "p_29": "15. There is no doubt that the first respondent had been using the trade mark 'FIELD MARSHAL' by infringing the registered trade mark of the applicant. It is an admitted fact that the first respondent filed applicant No. 363764 for registration of the same trade mark in their name and ultimately the said application was withdrawn on 20.3.87. In the meanwhile on 30.5.86 the first respondent got the assignment of the impugned registered Trade Mark No. 228867 'FIELD MARSHAL' from M/s Jain Industries. M/s Jain Industries were registered proprietor of the said trade mark and they were using the trade mark for flour mills. The case of the applicant is that M/s Jain Industries got the registration of the impugned trade mark in respect of centrifugal pumps, and they never used the same till they assigned it in favour of the first respondent. C.O. No. 9/86 was filed by the applicant for rectification of the Registered Mark No. 228867 only on that ground. Since during the pendency of the said rectification petition the assignment was made in favour of the first respondent, the said rectification petition was withdrawn and the present petition was filed against the respondent. Here again the averment is to the effect that M/s Jain Industries never used the said impugned registered trade mark in respect of centrifugal pumps till they assigned the same in favour of the 1st respondent and the respondents also never used the impugned registered mark in respect of centrifugal pumps after assignment.\n",
        "p_30": "16. Sub-clause (b) of Sub-section (i) of Section 46 prescribes a period of five years and one month or longer for the non-use of a trade mark in relation to those goods by any proprietor thereof for the time being, for the removal of the said trade mark. To be precise, in terms of the provisions it runs as follows:-\n",
        "p_31": " \"That upto a date one month before the date of application, a continuous period of five years or longer had elapsed during which the trade mark was registered and during which there was no bona fide use thereof in relation to those goods by any proprietor thereof for the time being.\"\n",
        "p_32": "The object underlined in Section 46 is to prevent trafficking in trade marks. This is, in fact, the object underlying in all trade mark laws. A trade mark is meant to distinguish the goods of one person from those made by another. A trade mark, therefore, cannot exist in vacuum. It can only exist in connection with the goods in relation to which it is used or intended to be used. Its object is to indicate the connection in the course of trade between the goods and some person having right to use the mark either with or without any indication of the identity of that person. When a person gets his trade mark registered, he acquires valuable right by reason of such registration. The registration of his trade mark gives him exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in connection with the goods in respect of which it is registered and if there is any invasion of this right by another person using the mark which is the same or deceptively similar to his mark, he can protect his trade mark by an action for infringement in which he can obtain by way of damages or account of profits. So Sub-clause (b) contemplates bona fide non-use of the trade mark for the stipulated period in relation to those goods by any proprietor thereof for the time being. The phrase \"any proprietor thereof for the lime being\" has a relevance with the non-user.\n",
        "p_33": "17. The term \"for the time being\" means that the moment or existing position as explained by the Supreme Court in the case of Jivendranath Kaul v. Collector/District Magistrate, (1992) 3 SCC 576. In yet another case H.S. Maharajadhiraja Madhava Rao Jivaji Rao Scindia Bahadur and Ors. v. Union of India, AIR 1971 SC 530 at page 568 para 110 familiarly known as the Privy Purses case the Supreme Court had an occasion to consider the term \"for the time being\" in Clause 22 of Article 322 of the Constitution of India. The Supreme Court had interpreted the term as one at a given time. Hence, the phrase \"for the time being\" refer only to the proprietor of the trade mark at the time of filing the rectification petition. If we take the relevant dates in this case, the first respondent got the assignment of the disputed trade mark on 30.5.86. They also filed TM-24 to get themselves registered as subsequent proprietors on 17.6.86 and the first respondent was registered as the subsequent proprietor. When the Act prescribes a stipulated period of five years and one month to establish the fact that there was no bona fide use by the proprietor of the trade mark sought to be removed, it would naturally refer to the non-use of the impugned trade mark by the first respondent for the stipulated period.\n",
        "p_34": "18. The petition has been filed for rectification by the applicant on 19.1.87, that is, hardly within 7 1/2 months from the date of assignment of the trade mark in favour of the first respondent. The first respondent having become the proprietor of the disputed trade mark on 30.5.86, the disputed mark cannot be removed from the Register on the ground that there is no bona fide use of the same by the first respondent for a period of five years and one month prior to 19.1.87, that is, the date on which the present application was filed.\n",
        "p_35": "19. The contention of the learned counsel for the applicant is that the applicant filed C.O. 9/86 for rectification of the disputed trade mark against Jain Industries, the then proprietors of the disputed trade mark on the same ground of non-user for five years and one month. During the pendency of the said C.O. 9/86, the first respondent got the assignment of the said trade mark and consequently the applicant withdrew C.O. 9/86 with liberty to file a fresh petition for rectification on the same cause of action. In view of the permission granted by the Court, the present proceedings must be taken as continuation of the earlier proceedings C.O 9/86 and as such the stipulated period of five years and one month is satisfied. We are unable to agree with the said contention of the learned counsel for the applicant for the simple reason that the cause of action in respect of C.O. 9/86 is non-user by the then proprietor of the trade mark Jain Industries. Unless the cause of action and the relief claimed in this application are  the same as in C.O. 9/86, it cannot be said that the subject matter of this application is the same as in the first. The cause of action in C.O. 9/86 is non-use of the impugned mark by Jain Industries who were parties therein. In the present application the cause of action is non-use of the impugned mark by the first respondent. When the parties are different and the cause of action is also different, the present application cannot be considered to be a one in continuation of the earlier C.O. 9/86 on the same cause of action. Because of the phrase \"any proprietor thereof for the time being\" occurring in Sub-clause (b) of Section 46(1) of the Act, the cause of action totally differs. There cannot be any continuation of the cause of action especially when the proprietors have changed in respect of the said trade mark. In the absence of any provision in the Act to tag on the period of non-use by the previous proprietor with that of the period of non-use by the present proprietor of the trade mark, the tagging cannot be done. The stipulated period would refer to each proprietor and consequently we have to hold that the applicant has not established the fact that the first respondent has not used the disputed trade mark for a period of five years and one month especially when they are the proprietors for hardly 7 months on the date of filing of the application.\n",
        "p_36": "20. In para 10 of the petition the applicant has stated that the registration of the impugned mark under No. 228867 was made without sufficient cause and it is wrongly remaining on the Register of Trade Marks. In the grounds of petition in ground (f) the applicant has stated that Jain Industries neither manufactured nor supplied the pumps under the impugned trade mark \"FIELD MARSHAL'. As already stated once the assignment has been made and the first respondent having become to subsequent proprietor, the non-use of the impugned mark for the prescribed period must be against the first respondent. With regard to assignment also the petitioner has not challenged the same except vaguely stating that the assignment is a fraudulent one, illegal and contrary to the provisions of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. No details were furnished in respect of the above allegations and hence we have to hold that these allegations have not been established.\n",
        "p_37": "21. Consequently the petition fails and it is dismissed. However, there will be no order as to costs.\n"

Such acts of the defendants are not only calculated to deceive the customers and to cause them to believe that the goods of the defendants are produced by the plaintiffs or that the defendants are in some way associated in business with plaintiffs and this is being done with malafide intention to take advantage of the goodwill and reputation of the plaintiffs trade mark. This act of the defendants amounts to passing off goods of defendants as those of the plaintiff. The defendants did not desist from this objectionable use of the plaintiffs trade mark on their goods despite plaintiffs request and hence the suit. Plaintiff seeks a permanent injunction restraining the defendants from using the trade mark v;wj in respect of their footwear and from using the artistic work and copy right in the said trade mark and also from passing off their goods as of those of the plaintiffs. Besides decree of rendition of accounts and for delivery of objectionable material for the purpose of destruction is also sought.  \n",
        "p_7": " 5. Along with the suit the plaintiff also filed an IA. being No. 6321/2000, under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 CPC seeking ad interim injunction to the same effect. This Court vide its order dated 29th June, 2000 issued an ex parte, ad interim injunction as prayed. The defendants have contested the application. In their reply dated 1st December, 2000 they have pleaded that the trade mark AYUR is not registered in the name of the plaintiffs in respect of Shoes, chappals kid footwears, ladies footwear under class 25 of schedule IV of the Act. Therefore, there is no infringement of trade mark as such in view of Section 29 of the Act. It is further contended that the word AYR is of generic and descriptive nature as it denotes something relating to traditional Indian science of health or medicine known as Ayurved and such a generic and descriptive word cannot be registered as a trade mark under Section 9 of the Trade Mark Act. Besides it is contended that the goods of the defendants viz. footwear are vastly different from those of the plaintiff and there is no likelihood of confusion and deception being caused on any customer. It is further the case of the defendants that they are using the said trade mark AYUR in respect of their goods viz. Shoes, chappals, kid footwears, ladies footwear since 1994 so they are entitled to protection of Section 33 of the Act. It is also contended that the suit suffers from delay, acquiescence and latches on the part of the plaintiff is as much as the defendants are using the said trade mark AYUR on their footwear since 1994 and the plaintiffs have falsely alleged that they came to know about it only in the month of June 2000. Further, defendants have also applied for registration of the said trade mark AYUR in respect of foot wear vide No. 706162. Defendants business in the footwear has been consistently rising and their products have acquired good will and reputation in the market as is reflected from the sale figure details whereof are given in para 8 of the reply. Besides, there are so many other traders who are using the trade mark AYUR so the plaintiff cannot claim monopoly over the use of such a generic and descriptive word. It is thus contended that plaintiff has not made out prima facie case for exclusive use of the trade mark AYUR in respect of foot wear. The balance of convenience also lies in favor of the defendants who are already in business for last six to seven years as the injunction would practically ruin their business.  \n",
        "p_8": " 6. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.  \n",
        "p_9": " 7. From the above recapitulation of the pleadings of the parties, the undisputed factual position which emerges is that although the plaintiffs are registered proprietors of the trade mark AYUR for various classes of goods enumerated in para 4 of the plaint, they are not holding any registered trade mark in respect of footwears which falls under class 25 of the schedule IV of the Act nor they are actually using it for footwear. So in view of Section 29 of the Act no case for infringement of registered trade mark in made out. What remains to be seen is whether, in the circumstances of the present case, an action for passing off is maintainable.  \n",
        "p_10": " 8. Going by the first principles, it can be said as a fundamental premises that whenever there is an attempt to imitate others trade mark, style or the artistic work, the idea is obviously to cash on the goodwill, reputation and popularity of the said trade mark. Even if the trade mark consists of a generic or descriptive word its use by some other person in exactly the same fashion and style would unmistakably mean that the latter is trying to exploit the name and fame already earned acquired by the trade mark and the style/design in which it is presented. Even a common language word with a meaning can be exclusively appropriated as a trade mark by a party if it is established that the word has acquired secondary significance that it to say, a different meaning other than the primary meaning in the language. Reference in this regard may be made to a decision of this Court in the case of   Globe Super Parts v. Blue Super Flame Industries- AIR 1986 Delhi 245   wherein it was held that even a common language word can be exclusively appropriated by party as a trade mark if the said word has acquired a secondary significance but in the case of a word which is coined, fancy, new or meaningless the claim to exclusive appropriation is sustainable without the need to prove existence of secondary significance. Secondary significance here would mean that the word has acquired a special meaning as denoting the goods of particular manufacturer or trader.  \n",
        "p_11": " 9. In that case the facts were that the plaintiff was manufacturing and marketing gas appliances since the year 1968 under the trade mark ' SUPERFLAME  '. It was alleged that ' SUPERFLAME  ' has become a distinctive mark for the plaintiffs business and that it has a considerable reputation in relation to the gas appliances. The word ' SUPERFLAME  ' connotes the product of the plaintiff exclusively, therefore, its use by any rival trader as part of its business name or in relation to its goods is likely to lead to confusion and deception and resultant passing off such trader's business and goods as the business and goods of the plaintiff. In that case the defendant concern ran a similar business under trade mark Blue Super Flame Industries. The defendant's contention was that the word Super Flame comprises of two common English words namely Super and Flame so nobody can claim monopoly or exclusive right over it. It was held by the learned single Judge of this Court that in the trade mark of the plaintiff the word ' SUPERFLAME  ' is written as one single word starting with a capital 'S'. It is not descriptive of any natural object or phenomenon. Yellow Flame, Red Flame, Blue Flame do exist in nature but this cannot be said of Super Flame. '  SUPERFLAME  ' is not part of ordinary language because '  SUPERFLAME  ' as one word is not to be found in authoritative English language dictionary. Repelling the contention that the word ' SUPERFLAME  ' is a common language word in para 73 of the judgment, it was observed as under:-  \n",
        "p_12": "  While dealing with appropriation of words either with reference to Trade Mark Law or Copyright Law, what has to be first seen is whether the word in question exists in the language. It is then to be seen whether the word in question is a combination of two or more words. The important thing to bear in mind is actually not whether it is a combination of two or more words but whether the word in question is used by the author/owner of its as the single word or not. It the author uses the word in question is a single word, I am of the view that it is not permissible to break up that single word into its component parts. I am further of the view that it is not permissible after the word has been broken up into its component parts to say that it consists of either two or more words, which are common language words. This so because what has to be seen in trade Mark Law is a \"connection in the course of trade\", and in the copyright laws, what one is concerned is to determine whether the person who has created the new fancy or invented word combination has expended his skill and his labour upon the creation of the word combination. Any person who is desirous of identifying himself with a particular word, which he has created, does so only for the purposes of establishing the sole connection with the article to which it is applied. The skill of the person who creates a new word lies in making the word so simple that the simplest of those who would be interested in procuring the 'articles to which that word is applied, or those interested in purchasing the book to which the word/name has been given as a title would immediately register it in his mind for future reference.\"  \n",
        "p_13": " 10. It was further observed that the mere fact that the word SUPERFLAME suggests a meaning by itself is its virtue and would not in any way denigrate amount of skill and labour spend in thinking it up and giving it expression. It is important to bear in mind that impugned trade mark in this case is v;wj written in Hindi which the defendants have stated using on their product viz. the footwear. The word v;wj  which is the impugned trade mark does not find place in the Hindi language dictionary nor it is a common language word in Hindi. Learned counsel for the defendant referred to the Oxford Hindi English Dictionary wherein Hindi word vk;qj appears which means something relating to traditional Indian science of health and medicine viz.Ayurveda. It starts with a prolonged pronunciation of Hindi letter vk  (a) which is different from the small pronunciation of v  (a) appearing in the impugned trade mark. The next letter ;w  has a prolonged pronunciation of (oo) in the impugned word v;wj\n whereas in vk;qj\n  it is a small pronunciation (U). vk;qj  is a meaningful word in Hindi language meaning something relating to Ayurveda but v;wj  is meaning less. Since v;wj  is not a part of common Hindi language or dictionary it should be held to be an invented, corned, new word and the claim to its exclusive appropriation is sustainable without the need to prove the existence of any secondary significance, as propounded in the case of Globe Super Parts(supra).  \n",
        "p_14": " 11. Learned counsel for the defendant referred to a decision of learned single Judge of this Court in the case of   Three N Products Pvt. Ltd., v. Pardesi General Store and Ors. 2000 PTC 489,   wherein the plaintiff had filed an application under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 CPC seeking interim injunction against Pardesi General Store & Ors and others who were marketing Ayurslim Tablets under an umbrella brand ayurvedic concepts. In that case the learned single Judge while dealing with the question as to whether Ayur is generic/descriptive or a fancy, invented word has observed that the word ayurvedic occurs in Oxford Hindi English dictionary as meaning the traditional Indian science of health and medicines. On a thorough study of said judgment, I find that learned single Judge has not recorded any specific finding that the word v;wj  in Hindi is of generic or descriptive nature and therefore incapable of exclusive appropriation by a party. Rather interim injunction in that case was declined because on a visual comparison of trade mark and logos learned single Judge came to the conclusion that there is no over all similarity between the two and products. The defendant's product was tablet whereas the plaintiff's product was a tumbler. Besides the trade names, the logos essential features art work, colour combination, lay out were also different.. Learned single Judge was of the view that there is no likelihood of nay confusion or deception being created in the mind of the purchaser. Ayur written in English can be pronunciated as v;wj  as well as vk;qj  unless metrical prolongations intervals are also specified. If Ayur written in English is read as vk;qj  in Hindi it could be argued that it is a generic or descriptive word denoting something relating to Ayurveda. But this does not apply to v;wj  in Hindi. No customer having an elementary knowledge of Hindi. No customer having an elementary knowledge of Hindi will relate the word v;wj  to Ayurveda. In the present case, the impugned trade mark v;wj  in Hindi and no Ayur written in English which was the subject matter of comment in the case cited by learned counsel for the defendant. Therefore the said decision is no authority for the proposition that v;wj  is not an invented word. For the reasons already given, I am of the view that v;wj  is a invented word capable of exclusive appropriation by a party without proof of its having acquired secondary significance.  \n",
        "p_15": " 12. More over in the present there is ample proof indicating prima facie that plaintiff's trade mark v;wj  has acquired a distinctive identity as denoting plaintiff's product. In para 8 or the plaint the plaintiff has given year wise sales and the the amount spent on advertisement right from 1984-85 to 1999-2000 which shows that the sales as well as the expenditure on advertisement has been steadily increasing year to year except the year 1985-86 and 1994-95 when the sales had shown a down ward trend. In the year 1999-2000 the plaintiff's sales amounted to Rs. 14.39.56.571.00 and the expenditure on advertisement was to the tune of Rs. 46,68,865.00. Plaintiff has filed copies of the bills, cash memos and invoices showing sales of the various products under the trade mark v;wj right from the year 1985 onwards up to date besides several other bills from the different advertising agencies. Under the circumstances it can be safely inferred that over the years the plaintiff have built up a great reputation and good will in the said trade mark and a distinctive identity for its products in the market. Therefore, even if v;wj  is held to be a common dictionary word it has become capable of exclusive appropriation by the plaintiff because it has earned enormous good will, reputation and distinctiveness which means a secondary significance as goods of the plaintiff and therefore it appears to me that prima facie, the plaintiff is entitled for injunction against its mis-use in an action for passing off.  \n",
        "p_16": " 13. Learned counsel for the defendant referred to another decision of this Court in   Relaxo Rubber Limited and Another v. Aman Cable Industries and another 1998 PCT (18)  . In that case the plaintiff was the registered owner of the trade mark Relaxo for footwear. Defendant started using the same trade mark for manufacturing and selling PVC pipe. Learned single Judge in that case came to the conclusion that Relaxo is not an invented, fancy, new word. Rather it is just a variation of a common dictionary word relax which therefore cannot be exclusively appropriated by a party. Some other cases which were cited on behalf of the plaintiff in that case related to the famous trade mark like Caltex, Bata, Benz were distinguished by the learned single Judge on the ground that all those trade marks were invented coined words therefore in such cases injunction was granted by the Court although goods marketed by the parties were altogether different. For the same reasons other cases cited by the learned counsel for the defendant in this case viz.   Nestle's Products Ltd. v. M/s Milkmade Corporation and Anr.-; M/s Hindustan Pencils Ltd., v. Aptudet Industries-1991 PTC 204; United Brothers v. United traders-1997 PTC (17) page 603; Vishnudas trading as Vishnuda Kishendas v. Vazir Sultan tobacco Co. Ltd-1996 PTC (16) page 512   are clearly distinguishable from the present case because in all these cases the trade marks did not involve any new coined, invented words. In the present case the word v;wj has been held to be invented, coined word as it does not form part of the Hindi language dictionary nor it is a word of common Hindi language and is a meaningless word. Plaintiff can legitimately claim exclusive right to use such a word as its trade mark to he exclusion of all others, even though goods marketed by such other parties may be totally different. In the case of   London Rubber Co. Ltd. v. Durex Products-,   the facts were that the respondent therein had applied for the registration of the trade mark in relation to the contraceptive manufactured and marketed by it. Respondent in that application claimed proprietorship in respect of the said trade mark by virtue of its user since 1928. This said application for registration was filed by the respondent on 28th May 1946. The appellant filed objections to the said application. The stand taken by the appellant was that they are well established manufacturers of surgical rubber goods and proprietor in India of trade mark Durex which they have been using in India since the year 1932. On 23rd December, 1946 the appellant also applied for registration of Durex in class 10 which application was granted on 11th July 1951 and the registration was renewed for further period of 15 years. On 24th July, 1954 Deputy Registrar over ruled the objection of the appellant and admitted the respondent's mark Durex to registration. Appellant preferred an appeal before the Calcutta High Court under Section 76 of the Trade Marks Act, 1940. T he said appeal was dismissed by the Division Bench on 9th March 1959. The appellant filed SLP before the Supreme Court. Hon'ble Supreme Court upheld the order of the Deputy Registrar and the High Court because it was found on facts that there was honest and concurrent user of the said trade mark by the respondent since 1928. Besides Durex was the name of the company itself and normally a company should be entitled to use is own name unless there be very cogent reason against it. Honest and concurrent user for such a long duration of time weighed heavily in the mind of the Court in allowing the registration. This case is also distinguishable form the present case on facts. In the present case the defendants started footwear business under the trade name v;wj  only recently in the year 1994. Besides, the user of the trade mark v;wj  which is identical with that of the plaintiff both in the trade names will as the artistic work cannot but be said to be dishonest. So the observations made by the Supreme Court in the case of London Rubber Co. Ltd (Supra) do not support the defendant's case in any way.  \n",
        "p_17": " 14. As already noticed the word v;wj is an invented, meaningless new word which neither finds pace in the Hindi language dictionary no it is a common language word. Besides it has assumed secondary significance as denoting the goods of the plaintiff. Therefore a passing off action in respect of its misuse can be maintained by the plaintiff.  \n",
        "p_18": " 15. Learned counsel for the defendant has contended that the field of activity of the parties in this case is totally different. The plaintiff deals in herbal cosmetics whereas the defendant is dealing in footwear. Therefore, there is not even a remote possibility of any confusion or deception being caused in the mind of an unwary purchaser that the footwear being marketed under the trade mark v;wj  is a product of the plaintiff. In support of his contention learned counsel for he defendant cited the case of   Sony Kabushiki Kaisha v. Shamrao Maskar and Ors.-Arbitration Law Reporter 1984 page 38 wherein the   registration of similar trade marks for altogether different kinds of goods was permitted. It is no doubt true that earlier the test of field of activities being different was almost decisive. If the filed of activities of the parties were vastly different then the possibility of any confusion or deception being caused to an unwary customer was axiomatically taken to be nil but of late this line of thinking has under gone a sea change. In the case of   Essel Packaging Limited and others v. Essel Tea Exports Limited-1999 PTC (19) 521,   the facts were that plaintiff group of companies were carrying on business of manufacturing packaging material since 1992. After some times, the defendant also started the business of tea export under the name and style of Essel Tea Exports Limited. When plaintiff brought a suit for injunction restraining the defendant from passing off their business as that of plaintiff the main defense taken by the defendant was that they are entirely in different field of activity so there is no likelihood of any deception or confusion being caused to the customer and, therefore, action for passing off goods or business is not maintainable. Repelling this contention Bombay High Court observed as under:-  \n",
        "p_19": " 14. In the present case also, one of the points which arises for determination is the controversy pertaining to common field by activity. It is the case of the Defendants herein that they are in the Tea Export Business whereas the Group of Companies of the Plaintiffs are not in Tea Export Business. IT is also contended that even one of the Companies which is in the Tea Export Business does not bear the name \"ESSEL\" and in the circumstances, the Plaintiffs are not entitled to an interim injunction in passing off action. This argument was also advanced in the case of Kirloskar Diesel Recon. Pvt. Ltd. (supra) and it was rejected by Jhunjhunwala, J. by observing   that the expression common field of activity is not conclusive for deciding whether there can be a passing off action although at one point of time the said test was treated as conclusive. With the passage of time the law on requirement of common field of activity in a passing of action has radically undergone a change Judge, there is no requirement for a common field of activity to found a claim in passing off because the real question in each of such cases is whether there is as a result of misrepresentation, a real likelihood of confusion or deception of the public and consequent damage to the plaintiffs is likely tobe caused and if that is the text then the focus is shifted from the external objective text of making comparison of activities of parties to the state of mind of public in deciding whether it will be confused.   Applying the text of misrepresentation, the learned single Judge Jhunjhunwala J. observed that the business activity of the Plaintiffs, namely, \"Kirloskar Group of Companies which vary from pin to piano as borne out from the object Clauses of the Memorandum of Association is likely to create confusion if the Defendants business activities are allowed to be carried out in the name of Kirloskar Diesel Recon Pvt. Ltd. because in the case of trading name which has become almost a household word and under which trading name a variety of activities are undertaken, a passing off can successfully lie if the defendant has adopted identical or similar trading name.  \n",
        "p_20": " 15. In the case of Bajaj Electrical Ltd. v. Metals & Allied Projects, , the Division Bench of this Court while granting injunction has observed that it is always in the interests of fair trading and in the interests of all who may wish to buy or to sell goods, the law recognises that certain limitations upon freedom of action are necessary and desirable. In some situations the law had to resolve what might at first appear to be conflicts between competing right. In solving the problems which have arisen there has been no need to report to any abstract principles but rather to the straight forward principles that trading must not only be honest but must not even unintentionally be unfair.   \n",
        "p_21": " 16.Now applying the text made out by the above two decisions of this Court to the facts of our case, the letters referred to here in above clearly indicate that the members of the public have been misled by the use of the word \"ESSEL\" in the corporate name of the Defendants Essel Tea Exports Ltd. Apart from the letter, issuance of advertisement inviting public to participate in the issuance of shares and photograph of the advertisement issued by the Directors of the Defendants clearly indicate that the above tests laid down by this Court and fully satisfied. The facts have been narrated at length by this Court in earlier paragraphs.\"\n",

In these cases passing off action was entertained and the infringer were restrained from using the offending trade mark even though the goods produced by the two parties were altogether different. While dealing with the question of field of activities of two parties being different Division Bench of High court of Bombay in the case of   1998 PTC (18) PAGE 47   observed in para 61 as under:-  \n",
        "p_33": "  61. Taking into consideration various cases cited by both sides we are of the opinion that the crux of the passing off action lies in actual or possible or probable deception. The plaintiffs necessarily has to establish reputation and goodwill. In quia timet action he must also show the probability of the plaintiffs suffering damage either in trade or to his goodwill and reputation Deception may be of several kinds i.e. that the public may think that the goods manufactured by the plaintiffs or that there is some trade connection or association of the defendants with the plaintiffs it is also clear that the trans border reputation has been recognized by the Indian Courts and as a matter of a law it isnot necessary to prove the actual sale, if by other material presence of the plaintiffs in India and good will and reputation in India is demonstrated. It is also clear to us that as a matter of law the \"common field of activity\" is not required tobe established. However, as the crux of passing off action lies in possible deception, the existence of common filed of activity is always a relevant consideration. If there is common field of activity, possibility of deception is very high and if there is no common filed of activity possibility may be less, but it cannot be laid down as a rule of l was that there can be no possibility at all. Thirdly and more importantly, all these issues ultimately will depend on the facts and circumstances and the material on record of each particular case, as to whether the plaintiff has established the goodwill or reputation, whether the plaintiff has established the trans-border reputation, whether the defendant has caused misrepresentation innocently or deliberately and whether the plaintiff has suffered damage or is likely to suffer damage in quia time action will be questions of fact to be determined by the Court. It is also clear that if it is shown that the defendant intended to deceived, the burden would be much lighter on the part of plaintiff. The existence of unexpected and unexplained similarities between the goods of the defendant and the plaintiff or lack of explanation or false explanation for adoption of name by the defendant, maybe extremely relevant.\"  \n",
        "p_34": " 18. In the case of   Alfred Dunhill Limited v. Kartar Singh Makkar and Ors.-1999 PTC 294,   the facts were that the defendant had imitated the trade mark of multinational Alfred Dunhill Limited on different kind of goods. Learned single Judge of this Court in para 12 had observed as under:-  \n",
        "p_35": "  12. In the suit of instant nature, the real test is whether defendants have any right to represent their business as the business of plaintiff. It ultimately leads to the question as to why defendants were using the trade name DUNHILL to their products. The defendants have not, offered any explanation whatsoever as to why the mark DUNHILL was being used by them.The name DUNHILL is neither parental name of defendants nor in any way connected with them. As noticed earlier, the mark DUNHILL is attributable to the surname of Alfred DUNHILL. All of the goods marketed by plaintiff company are sold under the trade mark and trade name DUNHILL. The trade mark and trade name DUNHILL has become distinctive of the plaintiff's goods as a result of substantially exclusive and continuous use in commerce since 1893. Thus, in my opinion, the user of the trade name DUNHILL by defendants is indicative of their intent. It follows that defendants desire to market their goods under the name of mark DUNHILL with a view to trade upon and encash on the name, fame, reputation image and goodwill acquired by the plaintiff company.\"  \n",
        "p_36": " 19. Several other authorities can be cited in support of the proposition that where a particular party is using a new, coined, fency, invented word as its trade mark which has acquired some good will and reputation, it can be exclusively appropriated by such party. The user of same or similar trade mark by any other trader will amount to passing off his goods or business as that of the first party unless of course such user by the other party appears to be innocent, honest. The intention of the trader in adopting the trade mark of an other trader is of paramount importance in such cases and if the intention appears to be dishonest viz. to encash upon the goodwill, reputation of the other's trade name an injunction to prevent passing off goods or business shall be granted no matter whether the goods marketed by them are similar or different. In the case of   Apple Computer Inc. v. Apple Leasing & Industries-1992 (1) Arbitration Law Reporter page 93   where both the parties were using the word Apple which by itself is not a invented word and were operating in different fields of activities, the learned single Judge of this Court had issued permanent injunction restraining defendants from using the word Apple or Apple Computers in the course of their trade because from the circumstances of the case the Court came to the conclusion that the user of the similar trade name by the defendants was not innocent. The explanation offered by the defendants regarding the use of the word Apple for their trade name which was similar to that of plaintiff was no found to be satisfactory. Rather it appeared that the defendants had adopted the word Apple Computer in their filed of activity with the intention of create subtle association between the plaintiff's Apple Computer and their own activities. In the case of   Surjit Singh Vs. M/s Alembic Glass Industries Ltd., ,   another learned single Judge of this Court observed that if the adoption of similar trade mark by the defendant is found to be dishonest, it will certainly disentitle the defendants from any protection from the Court. Similar observation were made by the Division Bench of the High Court of Bombay in the case of   Aktiebolaget Volvo Vs. Volvo Steels Limited- 1998 PTC (18) (DB) page 47.    \n",
        "p_37": " 20. In the present case defendants in their written statement have not offered any explanation whatsoever for adopting the trade mark v;wj  in the same fashions and style as that of the plaintiff. The trade the defendant is an exact replica of the plaintiff's  trade mark v;wj . It cannot be sheer co-incidence. Assuming that v;wj  is a common dictionary word, its adoption by the defendant in exactly the same style, design, get up as that of the plaintiff would prima facie indicate that in doing so the defendant was motivated by the desire to cash on the popularity, goodwill and reputation of the said trade mark. Such user cannot be said to be honest, innocent user. In the case of   Hindustan Pencils Pvt. Ltd., Vs. India Stationery Products Co-,   learned single Judge of this Court held that if the Court comes to the conclusion that prejudice is likely to be caused to the general public who may be misled into buying the goods manufactured by the defendants thinking them to the goods of the plaintiff, then the injunction must be issued as such user of the trade mark by the defendant will be fraudulent. Similarly in the case   Globe Super parts, Vs. Blue Super Flame Industries - AIR 1986 Delhi 245,  learned single Judge of this Court had issued permanent injunction restraining defendants from using the word 'superflame' in their business name.  \n",
        "p_38": " 21. Viewed in this legal and factual perspective, if stands established prima facie that the user of the trade v;wj  mark by the defendants is dishonest as it is purely with the idea of exploiting the goodwill, reputation and popularity of the plaintiff's trade mark who are in the business since 1984 i.e. much before the defendants commenced their footwear business in 1994. In view of the law laid down in the cases referred to above, the factor alone should be sufficient to injunct the defendants. The trade mark law is not intended to protect a person who deliberately sets out to take the benefit of somebody else's reputation, .  \n",
        "p_39": " 22. It was next contended by learned counsel for the defendant that there is an inordinate delay in filing the suit and this has given rise to some equities in favor of the defendants. It was submitted that granting injunction at this stage would lead to certain closure of defendant's business. The present suit was filed on 28th June 2000. According to the averments contained in para 18 of the plaint, plaintiff came to know for the first time in the third week of June 2000 that the defendants are misusing the said trade mark illegally. In the written statement the defendants have not disclosed any earlier point of time from which the knowledge of the misuse of the trade mark by the defendants could be attributed to the plaintiff. Thus prima facie their appears to be no delay on the part of the plaintiff in approaching this Court by filing the suit. The question of latches or acquiesces does not arise. It is not alleged by the defendants that the plaintiff had come to know about the use of the said trade mark by the defendants on any earlier point of time but the plaintiff ignored it or encouraged the defendants to carry on the misuse of the trade mark. In the case of   Hindustan Pencils Pvt. Ltd., Vs. India Stationery Products Co. ,  it was held by this Court that if the defendant acts fraudulently with the knowledge that he is violating others rights in that trade mark, the relief of injunction will not be denied to the plaintiff even if there is an inordinate delay on the part of the plaintiff in taking action against the defendants because in such cases interest of the general public has to be safeguarded. It was further observed by this Court that where there is an honest concurrent user by the defendant then inordinate delay or laches may defeat the claim for damages or rendition of accounts but the relief of injunction should not be refused because it is the interest of the general public which is the third party in such cases, which has to be kept in mind. Inordinate delay and laches may be there because the plaintiff may not be aware of the infringement by the defendants as not being serious enough to hurt the plaintiff's business. This notwithstanding, if the Court comes to the conclusion that prejudice is likely to be caused to the general public who may be mislead into buying the goods manufactured by the defendants thinking them to be the goods of the plaintiff then an injunction must be issued.  \n",
        "p_40": " 23. As already noticed according to the averments contained in the plaint, the plaintiff came to know about the alleged misuse of the trade mark only in the 3rd week of June 2000. Thus there is no delay on the part of the plaintiff in filing the suit. The defense of acquiescence on the part of the plaintiff is not available to the defendants in this case as written statement does not contain any allegation to the effect that the plaintiff had come to know about the alleged misuse on any earlier point of time but had ignored the same or encouraged the defendants to continue the misuser.  \n",
        "p_41": " 24. It is also the contention of the defendants that many other parties have applied for registration of trade mark AYUR. The details of some of these pending applications are given in para (L) of the preliminary objection of the written statement of the defendants. It was, therefore, contended that   AYUR   has become common word in the market in respect of various goods and therefore plaintiff cannot claim exclusive right over the same. The defendants have not given the requisite particulars viz. name of the parties, the type of goods they are dealing in. In absence of such details it is not possible to conclude that the mere act of filing of application for registration will prove the actual user of the said trade mark by the said applicants. In the case of   Century Traders Vs. Roshan Lal Duggar & Co      it was held that mere presence of the trade mark in the register maintained by the trade mark registry did not prove its actual user by the person in whose name the mark was registered or sought to be registered. The other parties who are alleged to have applied for registration of the trade mark AYUR in respect of their goods are not before the Court nor they are claiming any relief against the plaintiff and vice a verse. Hence, the defense that other persons are also using trade mark is not available to the defendants (  Indian Shaving products Ltd. Vs. Gift Pack and another- 1998 PTC 698.   \n",
        "p_42": " 25. At the time of the argument learned counsel for the defendants submitted that the defendants are ready and willing to change the art work/style of his trade mark v;wj  so as to make it look different from plaintiff's trade mark and this plea is also contained in para (n) of the preliminary objections in the written statement filed by the defendants. This indicates that the defendants themselves have realised that the trade mark v;wj  adopted by the defendants in the same design and style as that of the plaintiff is likely to cause confusion/deception in the mind of buyers that the goods marketed by the defendants are those of the plaintiff or defendants business is somehow associated or connected with that of the plaintiff. Moreover, in view of my findings that defendants use the trade mark will invite passing off action, the mere offer of changing the art work style or design will not be sufficient to meet the end of justice and the injunction as prayed by the plaintiff should be issued in the circumstances of the present case. Defendants are comparatively new entrants in the trade so the inconvenience caused to them in the changing their trade name would be much Lesser than the inconvenience that could be caused to the plaintiff by defendant's misuse of the trade mark and passing off their goods as that of the plaintiff. Further it will not be possible to evaluate exactly to what extent the defendant's misuse of the plaintiffs trade mark has adversely affected the plaintiff's business, its goodwill, reputation and popularity. Thus there would be no exact measure to determine the loss that would be caused to the plaintiff. Therefore, it can be safely inferred that irreparable loss would be caused to the plaintiff if the injunction as prayed for is not granted.  \n",

Singh, J\n\n\tIn this appeal by special leave the plaintiffs are the appellants.  \nTheir suit against original defendant nos. 1 to 9 was decreed for the \nsum of Rs.8,92,815.14 by the Third Joint Civil Judge (Senior \nDivision), Nagpur in Civil Suit No.52 of 1980.  On appeal by original \ndefendants 1 to 3, the High Court in First Appeal No.35 of 1988 by its \nimpugned judgment and order of April 10, 1992 allowed the appeal \nand dismissed the suit holding that in view of the provisions of \nSection 69(2) of the Indian Patnership Act (hereinafter referred to as \nthe 'Act'), the suit was not maintainable, the plaintiff being an \nunregistered firm.\n",
        "p_2": "\tThe facts of the case are not in dispute and they will be briefly \nnoticed.  Plaintiff No.1, Pursushottam, carried on business as whole-\nsale paper merchant in the name and style of \"Dinesh Paper Mart\" as \nthe sole proprietor of the concern.  During this period he supplied \ngoods to the defendant firm namely  Shivraj Fine Arts Litho Works, \na firm registered under the Partnership Act.  Defendants 2 to 9 were \nthe partners of the said firm.  In the year 1974, Special Civil Suit No.9 \nof 1974 was filed for dissolution of the defendant partnership firm and \nfor rendering of accounts.  During the pendency of the suit a receiver \nwas appointed initially to take possession of the properties of the firm \nand to run the business of the firm.  Later joint receivers were \nappointed, and it is not in dispute that at the relevant time defendant \nNo.2 and defendant No.12 were in management of the aforesaid \nregistered firm  respondent No.1 herein as joint receivers.\n",
        "p_3": "\tThe aforesaid Purushottam had business dealings with the \nrespondent No.1  firm.  Goods were supplied and payments made \nfrom time to time.  It is not in dispute that the amounts due and \npayable to the plaintiff No.1, Purushottam were fully paid up as on \nMarch 20, 1974, that is, before the date of appointment of Receiver. \nEven after appointment of the Receiver, successive Receivers \npurchased goods from Plaintiff No.1, Purushottam, herein for the \nbusiness of respondent No.1  firm.  A khata was maintained by \nplaintiff No.1  Purushottam in which payments made were duly \nentered, and at the end of the year the amount outstanding as on \nDecember 31, was carried forward to the next year.  The defendant \nfirm acknowledged their liability to pay the amount entered in the \nkhata by making an endorsement in the khata.  As at the end of the \nfinancial year 1979 a sum of Rs.6,22,713.06 was the balance due from \nthe defendant firm to plaintiff Purushottam.  The plaintiff was also \nentitled to interest at the agreed rate of 18% per annum on the balance \noutstanding for more than seven days.\n",
        "p_4": "\tWith effect from January 1, 1980 the proprietary  firm of \nPurushottam (Plaintiff No.1) was taken over by a partnership of which \nplaintiff Purushottam was also a partner.  The said partnership firm \ntook over all the assets and liabilities of \"Dinesh Paper Mart\" and \ncontinued their business in the same name.  Though the said \npartnership firm came into existence on January 1, 1980, an \napplication for registration of the firm under the Act was made on \nJanuary 14, 1980.  While the said application was pending, the instant \nsuit was filed on March 31, 1980.  Later, on November 29, 1980, the \nPlaintiff No.2  firm was granted registration under the Act.  It would \nthus appear that though the newly constituted partnership firm had \napplied for registration on January 14, 1980, on the date on which the \nsuit was filed, that is on March 31, 1980, it was an unregistered firm \nand registration was granted later on November 29, 1980.  This \ntherefore, gave rise to the objection urged on behalf of the defendants \nrelying on Section 69(2) of the Act that the suit by an unregistered \nfirm was not maintainable to enforce a right arising from a contract.\n",
        "p_5": "\tThe High Court took the view relying upon authorities that the \nsuit was barred by Section 69(2) of the Act, and even if registration \nwas subsequently granted, that would not cure the defect.  Repelling \nthe argument that in any event Plaintiff No.1, the erstwhile proprietor \nmay be entitled to enforce his claim, the Court held that once he had \ntransferred his rights to the partnership which took over all the rights \nand liabilities of the proprietary concern, he lost his exclusive right to \nrecover the amount since that had become an asset of the partnership \nfirm over which he as a partner had no exclusive right.  He, therefore, \ndid not have any enforceable subsisting claim after the partnership \ncame into existence, and, therefore, no relief could be granted to him \nin his personal capacity as erstwhile proprietor of the concern.\n",
        "p_6": "\tShri V.A. Mohta, Sr. Advocate, appearing on behalf of the \nappellants before us advanced three main submissions.  Firstly, he \nsubmitted that once registration is granted, even though after the filing \nof the suit, the suit should be held to be maintainable as from the date \non which registration is granted subject to the law of limitation.  \nSecondly, he submitted that Plaintiff No.1, Purushottam in his \npersonal capacity could sue the respondent firm for the amount in \nquestion, if the firm of which he was a partner was for reason of non-\nregistration unable to maintain a suit.  Lastly, he submitted that \nSection 69(2) of the Act is not attracted to a case where the contract in \nquestion is not with the unregistered firm and for this he relied on the \njudgment of this Court in Haldiram Bhujiawala and Anr. Vs. Anand \nKumar Deepak Kumar and Anr. : (2000) 3 SCC 250.  \n",
        "p_7": "In M/s.Shreeram Finance Corporation Vs. Yasin Khan and \nOrs. (1989) 3 SCC 476; it was held by this Court that a suit filed by \nthe existing partners of the firm after reconstitution was not \nmaintainable if the newly added partners were not shown as partners \nin the Register of Firms under the Act.  In that case the suit was filed \nin the name of the current partners as on the date of the suit, whose \nnames were not shown as partners in the Register of Firms maintained \nunder the Act.  It is no doubt true that in the aforesaid decision the bar \nwas attracted not on account of non-registration of a partnership firm \nbut on account of the fact that the persons suing had not been shown \nin the Register of Firms as partners of the firm.  Counsel for the \nrespondent submitted that Section 69(2) of the Act is mandatory and \nunless the conditions specified therein are fulfilled, a suit by a \npartnership Firm will be hit by the bar contained in that provision.\n",
        "p_8": "\tThe question as to whether the subsequent registration of the \nfirm would cure the initial defect in the filing of the suit arose for \nconsideration in D.D.A. Vs. Kochhar Construction Work and Anr. \n(1998) 8 SCC 559.  This Court held that in view of the clear provision \nof the Act it was not possible to subscribe to the view that subsequent \nregistration of the firm may cure the initial defect, because the \nproceedings were ab initio defective as they could not have been \ninstituted since the firm in whose name the proceedings were \ninstituted was not a registered firm on the date of the institution of the \nproceedings.  This Court also noticed the difference of opinion \namongst the High Courts and concluded thus:-\n",
        "p_9": "\"Counsel for the respondents, however, invited our \nattention to two decisions which take a view that \nsubsequent registration of the firm can cure the initial \ndefect provided the registration is before the period of \nlimitation has run out.  Our attention was drawn to \nM.S.A. Subramania Mudaliar Vs. East Asiatic Co. \nLtd. and Atmuri Mahalakshmi Vs.Jagadeesh Traders.  \nHowever, the High Court of Patna in Laduram \nSagarmal Vs. Jamuna Prasad Chaudhuri and the \nHigh Court of Madras in T. Savariraj Pillai Vs. R.S.S. \nVastrad & Co. take a contrary view and hold that the \nsuit is incompetent ab initio.  We have considered \nthese decisions, but in the light of the plain language \nof Section 69 of the Partnership Act read with Section \n20 of the Arbitration Act and in view of the decision \nof this Court reported in Shreeram Finance Corpn. \nWe are clearly of the opinion that proceedings under \nSection 20 of the Arbitration Act were ab initio \ndefective since the firm was not registered and the \nsubsequent registration of the firm cannot cure that \ndefect\".\n",
        "p_10": "The same view was also reiterated in U.P. State Sugar Corporation \nLtd. Vs. Jain Construction Co. And Anr. (2004) 7 SCC 332.  \n",
        "p_11": "\tThese decisions squarely answer the first submission of Shri \nV.A. Mohta. The submission must therefore be rejected.\n",
        "p_12": "\tThe second submission urged on behalf of the appellants is also \nsquarely answered by a judgment of this Court reported in Addanki \nNarayanappa and Anr. Vs.  Bhaskara Krishnappa (D) & Ors., (1966) \n3 SCR 400  This Court held:\n",
        "p_13": "\"It seems to us that looking to the scheme of the \nIndian Act no other view can reasonably be taken. \nThe whole concept of partnership is to embark upon a \njoint venture and for that purpose to bring in as capital \nmoney or even property including immovable \nproperty. Once that is done whatever is brought in \nwould cease to be the exclusive property of the person \nwho brought it in. It would be the trading asset of the \npartnership in which all the partners would have \ninterest in proportion to their share in the joint venture \nof the business of partnership. The person who \nbrought it in would, therefore, not be able to claim or \nexercise any exclusive right over any property which \nhe has brought in, much less over any other \npartnership property. He would not be able to exercise \nthis right even to the extent of his share in the \nbusiness of the partnership. As already stated, his \nright during the subsistence of the partnership is to get \nhis share of profits from time to time as may be \nagreed upon among the partners and after the \ndissolution of the partnership or with his retirement \nfrom partnership of the value of his share in the net \npartnership assets as on the date of dissolution or \nretirement after a deduction of liabilities and prior \ncharges.\"\n",
        "p_14": "\tThe High Court has, therefore, rightly held that the partnership \nhaving come into existence of which Plaintiff No.1 was a partner, and \nhe having transferred to the said partnership all his assets and \nliabilities of his proprietary concern, he had no subsisting exclusive \nright to enforce the liability against the defendants since such rights as \nhe had as the proprietor vested in the partnership.  He could not \ntherefore either file a suit or claim any relief in the suit filed by the \npartnership asserting his right as the erstwhile proprietor.  The second \nsubmission also fails.\n",
        "p_15": "This brings us to a consideration of the third submission that the \nbar in Section 69(2) of the Act is not attracted to a suit in which the \ncontract in question is not with the unregistered firm which is the \nplaintiff.  Counsel placed considerable reliance on the judgment of \nthis Court in Haldiram Bhujiawala and Anr. (supra), and submitted \nthat the principles laid down therein applied to his case with full force.  \nOn the other hand, the respondents insist that the case is clearly \ndistinguishable on facts, and in any case the observations relied upon \nby the appellants do not constitute the ratio, as it was wholly \nunnecessary to go into the question which did not fall for \nconsideration after the first question was answered in favour of the \nappellants.  \n",
        "p_16": "It therefore becomes necessary for us to notice the relevant facts \nof the case, the questions that fell for consideration, and the principles \nlaid down therein.\n",
        "p_17": "The plaintiffs in the suit were the sons of Moolchand, the first \nplaintiff being the partnership firm of which three of his sons were \npartners, and the second plaintiff being his fourth son.  Their case was \nthat the partnership of which their late father Moolchand was a partner \nwas the duly registered proprietor of the trademark Haldiram \nBhujiawala.  On dissolution of the firm on 16.11.1974 in terms of the \ndeed of dissolution, Moolchand became the sole proprietor of the \ntrademark for the whole country except State of West Bengal.  Smt. \nKamla Devi, another partner, who was the wife of R.L. Aggarwal a \nbrother of Moolchand, was given ownership of the trademark rights \nfor West Bengal.  Upon the death of Moolchand in 1985 his four sons \ngot themselves recorded as joint proprietors of the trademark.  Three \nof them formed a partnership in the year 1983 and were running a \nshop in Chandni Chowk, Delhi.  \n",
        "p_18": "In the meantime on 10.10.1977 R.L. Aggarwal and his son \napplied in Calcutta for registration of the same trademark in their \nname claiming to be full owners of the trademark, without disclosing \nthe dissolution deed of 16.11.1974.  In these circumstances a suit was \nfiled by the partnership firm with three of the sons of Moolchand as \npartners thereof being the first plaintiff.  The second plaintiff in the \nsuit was the fourth son of Moolchand.  They claimed the relief of \ninjunction restraining the defendants from using the said trademark, \ndamages, and for destruction of the material etc.  The defendants filed \nan application under Order 7, Rule 11, CPC for summary dismissal of \nthe suit since Plaintiff No.1 partnership firm was not a registered \npartnership firm on the date of the filing of the suit.  The Trial Court \ndismissed the application and so did the appellate bench of the High \nCourt of Delhi.  The defendants appealed to this Court by Special \nLeave.\n",
        "p_19": "Two questions were framed which arose for consideration.\n\"(i)  Whether Section 69(2) bars a suit by a firm \nnot registered on the date of suit where permanent \ninjunction and damages are claimed in respect of \ntrademark as a statutory right or by invoking common \nlaw principles applicable to a passing-off action?\n",
        "p_20": "(ii) Whether the words \"arising from a \ncontract\" in Section 69(2) refer only to a situation \nwhere an unregistered firm is enforcing a right arising \nfrom a contract entered into by the firm with the \ndefendant during the course of its business or whether \nthe bar under Section 69(2) can be extended to any \ncontract referred to in the plaint unconnected with the \ndefendant, as the source of title to the suit property?\" \n",
        "p_21": "The first question was answered relying upon the law laid down \nby this Court in Raptakos Brett & Co. Ltd. Vs. Ganesh Property \n(1998) 7 SCC 184 that the bar in Section 69(2) of the Act did not \noperate to bar a suit by an unregistered firm seeking enforcement of a \nstatutory right or a common law right.  It was held that a passing off \naction being a common law action based on tort, and not on contract, \nSection 69(2) did not apply.  The reliefs of permanent injunction and \ndamages were claimed on the basis of infringement of registered \ntrademark.  Thus the suit was held to be one based on statutory right \nunder the Trade Marks Act, and therefore not barred by Section 69(2).\n",
        "p_22": "\tCounsel for the respondents contended before us that having \nanswered the first question in favour of the plaintiffs, it was wholly \nunnecessary for the disposal of the appeal to consider the second \nquestion formulated by this Court.  Therefore, any observation made \nor principle enunciated, in relation to the second question was at best \nobiter, and not a binding precedent. \n",
        "p_23": "\tWe shall assume in favour of the respondents that the \nobservations made and principles laid down are obiter and therefore \nnot a bind precedent.  Even so that does not preclude this Court from \nappreciating the reasons given for the principles laid down, and if the \nreasoning appears to this Court to be cogent, and merit acceptance, the \nsame may be accepted by this Court as its own and applied to the case \nbefore it.\n",
        "p_24": "\tIn Haldiram Bhujiawala and Anr. (supra) this Court noticed the \nrecommendations made by the Special Committee in its report which \nwas considered by the legislature while enacting the Partnership Act, \n1932.  The Committee recommended that registration of firms be \nmade optional as it considered making registration compulsory too \ndrastic for a beginning in India.  It was proposed that registration \nshould lie entirely with the discretion of the firm or partner concerned, \nbut any firm which was not registered will be unable to enforce its \nclaim against third parties in the civil court; and any partner who is \nnot registered will be unable to enforce his claims either against third \nparties or against fellow partners.  Paragraphs 18 and 19 of the Report \nreads as follows :-\n",
        "p_25": "\"18. Once registration has been effected the statement \nrecorded in the register regarding the constitution of \nthe firm will be conclusive proof of the facts therein \ncontained against the partners making them and no \npartner whose name is on the register will be \npermitted to deny that he is a partner  with certain \nnatural and proper exceptions which will be indicated \nlater.  This should afford a strong protection to \npersons dealing with firms against false denials of \npartnership and the evasion of liability by the \nsubstantial members of a firm.\n",
        "p_26": "19. On the other hand, a third party who deals \nwith a firm and knows that a new partner has been \nintroduced can either make registration of the new \npartner a condition for further dealings, or content \nhimself with the certain security of the other partners \nand the chance of proving by other evidence, the \npartnership of the new but unregistered partner.  A \nthird party who deals with a firm without knowing of \nthe addition of a new partner counts on the credit of \nthe old partners only and will not be prejudiced by the \nfailure of the new partner to register\".\n",
        "p_27": "\tIt would thus appear that registration of a firm was conceived as \na protection to third parties dealing with a partnership firm.  \nRegistration ensured the certainty of existence of the firm and its \nmembership, so that later an unsuspecting third party contracting with \nthe firm may not run the risk of being defeated on discovery that \nneither the partnership firm nor its partners existed in fact.  On the \nother hand, an unregistered firm could not bring a suit for enforcing \nits right arising from a contract.\n",
        "p_28": "\tIn Raptakos Brett & Co. Ltd. (Supra) this court after noticing \nSection 69 of the Act observed :\n",
        "p_29": "\"A mere look at the aforesaid provision shows that the \nsuit filed by an unregistered firm against a third party \nfor enforcement of any right arising from a contract \nwith such a third party would be barred at its very \ninception.  To attract the aforesaid bar to the suit, the \nfollowing conditions must be satisfied:\n",
        "p_30": "\t(i)  That the plaintiff-partnership firm on the \ndate of the suit must not be registered under the \nprovisions of the Partnership Act and consequently or \neven otherwise, the persons suing are not shown in the \nRegister of Firms as partners of the firm, on the date \nof the suit.\n",

        "p_33": "\tRelying upon the aforesaid analysis this Court in Haldiram \nBhujiawala and Anr. (supra) held that the contract contemplated by \nSection 69 of the Act is the contract entered into by the firm with the \nthird party defendant.  The contract by the unregistered firm referred \nto in Section 69(2) must not only be one entered into by the firm with \na third party defendant, but must also be one entered into by the \nplaintiff firm in the course of the business dealings of the plaintiff \nfirm with such third party defendant.\n",
        "p_34": "\tWith respect, we find ourselves in complete agreement with the \nprinciples enunciated in Haldiram Bhujiawala and Anr.

If the right sought to be enforced does not arise \nfrom a contract to which the unregistered firm is a party, or is not \nentered into in connection with the business of the unregistered firm \nwith a third party, the bar of Section 69(2) will not apply.\n",
        "p_35": "\tIn the instant case the contract was entered into with the \nrespondent firm by the erstwhile proprietor of the concern namely \nPurushottam.

When he entered into partnership with others, \nhe contributed to the partnership by way of his contribution to the \ncapital, all the assets and liabilities of his erstwhile proprietary \nconcern.  Thus, though the partnership firm, which was unregistered, \nbecame entitled to enforce the contractual obligation of the defendant \nfirm which it owed to Purushottam, the contract was not one entered \ninto by the unregistered firm with a third party, nor was it one entered \ninto by the unregistered firm in the course of its business dealings \nwith the defendants.  So viewed, the bar of Section 69(2) cannot apply \nto the suit filed by the Plaintiff  appellants.\n",

It was also made clear that the Plaintiff shall have the right to seek, apply for and obtain by an independent application in any court of competent jurisdiction a mandatory injunction to enforce the provisions of the relevant paragraph of the agreement. This clause reads as follows:\n",
        "p_7": "THIRTEENTH: In connection with the performance of this agreement by Lloyd, but not otherwise, Fedders granted permission to Lloyd to use the trade name and label Fedders as hereinbefore provided. The parties understand and agree that the aforesaid trade name and label Fedders is and shall at all times be and remain the exclusive property of Fedders. Upon the termination or cancellation of this agreement for any reason whatsoever (and in addition to the provisions concerning the termination of the use of the Fedders name as hereinabove provided in paragraph TWELFTH of this agreement), Lloyd shall forthwith discontinue the use of the trade name or label Fedders in connection with any merchandise manufactured, produced, assembled or sold by it. In addition to but not in limitation of any other rights and remedies to which Fedders may be entitled by the terms of this agreement or otherwise, and despite any provision for arbitration hereinafter contained, Fedders shall have the right to seek, apply for and obtain by independent application in any court of competent jurisdiction a mandatory injunction to enforce the provisions of this paragraph THIRTEENTH of this agreement.\n",
        "p_8": "5. Apparently in view of the license granted to LEECO, but despite the agreement dated 21st May, 1956, LEECO applied on 18th July, 1956 for registration of the trademark Fedders. On 19th February, 1958 the trademark Fedders was registered by the Trade Marks Registration Authority in favor of LEECO under No. 175253. This appears to have taken effect from the date of the application made by LEECO, that is, 18th July, 1956. While the application was pending consideration with the Trade Marks Registration Authority, Fedders Lloyd Corporation, Defendant No. 18 was incorporated on 16th January, 1957 to take over the business of LEECO, as would appear from the narration of facts in Fedders Lloyd Corporation Ltd. v. Fedders Corporation, 2005 (30) PTC 353. Soon thereafter, on 11th February, 1957 LEECO issued a no-objection in favor of Defendant No. 18 to the effect that that Defendant may manufacture and market air-conditioners, refrigerators, air-conditioning machinery, components, etc. under their proposed trademark Fedders Lloyd since it was different from the trademark Fedders of LEECO.\n",
        "p_9": "6. It appears that when the Plaintiff came to know that its trademark Fedders had been registered in the name of LEECO, it raised some objection with the result that on 24th February, 1958 LEECO assigned the trademark in favor of the Plaintiff, who then became the registered proprietor of the trademark No. 175253 dated 18th July, 1956. The registration in favor of the Plaintiff was made by the Trade Marks Registration Authority on or about 20th August, 1958 but with retrospective effect.\n",
        "p_10": "Page 1943\n \n\n",
        "p_11": "7. The position, as it stood on 20th August, 1958 was that the trademark or label Fedders had been licensed by the Plaintiff to LEECO, who got the trademark registered in its own name. While that registration was subsisting, Defendant No. 18 was incorporated to take over its business and then LEECO permitted Defendant No. 18 to use that trademark or label. On an objection raised by the Plaintiff to the registration of the trademark or label Fedders by LEECO, the latter assigned it to the Plaintiff, who became the registered proprietor thereof in India and so the position remains till today. Also, by the agreement dated 21st May, 1956 LEECO recognized that the trade name and label Fedders was and shall continue to remain the exclusive property of the Plaintiff.\n",
        "p_12": "8. Notwithstanding some ups and downs, the agreement dated 21st May, 1956 between the Plaintiff and LEECO ran its course of five years. In the absence of anything to the contrary, it appears that the agreement was executed satisfactorily during its currency by both the parties so much so that in October, 1963 the Plaintiff and Defendant No. 18 sought to enter into a fresh license agreement for a period of five years whereby Defendant No. 18 would be permitted to use the trademark and label Fedders on its products.\n",
        "p_13": "9. Apparently in pursuance of this, on 10th October, 1963 the Plaintiff sent a letter to Defendant No. 18 confirming that permission had been given to it to include the word Fedders which is its registered trademark in the name of Defendant No. 18 in conjunction with a license agreement for use of the said trademark on the products, and the entry of Defendant No. 18 as a registered user in India under registration No. 175253. The letter dated 10th October, 1963 also mentioned that upon termination of the entry of Defendant No. 18 as a registered user, it would change its name by deleting the words Fedders there from and use another name which would not include as a part thereof the word Fedders or any other similar name. \n",
        "p_14": "10. Significantly, Defendant No. 18 did not object or protest the contents of this letter or claim that it was independently entitled to use the name Fedders by virtue of the no objection given to it by LEECO on 11th February, 1957 or that the Plaintiff had no authority to require Defendant No. 18 not to use the name Fedders as a part of its corporate name. In other words, Defendant No. 18 acknowledged the exclusive right of the Plaintiff to the use of Fedders. \n",
        "p_15": "11. On 11th October, 1963 the Plaintiff and Defendant No. 18 entered into a royalty license agreement whereby the Plaintiff granted to Defendant No. 18 the sole and exclusive right and license for a period of five years from 11th October, 1963 to assemble, manufacture and sell air-conditioners etc. The agreement stated that the Plaintiff had represented that it has the right to grant and does grant to Defendant No. 18 the authorization to use the Fedders trade name and label and the trademark Fedders which has been registered in India in respect of the Plaintiff(tm)s product.\n",
        "p_16": "12. Clause 8 of the agreement made it clear that Defendant No. 18 will not represent in any way that it has any right or title to the ownership of the trade name and/or trademark Fedders or to the eventual registration thereof since it is understood that such trade name and/or trademark and Page 1944 the registration thereof will continue to be in the ownership of the Plaintiff and will be used by Defendant No. 18 on behalf of and in the interest of the Plaintiff. Defendant No. 18 specifically recognized the Plaintiff(tm)s title in and to the trade name and/or trademark Fedders and that it would not at any time do or suffer to be done any act or thing which would in any manner impair the right of the Plaintiff in and to the said trade name and/or trademark and to its registration. Defendant No. 18 also agreed that it shall not either directly or indirectly at any time challenge the title of the Plaintiff to such trade name and/or trademark or the validity of such registration obtained by the Plaintiff for such trademark. \n",
        "p_17": "13. It must be mentioned at this stage that learned Counsel for Defendant No. 18 contended that the agreement dated 11th October, 1963 was not a concluded contract since some further steps were required to be taken by the parties. It was contended that in terms of Clause 13 of the agreement, it would become a binding contract only when a duly executed counterpart is actually received by the Plaintiff at its principal office, but no such duly executed counterpart was sent by Defendant No. 18 to the Plaintiff with the result that the contract was not concluded. \n",
        "p_18": "14. I am afraid this argument is not available to learned Counsel for Defendant No. 18 for three reasons. Firstly, because in CO No. 10 of 1982 (Fedders Lloyd Corporation Pvt. Ltd. v. Fedders Corporation) decided on 19th September, 1997, a learned Single Judge of this Court held in paragraph 25 that Defendant No. 18 was admittedly using the trademark Fedders under the agreement dated 11th October, 1963. I am of the view that Defendant No. 18 cannot be allowed to approbate and reprobate at the same time. \n",
        "p_19": "15. Secondly, in an appeal against the aforesaid decision [Fedders Lloyd Corporation Ltd. v. Fedders Corporation 2005 (30) PTC 353 (Delhi) (DB)], the Division Bench noted the reliance placed upon Clause 13 mentioned above and observed that Defendant No. 18 had availed benefits under the agreement dated 11th October, 1963. It was also noted that in the petition decided by the learned Single Judge, Defendant No. 18 had admitted that it had entered into a technical collaboration agreement with the Plaintiff in 1963 which terminated in the year 1968. In paragraph 11 of the petition, it was stated as follows:\n",
        "p_20": "In the year 1963 the petitioner No. 1 had entered into a technical collaboration arrangement with the respondent No. 1 with regard to the manufacture of window type Air-conditioner which arrangement concluded in the year 1968. Thereafter inspite of the efforts made by the parties no further arrangement could be entered into.\n",
        "p_21": "The Division Bench also noted the decision of J.K. Jain v. Ziff Davies 2000 PTC 244 (DB) to the effect that an ex-licensee cannot deny the rights of an owner of a trademark in the context of the admission of Defendant No. 18 that it had entered into a technical collaboration agreement with the Plaintiff in 1963. In the totality of these circumstances, I am of opinion that Defendant No. 18 cannot repudiate the agreement dated 11th October, 1963.\n",
        "p_22": "Page 1945\n \n\n",
        "p_23": "16.Thirdly, in proceedings initiated by the Plaintiff before the Calcutta High Court, Defendants No. 18 and 19 filed a written statement in which it was stated (in paragraph 13) as follows: With reference to paragraphs 2 and 3 of the several sub-paragraphs of paragraph 3 of the petition I say that the plaintiff and defendant No. 1 entered into an agreement dated October 11, 1963 which was amended by a further agreement on or about October 27, 1963 (hereinafter referred to as the said agreement) being annexure to the petition. Under the circumstances, it is too late in the day for Defendants No. 18 and 19 to say that it did not enter into any agreement dated 11th October, 1963. The agreement dated 11th October, 1963 has been affirmed by Defendants No. 18 and 19 in this Court and the Calcutta High Court. \n",
        "p_24": "17. In my opinion, these facts and the decision of the Division Bench are a complete answer to the contention raised by learned Counsel for Defendant No. 18 that no agreement was entered into between the parties on 11th October, 1963. This matter has conclusively been decided against Defendant No. 18 and cannot be reopened in the manner in which it is now being done. \n",
        "p_25": "18. Between 1968 (when the agreement dated 11th October, 1963 ran its full course) and late 1971, it appears that the Plaintiff and Defendant No. 18 were trying to negotiate an extension of the agreement dated 11th October, 1963 but could not do so. Therefore, in early 1972, the Plaintiff filed a suit in the Calcutta High Court against Defendants No. 18 and 19 (being Suit No. 361 of 1972) in which it was alleged that they were infringing the trademark of the Plaintiff and passing off their name as that of the Plaintiff. On 31st May, 1974 a learned Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court granted an interim injunction restraining the defendants therein from infringing the registered trademark of the Plaintiff but in appeal, a Division Bench stayed that order. Eventually, that suit was dismissed for non-prosecution some time in September, 1999 \" but more of that later. \n",
        "p_26": "19. In the meanwhile, Defendant Nos. 18 and 19 filed CO No. 19 of 1982 (a reference has already been made to this above) in which it was alleged that the Plaintiff had not used its trademark for a period of more than five years and one month and, therefore, under the provisions of Sections 46 and 56 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958, the trademark Fedders be removed from the register of trademarks. As already mentioned above, the petition was dismissed by a learned Single Judge of this Court on 19th September, 1997 and an appeal against that decision was also dismissed in Fedders Lloyd Corporation Ltd. v. Fedders Corporation 2005 (30) PTC 353 (Delhi) (DB). A very significant finding arrived at by the Division Bench was that the Plaintiff had been able to satisfy the Court that non-use of the trademark was due to special circumstances in the trade. Consequently, on this issue the Division Bench found no merit in the appeal filed by Defendant Nos. 18 and 19.\n",
        "p_27": "Page 1946\n \n\n",
        "p_28": "20. After the decision of the learned Single Judge (and during the pendency of the appeal), the Plaintiff filed the present suit for a permanent injunction restraining the Defendants (including Defendant Nos. 18 and 19) from infringing its registered trademark by using Fedders in respect of air-conditioners, refrigerators, refrigeration and air-conditioning machinery, parts and fittings thereof and also for a permanent injunction restraining the Defendants (including Defendant No. 18) from using the name Fedders Lloyd Corporation Ltd. or any other corporate name which includes the registered trademark Fedders. \n",
        "p_29": "21. The Plaintiff also filed CS (OS) No. 102 of 2000 for restraining the defendants therein by a permanent injunction from using the corporate name Fedders India Private Ltd. and Fedders Aircon Private Ltd. as well as the mark Fedders in respect of air-conditioners, refrigerators, refrigeration and air-conditioning machinery, parts and fittings thereof. \n",
        "p_30": "22. One of the defendants in CS (OS) No. 102 of 2000 along with Defendant No. 18 filed CS (OS) No. 2800 of 1998 in this Court against the Plaintiff praying for a permanent injunction restraining the Plaintiff from using the trademark Fedders in relation to air-conditioners, refrigeration equipments and parts thereof. \n",
        "p_31": "23. Applications for an interim injunction in all these three suits were heard on 20th, 21st, 22nd and 23rd March, 2006 and by this order, I propose to dispose of all these applications. \n",
        "p_32": "24. On these broad facts, it was submitted by learned Counsel for the Plaintiff that there is no doubt about the fact that the trademark Fedders belongs to the Plaintiff; this is more than abundantly clear from the agreements entered into by the Plaintiff with LEECO and Defendant No. 18 in 1956 and 1963 respectively. Since Defendant No. 18 was incorporated only to take over the business of LEECO, it cannot be said that Defendant No. 18 was ignorant about the title of the Plaintiff to its trademark; on the contrary, LEECO and Defendant No. 18 had subsequently colluded to use the trademark Fedders for their products thereby infringing the trademark owned by the Plaintiff. It was submitted that there is no delay in approaching this Court for grant of relief, particularly since the cause of action is a continuing one. The Plaintiff has a worldwide reputation which needs to be protected from damage by entities such as Defendant No. 18. It was contended that the mere fact that the suit filed by the Plaintiff in the Calcutta High Court was dismissed in default does not preclude the Plaintiff from agitating for relief in this Court. \n",
        "p_33": "25. On the other hand, learned Counsel for Defendant No. 18 contended that LEECO and Defendant No. 18 were the only users of the trademark Fedders. No injunction could be granted in favor of the Plaintiff after a gap of more than 40 or 50 years since the trademark Fedders was first used by LEECO and Defendant No. 18. It was contended that during this period, not only has the Plaintiff abandoned its trademark but also that Defendant No. 18 has built up a considerable business reputation, market acceptability and distinctiveness of its own which should not be hindered by the grant of an injunction. It was submitted that in any case, the dismissal of the Calcutta Page 1947 suit filed by the Plaintiff is fatal to the grant of an injunction in favor of the Plaintiff. \n",
        "p_34": "26. Having heard learned Counsel for the parties, I am of the view that the Plaintiff has made out a strong prima facie case for the grant of an injunction. It has also been able to show that the balance of convenience lies in favor of the prayer of the Plaintiff being granted and that if an injunction is not granted in its favor, the Plaintiff will suffer an irreparable loss and injury, which cannot be monetarily compensated. \n",
        "p_35": "What is the effect of the trademark or trade name Fedders being registered in the name of the Plaintiff?\n",
        "p_36": "27. In Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma v. Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories , the Supreme Court held that an action for infringement is a statutory remedy conferred on the proprietor of a registered trademark for the vindication of its exclusive right to the use of that trademark in relation to its goods. It was further held that when the defendant use of the mark which is claimed to infringe the plaintiff's mark is shown to be in the course of trade, the question whether there has been an infringement is to be decided by comparison of the two marks. Where the two marks are identical no further questions arise, for then the infringement is made out. The Supreme Court made observations to a similar effect in National Bell Co. v. Metal Goods Manufacturing Co. AIR 1971 SC 898. In so far as the present case is concerned, there is no dispute about the fact that the Plaintiff is the registered proprietor of the trademark Fedders and Defendant No. 18 is using that trademark in goods manufactured by it as well as in its corporate name. Quite clearly, a case for infringement of the trademark has been made out on the admitted position of the parties. \n",
        "p_37": "28. In American Home Products Corporation v. Mac Laboratories Pvt. Ltd. , the Supreme Court observed that when a person gets his trademark registered, he acquires valuable rights by reason of such registration. It was observed that registration of a trademark gives him the exclusive right to the use of that trademark in connection with goods in respect of which it is registered, and if there is any invasion of this right by any other person using the mark, which is the same or deceptively similar to his trademark, he can protect his trademark by an action for infringement in which he can obtain an injunction, damages or an account of profits made by the other person. In such an action, the registration of the trademark is prima facie evidence of its validity. \n",
        "p_38": "29. It is, therefore, possible to proceed on the basis that since the Plaintiff has the exclusive right to use the trademark Fedders and that Defendants No. 18 and 19 are infringing that trademark, they can be injuncted from doing so. The reason why a different assumption cannot be made is that neither LEECO nor Defendants No. 18 and 19 can claim any right to use the trademark Fedders after the agreements dated 21st May, 1956 and 11th October, 1963 came to an end.\n",
        "p_39": "Page 1948\n \n\n",
        "p_40": "30. It was contended by learned Counsel Defendant No. 18 that LEECO, who was earlier the registered proprietor of the trademark Fedders had granted permission to Defendant No. 18 to use that trademark and that it was on this basis that Defendant No. 18 was using the trademark for the last so many years.\n",
        "p_41": "31. I am afraid this contention proceeds on certain incorrect premises. In the first place LEECO knew quite well through the agreement dated 21st May, 1956 that it was entitled to use the trademark Fedders only for a period of five years from 30th June, 1956 onwards. It is not as if a license was given to LEECO to use the trademark Fedders forever. It was also made clear that the trademark Fedders is the exclusive property of the Plaintiff and that upon termination of the agreement dated 21st May, 1956, LEECO should forthwith discontinue use of the trademark Fedders. Under these circumstances, LEECO could have given permission to Defendant No. 18 to use the trademark Fedders for a maximum period of five years at the most. This permission could not be indefinite as made out by learned Counsel for Defendant No. 18. Moreover, the record shows that when the Plaintiff came to know that LEECO had registered the trademark Fedders in its own name, it immediately raised an objection with the result that on 24th February, 1958 LEECO assigned the trademark in favor of the Plaintiff, which then became its registered proprietor. The right of Defendant No. 18, therefore, flowed from permission granted by the Plaintiff to LEECO and then from the no-objection granted by LEECO to Defendant No. 18. The validity of this was only for a period of five years from 30th June, 1956, the date from which the agreement dated 21st May, 1956 between the Plaintiff and LEECO was to take effect.\n",
        "p_42": "32. Thereafter, the Plaintiff gave the right to Defendant No. 18 to use the trademark Fedders for a period of five years, by virtue of the agreement dated 11th October, 1963. After this period came to an end, Defendant No. 18 had no right to use the trademark Fedders, which was the exclusive property of the Plaintiff. It is under these circumstances that it must be held that the continued use of the trademark Fedders by Defendant No. 18 from 1968 onwards was unauthorised and in violation of the rights available to the Plaintiff as the registered proprietor of the trademark Fedders.\n",
        "p_43": "33. Learned counsel for Defendant No. 18 placed reliance on a report prepared by Sofres-Mode on 15th October, 1998 of a consumer research on brand awareness and associations to contend that Fedders was more closely associated with Defendant No. 18 than with the Plaintiff. The address and identity of Sofres-Mode has not been disclosed in the report and I find that the question to be answered by them has an obvious slant need to find out whether Fedders in India is associated with Fedders Lloyd or with Fedders North America Inc.. It is also well known that statistical reports of this nature hide more than they reveal and so I am not inclined to give much importance to it. Learned counsel referred to Time Warner Entertainment Company v. A.K. Das 1997 (17) PTC 35 to submit that a learned Single Judge of this Court had accepted another report by Mode. However, I find that in that case the report was supported by an affidavit, which is not so in the present case Page 1949 and, moreover the report in that case was in a totally different context and for an extremely limited purpose. Even if the report in the present case were supported by an affidavit, it would make no difference to the merits of the controversy. Consequently, I find no substance in this contention of learned Counsel for Defendant No. 18 and hold that the Plaintiff had the exclusive right to use Fedders and neither Defendant No. 18 nor LEECO had any right to do so, at least after 1968. Can an ex-licensee claim any right over a trademark of its former licensor?\n",
        "p_44": " 34. Since there was an agreement dated 11th October, 1963 between the Plaintiff and Defendant No. 18, which agreement came to an end after five years, can Defendant No. 18 claim user of the trademark Fedders either for its products or as a part of its corporate name? In Velcro Industries v. Velcro India Ltd. 1993 (1) Arb. LR 465, a learned Single Judge of the Bombay High Court (S.N. Variava, J.) rejected a contention made on behalf of the defendants therein that they are entitled to continue use of Velcro as a part of their corporate name because they have independently developed a reputation in India. It was noted that the defendants in that case were merely acting as licensees and even if the agreement between the parties did not provide that on termination of the license, the defendants would cease to use Velcro as a part of their trade name, that would make no difference, since the trademark Velcro is a registered trademark of the plaintiff and to allow the defendants to use it as a part of their corporate name is to permit them to give an impression to the public that they are still connected with or have a license from the plaintiffs. In the present case, as has been noticed above, the agreements between the parties made it absolutely clear that after termination of the agreements, neither LEECO nor Defendant No. 18 would be entitled to use the trademark Fedders. Therefore, the Plaintiff in the present case is on a much stronger footing than the plaintiff in Velcro Industries.\n",
        "p_45": "35. In Rob Mathys India Pvt. Ltd. v. Synthes Ag Chur 1997 (17) PTC 669 (DB), this Court echoed the view expressed by the Supreme Court in Power Control Appliances v. Sumeet Machines Pvt. Ltd. JT 1994 (2) SC 17 to the effect that it is a settled principle of law relating to trademarks that there can be only one mark, one source and one proprietor. A trademark cannot have two origins. It was held that after termination of the collaboration agreement between the parties to that litigation, the appellant therein, not the owner of the trademark, could not use the word Synthes or the trademark AO/ASIF after revocation of the collaboration agreement.\n",
        "p_46": "36. In this context, reference has already been made above to the Division Bench decision in J.K. Jain wherein it was held that an ex licensee, having taken the benefit of an agreement with the licensor is estopped from resisting an application for an injunction by the licensor after termination of the agreement between the parties. \n",
        "p_47": "37. Applying the law laid down by these decisions, it must be held that not only had the Plaintiff the exclusive right to use the trademark Fedders, but that after termination of the agreements dated 21st May, 1956 and Page 1950 11th October, 1963 LEECO and Defendant No. 18 respectively had no right or authority to use the trademark Fedders or to challenge the exclusive right of the Plaintiff to the trademark Fedders. Nevertheless, Defendant No. 18 continued to use that trademark. It must also be held that, in fact, user of the trademark Fedders by Defendant No. 18 after termination of the agreement dated 11th October, 1963 was unauthorized and that it infringed the right of the Plaintiff to its exclusive user. Has the Plaintiff has acquiesced in the user of the trademark Fedders by Defendants No. 18 and 19? Is the Plaintiff guilty of undue delay and laches in approaching this Court for relief?\n",
        "p_48": "38. The question of acquiescence (if not abandonment) and delay in approaching this Court for relief was agitated by learned Counsel for Defendant No. 18 on several grounds. It was pointed out that the facts show that in the Calcutta suit filed by the Plaintiff against Defendants No. 18 and 19, an injunction was granted by a learned Single Judge on 31st May, 1974 in favor of the Plaintiff, but this was stayed by the Division Bench on 14th June, 1974 read with the order dated 21st January, 1975. Thereafter, Defendants No. 18 and 19 filed a cancellation petition under the provisions of Section 46 and 56 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 being CO No. 10 of 1982 in this Court. In the cancellation proceedings, it was alleged that the trademark Fedders, registered in favor of the Plaintiff, should be removed from the appropriate register since the Plaintiff had not used it for a continuous period of five years and one month before filing of the application. During the pendency of the cancellation proceedings, Defendants No. 18 and 19 filed an application in the Calcutta High Court for a stay of the suit. By an order dated 2nd June, 1983 a learned Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court stayed the proceedings in so far as infringement of the Plaintiff's trademark is concerned, but declined to stay the proceedings with regard to the relief claimed by the Plaintiff in relation to passing off. Despite this, the Plaintiff took no steps in the suit on the issue of passing off, and the suit was eventually dismissed in default in September 1999.\n",
        "p_49": "39. Learned counsel for the Plaintiff submitted that even though proceedings were pending in the Calcutta High Court, Defendants No. 18 and 19 decided to open up a new front in this Court by filing a cancellation petition. When this Court dismissed CO No. 10 of 1982 on 19th September, 1997 on merits, the contention of the Plaintiff on infringement was completely vindicated, and if the Calcutta suit was subsequently dismissed in default in September, 1999, that would hardly matter.\n",
        "p_50": "40. It was submitted by learned Counsel for the Plaintiff that these being the facts, they cannot be used against the Plaintiff for several reasons. In the first place, it is contended, and I think rightly, that the continued use of the trademark Fedders by Defendant No. 18 is a continuing wrong and therefore the dismissal of the Calcutta suit for non-prosecution is of no consequence.\n",
        "p_51": "41. The dismissal of the Calcutta suit for non-prosecution is not res judicata and does not preclude the Plaintiff from filing a fresh suit on other or further Page 1951 causes of action. In Sheodan Singh v. Daryao Kunwar , the Supreme Court held in paragraph 13 of the Report, Reliance in this connection is placed on the well settled principle that in order that a matter may be said to have been heard and finally decided, the decision in the former suit must have been on the merits. Where, for example, the former suit was dismissed by the trial Court for want of jurisdiction, or for default of plaintiff's appearance, or on the ground of non-joinder of parties or misjoinder of parties or multi-fariousness, or on the ground that the suit was badly framed, or on the ground of a technical mistake, or for failure on the part of the plaintiff to produce probate or letter of administration or succession certificate when the same is required by law to entitle the plaintiff to a decree, or for failure to furnish security for costs, or on the ground of improper valuation or for failure to pay additional court fee on a plaint which was undervalued or for want of cause of action or on the ground that it is premature and the dismissal is confirmed in appeal (if any) the decision not being on the merits would not be res judicata in a subsequent suit.\n",
        "p_52": "42. Secondly, in Bengal Waterproof Limited v. Bombay Waterproof Manufacturing Company , the Supreme Court held that, Similarly whenever and wherever a person commits breach of a registered trademark of another he commits a recurring act of breach or infringement of such trademark giving a recurring and fresh cause of action on each time of such infringement to the party aggrieved. It is difficult to agree how in such as case when in historical past earlier suit was disposed of as technically not maintainable in absence of proper reliefs, for all times to come in future defendant of such a suit should be armed with a license to go on committing fresh acts of infringement and passing off with impunity without being subject to any legal action against such future acts\n \n\n",
        "p_53": "43. The contention of learned Counsel for the Plaintiff was, and which must be accepted, that the infringement of the Plaintiff's trademark by Defendant No. 18 gave it a continuing and recurring cause of action and merely because the Calcutta suit was dismissed in default and for non-prosecution does not prevent the Plaintiff from filing a suit in this Court on the basis of subsequent infringements of its trademark.\n",
        "p_54": "44. In this regard, reference may also be made to Power Control Appliances wherein the Supreme Court held that acquiescence implies positive acts and not merely silence or inaction as is involved in laches. It is a course of conduct inconsistent with the claim for exclusive right in a trademark, trade name, etc. This decision was cited by learned Counsel for the Plaintiff in support of his contention that it is not as if the Plaintiff was just sitting back watching the invasion of its right under its registered trademark. It Page 1952 was submitted on facts, that in 1972, the Plaintiff approached the Calcutta High Court and the litigation continued there till some time in 1999. From 1982 till 1997, the Plaintiff was protecting its interests in the petition filed by Defendants No. 18 and 19 in this Court under Sections 46 and 56 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. In September 1997, the Plaintiff succeeded in having the petition filed by Defendants No. 18 and 19 dismissed on merits. A little later, in 1998, the Plaintiff instituted the present proceedings to protect its rights. Therefore, all through for the last about 30 years the Plaintiff had been taking adequate steps to safeguard its rights and protect its interests. \n",
        "p_55": "45. In Midas Hygiene Industries (P) Ltd. and Anr. v. Sudhir Bhatia and Ors. , the Supreme Court held that in cases of infringement of a trademark or a copyright, it is well settled that normally an injunction must follow. It was observed that mere delay in bringing an action is not sufficient to defeat the grant of an injunction in such cases. The grant of an injunction also becomes necessary if it prima facie appears that the adoption of the infringed trademark was dishonest. In the present case, there is no reason why, after termination of the agreement dated 11th October, 1963, Defendant No. 18 should continue to use the name Fedders, which is quite foreign to it. The facts of the present case more than strongly suggest that the use of Fedders by Defendant No. 18 was quite dishonest, requiring the issuance of an injunction as prayed for. \n",
        "p_56": "46. How did Defendant No. 18 come by the word Fedders so that it claims a right to be able to use that word in its corporate name or as a trademark? Learned counsel for Defendant No. 18 had no answer to this, obviously because it was difficult to admit that it comes from nowhere else except the Plaintiff. In this context a similar question had arisen in Revlon Inc. v. Sarita Manufacturing Co. 1997 III AD (DELHI) 897 and it was answered in the following words, No satisfactory explanation has been given by the defendants as to how they came to adopt the trade marks which are registered in the name of the plaintiffs. Word Revlon does not appear in the dictionary. It cannot be a mere co-incidence that the defendants had adopted the same mark for their products which was registered in the name of the plaintiffs and which have a world wide market. In my view, the adoption of marks registered in the name of the plaintiffs by the defendants for their products cannot be considered honest and in such a case even the plea of delay and laches, in my opinion, would be of no avail to the defendants. In case, the defendants had chosen to continue to use the trade marks registered in the name of the plaintiffs, in spite of the plaintiffs objection, they, in my view, had been doing so at their own risk and they cannot derive any advantage from such user. The above observations are quite apposite to this case. \n",

        "p_58": "47. In Swaran Singh Trading as Appliances Emporium v. Usha Industries (India) New Delhi and Anr. , a Division Bench of this Court held that the effect of registration of a trademark is to give an exclusive right of user to the proprietor of the registered trademark, subject to the condition that if there is a user prior to the date of registration, then that user may continue. The effect of a registered trademark is that even if there is some delay in enforcing the statutory right, the exclusive right of user cannot be lost. The principles governing other types of injunctions are not to be readily applied to the infringement of a trademark. While dealing with the use of the same trademark, it was held that in such a case the public is deceived into purchasing the defendant's goods on the belief that they are the plaintiff's goods and it is the duty of the Court to protect a registered trademark. An injunction cannot be refused even if there is some delay in such a case because that would tantamount to permitting a fraud being practiced on unwary customers. It was further held that a delay in the matter of seeking an injunction may be a ground for refusing it in certain circumstances but a statutory right cannot be lost by delay. \n",
        "p_59": "48. Similarly, in Hindustan Pencils Pvt. Ltd. v. India Stationery Products Co. and Ors. , a learned Single Judge of this Court held that if the Court comes to a conclusion that prejudice is likely to be caused to the general public who may be misled into buying the goods manufactured by the defendants thinking them to be the goods of the plaintiff, then an injunction must be issued. The Court may, in appropriate cases, allow some time to the defendants to sell off their existing stock but an injunction should not be denied. On the question of delay, it was held that the defense of laches or inordinate delay is a defense in equity. If there is honest concurrent user by the defendant, then inordinate delay and laches may defeat the claim of damages or rendition of account but the relief of injunction should not be refused. This is because the interest of the general public has to be kept in mind. Inordinate delay or laches was distinguished from acquiescence and if the Court comes to a conclusion that prejudice is likely to be caused to the general public who may be misled into buying goods manufactured by the defendants thinking them to be the goods of the plaintiff, then an injunction must be issued. Maintaining status quo\n \n\n",
        "p_60": "49. It was submitted by learned Counsel for Defendant No. 18 that notwithstanding all this, the attempt of the Courts should be to maintain the status quo and not disturb it. This contention is really an extension of the argument that since Defendant No. 18 has been using the trademark Fedders for so many years, it should be allowed to continue to do so. This principal contention has already been dealt with above. The additional argument now raised is that the injunction application in this case has been pending for the last about eight years without a decision, issues have recently been framed in the suit and the matter is now ripe for recording evidence. As such, it may be advisable to wait awhile instead of injuncting Defendant No. 18. \n",
        "p_61": "Page 1954\n \n\n",
        "p_62": "50. Learned counsel for Defendant No. 18 referred to Wander Ltd. v. Antox India P. Ltd. 1990 (Supp) SCC 727 wherein in paragraph 9 of the Report the Supreme Court observed that, The interlocutory remedy is intended to preserve in status quo, the rights of parties which may appear on a prima facie case. However, the next few sentences are equally important. It is said, The court also in restraining a defendant from exercising what he considers his legal right, but what the plaintiff would like to be prevented, puts into the scales, as a relevant consideration whether the defendant has yet to commence his enterprise or whether he has already been doing so in which latter case considerations somewhat different from those apply to a case where the defendant is yet to commence his enterprise, are attracted. \n",
        "p_63": "In other words, the Supreme Court did not intend to lay down any absolute proposition that the status quo should never be disturbed \" it merely expressed the view that the considerations for disturbing the status quo are different from those for maintaining it. Similarly, in Uniply Industries Ltd. v. Unicorn Plywood Pvt. Ltd.  relied on by learned counsel, the Supreme Court acknowledged that the status quo can be disturbed but the plaintiff would have to make out a strong prima facie case for doing so. \n",
        "p_64": "51. I am of the view that to hold that the status quo should never be disturbed may lead to ridiculous results. If, for example, a defendant infringes the trademark of the plaintiff or passes off its goods as those of the plaintiff, preserving the status quo would mean permitting the defendant to continue to infringe the trademark of the plaintiff or pass off its goods as those of the plaintiffs. Surely, this cannot be. \n",
        "p_65": "52. Defendant No. 18 cannot also be permitted to take advantage of the laws delays. Merely because the injunction application has remained pending for about eight years does not mean that Defendant No. 18 should be allowed to continue to infringe the Plaintiffs trademark on the contrary, it means that the injunction application should be decided as soon as possible so that both parties know where they stand. Even though issues have been framed in the suit, it is not possible to say (unfortunately) with any degree of certainty that the trial will be conducted within a reasonable period of time. This is all the more reason to decide the injunction application expeditiously, one way or another. Conclusion\n \n\n",
        "p_66": "53. For all the reasons given above, I am of the view that the Plaintiff has made out a strong prima facie case for the grant of an injunction. The balance of convenience lies in favor of the prayer of the Plaintiff being granted inasmuch as it is the registered proprietor of the trademark Fedders and Defendants No. 18 and 19 cannot be permitted to cash in on the international reputation of the Plaintiff. While it is true that Defendant No. 18 has a large Page 1955 workforce and has established itself in the business of manufacture and sale of air-conditioners, it was mentioned by learned Counsel for Defendant No. 18 that his client is no longer using the trademark Fedders in respect of air-conditioners for the last about three or four years. If that is so, the injunction prayed for by the Plaintiff will not cause any inconvenience to Defendant No. 18 in terms of the manufacture and sale of air-conditioners etc. \n \n\n",
        "p_67": "54. In so far as Fedders in the corporate name of Defendant No. 18 is concerned, it is more than obvious that the word Fedders is a name that is completely foreign to it. Defendant No. 18 adopted this name only because it, and its predecessor in interest, that is, LEECO had a tie up with the Plaintiff. Otherwise, there is no reason for Defendant No. 18 to have adopted a completely foreign name as a part of its corporate name. The continued use of the word Fedders by Defendant No. 18 in its corporate name would give to the general public an impression that it continues to have a tie up with a foreign company, even though both the Plaintiff and Defendant No. 18 are at logger heads and have been so for the last over 30 years. However, no relief is claimed by the Plaintiff in this regard, except against the sister or group companies of Defendant No. 18. \n",
        "p_68": "55. In so far as irreparable harm and injury to the Plaintiff is concerned, it is quite obvious that if anybody is allowed to filch its name, the reputation of the Plaintiff will suffer some damage. No one can be allowed to ride piggyback on the name of another and if one does so by infringing the trademark of another, it is but natural that the proprietor of the trademark will suffer injury to its name and reputation. \n",
        "p_69": "56. I am satisfied that all the ingredients for the grant of an injunction in favor of the Plaintiff have been made out. The justice of the case demands the grant of an injunction.\n",

Under the circumstances, the Defendants, including Defendants No. 18 and 19 and those acting under them in any manner, are restrained from infringing the registered trademark No. 175253 bearing the mark Fedders in respect of air-conditioning machinery, parts and fittings thereof, and from exporting any of the aforesaid goods bearing the mark Fedders.\n",
        "p_71": "58. It may be mentioned for the record that learned Counsel for the Plaintiff contended that the Plaintiff has a transborder reputation that needs to be protected.

        "p_73": " So far as awarding of costs at the time of judgment is concerned, awarding of costs must be treated generally as mandatory in as much Page 1956 as the liberal attitude of the Courts in directing the parties to bear their own costs had led parties to file a number of frivolous cases in the Courts or to raise frivolous and unnecessary issues. Costs should invariably follow the event. Where a party succeeds ultimately on one issue or point but loses on number of other issues or points which were unnecessarily raised, costs must be appropriately apportioned. Special reasons must be assigned if costs are not being awarded. Costs should be assessed according to rules in force. If any of the parties has unreasonably protracted the proceedings, the Judge should consider exercising discretion to impose exemplary costs after taking into account the expense incurred for the purpose of attendance on the adjourned dates.\n",

The latest point of time upto which the tenders\ncould be  submitted to\tthe 1st\t respodent was stipulated in\nParagraph 7  of the  notice to\tbe 12  p.m. On 25th January,\n1977 and it was provided that the tenders would be opened on\nthe same  date at  12.30 hours.\t Paragraph (8) of the notice\nmade it\t clear that  \"the acceptance of the tender will rest\nwith the  Airport Director  who does  not  bind\t himself  to\naccept any  tender and\treserves to  himself  the  right  to\nreject all or ally of the tenders received without assigning\nany reasons  therefore \"  There were six tenders received by\nthe 1st respondent in response to the notice and one of them\nwas from  the 4th  respondents of  offering a licence fee of\nRs. 6666.66  per month, and the others were from Cafe Mahim,\nCentral Catering  Service, one A. S. Irani, Cafe Seaside and\nCare Excelsior offering progressively decreasing licence fee\nvery much  lower than  that offered  by the 4th respondents.\nThe tenders were opened in the\n1021\noffice of  the\tAirport\t Director  at  12.30  p.m.  On\t25th\nJanuary, 1977  and at  that time  the 4th  respondents\twere\nrepresented by\ttheir sole  proprietor Kumaria.\t A. S. Irani\nwas present  on behalf\tof himself, Cafe Mahim, Cafe Seaside\nand Cafe  Excelsior and\t there\twas  one  representative  of\nCentral Catering Service. The tenders of Cafe Mahim, Central\nCatering Service,  Cafe Seaside\t and Cafe Excelsior were not\ncomplete since\tthey were  not accompanied by the respective\nincome tax  certificates, affidavits  of immovable  property\nand solvency  certificates, as\trequired by  cl. (9)  of the\nterms and  conditions of  the tender form. The tenders of A.\nS. Irani  was also not complete as it was not accompanied by\nan affidavit  of immovable property held by him and solvency\ncertificates. The  only tender\twhich was complete and fully\ncomplied with  the terms  and conditions  of the tender form\nwas that  of the  4th respondents and the offer contained in\nthat tender  was also  the highest  amongst all the tenders.\nNow it\tis necessary  to point\tout at this stage that while\nsubmitting their  tender the 4th respondents had pointed out\nin their  letter dated\t24th January,  1977 addressed to the\nAirport Director  that they  had  10  years'  experience  in\ncatering to  reputed commercial\t houses,  training  centres,\nbanks  and   factories\tand   that  they   were\t also  doing\nconsiderable outdoor catering work for various institutions.\nThis letter  showed that  the 4th respondents had experience\nonly  of  running  canteens  and  not  restaurants  and\t  it\nappeared that  they  did  not  satisfy\tthe  description  of\n\"registered IInd  Class Hotelier  having at  least 5  years'\nexperience\" as\tset out\t in  paragraph\t(1)  of\t the  notice\ninviting tenders.  The Airport\tofficer, therefore,  by\t his\nletter\tdated\t15th  February,\t  1977\trequested   the\t 4th\nrespondents to\tinform by return of post whether they were a\n\"registered IInd  Class Hotelier  having at  least  5  years\nexperience\" and\t to produce  documentary  evidence  in\tthis\nrespect within\t7 days.\t The 4th  respondents pointed out to\nthe Airport  officer by\t their letter  dated 22nd  February,\n1977 that they had, in addition to what was set out in their\nearlier letter\tdated  24th  January,  1977,  experience  of\nrunning canteens  for Phillips\tIndia Ltd.  and\t Indian\t oil\nCorporation and\t moreover, they\t held Eating  House  Licence\ngranted by  the Bombay\tMunicipal Corporation since 1973 and\nhad thus  experience of\t 10 years  in the  catering line. It\nappears that before this letter of the 4th respondents could\nreach Airport  officer, another\t letter dated 22nd February,\n1977  was  addressed  by  the  Airport\tofficer\t once  again\nrequesting  the\t  4th  respondents  to\tproduce\t documentary\nevidence to  show if  they were\t ''a registered\t Ilnd  Class\nHotelier having\t at  least  5  years  experience\".  The\t 4th\nrespondents thereupon  addressed another  letter dated\t26th\nFebruary, 1977\tto the\tDirector pointing  out that they had\nconsiderable experience\t of  catering  for  various  reputed\ncommercial houses,\n1022\nclubs, messes  and banks  and They also held an Eating House\nCatering Establishment\t(Canteen) Licence  as also a licence\nissued under  the Prevention  of Food  Adulteration Act. The\n4th respondents\t stated that  their sole  proprietor Kumaria\nhad started  his career in catering line in the year 1962 at\nHotel Janpath,\tDelhi and  gradually risen  to\this  present\nposition and  that he had accordingly \"experience equivalent\nto that\t of a  IInd Class  or even 1st Class hotelier.\" This\nposition was  reiterated by the 4th respondents in a further\nletter dated 3rd March, 1977 addressed to the Director. This\ninformation given by the 4th respondents appeared to satisfy\nthe 1st\t respondent and\t by a  letter dated 19th April, 1977\nthe  1st   respondent  accepted\t  the  tender\tof  the\t 4th\nrespondents on\tthe terms  and conditions  set out  in\tthat\nletter.\t The   4th  respondents\t accepted  these  terms\t and\nconditions by  their  letter  dated  23rd  April,  1977\t and\ndeposited with\tthe 1st\t respondent by was of security a sum\nof Rs.\t39,999.96 in  the form\tof fixed Deposit Receipts in\nfavour of  the Ist respondent and paid to the 1st respondent\na sum  of Rs. 6666.66 representing licence fee for one month\nand  other   amounts  representing  water,  electricity\t and\nconservancy charges. The 4th respondents thereafter executed\nand handed  over to  the Ist  respondent an agreement in the\nform attached  to the  tender on  1st  May,  1977.  The\t 4th\nrespondents  also   got\t prepared  furniture,  counters\t and\nshowcases as  also uniforms  for the  staff, purchased inter\nalia deep  freezers, water  coolers, electrical\t appliances,\nicecream  cabinets,   espresso\tcoffee\tmachines,  crockery,\ncutlery and  other articles  and things and also engaged the\nnecessary staff\t for the  purpose of  running the restaurant\nand the two Snack bars But the Ist respondent could not hand\nover  possession   of  the   requisite\tsites\tto  the\t 4th\nrespondents, since  A. S.  Irani was  running his restaurant\nand snack bars on these sites under a previous contract with\nthe 1  st respondent and though that contract had come to an\nend, A.\t S. Irani  did not deliver possession of these sites\nto  the\t Ist  respondent.  The\t4th  respondents  repeatedly\nrequested the 1st respondent and the Airport Director who is\nthe 2nd respondent in the appeal, to hand over possession of\nthe sites  and pointed\tout to\tthe that  the 4th repondents\nwere incurring\tlosses by  reason of  delay in\tdelivery  of\npossession, but\t on account  of the  intransigence of  A. S.\nIrani the  Ist respondent  could not  arrange to  hand\tover\npossession of the sites to the 4th respondents.\n",
        "p_7": "     Meanwhile one  K. S,  Irani who  owned  Cafe  Excelsior\nfiled Suit  No. 6544 of 1977 in the City Civil Court, Bombay\nagainst the  respondents challenging the decision of the Ist\nrespondent to  accept the  tender of the 4th respondents and\ntook out  a notice  of\tmotion\tfor  restraining  the  1  st\nrespondent from taking any further steps pursuant to\n1023\nthe acceptance\tof the\ttender. K.  S. Irani obtained an ad-\ninterim injunction against the respondents but after hearing\nthe respondents, the City Civil Court vacated the ad-interim\ninjunction and\tdismissed the  notice of  motion by an order\ndated 10th  october, 1977.  An appeal was preferred by K. S.\nIrani against  this order,  but the  appeal was dismissed by\nthe  High   Court  on\t19th  october,\t 1977.\t Immediately\nthereafter, on\tthe same day, the Ist respondent handed over\npossession of  two, sites to the 4th respondents and the 4th\nrespondents proceeded  to set up snack bars on the two sites\nand started  business of  catering at  the two\tsnack  bars.\nThese two  sites handed\t over to  the 4th  respondents\twere\ndifferent from\tthe sites occupied by A.S. Irani, because A.\nS. Irani  refused to  vacate the sites in his occupation. So\nfar as\tthe site  for the  restaurant was concerned, the Ist\nrespondent could  not hand  over the possession of it to the\n4th  respondents  presumably  because  there  was  no  other\nappropriate site available other than the one occupied by A.\nS. Irani.  Since A. S. lrani refused to hand over possession\nof the\tsites occupied\tby him\tto the\tIst respondent, even\nthough his  contract had  come to  an end,  and continued to\ncarry on  the business\tof running  the restaurant  and\t the\nsnack  bars   on  these\t  sites,  the\tIst  respondent\t was\nconstrained to\tfile suit  No. 8032  of 1977  against A.  S.\nIrani in the City Civil Court at Bombay and in that suit, an\ninjunction was obtained by the 1st respondent restraining A.\nS. Irani  from running\tor conducting the restaurant and the\nsnack bars or from entering the premises save and except for\nwinding up  the restaurant  and the  snack bars. A. S. Irani\npreferred  an\tappeal\tagainst\t  the  order   granting\t the\ninjunction, but\t the appeal  was rejected  and ultimately  a\npetition for  special leave to appeal to this Court was also\nturned down on 31st July, 1978.\n",
        "p_8": "     This was, however, not to be the end of the travails of\nthe 4th respondents. for, as soon as the appeal preferred by\nK. S.  Irani against  the order\t dismissing  his  notice  of\nmotion was rejected by the High Court on 19th October, 1977,\nA. S.  Irani filed  another suit being suit No. 8161 of 1977\nin the City Civil Court, Bombay on 24th October,1977 seeking\nmandatory injunction  for removal  of the two snack bars put\nup by  the 4th\trespondents. This was one more attempt by A.\nS. Irani  to prevent  the 4th respondents from obtaining the\nbenefit\t of   the  contract  awarded  to  them\tby  the\t Ist\nrespondent. He,\t however, did  not succeed  in obtaining ad-\ninterim injunction and we are told that the notice of nation\ntaken out by him is still pending in the City Civil Court.\n",
        "p_9": "     It will  thus be  seen that  A. S.\t Irani failed in his\nattempts to  prevent the  4th respondents from obtaining the\ncontract and enjoying its\n1024\nbenefit. The  4th respondents  put up  two snack bars on the\nsites provided by the 1st respondent and started running the\ntwo snack  bars from  1 9th  october? 1977.  The  restaurant\nhowever, could\tnot be put up on account of the inability of\nthe Ist\t respondent to\tprovide appropriate  site to the 4th\nrespondents and,  therefore, the  licence fee  for  the\t two\nsnack bars had to be settled and it was fixed at Rs. 4.50O/-\nper month  by mutual  agreement between\t the parties. But it\nseems that  the 4th respondents were not destined to be left\nin peace  to run  the two  snack bars  and  soon  after\t the\ndismissal of the appeal of A. S. Irani on l9th october, 1977\nand the\t failure of  A. S.  Irani to  obtain an\t ad  interim\nmandatory injunction  in the  suit filed  by him against the\n1st and\t the  4th  respondents,\t the  appellant\t filed\twrit\npetition No.  1582 of  1977 in\tthe  High  Court  of  Bombay\nchallenging the decision of the 1st respondent to accept the\ntender of  the 4th  respondents. The writ petition was moved\nbefore a  Single Judge\tof the\tHigh Court  on 8th November,\n1977 after  giving prior  notice to the respondent and after\nhearing the  parties, the  learned  Single  Judge  summarily\nrejected the  writ  petition.  The  appellant  preferred  an\nappeal to  the Division\t Bench of the High Court against the\norder rejecting the writ petition and on notice being issued\nby the Division Bench, the 1st and the 4th respondents filed\ntheir respective  affidavits in\t reply showing cause against\nthe admission  of  the\tappeal.\t The  Division\tBench  after\nconsidering the\t affidavits and hearing the parties rejected\nthe appeal  in limine  on 21st February, 1978. The appellant\nthereupon filed\t a petition  for special  leave to appeal to\nthis Court  and since  it was felt that the questions raised\nin the appeal were of seminal importance, this Court granted\nspecial leave  and decided  to hear  the appeal\t at an early\ndate after  giving a  further opportunity  to the parties to\nfile their respective affidavits. That is how the appeal has\nnow come  before us for final hearing with full and adequate\nmaterial placed before us on behalf of both the parties.\n",
        "p_10": "     The main  contention urged\t on behalf  of the appellant\nwas that in paragraph (1) of the notice inviting tenders the\n1st respondent\thad stipulated a condition of eligibility by\nproviding that\ta person  submitting  a\t tender\t must  be  a\n\"registered IInd  class Hotelier  having at  least  5  years\nexperience.\" This  was a  condition  of\t eligibility  to  be\nsatisfied by every person submitting a tender and if in case\nof any\tperson, this condition was not satisfied, his tender\nwas ineligible\tfor being  considered. The  1st\t respondent,\nbeing  a  State\t within\t the  meaning  of  Art.\t 12  of\t the\nConstitution or\t in any\t event a public authority, was bound\nto give\t effect to the condition of eligibility set up by it\nand was not entitled to depart from it at its own sweet will\n1025\nwithout rational  justification.  The  4th  respondents\t had\nexperience of  catering only  in canteens and did not have 5\nyears'\texperience   of\t running   a  IInd  class  hotel  or\nrestaurant and\thence they  did not satisfy the condition of\neligibility and\t yet the  1st respondent accepted the tender\nsubmitted by  them. This  was clearly  in violation  of\t the\nstandard or  norm of  eligibility set up by the 1 respondent\nand the action of the 1st respondent in accepting the tender\nof the 4th respondents was clearly invalid. Such a departure\nfrom the  standard or  norm of eligibility had the effect of\ndenying equal  opportunity to  the appellant  and others  of\nsubmitting their  tenders and  being considered for entering\ninto contract  for putting up and running the restaurant and\ntwo snack  bars. The  appellant too was not a registered 2nd\nclass hotelier\twith 5 years' experience and was in the same\nposition as  the 4th respondents vis-a-vis this condition of\neligibility and\t he also could have submitted his tender and\nentered\t the   field  of  consideration\t for  award  of\t the\ncontract, but  he did not do so because of this condition of\neligibility which  he admittedly did not satisfy. The action\nof the\t1st respondent\tin accepting  the tender  of the 4th\nrespondents  had,   therefore  the  effect  of\tdenying\t him\nequality of  opportunity in  the matter of consideration for\naward of  the contract\tand hence it was unconstitutional as\nbeing in  violation of\tthe equality clause. This contention\nof the\tappellant was  sought  to  be  met  by\ta  threefold\nargument on  behalf of the 1 st and the 4th Respondents. The\nfirst head  of the argument was that grading is given by the\nE Bombay  City\tMunicipal  Corporation\tonly  to  hotels  or\nrestaurants and not persons running them and hence there can\nbe a  2nd grade\t hotel or  restaurant but  not a  2nd  grade\nhotelier and  the requirement in paragraph (1) of the notice\nthat a\ttenderer must be a registered 2nd grade hotelier was\ntherefore a  meaningless requirement  and it  could  not  be\nregarded as  laying clown  any condition  of eligibility. It\nwas also  urged that in any event what paragraph (] ) of the\nnotice required\t was not that a person tendering must have 5\nyears' experience  of running  a 2nd  grade  hotel,  but  he\nshould have  sufficient experience  to be  able to run a 2nd\ngrade hotel  and the 4th respondents were fully qualified in\nthis respect  since they  had over  10 years'  experience in\ncatering to  canteens of  well known  companies,  clubs\t and\nbanks. It  was further\tcontended in  the  alternative\tthat\nparagraph (8)  of  the\tnotice\tclearly\t provided  that\t the\nacceptance of  the  tender-  would  rest  with\tthe  Airport\nDirector who  did not  bind himself to accept any tender and\nreserved to  himself the  right to  reject all or any of the\ntenders without\t assigning any\treasons therefor and it was,\ntherefore, competent to the 1st respondent to reject all the\ntenders and  to nogotiate  with any person it considered fit\nto enter\n1026\ninto a contract and this is in effect and substance what the\n1st respondent\tdid when  he accepted  the tender of the 4th\nrespondents. The  second head of argument was that paragraph\n(1) of\tthe notice  setting out the condition of eligibility\nhad  no\t  statutory  force  nor\t was  it  issued  under\t any\nadministrative rules  and, therefore,  even if there was any\ndeparture from\tthe standard  or norm of eligibility set out\nin that\t paragraph, it\twas  not  justiciable  and  did\t not\nfurnish any  cause  of\taction\tto  the\t appellant.  It\t was\ncompetent to  the 1st respondent to give the contract to any\none it\tthought fit  and it was not bound by the standard or\nnorm of\t eligibility set out in paragraph (l) of the notice.\nIt was\tsubmitted that\tin any\tevent the  appellant had  no\nright to  complain that\t the 1st  respondent had  given\t the\ncontract to  the 4th  respondents in breach of the condition\nof eligibility laid down in paragraph (1) of the notice. And\nlastly, under  the third  head of argument, it was submitted\non behalf.  Of the  1st and  the 4th respondents that in any\nview of\t the matter,  the writ petition of the appellant was\nliable to  be rejected\tin the exercise of its discretion by\nthe Court,  since the appellant had no real interest but was\nmerely a  nominee of A. S. Irani who had been putting up one\nperson after  another to  start litigation  with a  view  to\npreventing the award of the contract to the 4th respondents.\nThe appellant  was also guilty of laches and delay in filing\nthe writ  petition and\tthe  High  Court  was  justified  in\nrejecting the  writ petition  in limine particularly in view\nof the\tfact that  during the  period between  the  date  of\nacceptance of  the tender and the date of filing of the writ\npetition, the  4th respondents had spent an aggregate sum of\nabout Rs.  1,25,000/- in  making arrangements for putting up\nthe restaurant\tand two\t snack bars.  These were  the  rival\ncontentions urged  on behalf of the parties and we shall now\nproceed to  discuss them  in the  order in which we have set\nthem out.\n",
        "p_11": "     Now it  is clear  from paragraph (1) of the notice that\ntenders\t were\tinvited\t only  from  \"registered  2nd  Class\nhoteliers having  at least  5 years' experience\". It is only\nif a  person was  a registered\t2nd Class hotelier having at\nleast 5\t years' experience  that he  could, on\tthe terms of\nparagraph (1)  of the notice, submit a tender. Paragraph (1)\nof the\tnotice prescribed  a condition\tof eligibility which\nhad to\tbe satisfied by every person submitting a tender and\nif, in\ta given\t case, a  person submitting a tender did not\nsatisfy this  condition, his  tender was  not eligible to be\nconsidered. Now\t it is true that the terms and conditions of\nthe tender  form did not prescribe that the tenderer must be\na registered  IInd Class  hotelier having  at least 5 years'\nexperience nor\twas any\t such stipulation to be found in the\nform c f the agreement\n1027\nannexed to  the\t tender\t but  the  notice  inviting  tenders\npublished in  the newspapers clearly stipulated that tenders\nmay be\tsubmitted only\tby registered  llnd Class  hoteliers\nhaving at  least 5  years' experience and this tender notice\nwas also  included amongst  the\t documents  handed  over  to\nprospective tenderers  when they  applied for  tender forms.\nNow the\t question is,  what is the meaning of the expression\n\"registered Ilnd  Class hotelier\",  what category of persons\nfall within  the meaning  of this  description ?  This is  a\nnecessary enquiry  in order  to determine  whether  the\t 4th\nrespondents were  eligible to  submit a\t tender. It is clear\nfrom the affidavits and indeed there was no dispute about it\nthat different grades are given by the Bombay City Municipal\nCorporation to\thotels and restaurants and, therefore, there\nmay be\ta registered Ilnd Class Hotel but no such grades are\ngiven to persons running hotels and restaurants and hence it\nwould be  inappropriate to speak of a person as a registered\nllnd Class  hoteIier. But  on that account would it be right\nto reject the expression \"registered IInd Class hotelier\" as\nmeaningless and\t deprive paragraph  (1) of the notice of any\nmeaning and  effect. We\t do not\t think such  a view would be\njustified by any canon of construction. It is a well settled\nrule of\t interpretation applicable  alike to documents as to\nstatutes that,\tsave for  compelling  necessity,  the  court\nshould not  be prompt to ascribe superfluity to the language\nof a  document \"and  should be rather at the outset inclined\nto suppose  every word intended to have some effect or be of\nsome use\".  To reject words as insensible should be the last\nresort of  judicial interpretation,  for it is an elementary\nrule based  on common  sense that  no  author  of  a  formal\ndocument intended  to be  acted upon by the others should be\npresumed to  use words without a meaning. The court must, as\nfar as possible, avoid a construction which would render the\nwords used  by the  author of  the document  meaningless and\nfutile or  reduce silence  any part of the document and make\nit altogether inapplicaple. Now, here the expression used in\nparagraph (1)  of the  notice  was  \"registered\t IInd  Class\nhotelier\" and  there can  be no\t doubt that  by using,\tthis\nexpression  the\t Ist  respondent  intended  to\tdelineate  a\ncertain category  of persons who alone should be eligible to\nsubmit a tender. The Ist respondent was not acting aimlessly\nor insensibly  in insisting upon this requirement nor was it\nindulging, in  a meaningless  and futile  exercise. It had a\ndefinite purpose in view when it laid down this condition of\neligibility in\tparagraph (1) of the notice. It is true that\nthe phraseology\t used by  the Ist  respondent to express its\nintention was  rather inapt  but  it  is  obvious  from\t the\ncontext that the expression \"registered llnd Class hotelier\"\nwas loosely  used to denote a person conducting or running a\nIInd Class  hotel or restaurant. It may be ungrammatical but\nit docs not offend common-sense to describe a\n1028\nperson running a registered IInd grade hotel as a registered\nIInd grade  hotelier. This  meaning is\tquite reasonable and\ndoes not  do any violence to the language and makes sense of\nthe provision  contained in  paragraph (1) of the notice. We\nmust,  in   the\t circumstances,\t  hold\tthat,  on  a  proper\nconstruction, what  paragraph (1) of the notice required was\nthat only  a person running a registered llnd Class hotel or\nrestaurant and\thaving at  least 5 years' experience as such\nshould be  eligible to submit a tender. This was a condition\nof eligibility and it is difficult to see how this condition\ncould be said to be satisfied by any person who did not have\nfive years'  experience of  running a  IInd Class  hotel  or\nrestaurant.  The  test\tof  eligibility\t laid  down  was  an\nobjective test\tand not a subjective one. What the condition\nof eligibility\trequired has  that the\tperson submitting  a\ntender must  have 5  years' experience of running a II Class\nhotel, as this would ensure by an objective test that he was\ncapable of  running a  Il Class restaurant and it should not\nbe left\t to the\t Ist respondent\t to decide in its subjective\ndiscretion that\t the person tendering was capable of running\nsuch a\trestaurant. If\ttherefore,  a  person  submitting  a\ntender did  not have at least 5 years' experience of running\na II  Class hotel,  he was not eligible to submit the tender\nand it\twould not  avail him  to say  that though he did not\nsatisfy this  condition, he was otherwise capable of running\na  IInd\t  Class\t restaurant   and  should,   therefore,\t  be\nconsidered. This  was in fact how the 1 st respondent itself\nunderstood this\t condition  of\teligibility.  When  the\t 4th\nrespondents submitted  their tender  along with Their Letter\ndated 24th  January, 1977,  it appeared\t from the  documents\nsubmitted by  the 4th  respondents that\t they did not have 5\nyears' experience  of running a II Class restaurant. The 1st\nrespondent by  its letter  dated l5th February 1977 required\nthe 4th\t respondents to produce documentary evidence to show\nthat they were \"registered II Class hotelier having at least\n5 years' experience.\" The 1st respondent did not regard this\nrequirement of eligibility as meaningless or unnecessary and\nwanted to  be satisfied\t that the  4th respondent did fulfil\nthis   requirement.   Now,   unfortunately   for   the\t 4th\nrespondents, the  had over  lO years'  experience of running\ncan teens  but at the date when they submitted their tender,\nthey cannot  running a\tII grade hotel or restaurant nor did\nthey have  5 years'  experience of  running such  a hotel or\nrestaurant. Even if the experience of the 4th respondents in\nthe catering line were taken into account from 1962 onwards,\nit would  not cover  a total  period of\t more than 4 years 2\nmonths so  far as  catering experience\tin llnd Grade hotels\nand restaurants\t is concerned.\tThe 4th respondents thus did\nnot satisfy  the  condition  of\t eligibility  laid  down  in\nparagraph (1)  of the  notice and in fact this was implidely\nconceded by\n1029\nthe 4th\t respondents in\t their letter  dated 26th  February,\n1977  where   A\t they\tstated\tthat  they  had\t \"experience\nequivalent to  that  of\t a  2nd\t class\tor  even  1st  class\nhotelier.\"  The\t  4th  respondents  were,  accordingly,\t not\neligible for  submitting a  tender and the action of the 1st\nrespondent in accepting their tender was in contravention of\nparagraph (1) of the notice.\n",
        "p_12": "     It was  suggested on  behalf of  the 1st  and  the\t 4th\nrespondents  that   there  was\tnothing\t wrong\tin  the\t 1st\nrespondent giving  the contract to the 4th respondents since\nit was\tcompetent to  the 1st  respondent to  reject all the\ntenders received  by it\t and to\t negotiate directly with The\n4th respondents\t for giving them the contract and it made no\ndifference that\t instead of  following this procedure, which\nperhaps might  have resulted in the 4th respondents offering\na smaller  licence fee\tand the\t 1 st respondent suffering a\nloss in\t the process,  true 1  st  respondent  accepted\t The\ntender of  the 4th respondents. We do not think there is any\nforce in  this argument.  It  is  true\tthat  there  was  no\nstatutory  or\tadministrative\trule   requiring   the\t 1st\nrespondent to  give a  contract only by inviting tenders and\nhence the  1st respondent  was entitled\t to reject  all\t the\ntenders and, subject to the constitutional norm laid down in\nArt 14,\t negotiate directly  for entering  into a  contract.\nParagraph (8)  of the notice also made it clear that the 1st\nrespondent was\tnot bound  to accept  any tender  and  could\nreject all  the tenders\t received by  it. But  here the\t 1st\nrespondent did\tnot reject  the tenders\t outright and  enter\ninto  direct  negotiations  with  the  4th  respondents\t for\nawarding the contract. The process of awarding a contract by\ninviting tenders  was not terminated or abandoned by the 1st\nrespondent by  rejecting all  the tenders but in furtherance\nof the\tprocess, the  tender  of  the  4th  respondents\t was\naccepted by  the 1st  respondent. The contract was not given\nto the\t4th respondents\t as a result of direct negotiations.\nTenders were  invited and  out of  the tenders received, the\none submitted  by the  4th respondents\twas accepted and the\ncontract was given to them. It is, therefore not possible to\njustify the  action of the 1st respondent on the ground that\nthe 1st\t respondent could  have achieved  the same result by\nrejecting  all\t the  tenders\tand  entering\tinto  direct\nnegotiations with the 4th respondents.\n",
        "p_13": "     That  takes   us  to  the\tnext  question\twhether\t the\nacceptance of  the tender of the 4th respondents was invalid\nand liable to be set aside at the instance of the appellant.\nIt  was\t  contended  on\t behalf\t GI  the  1st  and  the\t 4th\nrespondents that  the appellant had no locus to maintain the\nwrit petition  since no\t tender was  submitted by him and he\nwas a mere stranger. The argument was that if the appellant\n1030\ndid not\t enter the  field of  competition  by  submitting  a\ntender, what did it matter to him whose tender was accepted;\nwhat grievance\tcould he  have if  the\ttender\tof  the\t 4th\nrespondents was\t wrongly accepted. A person whose tender was\nrejected might very well complain that the tender of someone\nelse was wrongly accepted, but it was submitted, how could a\nperson who  never tendered  and who  was at  no time  in the\nfield, put  forward such a complaint ? This argument, in our\nopinion, is  mis-conceived and\tcannot be  sustained  for  a\nmoment. The grievance of the appellant, it may be noted, was\nnot that  his tender  was rejected  as a  result of improper\nacceptance of the tender of the 4th respondents, but that he\nwas  differentially   treated\tand   denied   equality\t  of\nopportunity with the 4th respondents in submitting a tender.\nHis complaint  was that if it were known that non-fulfilment\nof  the\t  condition  of\t eligibility  would  be\t no  bar  to\nconsideration of  a tender,  he also  would have submitted a\ntender and  competed for  obtaining a  contract. But  he was\nprecluded from submitting a tender and entering the field of\nconsideration by  reason of  the condition  of\teligibility,\nwhile so  far as  the 4th  respondents were concerned, their\ntender was entertained and accepted even though they did not\nsatisfy the  condition of  eligibility and  this resulted in\ninequality   of\t  treatment   which   was   constitutionally\nimpermissible. This  was the grievance made by the appellant\nin the\twrit petition and there can be no doubt that if this\ngrievance were well founded, the appellant would be entitled\nto maintain  the writ petition. The question is whether this\ngrievance was  justified in  law and  the acceptance  of the\ntender of  the 4th  respondents was  vitiated by  any  legal\ninfirmity.\n",
        "p_14": "     Now, there\t can be\t no doubt that what paragraph (1) of\nthe notice  prescribed was  a condition of eligibility which\nwas required  to be  satisfied by  every person submitting a\ntender. The  condition of  eligibility was  that the  person\nsubmitting  a\ttender\tmust  be  conducting  or  running  a\nregistered 2nd class hotel or restaurant and he must have at\nleast 5\t years' experience as such and if he did not satisfy\nthis condition\tof  eligibility\t his  tender  would  not  be\neligible for consideration. This was the standard or norm of\neligibility laid  down by  the 1 st respondent and since the\n4th respondents\t did not  satisfy this\tstandard or norm, it\nwas not\t competent to  the 1st\trespondent to  entertain the\ntender of  the 4th respondents. It is a well settled rule of\nadministrative law  that  an  executive\t authority  must  be\nrigorously held\t to the\t standards by which it professes its\nactions to  be judged and it must scrupulously observe those\nStandards on  pain of invalidation of an act in violation of\nthem.

If  we  turn\t to  the  judgment  of\tMr.  Justice\nFrankfurter and\t examine it,  we find that he has not sought\nto draw support for the rule from the equality clause of the\nUnited States  Constitution, but evolved it purely as a rule\nof administrative  law.

        "p_19": "     To-day the\t Government, is\t a  welfare  State,  is\t the\nregulator and  dispenser of special services and provider of\na  large  number  of  benefits,\t including  jobs  contracts,\nlicences, quotas,  mineral rights  etc. The Government pours\nforth wealth,  money, benefits,\t services, contracts, quotas\nand licences.  The valuables  dispensed by  Government\ttake\nmany forms,  but they all share one characteristic. They are\nsteadily taking\t the place  of traditional  forms of wealth.\nThese valuables which derive from relationship to Government\nare of\tmany kinds.  They comprise social security benefits,\ncash grants  for political sufferers and the whole scheme of\nState and local welfare. Then again, thousands of people are\nemployed in  the State and the Central Governments and local\nauthorities. Licences  are required before one can engage in\nmany kinds of business or work. The power of giving licences\nmeans power  to withhold  them and this gives control to the\nGovernment or  to the  agents of  Government on the lives of\nmany people. Many individuals and many more businesses enjoy\nlargess in the form of Government contracts. These contracts\noften resemble subsidies. It is virtually impossible to lose\nmoney on  them and  many enterprises are set up primarily to\ndo business  with Government.  Government owns\tand controls\nhundreds of  acres of  pubic Land  valuable for\t mining\t and\nother  purposes.   These   resources   are   available\t for\nutilisation by\tprivate corporations  and individuals by way\nof lease or licence. All these mean growth in the Government\nlargess and with the increasing\n1033\nmagnitude and  range of\t governmental functions\t as we\tmove\ncloser to  a welfare  State, more  and more  of\t our  wealth\nconsists of  these new\tforms. Some of these forms of wealth\nmay be\tin the nature of legal rights but the large majority\nof them are in the nature of privileges But on that account,\ncan it be said that they do not enjoy any legal protection ?\nCan they  be regarded  as gratuity furnished by the State so\nthat the  State may  withhold, grant  or revoke\t it  at\t its\npleasure ? Is the position of the Government in this respect\nthe same as that of a private giver? We do not think so. The\nlaw has\t not been  slow to  recognise the importance of this\nnew kind  of wealth  and  the  need  to\t protect  individual\ninterest in  it and  with that end in view, it has developed\nnew  forms  of\tprotection.  some  interests  in  Government\nlargess,  formerly   regarded  as   privileges,\t have\tbeen\nrecognised as  rights while  others have  been\tgiven  legal\nprotection not\tonly by\t forging procedural  safeguards\t but\nalso  by   confinding/structuring  and\tchecking  Government\ndiscretion in  the matter  of grant  of\t such  largess.\t The\ndiscretion of  the  Government\thas  been  held\t to  be\t not\nunlimited in  that the\tGovernment cannot  give or  withhold\nlargess in its arbitrary discretion or at its sweet will. It\nis insisted,  as pointed out by Prof. Reich in an especially\nstimulating article  on \"The  New Property\"  in 73  Yale Law\nJournal 733,  \"that Government\taction be based on standards\nthat are  not arbitrary\t or unauthorised.\"  \"The  Government\ncannot be  permitted to\t say that it will give jobs or enter\ninto contracts or issue quotas or licences only in favour of\nthose  having\tgrey  hair  or\tbelonging  to  a  particular\npolitical party\t or professing a particular religions faith.\nThe Government\tis still  the Government when it acts in the\nmatter of granting largess and it cannot act arbitrarily. It\ndoes not stand in the same position as a private individual\n     We agree  with the\t observations of  Mathew, J.,  in V.\nPunnan Thomas v. State of Kerala(1) that: \"The Government is\nnot and\t should not be as free as an individual in selecting\nthe recepients\tfor its\t largess. Whatever its activity, the\nGovernment is  still the  Government and  will be subject to\nrestraints,  inherent\tin  its\t position  in  a  democratic\nsociety. A  democratic Government  cannot lay down arbitrary\nand capricious standards for the choice of persons with whom\nalone it  will deal\".  The same point was made by this court\nin Erusian  Equipment and  Chemicals Ltd.  v.

J.,\nspeaking on  behalf of\thimself and  his colleagues  on\t the\nBench pointed  out that\t black-listing on  a person not only\naffects\t his  reputation  which\t is  in\t Poundian  terms  an\ninterest both  of personality and substance, but also denies\nhim equality  in the  matter of\t entering into contract with\nthe  Government\t and  it  cannot,  therefore,  be  supported\nwithout fair  hearing. It was argued for the Government that\nno person has a right to enter into contractual relationship\nwith the  Government and  the  Government,  like  any  other\nprivate individual,  has the  absolute right  to enter\tinto\ncontract with  any one\tit pleases.  But the Court, speaking\nthrough\t the  learned  Chief  Justice,\tresponded  that\t the\nGovernment is not like a private individual who can pick and\nchoose the person with whom it will deal, but the Government\nis still  a Government\twhen it enters into contract or when\nit is  administering largess and it cannot, without adequate\nreason, exclude any person from dealing with it or take away\nlargess arbitrarily.  The learned  Chief Justice  said\tthat\nwhen  the  Government  is  trading  with  the  public,\t\"the\ndemocratic form\t of Government\tdemands equality and absence\nof arbitrariness  and discrimination  in such  transactions.\nThe activities\tof the Government have a public element and,\ntherefore, there  should be fairness and equality. The State\nneed not enter into any contract with anyone, but if it does\nso, it\tmust do so fairly without discrimination and without\nunfair procedure.\"  This proposition  would hold good in all\ncases of  dealing by  the Government  with the public, where\nthe interest sought to be protected is a privilege. It must,\ntherefore, be  taken to be the law that where the Government\nis dealing with the public, whether by way of giving jobs or\nentering into  contracts or  issuing quotas  or licences  or\ngranting other\tforms of  largess, the Government cannot act\narbitrarily  at\t  its  sweet   will  and,   like  a  private\nindividual, deal  with any person it pleases, but its action\nmust be\t in conformity\twith standard  or norms which is not\narbitrary, irrational or irrelevant. The power or discretion\nof  the\t Government  in\t the  matter  of  grant\t of  largess\nincluding award\t of jobs,  contracts, quotas, licences etc.,\nmust be\t confined and  structured by  rational, relevant and\nnon-discriminatory standard  or norm  and if  the Government\ndeparts from  standard or  norm in  any particular  case  or\ncases, the  action of  the Government  would be liable to be\nstruck down,  unless it\t can be shown by the Government that\nthe departure was not arbitrary, but was based on some valid\nprinciple which\t in itself  was not irrational, unreasonable\nor discriminatory.\n",
        "p_22": "     Now, it is obvious that the Government which represents\nthe executive  authority of  the State,\t may act through the\ninstrumentality\n1035\nOr  agency   of\t natural   persons  or\tit  may\t employ\t the\ninstrumentality or  agency of juridical persons to carry out\nits functions.\tIn the\tearly days,  when the Government had\nlimited functions,  it\tcould  operate\teffectively  through\nnatural persons constituting its civil service and they were\nfound adequate\tto discharge  governmental functions,  which\nwere of\t traditional  vintage.\tBut  as\t the  tasks  of\t the\nGovernment multiplied  the advent  of the  welfare State, it\nbegan to  be increasingly  felt that  the framework of civil\nservice was  not sufficient  to handle\tthe new\t tasks which\nwere often  of specialised  and highly\ttechnical character.\nThe inadequacy\tof the\tcivil service to deal with these new\nproblems came  to be  realised and  it became  necessary  to\nforce a\t new instrumentality  or administrative\t device\t for\nhandling these\tnew problems.  It was in these circumstances\nand with  a view  to supplying this administrative need that\nthe public  corporation came  into being as the third arm of\nthe Government.\t As early  as 1819  the Supreme Court of the\nUnited States  in Mac  Cullough v. Maryland(1) held that the\nCongress has  power to charter corporations as incidental to\nor in  aid of  governmental functions and, as pointed out by\nMathew, J.,  in Sukhdev\t v. Bhagat  Ram (supra) such federal\ncorporations  would   ex-hypothesi  be\t agencies   of\t the\nGovernment. In\tGreat Britain  too,  the  policy  of  public\nadministration through\tseparate corporations  was gradually\nevolved and  the conduct  of basic  industries through giant\ncorporations has  now become  a permanent  feature of public\nlife. So  far as  India is  concerned, the  genesis  of\t the\nemergence of  corporations as  instrumentalities or agencies\nof Government  is to  be found\tin the\tGovernment of  India\nResolution on  Industrial Policy dated 6th April, 1948 where\nit  was\t  stated  inter\t  alia\tthat  \"management  of  State\nenterprises will  as a\trule be through the medium of public\ncorporation under  tile statutory  control  of\tthe  Central\nGovernment who\twill assume  such powers as may be necessary\nto ensure this.\" It was in pursuance of the policy envisaged\nin this\t and subsequent\t resolutions on\t Industrial  Policy.\nthat corporations  were created by Government for setting up\nand management\tof public enterprises and carrying out other\npublic functions. Ordinarily these functions could have been\ncarried out by Government departmentally through its service\npersonnel,  but\t  the  instrumentality\t or  agency  of\t the\ncorporations was resorted to in these cases having regard to\nthe nature  of the  task to  be performed.  The corporations\nacting as  instrumentality or  agency  of  Government  would\nobviously be subject to the same limitations in the field of\nconstitutional and  administrative law as Government itself,\nthough\n(1) 4 Wheat 315\n1036\nin  the\t  eye  of  the\tlaw,  they  would  be  distinct\t and\nindependent legal entities. If Government acting through its\nofficers is subject to certain constitutional and public law\nlimitations, it\t must  follow  a  fortiori  that  Government\nacting through the instrumentality or agency of corporations\nshould equally\tbe subject  to the same limitations. But the\nquestion is how to determine whether a corporation is acting\nas instrumentality or agency of Government. It is a question\nnot entirely free from difficulty.\n",
        "p_23": "     A corporation may be created in one of two ways. It may\nbe either established by statute or incorporated under a law\nsuch as the Companies Act 1956 or the Societies Registration\nAct 1860.  Where  a  Corporation  is  wholly  controlled  by\nGovernment not\tonly  in  its  policy  making  but  also  in\ncarrying out  the functions  entrusted\tto  it\tby  the\t law\nestablishing it\t or by\tthe Charter  of\t its  incorporation,\nthere can be no doubt that it would be an instrumentality or\nagency of  Government. But ordinarily where a corporation is\nestablished by\tstatute, it  is autonomous  in its  working,\nsubject only to a provision, often times made, that it shall\nbe bound  by any  directions that may be issued from time to\ntime by\t Government in\trespect of  policy matter. So also a\ncorporation incorporated  under law is managed by a board of\ndirectors or  committee of management in accordance with the\nprovisions of  the statute  under which\t it is incorporated.\nWhen does  such a  corporation become  an instrumentality or\nagency of  Government ?\t Is the\t holding of the entire share\ncapital of  the Corporation  by Government  enough or  is it\nnecessary that in addition, there should be a certain amount\nof direct  control exercised  by Government and, if so, what\nshould be  the nature of such control ? Should the functions\nwhich the  corporation is  charged to  carry out possess any\nparticular characteristic  or feature,\tor is  the nature or\nthe functions  immaterial ?  Now, one thing is clear that if\nthe entire  share capital  of the  corporation\tis  held  by\nGovernment, it\twould go  a long way towards indicating that\nthe  corporation   is  an   instrumentality  or\t  agency  of\nGovernment. But,  as is\t quite often the case, a corporation\nestablished by\tstatute may  have no shares or shareholders,\nin which  case it  would be  a relevant\t factor to  consider\nwhether the  administration is\tin the\thands of  a board of\ndirectors appointed by Government, though this consideration\nalso may  not  be  determinative,  because  even  while\t the\ndirectors  are\t appointed  by\t Government,  they   may  be\ncompletely free\t from governmental  control in the discharge\nof their  functions. What  then are  the tests\tto determine\nwhether a corporation established by statute or incorporated\nunder law is an instrumentality or agency of Government ? It\nis not possible to formulate an all-\n",
        "p_24": "inclusive or  exhaustive test  which would adequately answer\nthis question  'there is  no cut  and dried  formula,  which\nwould provide  the correct  division  of  corporations\tinto\nthose which  are instrumentalities or agencies of Government\nand those which are not.\n",
        "p_25": "     The analogy of the concept of State action as developed\nin the\tUnited States may not, however, be altogether out of\nplace while  considering this question. The decisions of the\ncourt in  the United  States seem  to suggest that a private\nagency, if  supported by  extraordinary assistance  given by\nthe  State,  may  be  subject  to  the\tsame  constitutional\nlimitations as\tthe State.  Of course, it may be pointed out\nthat \"the State's general common law and statutory structure\nunder which  its people\t carry on their private affairs, own\nproperty and  contract, each  enjoying equality\t in terms of\nlegal capacity,\t is  not  such\tState  assistance  as  would\ntransform  private   conduct  into  State  action\".  But  if\nextensive and  unusual financial assistance is given and the\npurpose\t of   the  Government\tin  giving  such  assistance\ncoincides with\tthe purpose  for which\tthe  corporation  is\nexpected to use the assistance and such purpose is if public\ncharacter, it  may be  a relevant circumstance supporting an\nextensive that\tthe corporation\t is  an\t instrumentality  or\nagency of Government. The leading case on the subject in the\nUnited States  is Kerr\tv. Eneck  Pratt Free Library(1). The\nLibrary system\tin question  in this case was established by\nprivate donation  in 1882,  but by  1944, 99 per cent of the\nsystem's budget\t was supplied  by the  city,  title  to\t the\nlibrary property  was held by the city, employees there paid\nby the\tcity payroll  officer and  a high  degree of  budget\ncontrol was  exercised or  available to the city government.\nOn these  facts the  Court of  Appeal required\tthe trustees\nmanaging the  system to\t abandon a  discriminatory admission\npolicy for  its library\t training courses.  It will  be seen\nthat in\t this case  there was  considerable amount  of State\ncontrol of  the library\t system\t in  addition  to  extensive\nfinancial assistance  and it is difficult to say whether, in\nthe absence  of such  control it would have been possible to\nsay that  the  action  of  the\ttrustees  constituted  State\naction. Thomas\tP. Lewis  has expressed\t the opinion  in his\narticle on  \"The meaning  of State  Action\" (60 Colombia Law\nReview 1083)  that in  this case  \"it is  extremely unlikely\nthat absence of public control would have changed the result\nas long\t as  99%  of  the  budget  of  a  nominally  private\ninstitution  was  provided  by\tgovernment.  Such  extensive\ngovernmental support  should  be  sufficient  identification\nwith the  Government  to  subject  the\tinstitution  to\t the\nprovisions of the Fourteenth Amendment\".\n",
        "p_26": "     (1) 149 F. 2d. 212.\n",
        "p_27": "It may,\t therefore,  be\t possible  to  say  that  where\t the\nfinancial assistance  of the  State is\tso much\t as to\tmeet\nalmost entire  expenditure  of\tthe  corporation,  it  would\nafford\t some\t indication   of   the\t corporation   being\nimpregegnated  with   governmental  character.\t But   where\nfinancial assistance  is not  so extensive,  it may  not  by\nitself, without\t anything more\trender\tthe  corporation  an\ninstrumentality or  agency of government, for there are many\nprivate institutions  which  are  in  receipt  of  financial\nassistance from\t the State  and merely on that account, they\ncannot be  classified as  State\t agencies.  Equally  a\tmere\nfinding\t of   some  control   by  the  State  would  not  be\ndeterminative  of   the\t question   \"since   a\t State\t has\nconsiderable measure  of control under its police power over\nall types  of business\toperations\". But 'a finding of State\nfinancial support plus an unusual degree of control over the\nmanagement and\tpolicies might lead one to characteristic an\noperation as  State action\" vide Sukhdev v. Bhagatram(1). So\nalso the  existence of\tdeep and pervasive State control may\nafford an  indication that the Corporation is a State agency\nor instrumentality.  It may  also be  a relevant  factor  to\nconsider whether  the  corporation  enjoys  monopoly  status\nwhich is  State conferred  or State  protected. There can be\nlittle\tdoubt\tthat  State  conferred\tor  State  protected\nmonopoly status\t would be  highly relevant  in assessing the\naggregate weight  of the  corporation's ties  to the  State.\nVide  the   observations  of  Douglas,\tJ.,  in\t Jackson  v.\nMetropolitan Edison Co.(2)\n     There is  also another  factor which may be regarded as\nhaving a  bearing on  this  issue  and\tit  is\twhether\t the\noperation  of\tthe  corporation   is  an  important  public\nfunction. It  has been held in the United States in a number\nof cases  that the concept of private action must yield to a\nconception of  State action where public functions are being\nper formed.  Vide Arthur  S. Miller: \"The Constitutional Law\nof the\tSecurity State\" (10 Stanford Law Review 620 at 664).\nIt was\tpointed out  by Douglas,  J., in  Evans v. Newton(3)\nthat \"when  private individuals or groups are endowed by the\nState with  powers or functions governmental in nature, they\nbecome agencies\t or  instrumentalities\tof  the\t State\".  Of\ncourse, with  the growth  of the  welfare State,  it is very\ndifficult to define what functions are governmental and what\nare not, because, as pointed out by Villmer, L.J., in Pfizer\nv.Ministry of Health,(4) there has been, since mid-Victorian\ntimes, \"a  revolution in  political thought  and  a  totally\ndifferent conception  prevails today  as to what is and what\nis not within the functions of Government\".\n",

Gerhardt(2). A State may deem it as essential\nto its\teconomy that  it own and operate a railroad, a mill,\nor an  irrigation system  as it\t does  to  own\tand  operate\nbridges, street\t lights, or  a sewage  disposal plant.\tWhat\nmight have  been viewed\t in an earlier day as an improvident\nor even dangerous extension of state activities may today be\ndeemed indispensable.  It may  be noted\t that besides the so\ncalled traditional  functions, the  modern State  operates a\nmultitude of  public enterprises  and discharges  a host  of\nother public  functions. If the functions of the corporation\nare of public importance and closely related to governmental\nfunctions, it  would be a relevant factor in classifying the\ncorporation as\tan instrumentality  or agency of Government.\nThis is\t precisely what\t was pointed  out by  Mathew, J., in\nSukhdev v.  Bhagatram (supra)  where the  learned Judge said\nthat  \"institutions   engaged  in  matters  of\thigh  public\ninterest or performing public functions are by virtue of the\nnature\tof  the\t functions  performed  government  agencies.\nActivities which  are too  fundamental to the society are by\ndefinition too\timportant not  to be  considered  government\nfunctions.\"\n",

She was fined\n$ 5/- and aggrieved by her conviction she carried the matter\nright upto the Supreme Court contending successfully that by\nreason of  the\taction\tof  the\t corporation  her  religious\nliberty\t had  been  denied.  The  Supreme  Court  held\tthat\nadministration of  private property  such as  a town, though\nprivately carried  on, was, nevertheless, in the nature of a\npublic\tfunction   and\tthat   the  private  rights  of\t the\ncorporation   must,    therefore,   be\t  exercised   within\nconstitutional limitations  and the  conviction for trespass\nwas reversed.

Mr.  Justice  Frankfurter,\t concurring,\nreduced the  case to simpler terms. He found in the realm of\ncivil liberties the need to treat a town, private or not, as\na town.

        "p_39": "     It will  thus be  seen that  there are  several factors\nwhich may  have to  be considered  in determining  whether a\ncorporation is\tan agency  or instrumentality of Government.\nWe have\t referred to  some of  these factors and they may be\nsummarised  as\t under:\t whether   there  is  any  financial\nassistance given  by the  State, and  if  so,  what  is\t the\nmagnitude of such assistance whether there is any other form\nof assistance,\tgiven by the State, and if so, whether it is\nof the\tusual kind  or it is extraordinary, whether there is\nany  control   of  the\t management  and   policies  of\t the\ncorporation by\tthe State  and what is the nature and extent\nof  such  control,  whether  the  corporation  enjoys  State\nconferred or State protected monopoly status and whether the\nfunctions  carried   out  by   the  corporation\t are  public\nfunctions closely  related to  governmental functions.\tThis\nparticularisation  of\trelevant  factors   is\thowever\t not\nexhaustive and by its very nature it cannot be, because with\nincreasing assumption  of new tasks, growing complexities of\nmanagement  and\t  administration  and\tthe   necessity\t  of\ncontinuing adjustment  in relations  between the corporation\nand Government\tcalling for  flexibility, adapt\t ability and\ninnovative skills,  it is not possible to make an exhaustive\nenumeration of\tthe tests  which would invariably and in all\ncases provide  an unfailing answer to the question whether a\ncorporation  is\t  governmental\tinstrumentality\t or  agency.\nMoreover even amongst these factors which we have described,\nno one single factor will yield a satisfactory answer to the\nquestion and  the court will have to consider the cumulative\neffect of  these various  factors and arrive at its decision\non the\tbasis of a particularised inquiry into the facts and\ncircumstances of each case. \"the dispositive question in any\nstale action  case,\" as\t pointed  out  by  Douglas,  J.,  in\nJackson v.  Metropolitan  Edison  Company  (supra)  \"is\t not\nwhether\t any   single  fact   or  relationship\t presents  a\nsufficient degree  of state  involvement, but rather whether\nthe aggregate  of all  relevant factors compels a finding of\nstate responsibility.\"\tIt is not enough to examine seriatim\neach of\t the factors  upon which a corporation is claimed to\nbe an instrumentality or agency of Government and to dismiss\neach individually as being insufficient to support a finding\nof that\t effect. It is the aggregate or cumulative affect of\nall the relevant factors that is controlling. G\n     Now,   obviously\t where\t a    corporation   is\t  an\ninstrumentality or  agency of  Government, it  would, in the\nexercise of  its power or discretion, be subject to the same\nconstitutional or  public law limitations as Government. The\nrule inhibiting arbitrary action by Government which we have\ndiscussed above must apply equally where such corporation is\ndealing with  the public,  whether by  way of giving jobs or\nentering into  contracts or  otherwise, and  it\t cannot\t act\narbitrarily\n1042\nand enter  into relationship with any person it likes at its\nsweetwill, but\tits action  must be  in conformity with some\nprinciple which meets the test of reason and relevance.\n",

It\nrequires that State action must not be arbitrary but must be\nbased on  some rational and relevant principle which is non-\ndiscriminatory: it  must not  be guided by any extraneous or\nirrelevant considerations,  because that  would be denial of\nequality. The  principle of  reasonableness and\t rationality\nwhich is  legally as  well as  philosophically an  essential\nelement of  equality or\t non-arbitrariness is  protected  by\nArticle 14  and it  must characterise  every  State  action,\nwhether it  be under  authority of  law or  in\texercise  of\nexecutive power\t without making\t of law.  The State  cannot,\ntherefore act  arbitrarily in  entering\t into  relationship,\ncontractual or\totherwise with a third party, but its action\nmust conform  to some standard or norm which is rational and\nnon-discriminatory.  This   principle  was   recognised\t and\napplied by a Bench of this Court presided over by Ray, C.J.,\nin Erusian  Equipment and  Chemicals v.

The\texercise of  such powers and\nfunctions in  trade by\tthe State  is subject to Part III of\nthe Constitution.  Article 14  speaks of equality before the\nlaw  and   equal  protection   of  the\t laws.\tEquality  of\nopportunity should apply to matters of public contracts. The\nState has  the right  to trade. The State has there the duty\nto observe  equality. An  ordinary individual can choose not\nto deal\t with any  person The  Government cannot  choose  to\nexclude persons\t by  discrimination.  The  order  of  black-\nlisting has  the effect of depriving a person of equality of\nopportunity in\tthe matter  of public contract. A person who\nis on the approved list is unable to enter into advantageous\nrelations with\tthe  Government\t because  of  the  order  of\nblacklisting....

        "p_43": "     It is interesting to find that this rule was recognised\nand applied  by a Constitution Bench of this Court in a case\nof sale\t of kendu  leaves by  the Government  of  Orissa  in\nRashbihari Panda  v. State  of Orissa.(1) The trade of kendu\nleaves in  the State  of Orissa\t was regulated by the Orissa\nKendu Leaves  (Control of  Trade) Act,\t1961  and  this\t Act\ncreated a monopoly in favour of the State so far as purchase\nof kendu  leaves from  growers and  pluckers was  concerned.\nSection 10  of the  Act authorised the Government to sell or\notherwise dispose  of kendu  leaves purchased in such manner\nas the Government might direct. The Government first evolved\na scheme  under which  it offered  to renew  the Licences of\nthose traders  who in  its view had worked satisfactorily in\nthe previous year and had regularly paid the amount due from\nthem. The  scheme was challenged and realising that it might\nbe struck  down, the  Government  withdrew  the\t scheme\t and\ninstead, decided  to invite  tenders for advance purchase of\nkendu  leaves\tbut  restricted\t  the  invitation  to  those\nindividuals who\t had carried  out contracts  in the previous\nyear  without\tdefault\t and  to  the  satisfaction  of\t the\nGovernment. This  method of  sale of  kendu leaves  was also\nchallenged by  filing a\t writ petition\ton the\tground inter\nalia that  it was  violative of Articles ]4 and 19(1)(g) and\nthis challenge,\t though negatived  by the  High\t Court,\t was\nupheld by  this Court  in appeal. The Court pointed out that\nthe original scheme of offering to enter into contracts with\nthe old\t licences and to renew their terms was open to grave\nobjection, since  it  sought  arbitrarily  to  exclude\tmany\npersons interested  in the  trade and  the new\tscheme under\nwhich the  Government  restricted  the\tinvitation  to\tmake\noffers to  those traders who had carried out their contracts\nin the previous year without default and to the satisfaction\nof the Government was also objectionable, since the right to\nmake  tenders\tfor  the  purchase  of\tkendu  leaves  being\nrestricted to a limited\n     (1) [1969] 3 S.C.R. 374.\n",
        "p_44": "class of  persons, it effectively shut out all other persons\ncarrying on  trade in kendu leaves and also the new entrants\ninto that  business and hence it was ex-facie discriminatory\nand imposed  unreasonable restrictions\tupon  the  right  of\npersons other  than the\t existing contractors  to  carry  on\nbusiness. Both\tthe schemes  evolved by\t the Government were\nthus held  to be  violative  of\t Articles  14  and  19(1)(g)\nbecause they  \"gave rise to a monopoly in the trade in kendu\nleaves to  certain traders and singled out other traders for\ndiscriminatory\ttreatment\".   The  argument   that  existing\ncontractors who\t had carried  out their\t obligations in\t the\nprevious year  regularly and  to  the  satisfaction  of\t the\nGovernment formed  a valid basis of classification bearing a\njust and  reasonable relation  to the  object sought  to  be\nachieved by  the sales\tnamely, effective  execution of\t the\nmonopoly in  the public\t interest, was also negatived and it\nwas pointed  out that:\t\"exclusion of all persons interested\nin the\ttrade, who  were not in the previous year licencees,\nis ex  facie arbitrary;\t it had\t not direct  relation to the\nobject of preventing exploitation of pluckers and growers of\nkendu leaves,  nor had it any just or reasonable relation to\nthe securing  of the  full benefit  from the  trade, to\t the\nState\".\n",
        "p_45": "     The Court\treferred to  the offer\tmade by a well known\nmanufacturer of\t bidis for  purchase of\t the entire  crop of\nkendu leaves for a sum of Rs. 3 crores which was turned down\nby  the\t Government  and  expressed  its  surprise  that  no\nexplanation was attempted to be given on behalf of the State\nas to  why such an offer, from which the State stood to gain\nmore than  Rs. 1  crore, was  rejected by the Government. It\nwill  be  seen\tfrom  this  judgment  that  restricting\t the\ninvitation to  submit tenders  to a limited class of persons\nwas held to be violative of the equality clause, because the\nclassification\tdid   not  bear\t any.  just  and  reasonable\nrelation to  the  object  sought  to  be  achieved,  namely,\nselling of  kendu leaves  in the interest of general public.\nThe standard  or  norm\tlaid  down  by\tthe  Government\t for\nentering into  contracts of  sale of tendu leaves with third\nparties was  discriminatory and could not stand the scrutiny\nof Article  14 and  hence the scheme was held to be invalid.\nThe Court  rejected the contention of the Government that by\nreason of  section 10  it was  entitled to  dispose of kendu\nleaves in  such manner\tas it  thought fit  and there was no\nlimitation upon\t its power  to enter into contracts for sale\nof kendu  leaves with  such persons it liked. The Court held\nthat the  Government was,  in the  exercise of\tits power to\nenter into  contracts for  sale of  kendu leaves; subject to\nthe constitutional limitation of Article 14 and it could not\nact arbitrarily in selecting persons with whom to enter into\ncontracts and discriminate against others similarly situate.\nThe Court criticised\n1045\nthe Government\tfor not\t giving any explanation as to why an\noffer for  a large  amount was\tnot accepted,  the  clearest\nimplication being that the Government must act in the public\ninterest; it  cannot act  arbitrarily and without reason and\nif it does so, its action would be liable to be invalidated.\nThis decision  wholly supports\tthe view  we are  taking  in\nregard\tto   The   applicability   of\tthe   rule   against\narbitrariness in State action. B\n     We may also in this connection refer to the decision of\nthis Court  in C.  K. Achuthan\tv. State of Kerala(1), where\nHidayatullah, J.,  speaking on\tbehalf\tof  The\t Court\tmade\ncertain observation which was strongly relied upon on behalf\nof the\trespondents. The  facts of  this case  were that the\npetitioner and\tthe 3rd\t respondent Co-operative Milk Supply\nUnion, Cannanore,  submitted tenders  for the supply of milk\nto the\tGovernment hospital  at Cannanore for the year 1948-\n",
        "p_46": "49. The\t Superintendent who scrutinised the tenders accepted\nthat of\t the petitioner and communicated the reasons for the\ndecision to  the Director  of Public  Health. The  resulting\ncontract  in   favour  of   the\t petitioner   was,  however,\nsubsequently cancelled\tby issuing  a  notice  in  terms  of\nclause (2)  of the tender, in pursuance of the policy of the\nGovernment that\t in  the  matter  of  supply  to  Government\nMedical Institutions  the  Co-operative\t Milk  Supply  Union\nshould be given contract on the basis of prices filed by the\nRevenue Department.  The petitioner  challenged The decision\nof the\tGovernment in  a petition  under Article  32 of\t the\nConstitution on\t the ground  inter alia\t that there had been\ndiscrimination against\thim vis-a-vis the 3rd respondent and\nas such,  there was  contravention  of\tArticle\t 14  of\t the\nConstitution.\tThe   Constitution   Bench   rejected\tthis\ncontention  of\t the  petitioner   and\t while\t doing\t so,\nHidayatullah, J.,  made the following observation: \"There is\nno discrimination,  because it\tis  perfectly  open  to\t the\nGovernment, even  as it\t is to\ta private party, to choose a\nperson to  their liking, to fulfil contracts which they wish\nto be  performed. When\tone person  is choosen\trather\tthan\nanother, the  aggrieved party cannot claim the protection of\nArticle 14,  because the  choice of  the person\t to fulfil a\nparticular contract  must be  left to  the Government.\"\t The\nrespondents relied  very strongly  on  this  observation  in\nsupport of  their contention  that it is open to the 'State'\nto enter  into contract\t with any  one it likes and choosing\none person  in preference  to another  for entering  into  a\ncontract does  not involve  violation of  Article 1a. Though\nthe language  in which this observation is couched is rather\nwide, we  do not  think that in making this observation, the\nCourt.\tintended   to  lay  down  any  absolute\t proposition\npermitting the\tstate to  act arbitrarily  in the  matter of\nentering into contract with\n     (1) [1959] Supp. 1 S C.

State of  Orissa (supra) which was also a decision\nof the\tConstitution Bench,  where it  was held\t in so\tmany\nterms that  the State  cannot act  arbitrarily in  selecting\npersons with  whom to  enter into  contracts. Obviously what\nthe Court meant to say was that merely because one person is\nchosen in  preference to  another, it  does not\t follow that\nthere is  a violation  of Article 14, because the Government\nmust necessarily be entitled to make a choice. But that does\nnot mean  that the  choice be  arbitrary  or  fanciful.\t The\nchoice must  be dictated  by public interest and Must not be\nunreasoned or unprincipled.\n",

        "p_52": "     There was\talso one  other decision  of this  Court  in\nState of  Orissa v.  Harinarayan Jaiswal & ors.(1) which was\nstrongly relied upon on behalf of the respondents. There the\nrespondents were  the highest  bidders at an auction held by\nthe orissa  Government through\tthe Excise  Commissioner for\nthe exclusive  privilege of selling by retail country liquor\nin some\t shops. The  auction was  held pursuant\t to an order\ndated 6th  January, 1971  issued by the Government of orissa\nin exercise  of the  power conferred  under section 29(2) of\nthe Bihar  & orissa  Excise Act, 1915 and clause (6) of this\norder provided\tthat \"no  sale shall  be deemed\t to be final\nunless confirmed  by the  State Government  who shall  be at\nliberty to  accept or  reject any  bid without assigning any\nreason therefor\".  The Government  of orissa  did not accept\nany of\tthe bids  made at  the auction and subsequently sold\nthe privilege  by negotiations\twith some other parties. One\nof the\tcontentions raised  on behalf  of the petitioners in\nthat case  was that the power retained by the Government \"to\naccept or  reject many\tbid without any reason therefor\" was\nan arbitrary  power violative  of Articles 14 and 19(1) (g).\nThis contention\t was negatived\tand Hegde,  J.\tspeaking  on\nbehalf of the Court observed:\n",
        "p_53": "It will be seen from these observations that the validity of\nclause (6)  of the  order dated 6th January, 1971 was upheld\nby this Court on the ground that having regard to the object\nof holding  the\t auction,  namely,  to\traise  revenue,\t the\nGovernment was\tentitled to  reject even the highest bid, if\nit thought  that  the  price  offered  was  inadequate.\t The\nGovernment was\tnot bound to accept the tender of the person\nwho  offered  the  highest  amount  and\t if  the  Government\nrejected all  the bids\tmade at\t the  auction,\tit  did\t not\ninvolve any  violation of  Article 14 or 19(1)(g). This is a\nself-evident proposition  and we do not see how it can be of\nany assistance to the respondents.\n",
        "p_54": "     The last decision to which reference was made on behalf\nof the respondents was the decision in P. R. Quenin v. M. K.\nTendel(1) This decision merely reiterates the principle laid\ndown in\t the earlier  decisions in Trilochan Mishra v. State\nof Orissa (supra) and State of Orissa v. Harinarayan Jaiswal\n(supra) and  points out that a condition that the Government\nshall be  at liberty  to accept\t or reject  any bid  without\nassigning any reason therefor is not violative of Article 14\nand  that   \"in\t matters  relating  to\tcontracts  with\t the\nGovernment, the\t latter is not bound to accept the tender of\nthe person who offers the highest amount\". Now where does it\nsay that  such a  condition permits  the Government  to\t act\narbitrarily in accepting a tender or that under the guise or\npretext of such a condition, the Government may enter into a\ncontract with  any person  it likes, arbitrarily and without\nreason. In  fact the  Court pointed  out at  the end  of the\njudgment that the act of the Government was not \"shown to be\nvitiated  by   such  arbitrariness   as\t should\t  call\t for\ninterference by\t the Court\", recognising clearly that if the\nrejection  of\tthe  tender   of  the  1st  respondent\twere\narbitrary, the\tCourt would  have been justified in striking\nit down as invalid.\n",

        "p_57": "tion considerable  light is  thrown by\tthe decision of this\nCourt in  Rajasthan Electricity\t Board v. Mohan Lal(1). That\nwas a  case in\twhich this Court was called upon to consider\nwhether the  Rajasthan Electricity  Board was an 'authority'\nwithin the  meaning of the expression \"other authorities\" in\nArt. 12.  Bhargava,  J.,  delivering  the  judgment  of\t the\nmajority pointed out that the expression \"other authorities\"\nin Art.\t 12 would  include all\tconstitutional and statutory\nauthorities on whom powers are conferred by law. The learned\nJudge also said that if any body of persons has authority to\nissue  directions   the\t disobedience\tof  which  would  be\npunishable  as\t a  criminal   offence,\t that  would  be  an\nindication that\t that authority\t is 'State'.  Shah, J.,\t who\ndelivered a  separate judgment, agreeing with the conclusion\nreached by  the\t majority,  preferred  to  give\t a  slightly\ndifferent meaning  to the expression \"other authorities\". He\nsaid that  authorities, constitutional\tor statutory,  would\nfall within  the expression \"other authorities\" only if they\nare invested  with the sovereign power of the State, namely,\nthe power to make rules and regulations which have the force\nof law.\t The ratio of this decision may thus be stated to be\nthat a constitutional or statutory authority would be within\nthe meaning of the expression \"other authorities\", if it has\nbeen  invested\t with  statutory   power  to  issue  binding\ndirections to third parties, the disobedience of which would\nentail penal  consequence or  it has  the sovereign power to\nmake rules  and regulations  having the\t force of  law. This\ntest was  followed by  Ray, C.J.,  in Sukhdev  v. Bhagat Ram\n(supra). Mathew, J., however, in the same case, propounded a\nbroader test,  namely, whether\tthe statutory corporation or\nother  body   or  authority,  claimed  to  fall\t within\t the\ndefinition of  State', is  as instrumentality  or agency  of\nGovernment: if\tit is,\tit would  fall within the meaning of\nthe expression\t'other authorities'  and  would\t be  State'.\nWhilst accepting the test laid down in Rajasthan Electricity\nBoard v.  Mohan Lal  (supra), and followed by Ray, C. J., in\nSukhdev v. Bhagat Ram (supra), we would, for reasons already\ndiscussed,  prefer   to\t adopt\t the  test  of\tGovernmental\ninstrumentality or  agency as  one more\t test and  perhaps a\nmore satisfactory  one for  determining whether\t a statutory\ncorporation,  body  or\tother  authority  falls\t within\t the\ndefinition of  'State'. If  a statutory corporation, body or\nother  authority   is  an   instrumentality  or\t  agency  of\nGovernment, it would be an 'authority' and therefore 'State'\nwithin the meaning of that expression in Article 12.\n",

        "p_59": "     The second\t decision to  which we must refer is that in\nHeavy Engineering  Mazdoor Union  v. State  of Bihar(2). The\nquestion which arose in this case was whether a reference of\nan  industrial\t dispute  between   the\t Heavy\t Engineering\nCorporation  Limited   (hereinafter  referred\tto  as\t the\n'Corporation') and  the Union  made by\tthe State  of  Bihar\nunder section  10 of  the Industrial  Disputes Act, 1947 was\nvalid. The  argument of\t the Union  was that the industry in\nquestion was  \"carried on under the authority of the Central\nGovernment\" and the reference could, therefore, be made only\nby the\tCentral Government.  The Court\theld that  the words\n\"under the  authority\" mean \"pursuant to the authority, such\nas where an agent or a servant acts under of pursuant to the\nauthority of  his principal or master\" and on this view, the\nCourt  addressed   itself  to\tthe  question\twhether\t the\nCorporation  could  be\tsaid  to  be  carrying\ton  business\npursuant to  the authority  of the  Central Government.\t The\nanswer to  this question  was  obviously  'no'\tbecause\t the\nCorporation was\t carrying  on  business\t in  virtue  of\t the\nauthority  derived  from  its  memorandum  and\tarticles  of\nassociation and\t not by\t reason of  any authority granted by\nthe Central  Government.

Sub-section  (1) of  section 3 of the Act provides\nthat the Central Government shall constitute an authority to\nbe called  the International  Airport Authority of India, to\nwhom we\t shall hereafter  refer as  the 1st respondent. Sub-\nsection (2)  states that the 1 st respondent shall be a body\ncorporate having  perpetual succession and a common seal and\nsub-section (3) enacts that the Ist respondent shall consist\nof a Chairman to be appointed by the Central Government, the\nDirector General  of Civil  Aviation exofficio\tand not less\nthan six  and not more than thirteen members to be appointed\nby the\tCentral Government.  The term  of  office  of  every\nmember of  the 1st  respondent is  prescribed by sub-section\n(1) of\tsection 5  to be 3 years, but the Central Government\nis  given   under  the\t Proviso  power\t  to  terminate\t the\nappointment of\tany member  who is  not\t a  servant  of\t the\nGovernment after  giving him  notice as also to terminate at\nany time  the appointment  of any member who is a servant of\nthe Government.\t The power  to remove  a member\t in  certain\nspecified  circumstances  is  also  vested  in\tthe  Central\nGovernment under  section 6.  Section  32,  sub-section\t (1)\nprovides that  as from\tthe date  appointed by\tthe  Central\nGovernment all\tproperties and\tother assets vested in the p\nCentral Government  for the  purposes  of  the\tairport\t and\nadministered by\t the  Director\tGeneral\t of  Civil  Aviation\nimmediately  before   such  date   shall  vest\tin  the\t 1st\nrespondent  and\t  all  debts,  obligations  and\t liabilities\nincurred, all  contracts entered  into and  all matters\t and\nthings engaged\tto be  done by,\t with  or  for\tthe  Central\nGovernment immediately\tbefore such  date shall be deemed to\nhave been  incurred, entered into and engaged to be done by,\nwith or\t for the  1st respondent. This sub-section also says\nthat all  non-recurring expenditure  incurred by the Central\nGovernment for\tor in  connection with\tthe purposes  of the\nairport upto  the appointed  date and declared to be capital\nexpenditure by\tthe Central  Government shall  be treated as\nthe capital  provided by  the Central  Government to the 1st\nrespondent  and\t all  sums  of\tmoney  due  to\tthe  Central\nGovernment in relation to the airport immediately before the\nappointed date\tshall  be  deemed  to  be  due\tto  the\t 1st\nrespondent. The\t 1st respondent\t is also  given the power to\ninstitute or continue all suits\n1053\nand other  legal proceedings  instituted or which could have\nbeen instituted by or against the Central Government for any\nmatter in relation to the airport and every employee holding\nany office  under the  Central Government immediately before\nthe appointed  date solely  or mainly  for or  in connection\nwith the  affairs of  the airport  shall be  treated  as  on\ndeputation with\t the  1st  respondent.\tSub-section  (1)  of\nsection 12 also enacts similar provisions with regard to the\nair navigation\tservices and  the buildings used exclusively\nfor such services immediately before the appointed date. The\nfunctions of the 1st respondent are specified in section 16:\nsub-section (l) provides that, subject to the rules, if any,\nmade by\t the Central  Government in this behalf, it shall be\nthe function  of the  1st respondent  to manage the airports\nefficiently and sub-section (2) casts an obligation on the 1\nst respondent  to provide  at the airports such services and\nfacilities as  are necessary  or desirable for the efficient\noperation of  air transport  services and  certain  specific\nfunctions  to\tbe  performed  by  the\t1st  respondent\t are\nparticularised in  sub-section (3).  These. functions  were,\nuntil the  appointed date,  being carried out by the Central\nGovernment but\tnow under Section 16 they are transferred to\nthe ]  st respondent.  Section 20 provides that after making\nprovision  for\t reserve  funds,  bad  and  doubtful  debts,\ndepreciation in\t assets\t and  an  other\t matters  which\t are\nusually provided  for by companies, the 1st respondent shall\npay the\t balance of  its annual\t net profits  to the Central\nGovernment. Section 21 requires the 1st respondent to submit\nfor the\t approval of  the Central  Government a statement of\nthe programme  of  its\tactivities  during  the\t forthcoming\nfinancial year\tas well as its financial estimate in respect\nthereof at  least three\t months before\tthe commencement  of\neach  financial\t year  and  section  24\t provides  that\t the\naccounts of  the 1st respondent shall be audited annually by\nthe Comptroller\t and Auditor  General and  the\taccounts  as\ncertified by  the Comptroller  and Auditor  General  or\t any\nother person  appointed by him in this behalf, together with\nthe audit  report thereon, shall be forwarded to the Central\nGovernment and\tthe Central  Government shall cause the same\nto be  laid  before  both  Houses  of  Parliament.  The\t 1st\nrespondent is  also required  by section  25 to\t prepare and\nsubmit to  the Central\tGovernment, as\tsoon as may be after\nthe end\t of each  financial year, a report giving an account\nof its\tactivities during the financial year and this report\nhas to\tbe laid\t before both  Houses of\t Parliament  by\t the\nCentral Government.  The officers  and employees  of the 1st\nrespondent are\tdeemed by  section 28  to be public servants\nand section 29 gives them immunity from suit, prosecution or\nother legal  proceeding for  anything in  good faith done or\nintended to  he done  in pursuance of the Act or any rule or\nregulation made\t under it.  Section 33\tconfers power on the\nCentral Government\n1054\nto temporarily divest the 1st respondent from the management\nof any\tairport and  to direct the 1st respondent to entrust\nsuch management\t to any other person. The Central Government\nis also\t empowered  by\tsection\t 34  lo\t supersede  the\t 1st\nrespondent under certain specified circumstances. Section 35\ngives power  to the Central Government to give directions in\nwriting from  time  to\ttime  on  questions  of\t policy\t and\nprovides that  the 1 st respondent shall in the discharge of\nits functions,\tand duties,  be bound  by  such\t directions.\nSection\t 36   confers  rule  making  power  on\tthe  Central\nGovernment for\tcarrying out  the purposes  of the  Act\t and\npower to make regulations is conferred on the 1st respondent\nunder section  37. Section  39 provides\t that any regulation\nmade by\t the 1st  respondent under any of the clauses (g) to\n",
        "p_66": "(m) of\tsub-section (2)\t of section  37 may make it Penal to\ncontravene such regulation.\n",
        "p_67": "     lt will  be seen  from these  provisions that there are\ncertain features  of the  1 st respondent which are eloquent\nand throw  considerable light  on the true nature of the 1st\nrespondent. In\tthe first place, the chairman and members of\nthe 1st\t respondent are all persons nominated by the Central\nGovernment and\tthe Central Government has also the power to\nterminate their\t appointment  as  also\tto  remove  them  in\ncertain specified  circumstances. The  Central Government is\nalso vested  with the  power to\t take away the management of\nany airport from the 1st respondent and to entrust it to any\nother person  or authority  and for certain special reasons,\nthe  Central   Government  can\t also  supersede   the\t Ist\nrespondent. The\t Central Government  has also  power to give\ndirections in  writing,, from  time to\ttime on questions of\npolicy and  these directions are declared binding on the 1st\nrespondent. The\t 1st respondent has no share capital but the\ncapital needed\tby it  for carrying  out  its  functions  is\nprovided wholly\t by the\t Central Government.  The balance of\nthe not\t profit made  by the  Ist  respondent  after  making\nprovision for  various charges,\t such as  reserve funds, had\nand doubtful  debts depreciation  in assets  etc.  does\t not\nremain with  the 1st  respondent and  is required to be paid\nover lo\t the Central  Government. The 1st respondent is also\nrequired  to  submit  to  the  Central\tGovernment  for\t its\napproval a  statement of  the programme of its activities as\nalso  the  financial  estimate\tand  it\t must  follow  as  a\nnecessary corollary  that the  1 st respondent can carry out\nonly such  activities and  incur only such expenditure as is\napproved by  the Central Government. The audited accounts of\nthe 1st respondent together with the audit report have to be\nforwarded to the Central Government and they are required to\nbe laid\t before both  Houses of\t Parliament. So\t far as\t the\nfunctions of  the 1st  respondent are  concerned, the entire\ndepartment  of\t the  Central  Government  relating  to\t the\nadministration\tof  airports  and  air\tnevigation  services\ntogether with its\n1055\nproperties and\tassets, debts,\tobligations and liabilities,\ncontracts, causes  A of\t action and  pending  litigation  is\ntransferred to\tthe 1st respondent and the 1st respondent is\ncharged with  carrying out  the same  functions which  were,\nuntil the  appointed date,  being carried out by the Central\nGovernment. The employees and officers on the 1st respondent\nare also deemed to be public servants and the 1st respondent\nas well\t as its\t members, officers  and employees  are given\nimmunity for  anything\twhich  is  in  good  faith  done  or\nintended to  be done  in pursuance of the Act or any rule or\nregulation made\t under it.  The 1st respondent is also given\npower to frame Regulations and to provide that contravention\nof  certain   specified\t Regulations   shall  entail   penal\nconsequence. These  provisions clearly\tshow that every test\ndiscussed  above  is  satisfied\t in  the  case\tof  the\t 1st\nrespondent and\tthey leave  no doubt that the 1st respondent\nis an  instrumentality or  agency of  the Central Government\nand falls  within the  definition of  'State'  both  on\t the\n'narrow view  taken by the majority in Sukhdev v. Bhagat Ram\n(supra) as  also on  the broader view of Mathew, J., adopted\nby us.\n",
        "p_68": "     It is,  therefore, obvious\t that both  having regard to\nthe  constitutional  mandate  of  Article  14  as  also\t the\njudicially evolved  rule  of  administrative  law,  the\t 1st\nrespondent was\tnot entitled to act arbitrarily in accepting\nthe tender  of the 4th respondents, but was bound to conform\nto the\tstandard or  norm laid\tdown in\t paragraph 1  of the\nnotice inviting\t tenders which\trequired that  only a person\nrunning a  registered IInd  Class hotel\t or  restaurant\t and\nhaving at  least S  years'  experience\tas  such  should  be\neligible to  tender.  It  was  not  the\t contention  of\t the\nappellant that\tthis standard  or norm prescribed by the 1st\nrespondent was\tdiscriminatory having  no just or reasonable\nrelation to  the object of inviting tenders namely, to award\nthe contract  to a sufficiently experienced person who would\nbe able\t to run\t efficiently a\tIInd class restaurant at the\nairport. Admittedly  the standard or norm was reasonable and\nnon-discriminatory and\tonce such  a standard  or  norm\t for\nrunning a  IInd Class  restaurant should be awarded was laid\ndown, the  1st respondent was not entitled to depart from it\nand to award the contract to the 4th respondents who did not\nsatisfy the  condition\tof  eligibility\t prescribed  by\t the\nstandard or  norm. If  there was no acceptable tender from a\nperson who  satisfied the  condition of eligibility, the 1st\nrespondent could have rejected the tenders and invited fresh\ntenders on  the basis  of a less stringent standard or norm,\nbut it could not depart from the standard or norm prescribed\nby  it\t and  arbitrarily  accept  the\ttender\tof  the\t 4th\nrespondents. When  the 1st respondent entertained the tender\nof the\t4th respondents\t even though  they did\tnot  have  5\nyears' experience of running a IInd Class\n1056\nrestaurant or  hotel,  denied  equality\t of  opportunity  to\nothers similarly  situate in the matter of tendering for the\ncontract. There\t might have been many other persons, in fact\nthe appellant himself claimed to be one such person, who did\nnot have  5  years'  experience\t of  running  a\t IInd  Class\nrestaurant, but\t who were  otherwise competent to run such a\nrestaurant and\tthey might  also have  competed with the 4th\nrespondents  for  obtaining  the  contract,  but  they\twere\nprecluded from\tdoing so  by the  condition  of\t eligibility\nrequiring five\tyears' experience.  The action\tof  the\t 1st\nrespondent in  accepting the  tender of the 4th respondents,\neven though they did not satisfy the prescribed condition of\neligibility, was  clearly discriminatory,  since it excluded\nother  person  similarly  situate  from\t tendering  for\t the\ncontract and  it was  plainly arbitrary\t and without reason.\nThe acceptance\tof the tender of the 4th respondents was, in\nthe circumstances invalid as being violative of the equality\nclause\tof   the  Constitution\t as  also  of  the  rule  of\nadministrative law inhibiting arbitrary action.\n",
        "p_69": "     Now, on  this view\t we should have ordinarily set aside\nthe decision of the,- 1st respondent accepting the tender of\nthe 4th\t respondents and  the contract\tresulting from\tsuch\nacceptance  but\t  in  view   of\t the   peculiar\t facts\t and\ncircumstances of  the present case, we do not think it would\nbe a  sound exercise of discretion on our part to upset that\ndecision and  void the\tcontract. It  does appear  from\t the\naffidavits filed  by the  parties that\tthe appellant has no\nreal interest  in the result of the litigation, but has been\nput up\tby A.  S. Irani for depriving the 4th respondents of\nthe benefit  of the contract secured by them. We find that a\nnumber of  proceedings have been instituted for this purpose\nfrom time  to time  by A.  S. Irani  either personally or by\ninstigating others to take such proceedings. The first salvo\nin the battle against the 4th respondents was fired by K. S.\nIrani, proprietor  of  Cafe  Excelsior,\t who  filed  a\tsuit\nchallenging the decision of the 1st respondent to accept the\ntender of the 4th respondents, but in this suit he failed to\nobtain an interim injunction and his appeal was dismissed by\nthe High Court on 19th October, 1977. It is significant that\nwhen the  tenders were\topened in  the office of the Airport\nDirector, Cafe\tExcelsior was  represented by  A. S.  Irani,\nwhich shows  that either  Cafe Excelsior was a nominee of A.\nS. Irani  or in\t any event  K. S.  Irani, proprietor of Cafe\nExcelsior, was closely connected with A. S. Irani. Moreover,\nit is  interesting to note that though the tender of the 4th\nrespondents was accepted as far back as 19th April, 1977, K.\nS. Irani did not adopt any proceedings immediately but filed\nthe suit  only after A. S. Irani was informed by the Airport\nDirector on  22nd August,  1977 that  a final order has been\nreceived from the Ministry\n1057\nrequiring  A.\tS.  Irani  to  immediately  close  down\t his\nrestaurant and\tsnack bars.  It is  also a  circumstance not\nwithout significance  that A.  S. Irani\t did not immediately\ntake any  proceeding for  challenging the  acceptance of the\ntender of  the 4th  respondents, but filed a suit in his own\nname only  after the  appeal of K. S. Irani was dismissed by\nthe High  Court on  19th October,  1977. These circumstances\nclearly indicate  that the  suit was filed by K. S. Irani at\nthe instance  of A. S. Irani or in any event in concert with\nhim and\t when the  suit of K. S. Irani failed to achieve the\ndesired result, A. S. Irani stepped into the arena and filed\nhis own\t suit. This  suit was  for  a  mandatory  injunction\nseeking removal\t of the\t two snack  bars which\thad  in\t the\nmeantime' been put up by the 4th respondents pursuant to the\nacceptance of  their tender  by the  1st respondent.  But in\nthis proceeding\t also A.  S. Irani  failed to  obtain an ad-\ninterim injunction.  It was only after the failure to obtain\ninterim relief\tin these two proceedings, one by K. S. Irani\nand the\t other by  A. S. Irani, that the appellant filed the\npresent\t writ\tpetition  in   the  High   Court  of  Bombay\nchallenging the decision of the 1st respondent to accept the\ntender of  the 4th  respondents. Now,  it appears  from\t the\nrecord\tthat   the  appellant\twas  at\t the  material\ttime\nconducting a  restaurant called\t Royal Restaurant  and Store\nwhich was  owned in partnership by three persons, namely, J.\nK. Irani,  K. M.  Irani and  G. S. Irani. G. S. Irani is the\nbrother of A. S. Irani and he was managing and looking after\nthe restaurant\tof A.  S. Irani\t at the\t airport. It  would,\ntherefore, be  a fair  inference to  make that the appellant\nwas well  connected with  A. S. Irani and from the manner in\nwhich proceedings  with a  view to  thwarting the attempt of\nthe 4th respondents to obtain the benefit of their contract,\nhave been adopted one after the other in different names, it\ndoes appear  that the  appellant has filed the writ petition\nat the instance of A. S. Irani with a view to helping him to\nobtain the  contract for  the restaurant and the snack bars.\nIt is  difficult to understand why the appellant should have\nwaited until  8th November,  1977 to  file the writ petition\nwhen the  tender of  the 4th respondents was accepted as far\nhack as\t 19th April,  1977. The\t explanation  given  by\t the\nappellant is  that he was not aware of the acceptance of the\ntender of  the 4th  respondents but  that is  a rather naive\nexplanation which  cannot  be  easily  accepted\t It  is\t not\npossible to  believe that  the appellant  who  was  so\twell\nconnected with A. S. Irani and G. S. Irani did not know that\nA. S.  Irani had  failed to  obtain the contract for running\nthe restaurant and the snack bars and that this contract had\nbeen awarded  to the 4th respondents as a result of which A.\nS. Irani  was being pressed to close down his restaurant and\nsnack bars.  We have grave doubts whether this writ petition\nwas commenced by the appellant bona fide\n1058\nwith a\tview to\t protecting his\t own interest. Moreover, the\nwrit petition  was filed  by the  appellant more  than\tfive\nmonths after  the  acceptance  of  the\ttender\tof  the\t 4th\nrespondents and\t during this  period,  the  4th\t respondents\nincurred considerable  expenditure aggregating\tto about Rs.\n1,25,000/-  in\t making\t arrangements  for  putting  up\t the\nrestaurant and\tthe snack  bars and in fact set up the snack\nbars and  started running  the same.  It would\tnow be\tmost\ninequitous to set aside the contracts of the 4th respondents\nat the\tinstance of  the appellant.  The position would have\nbeen different\tif the appellant had filed the writ petition\nimmediately after  the acceptance  of the  tender of the 4th\nrespondents but\t the appellant allowed a period of over five\nmonths to  elapse during  which the  4th respondents altered\ntheir position.\t We are, therefore, of the view that this is\nnot a fit case in which we should interfere and grant relief\nto the\tappellant in  the exercise  of our  discretion under\nArticle 136 read with Article 226 of the Constitution.\n",
        "p_70": "     We accordingly dismiss the appeal and confirm the order\nof the\tHigh Court  rejecting the  writ petition. But in the\ncircumstances of the case there will be no order as to costs\nthroughout.\n"

        "p_3": "2. The plaintiff is a partnership firm which claims to be manufacturing churan and digestive tablets since the year 1982. The mark ROCHAK is stated to have been adopted in the year 1982 itself and artistic labels in the form of pouch bearing the trademark ROCHAK were used for sale of the products. The pouch is stated to have distinctive features such as colour combination of blue, white and red. The face of a person artistically designed in a manner that the face is mounted on the handle of the spoon and the spoon is crisscrossed by a knife. A two toned red plate is in the background of this crisscrossed spoon and knife with the word 'ROCHAK' written in red letters in the blue strip and in blue in the white portion on the pouch. The VISAKHA, the name of the plaintiff firm, is written in a hexagon.\n",
        "p_4": "3. The AM PACHAN is stated to have been adopted in the year 1985 with the colour combination of light green, red, white and yellow with AM PACHAN written in Hindi and English in an artistic manner. The first letter of the trademark starts from the middle of an artistically designed mango. The children are shown on the package in a special posture with AM PACHAN written in a box with yellow colour in the background and the name of the plaintiff VISAKHA written in a hexagon.\n",
        "p_5": "4. The plaintiff is stated to be a registered proprietor of the copyrights registered under different Nos. in respect of both ROCHAK and AM PACHAN and the year-wise details of sales figures have been set out in para 7 of the plaint. These sales figures have been given from the year 1985-86 and for the nearest year of 2004-2005, the sales figure were of more than Rs. 33 lakhs. Almost half of the sales are in respect of the trademark ROCHAK, while about 48% pertained to the trademark AM PACHAN and the remaining 2% for the other products of the plaintiff. The plaintiff is stated to have widely advertised its products.\n",
        "p_6": "5. The plaintiff claims to have established an unrivaled reputation and goodwill for the trademark ROCHAK and AM PACHAN which are exclusively associated with the goods of the plaintiff in respect of Ayurvedic medicinal products such as churans and tablets for digestive purposes. The packaging is stated to be distinctive and, thus, the public and third persons associate the trademark and the packaging with the goods of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_7": "6. The plaintiff has given illustrations of various legal proceedings initiated for protection of the trademark and the packaging by filing of civil suits where the plaintiff succeeded albeit largely on the defendant(s) compromising and recognizing the rights of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_8": "7. The defendants are stated to have recently started selling Ayurvedic medicinal products of similar nature under the trademark ROCHAK and AM PACHAN with similar packaging. The plaintiff has annexed its pouches as Annexures - A and B while those of the defendants are Annexures - Y and Z to show similarity of the packaging. It is stated that such packaging is bound to cause confusion and deception amongst the purchasers who would be misled into thinking that the products of the defendants actually emanate from the plaintiff. The triple identity test of identical goods, identical trademarks and identical trade channels are stated to be fully satisfied in the present case and the action of the defendants is stated to be deliberate and deceptive with the sole object of making illegal profits by passing off its inferior goods as those of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_9": "8. The plaintiff has, thus, filed the suit and along with the suit filed the application for interlocutory relief under the provisions of Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 (for short, 'the Code'). Ad interim orders were granted in favor of the plaintiff on 26.09.2005 in IA No. 7656/2005. The defendants have entered appearance and filed the written statement. The defendants have also sought vacation of the injunction by filing IA No. 10095/2005 under Order XXXIX Rule 4 of the Code.\n",
        "p_10": "9. The defendants have resisted the suit and the application. The defendants have claimed that the trademark and the packaging are not identical or deceptively similar. It is stated that no trademark rights or significance can be attached to the word 'AM PACHAN' as it is not a trademark and is descriptive as well as generic and laudatory in nature. The said word is stated to be commonly used in the trademark by numerous persons / firms in relation to churan tablets. The defendants claim that the plaintiff is not proprietor or owner under any statutory law or common law of the trademarks or labels of ROCHAK and AM PACHAN. The defendants have also disputed that the plaintiff has been using the trademarks continuously since the year 1982 and, thus, have claimed that the plaintiff has no goodwill in the packaging of the mark. The plaintiffs are stated to be guilty of suppressio veri suggesstio falsi. This allegation is based on the fact that the plaintiff is alleged to have originally adopted the trademark / label 'ROCHAKA' and made an application for registration thereof. The mark was advertised in the trademark journal, but was opposed by M/s. F Hoffmann-La Roche AG, Ch 4002 Basel, Switzerland. The plaintiff thereafter changed its trademark to ROCHAK and accordingly the opposition was withdrawn and the mark was amended to read as ROCHAK vide Order dated 12.10.2001. This mark is stated not to have been advertised as per the provisions of law or the Trademarks Act, 1999 and directly the registration certificate was issued.\n",
        "p_11": "10. A plea has also been raised that the impugned trademark AM PACHAN originally belonged to a third-party from Nepal and the same is registered in that country.\n",
        "p_12": "11. The plaintiff filed a replication and one factor to be taken note of is that the counsel for the defendants originally represented the plaintiff itself and had issued a notice in the year 1986, copy of which has been placed on record, stating that the plaintiff was engaged in the relevant business and have been using the trademark ROCHAK since the year 1982.\n",
        "p_13": "12. Learned counsel for the plaintiff, in fact, sought to contend that the counsel for the defendants had no right to represent the defendants as the counsel had represented the plaintiff in respect of the disputes relating to the same trademarks. However, learned counsel for the defendants stated that he had examined the issue and was entitled to represent the defendants. Be that as it may, the same is not a matter to be considered by this Court. However, in view of the notice, learned counsel for the defendants conceded that he would not advance the plea that prior to 1986, the plaintiff did not have any sale under the trademark ROCHAK. The plea was sought to be modified by contending that apparently the plaintiff had given up the trademark and post-1986 was marketing under the name of ROCHAKA, which was ultimately not registered and registration of the mark ROCHAK subsequently in the year 2001 did not establish the right of the plaintiff from the year 1986 onwards apart from the fact that such registration was not valid.\n",
        "p_14": "13. Learned counsel for the plaintiff referred to various documents placed on record including copy of the drug license issued in the year 1982 for both ROCHAK tablets and ROCHAK churan. A memorandum dated 03.12.2001 issued by the Directorate of Indian System of Medicine and Homeopathy, Government of NCT of Delhi has also been placed on record certifying that the firm holds license to manufacture Ayurvedic medicine including ROCHAK Tablet and AM PACHAN Tablet. The license is stated to be in force as per the said letter. Advertisements in respect of both the marks for various periods starting from 1993 have been placed on record by filing copies of the newspapers where such advertisements were issued. Some of the old bills showing sales of ROCHAK tablets have also been placed on record including bills for the year 1985.\n",
        "p_15": "14. The plaintiff has filed certificates of registration issued by the Copyright Office of the artistic work of both ROCHAK and AM PACHAN. It may be stated that there are small pouches of both ROCHAK and AM PACHAN in respect of the plaintiff and the defendants, which in turn are put in larger pouches. In order to appreciate the distinctive features and the visual impact, it may be appropriate to compare the two pouches. The smaller pouches of the parties in respect of ROCHAK being Annexure - A and Annexure - Y respectively as also in respect of AM PACHAN being Annexure - B and Annexure - Z respectively are as under:\n",
        "p_16": "ANNEXURE - A AND ANNEXURE - Y\n \n\nANNEXURE - B and ANNEXURE - Z\n \n\n",
        "p_17": "15.The larger pouches of the two parties are as under:\n",
        "p_18": "PLAINTIFF'S LARGER POUCH\n \n\nDEFENDANT'S LARGER POUCH\n \n\nPLAINTIFF'S LARGER POUCH\n \n\nDEFENDANT'S LARGER POUCH\n \n\n",
        "p_19": "16. A comparison of the two packagings, in my considered view, leaves little manner of doubt that the attempt of the defendants is clearly to replicate the packaging of the plaintiff. Such replication is almost feature by feature. It is the total impact which has to be seen and not merely a question of a particular colour combination being used. Thus, there is no doubt in my mind by reference to the colour schemes, the placement of the mark, the features of the spoon and the knife and the placement of the head, the nature of the face of the person, the hexagonal nature where the brand-name is indicated that the two are practically identical. In fact, a visual perusal of the smaller and the larger packaging itself shows that a common man, who consumes the product, is bound to fall into a deception and assuming that the products of the defendants emanate from the plaintiff. It is, thus, clearly an attempt on the part of the defendants to pass off their goods as those of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_20": "17. Learned counsel for both the parties referred to certain judgments to substantiate their point of view.\n",
        "p_21": "18. Learned counsel for the plaintiff referred to the judgment of learned Single Judge of Madhya Pradesh High Court in Rati Traders v. K.P. Pouches Pvt. Ltd. 2004 (29) PTC 254 (MP). This judgment was cited to advance the proposition that it is the test of prior user in such a case of passing off which would be the most material. It was observed in para 11 of the judgment by reference to the judgment of Delhi High Court as under:\n",
        "p_22": "11. The main ground for allowing the application of the respondent by the court below had been that in its opinion the respondent had been prior user of the trademark Safal. Certainly, an injunction could be granted in favor of prior user Jai Prakash Gupta v. Vishal Aluminium Mfg. Co. 1996 PTC (16) had been clear authority for the purpose. The learned Judge therein had held:\n",
        "p_23": " There is no dispute and can be none with the legal proposition that as between the two parties, who proposed to use a particular trade mark the person who designs the mark will get preference over the other and in case of one party proposing to use the mark against the actual user, the later will take precedence. In between the two parties claiming actual user as against the prior user, the party, who is prior in point of time will have the advantage over the other. Even in regard to the prior registration of the trade mark, as against the prior user, the action of the later will prevail. In an action for passing off, in order to succeed in getting an interim injunction, the plaintiff has to establish user of the mark prior in point of time than the impugned user by the defendant. The registration of the mark or similar m ark prior in point of time to user by the plaintiff is irrelevant in an action for passing off and the mere presence of the mark in the register maintained by the trade mark registry does not prove its user by the person in whose names the mark is registered and it is irrelevant for the purposes of deciding the application for interim injunction unless evidence has been led or is available of user of their registered trade mark.\n",
        "p_24": "19. Learned counsel for the plaintiff further referred to the judgment of learned Single Judge of this Court in Jai Prakash Gupta v. Vishal Aluminium Mfg. Co. 1996 PTC (16) 575, which is the judgment relied upon by the Madhya Pradesh High Court aforesaid. It was observed in para 16 as under:\n",
        "p_25": " 16. On another question, which has been raised on behalf of the defendant that the application as well as suit of the plaintiff is not maintainable, since plaintiff is a pirator of the trade mark VISHAL of M/s Monica Manufacturing Co, the same is of no consequence since the instant litigation is between the plaintiff and the defendant, in which M/s Monica Manufacturing Co. is not a party. Moreover, it may be observed that in suit between the plaintiff and M/s Monica Manufacturing Co. also there is an order passed on 13th September, 1993, copy of which has been placed on record on behalf of the defendant that M/s Monica Manufacturing Co., for the duration of the said suit stated that plaintiff in the instant suit will be at liberty to use the trade mark VISHAl till the controversy amongst plaintiff and M/s Monica Manufacturing Co. is finally decided. The above objection raised on behalf of the defendant otherwise has to be negatived that for the purpose of the instant application, on the ratio of the decision of this Court in Coolways India v. Princo Air Conditioning and Refrigeration 1993 (1) A.L.R. 401. In that case it was held that it will be useless and without merit to contend that the petitioner himself is infringing the trade mark of another person. It is a matter between the petitioner and the other party on whose favor that trade mark is registered. The respondent cannot be allowed to make use of the reputation and goodwill of the petitioner by adopting his trade mark or a deceptively similar trade mark for his product. On the same principle, in the instant case also, the defendant cannot take advantage of the pendency of litigation between the plaintiff and M/s Monica Manufacturing Co.\n",
        "p_26": "20. A reading of the aforesaid judgment shows that a defendant cannot be allowed to make use of the reputation and goodwill of the plaintiff by adopting its trademark or a deceptively similar trademark for its product and the defendant cannot take advantage of the pendency of the litigation between the plaintiff and a third-party. It is this latter aspect which has been emphasised by learned counsel for the plaintiff in view of the plea raised by learned counsel for the defendants that rectification proceedings are pending.\n",
        "p_27": "21. Learned counsel for the plaintiff also referred to the judgment of learned Single Judge of this Court in Avis International Ltd. v. Avi Footwear Industries and Anr. AIR 1991 DELHI 22 wherein it was observed in paras 9 and 17 as under:\n",
        "p_28": "9. The further case of the defendants that in view of the fact that the rectification proceedings have been filed, it would not be appropriate to grant the injunction which has been sought by the plaintiffs against the defendants, as prima facie the register is liable to be rectified. For this proposition, the defendants have referred to two judgments of this Court, both delivered by Dalip K. Kapur, J., which have been reported in 1981 Patent and Trade Mark Cases 14, and 1981 Patent and Trade Mark Cases 260.\n",
        "p_29": "17. In my view, the statutory monopoly which has been conferred upon the plaintiffs in connect with use of the mark AVIS for footwear has to have primary precedence over any other consideration in relation to grant or non-grant of an injunction, especially when the matter is at interlocutory stage, and is yet to be tried, and it cannot be foreseen as to whether the defendants who seek rectification of the plaintiffs mark, on account of non-statutory registration establishes prima facie case in favor of the plaintiffs.\n",
        "p_30": "22.The last judgment referred to by learned counsel for the plaintiff was of the Division Bench of this Court in Century Traders v. Roshan Lal Duggar and Co. and Ors.  where the principles in respect of passing off were set out in par 14 as under:\n",
        "p_31": " 14. Thus, the law is pretty well settled that in order to succeed at this stage the applicant had to establish user of the aforesaid mark prior in point of time than the impugned user by the respondents. The registration of the said mark or similar mark prior in point of time to user by the appellant is irrelevant in an action for passing off and the mere presence of the mark in the register maintained by the trade mark registry did not prove its user by the persons in whose names the mark was registered and was irrelevant for the purposes of deciding the application for interim injunction unless evidence had been led or was available of user of the registered trade marks. In our opinion, these clear rules of law were not kept in view by the learned single Judge and led him to commit an error.\n",
        "p_32": "A reading of the aforesaid judgment shows that in action of passing off, prior use of the mark in point of time is the relevant test.\n",
        "p_33": "23. The plaintiff in the aforesaid behalf has placed various documents on record to show sales under both the marks. There have been advertisements published also under both the marks. I am unable to accept the plea of learned counsel for the defendants that even if the plaintiff had sales under ROCHAK prior to 1986, the same were abandoned post-1986. There is no material on record at this stage to substantiate this plea. The mere fact that the plaintiff wanted registration of the mark ROCHAKA, which was opposed and subsequently ROCHAK was accepted for registration, would not be very material in this behalf. Interestingly, the defendants have placed no material on record showing that they have sales or they have prior adoption of the mark. The only material placed is of registration of the mark stated to be carried out in Nepal for AM PACHAN. It has to be kept in mind that the stage of the present suit is pre- trial and the adjudication has to be based on a prima facie view of the matter. As to what is the impact of the registration of mark, if it has actually been done in Nepal, would have to be considered at the stage of trial. That does not in any manner advance the case of the defendants of any prior user. The only plea in this behalf is that even prior to the plaintiff, some persons were using this mark in Nepal. In fact, the only other document filed by the defendants is the Order of the Registrar of Trademarks dated 10.12.2001 dealing with the issue of registration of ROCHAKA and ROCHAK. The defendants do not even dispute the fact that the plaintiff did carry out sales under the trademark ROCHAK from the year 1982 onwards till at least 1986. This admission is possibly on account of the fact that counsel for the defendants himself was representing the plaintiff up to that date and had issued the legal notice in this behalf. Thus, a unique plea was sought to be advanced that post-1986, ROCHAK was given up in favor of ROCHAKA because the plaintiff applied for registration of the mark ROCHAKA.\n",
        "p_34": "24. Learned counsel for the defendants referred to the judgment of learned Single Judge of this Court in Glaxo Operations YK Ltd., Middlesex (England) and Ors. v. Samrat Pharmaceuticals Kanpur AIR 1984 SC 265 in respect of the registration of the artistic work under the Copyright Act. It was observed in paras 21 and 22 as under:\n",
        "p_35": "21. The aforesaid defense raises a question as to what rights are conferred on account of registration of copy rights and what exactly the nature of copyright is. The relevant provisions regarding the registration of copyrights are Sections 44 and 45 of the Copyright Act. Section 44 says that there shall be kept at the copyright Office register in the prescribed form to be called register of copyright. Section 45 reads as under:\n",
        "p_36": "45(1) The author or publisher of, or the owner of or other person interested in the copyright in any work may make an application in the prescribed form accompanied by the prescribed fee to the Registrar of the Copyrights for entering particulars of the work in the Register of Copyrights.\n",
        "p_37": "(2) On receipt of an application in respect of any work under sub section (1), the Registrar of Copyrights may, after holding such inquiry as he may deem fit, enter the particulars of the work in the Register of Copyrights.\n",
        "p_38": "It is apparent from a plain reading of Section 45 that it is discretionary with any author of any work to apply for the registration of copyrights and that registration as such does not confer any rights. There is no other provision at all in the Copyright Act which confers rights on account of registration of copy right. Therefore, copyrights exist whether the registration is done or not an the registration is merely apiece of evidence as to when a certain author started claiming copyrights in some artistic or some other work.\n",
        "p_39": "22. When the registration does not confer any rights it is to be seen as to how copyrights in favor of a person come into existence. Section 13 of the Copyright Act gives a clue as to how a copyright is acquired. It say that copyright shall subsist throughout India, inter alia, in case of original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works. Therefore, emphasis is on the originality. It is, therefore, that artistic work which is original in which copyrights can vest. According to Section 17 of the author of the work shall be the owner of the copyright therein. The work 'author' is defined as under in Section 2(d) of the Copyright Act:\n",
        "p_40": "2. Interpretation - In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires -\n",
        "p_41": "a) author means\n  \n\n",
        "p_42": "i) in relation to a literary or dramatic work, the authority of the work;\n",
        "p_43": "ii) in relation to a musical work, the composer;\n",
        "p_44": "iii) in relation to an artistic work other than a photograph, the artist;\n",
        "p_45": "iv) in relation to a photograph, the person taking the photograph\n \n\n",
        "p_46": "v) in relation to a cinematograph film, the owner of the original plate from which the record is made, at the time of the making of the plate.\n",
        "p_47": "vi) in relation to a record, the owner of the original plate from which the record is made, at the time of the making of the plate.\n",
        "p_48": "That definition of the work author and Section 17 lay emphasis on the fact that copyrights vest in that person who is original creator of the work. In some cases it may not be possible to be definite as to who was the original creator. In such cases, therefore, obviously the person who got registration earlier or who is established to be earlier user can be presumed to be the author or original creator of the artistic work.\n",
        "p_49": "25. The aforesaid observations, in my considered view, are not of much assistance to the defendants as they only advance the proposition that even in the absence of registration, the copyright can be claimed in some artistic work, the emphasis would be on originality. Not only this, in the same judgment, it was observed in paras 15 and 16 as under:\n",
        "p_50": "15. At pages 41 to 43 of the documents file is the photostat copy of the registration of copyright of the product of the plaintiff known as Glazose-D. At pages 44 to 46 is the photostat copy of registration of copyright of Glucon-D of the plaintiff. A copy of the carton forms part of the aforesaid certificate. I have already compared the carton of Glucon-D of the plaintiff with the carton of Glucose-D of the defendant and found that latter deceptively similar. It is, therefore, obvious that there is infringement of the trade marks and copyrights of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_51": "16. Further, it also appears that the defendant is guilty of passing off his goods as those of the plaintiff by way of using deceptively similar cartons and trade marks. Learned counsel for the defendant in this connection relied upon judgment of this Court in Khemraj Shrikrishnadass v. Garg and Co. . It was held that action for passing off was a common law remedy, that its gist was deceit and not infringement of a right to exclusive user and that in such an action, it was essential for the plaintiff to establish (1) distinctive features, (2) substantial user and (3) wide reputation. Counsel contended that in this case the third condition of wide reputation did not stand proved, that although the plaintiff had placed on record a statement of sales worth crores of rupees of their product from the years 1972 to 1982 yet the said statement was not supported by an affidavit and that, therefore, it cannot be said that their products were so well reputed as to command wide and exclusive sale. I do not, however, agree with the learned counsel. Prima facie all the conditions mentioned in the aforesaid authority stand established. It is true that affidavit has not been attached with the statement on sales and the statement of expenditure on advertisement but it was stated at the bar that if the Court permitted an affidavit could be filed. Learned counsel for the defendant did point out the defect of absence of affidavit but at the same time he could not dispute correctness of the said statements at the bar. Therefore, prima facie they give correct indication. The other condition obviously stands satisfied. The products of the plaintiff are put in cartons with distinctive features, as already mentioned. The user has been substantial for number of years while the user of the defendant, even a according to the case of the defendant, is later in time because according to the plaintiff their user started in 1979.\n",
        "p_52": "26. The aforesaid shows that when the packagings were compared, they were found to be deceptively similar and a case of passing off was found to be made of. A similar position is in the present case coupled with the factor of the plaintiff establishing sales from 1982 onwards in respect of ROCHAK and from 1985 onwards under AM PACHAN. The defendants have not even filed any material on record to show the period from which they began their sales under the offending packaging and the mark.\n",
        "p_53": "27. Learned counsel for the defendants also referred to the judgment of learned Single Judge of this Court in K.B. Hiralal and Sons v. Kumar Industries and Anr. 1985 Arb. LR 265. The dispute related to the mark JULIE which was held not to be novel or originating from the plaintiff as the entire matter was copied from a still photograph of a film JULIE released in the year 1975. In the said judgment, it has been observed in paras 7, 9 and 10 as under:\n",
        "p_54": "7. The defendant have oppose this application for the grant of interim injunction in their joint reply (IA NO 2019/78). they have stated that the plaintiff has not acquired any legal right to the tin containers as alleged. It is stated that the work 'JULIE' has been derived from Hindi Feature Film produced by M/s. Vijaya Productions (P) Limited, and the get up, colour scheme, arrangement of the words, letters and photos of the character, 'JULIE' have been derived from the still photograph of the sequence from the said feature film. It is further stated that the representation of the character 'JULIE' as shown on the defendants' tin containers appears on the paper jacket produced and widely distributed by M/s Polydor of India Limited under the series NO 2253-006 as adopted from the sequence of the film production. It is thus contended that the plaintiff has deliberately refrained from disclosing the material particulars which were well within its knowledge. It is submitted that by doing so, the plaintiff has made a false and misleading claim as to the proprietory right to the representation pertaining to the tin containers. It is thus submitted that the plaintiff has knowingly made a false and misleading statement in relation to the material particulars and, therefore, the interim injunction granted be vacated and application be dismissed.\n",
        "p_55": "9. The geometrical boxes manufactured by both the parties have the same colour scheme and contained the name 'JULIE' the learned counsel for the defendants has pointed out that the picture 'JULIE' was released in 1975 and according to the plaintiff itself, it had placed an order for the supply of tin containers on 20th December, 1975. The same is evident from the photostat copy of a duplicate bill produced by the plaintiff. The learned counsel for the defendant has thus submitted that the plaintiff has falsely stated in the plaint and also in the application under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 that the gometrical boxes in question having the distinctive tin containers entitled 'JULE' were manufactured and sold from the year 1972. So much so, it is stated by the plaintiff that this firm alone had originated the get-up, colour scheme, arrangement of words, letters and photos of the distinctive tins. It is also stated that this trade 'JULIE' has acquired vide reputation from the year 1972.\n",
        "p_56": "10. This all seems obviously incorrect because the picture was released in 1975 and the order for the manufacture of the containers was placed by the plaintiff on 20th December, 1975. The record cover of 'JULIE' film has been produced by the defendants. The photograph has been clearly taken from the film. Even the name 'JULIE' as it appears on the record cover has been copies out by both the parties. There is absolutely no originality on the part of the plaintiff. Clearly the plaintiff has made an incorrect statement by saying that it has been using such geometrical boxes from 1972. There users could only be some time after December, 1975. In my view this false representation on the part of the plaintiff is sufficient to disentitled it from the discretion being used in its favor. Intaking such a view I am fully supported by a Division Bench decision of this court resorted as Prinal Chemical Works and Ors. v. Sukhdayal and Ors. The relevant portion at page 562 reads as under:\n",
        "p_57": "It is well established that he who comes into equity must come with clean hands. This applies strongly to parties seeking relief against the infringement of trade mark or in passing off action and against unfair competition. One seeking relief against the fraud of others must be free from fraud. An exclusive privilege for deceiving the public is assuredly one act that a Court of Equity can be required to section (3). Accordingly it is essential that the plaintiff should not be in his trade mark or in his advertisement and business himself guilty of any false or misleading misrepresentation; that if the plaintiff makes any material false statement in connection with the property, which he seeks to protect he loses his right to the assistance of a Court of Equity; Thus, where by a sample or lable claimed as a trade mark is so constructed or worded as to make or contain a distinct assertion which is false, no property can be claimed on it, or in other words the right to the exclusive use of it cannot be maintained.\n",
        "p_58": "28. The facts of that case would have no material bearing in the given facts of the present case. It cannot be established at this stage that user of the word 'AM PACHAN' alleged to be in practice in Nepal has any material bearing in the present case. The registration itself is yet to be proved since it is not within the country. There is no question of any equities arising in favor of the defendants as the plaintiff, prima facie, has not concealed any material fact. The factum of any proceedings initiated in respect of the trademark ROCHAKA and the resultant registration of ROCHAK in view of the objections raised thereto would not affect the present case apart from the fact that the same relates to a third-party and the present case is also one of passing off.\n",
        "p_59": "29. The last judgment referred to by learned counsel for the defendants is of learned Single Judge of this Court in Anand Kumar Deepak Kumar and Anr. v. Haldiram Bhujia Wala and Anr. 1999 PTC (19) 466 to advance the proposition that where a registration of the mark is by concealment of material facts, a fraud would vitiate all transactions including registration and the plaintiff was entitled to interim injunction against the registered mark. As explained above, I fail to find any case of fraud by the plaintiff whereby the plaintiff should be dis-entitled to interim relief in the present case.\n",
        "p_60": "30. In view of the aforesaid position, I am of the considered view that the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case for the right to use the trademark ROCHAK and AM PACHAN and for a restraint order against the defendants from using pouches as per Annexures - Y and Z as also the consequent enlarged pouches. The continued sale by the defendants would result in not only a financial loss to the plaintiff, but the reputation of the plaintiff itself can be affected by the nature and quality of the product of the defendants. The defendants have not made out any case of prior user or sale, while the plaintiff has made out a case of continued prior use and sale leading to a reputation in the market. The balance of convenience is consequently in favor of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_61": "31. The interim orders were granted on 26.09.2005 directing that the defendants are restrained from manufacturing, exporting, selling, offering for sale, advertising, exhibiting Ayurvedic Medicinal Products such as churan and tablets used for digestive purposes under the trade mark - ROCHAK and AM PACHAN - or any other identical or deceptively similar mark to the plaintiff's mark ROCHAK and AM PACHAN and from infringing copyright of the plaintiff in the artistic work of ROCHAK and AM PACHAN in pouches Annexures - A and B by the pouches of the defendants given as Annexures - Y and Z to the plaint. The said interim orders are, thus, liable to be made absolute during the pendeny of the suit. Ordered accordingly.\n",
        "p_62": "32. Needless to say that any views expressed for disposal of these applications would not in any manner affect the final adjudication of the suit.\n",
        "p_63": "33. IA No. 7656/2005 is consequently allowed, while IA No. 10095/2005 is dismissed.\n",

        "p_1": "JUDGMENT  \n\nB.N. Kirpal, J.   \n",
        "p_2": "(1) The plaintiff has filed a suit alleging that its registered trade mark \"CALMPOSE\" has been infringed by the defendant, who is manufacturing similar medicine and marketing under the mark of \"CALMPROSE\". The prayer in the suit is for a perpetual injunction and for a decree for rendition of accounts.   \n",
        "p_3": "(2) Along with the plaint the plaintiff has also filed an application under Order 39, Rules 1 & 2 Civil Procedure Code and has prayed for an ad interim injunction. It is averred that the plaintiff has had the trade mark registered since 6th March 1970 and has sold \"CALMPOSE\" worth about Rs. 40.16 crores since its adoption and has spent about Rs. 16.43 lakhs on sales promotion from January to August, 1987. The said medicine are Diazepam tablets of 5 mg each. It is also contended that not only is the mark of the defendant phonetically and visually similar, but even the packing of the defendant of the said medicine is similar to that of the plaintiff. The plaintiff is using two colours, namely, silver and brown and the packing is done in aluminium foil on one side and polythene film on the other ; and the packing of the defendant is similar to that of the plaintiff.   \n",
        "p_4": "(3) Ad interim ex parte injunction was issued. In the reply which has been filed, it is contended that the medicine in question is sold by chemists on the prescription of a medical practitioner and. therefore, the persons cannot be deceived by the said mark. It is further contended that the words used on the strips containing the medicine are different and the word \"CALMPROSE\" is phonetically different from the plaintiff's mark \"CALMPOSE\".   \n",
        "p_5": "(4) Shri Bharat Inder Singh, learned counsel for the defendant has raised two contentions before me. He has firstly submitted that the two marks are phonetically different. In this connection, he relies upon a Division Bench authority reported as Stadmed Private Ltd. vs. Hind Chemicals (AIR 1965 Punjab 17). In this case the two words involved were \"ENTOZINE\" and \"ENTROZYME\". The High Court came to the conclusion that the said words were phonetically different. In my opinion, the tw6 words in the present case, namely, \"CALMPOSE\" and \"CALMPROSE\" are phonetically and even visually similar. What the defendant has done is to insert the letter \"R\" in the middle of the word and converted \"CALMPOSE\" to \"CALMPROSE\". The intention of the defendant clearly is to cash in on the reputation which has been built up by the plaintiff over the years in the sale of its medicine \"CALMPOSE\", the turnover of which is stated to be over Rs. 40 crores. It is certainly not by accident that the defendant has coined or hit upon the word \"CALMPROSE\". It is, to my mind, a deliberate attempt to adopt another person's trade mark to one's advantage.   \n",
        "p_6": "(5) The decision of the Punjab High Court in Stadmed's case (supra) cannot be of any assistance to the defendant in the present case. The spellings of the two words \"ENTOZINE\" and 'ENTROZYME\" are different because the word 'ENTROZYME\" contained there letters R, Y & M which are not present in the word \"ENTOZINE\". It is true that the Court in that case felt that the two words were not phonetically similar, but in this regard reference may also be made to the following observations of another Division Bench of the Punjab High Court in the case of Anglo-French Drug. Co. (Eastern) Ltd. vs. Belco Pharma  where with reference to the decision in Stadmed's case (supra) the High Court observed as follows:    \"WE are not called upon to decide whether 'ENTROZYME' and 'ENTOZINE' are phonetically and visually similar, but if we had a case like this before us, we might have taken the view that the two names are visually and phonetically similar.\"  \n",
        "p_7": "I also tend to agree with the observations of Punjab High Court in Angio French's case. In any case. I have no doubt in my mind that the two words \"CALMPOSE\" and \" CALMPROSE\" are phonetically similar.   \n",
        "p_8": "(6) It was then contended by the learned counsel for the defendant that the said medicines can only be sold on the doctor's prescription and, therefore, there can be little likelihood of confusion. It is true that the said drugs are supposed to be sold on doctor's prescription, but it is not unknown that the same are also available across the counters in the shops of various chemists. It is also not unknown that the chemists who may not have \"CALMPOSE\" may pass off the medicine \"CALMPROSE\" to an unwary purchaser as the medicine prepared by the plaintiff. The test to be adopted is not the knowledge of the doctor, who is giving the prescription. The test to be adopted is whether the unwary customer, who goes to purchase the medicine can make a mistake.   \n",
        "p_9": "(7) I have also been shown the strips containing the medicines manufactured by the parties. It is clear that the dimension of the strip of the defendant is practically the same as the one made by the plaintiff ; the type of packaging is identical ; the colour scheme is similar and even the manner of writing is not very different. This is a clear case of an attempt by the defendant to pass off its product as that of the plaintiff.   \n",
        "p_10": "(8) For the aforesaid reasons, the interim injunction issued on 30th November, 1987 is made absolute pending disposal of the main suit. I.A. stands disposed of.  \n"

        "author": "J Kapoor",
        "p_1": "JUDGMENT\n \n\nJ.D. Kapoor, J.\n",
        "p_2": "1. Through this application under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC the plaintiff seeks ad interim injunction against the use of trade dress and colour combination of one third red and two third white, in that order, on the container of its product viz. Tooth Powder as by adopting the similar trade-dress particularly the colour combination of \"red and white\"the defendant has committed offence of \"passing off\" goods of plaintiff as its own. There is no dispute as to the trade names as these are distinct and have no kind of similarity whatsoever. Plaintiff's trade name is \"Colgate\" and that of defendant is \"Anchor\". Relevant facts need to be capitulated in brief. \n",
        "p_3": "2. Plaintiff No. 1 is a company incorporated under the laws of United States of America having its principal office at Newyork. Plaintiff No. 2 is a public limited company having its registered office at Mumbai. Plaintiff No. 1 is the proprietor of the trademark \"Colgate\" whereas plaintiff No. 2 is the registered or licensed user and has been manufacturing and marketing dental products in India under the trademark \"Colgate\".\n",
        "p_4": "3. The defendant, Anchor Health, is a company incorporated under the Indian companies Act, 1956 and carries on the business as manufacturers and marketeers of dental products under the trademark \"Anchor\". The defendant is in the said business since 1996. The plaintiffs have been chasing the defendant since then as according to them the defendants have been trespassing the plaintiff's intellectual property right and have filed as many as three suits against the defendants pertaining to different products. \n",
        "p_5": "4. The product which is subject matter of the instant proceedings is a \"Tooth Powder\" under the trademark \"Colgate\" sold in Cans bearing the distinctive get up and colour scheme or combination of colour comprising pre-dominantly of red and white background. They have been selling this product in India since 1951. Distinct feature of this combination is that around 1/3rd of the background of the upper part of the Can Along with cap is in red colour and 2/3rd is in white colour and in that order. The trademark 'Colgate' appears in white against red. \n",
        "p_6": "5. Some time in August, 2002 the plaintiffs improved the get up by introducing swoir and a yellow representation in the red coloured portion of the Can. It is claimed that it is because of the distinctive shape of the container and the red and white colour scheme and the overall get up that has helped the plaintiffs in attaining immense reputation and goodwill verging on acquisition of a secondary significance as indicative of the trade of the plaintiff's dental products. It is further claimed that it has become so familiar with the customers at large that they identify the article with the plaintiffs merely by the get up and the red and white colour scheme and for the purpose of the instant product i.e the 'tooth powder' from the shape of the container also.\n",
        "p_7": "6. In order to demonstrate the dishonest intention of the defendants in appropriating or adopting prominently similar trade dress in terms of layout, get up and colour combination with obvious intention to encash upon the reputation and goodwill of the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs have referred to the past history of the defendants in keeping track of the plaintiffs products in the market by way of illustrative instances of comparative charts of various products having substantial reproduction of the colour combination of the colour red and white not only in respect of packaging but also otherwise. It all began some time in the year 1996 and the first action taken by the plaintiffs in this regard was in a suit filed in 1996 before the Bombay High Court. However the plaintiff did not succeed in getting ad interim injunction from adopting the same colour scheme and layout mainly for the reason that the trademarks used by the parties were not the same. This action arose from the cartons of dental cream. Though the Appeal against the said order of learned Single Judge of the Bombay High Court has been admitted and pending disposal but no interim relief has been granted. \n",
        "p_8": "7. The second suit was instituted against the defendants in Delhi High Court in relation to the copying of the line drawings, layout drawings and artistic work comprising the red and white colour scheme adopted by the defendants in relation to the plaintiffs tooth brush hanger display tray. The instant action is third in the row.\n",
        "p_9": "8. The plaintiffs seek ad interim protection to the limited extent of restraining the defendants from using the red and white colour scheme as well as the shape of the container of the tooth powder as according to the plaintiffs they have originated, developed, promoted, protected and also nurtured the distinctive red and white trade dress for all these products which has acquired the meaning as a trademark and, therefore, has earned exclusive ownership of the said trade dress because of its distinctiveness as well as use over a long period of time across wide geographical area. \n",
        "p_10": "9. The comparative charts of various products of the plaintiffs and that of the defendants as well as of few others in the trade like Pepsodent and Dabur have also been placed for the purpose of comparative study as none of the other rivals in the trade has adopted the same colour scheme, combination or get up and the shape of the container and, therefore, the act of the defendants is against the norms of fair and accepted trade practices which act will inevitably lead to dilution and erosion of the uniqueness and distinctiveness of the trade dress of the plaintiff's goods. Statement has also been filed to show the rise in the sale of the products of the defendants after the colour combination, the trade dress as well as the shape of the container was copied by the defendants in selling the same goods. Thus according to the plaintiffs this amounts to infringement of trade mark and passing off its products. It is pertinent to mention here that the colour scheme red and white has been registered in respect of tooth paste.\n",
        "p_11": "10. The defendants have resisted the ad interim injunction mainly and briefly on the following premises:-\n",
        "p_12": "(i) That the shape of the container cannot be monopolized by the plaintiff unless and until it is registered under the Designs Act.\n",
        "p_13": "(ii) That the shape of packaging or any combination thereof do not fall within the ambit of mark or trademark as envisaged in the TMM Act, 1958.\n",
        "p_14": "(iii) That the use of red and white colour combination is neither distinctive nor capable of identifying the goods with the plaintiff nor business of the plaintiff nor capable of secondary significance.\n",
        "p_15": "(iv) That the plaintiffs have abandoned the colour combination of red and white and have used various other colour combinations in respect of different ranges of products and, therefore, the claim of the distinctiveness or uniqueness of the colour combination is unfounded.\n",
        "p_16": "(v) That the essential features of the label marks is the word mark and not the colour combination or overall get up and since the two trade marks are entirely different the plaintiffs cannot seek protection under the garb of colour combination of the label.\n",
        "p_17": "(vi) That the colour combination red and white in respect of dental care products is descriptive in nature and has a direct reference to the character or quality of the goods, gum and teeth. This combination is common to the trade and is being used by large number of manufactureRs. \n",
        "p_18": "(vii) That the plaintiff No. 2 is falsely claiming to be the registered user or a licensed user of the marks of plaintiff No. 1 in India and the plaintiff No. 2 has no right to use the said marks or to restrain otheRs. \n",
        "p_19": "(viii) That the use of trademark \"Colgate\" by plaintiff No. 2 in India is itself illegal and fraudulent and is in violation of bye-laws.\n",
        "p_20": "(ix) The claim of the plaintiff with regard to the colour combination and get up of the label being original artistic work or to the ownership thereof is absolutely false as the plaintiffs claim the ownership of the copyright on the basis of certain averments and in the present suit they have taken a different stand inasmuch as that they have not pleaded the basic requisites for the subsistence of the copy right or for acquiring ownership therein.\n",
        "p_21": "(x) That similar pleas were raised by the plaintiff in the earlier suits, one filed in Mumbai High Court and another in this court and claimed that colour combination of red and while is distinctive qua the plaintiff and the use of red and white colour combination by the defendant constitutes an act of passing off. The said plea of the plaintiff has been rejected by the Mumbai High Court as well as in Appeal by the Division Bench of Mumbai High Court and the court has specifically held that because of difference between the trademarks COLGAGE and ANCHOR of respective parties, there is no likelihood of confusion and deception.\n",
        "p_22": "(xi) The plaintiffs are not entitled to any order of interim injunction because of delay, laches and acquiescence inasmuch as notice was served upon the defendants in July, 1998 and the action was brought in 2003.\n",
        "p_23": "(xii) Plaintiffs have suppressed and concealed the material documents and facts from this court as have been detailed in para 9 of reply namely:-\n",
        "p_24": "(a) They are using various colour combinations in respect of their products and not Red and White alone;\n",
        "p_25": "(b) Plaintiff is the registered user which is a false claim.\n",
        "p_26": "(c.) Plaintiffs have falsely claimed colour combination of Red and White as an essential feature of their label mark. The essential feature is the word `COLGATE' which has been admitted in the rejoinder by the plaintiff.  \n",
        "p_27": "11. The main gravamen of contention of Mr. R.K.Anand, learned senior counsel for the defendant is that in order to avail protection by way of ad interim injunction the plaintiff has to prima facie establish the following ingredients:-\n",
        "p_28": "(a) That he has been in prior, long and continuous use of the mark.\n",
        "p_29": "(b) That the defendant has entered the market much later than him.\n",
        "p_30": "(c) That there has been no delay in filing of the suit for grant of the ex parte injunction.\n",
        "p_31": "(d) That the trademark of the plaintiff has become so distinctive and identical with the goods of the plaintiff that it has imprinted upon the minds of the public at large that the goods belong to the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_32": "(e) That there is an element of dishonesty on the part of the defendant to pass off his goods as that of the plaintiff on the premise of deceptive similarities. \n",
        "p_33": "12. In support of aforesaid principles Mr. Anand has relied upon the following judgments:-\n",
        "p_34": "(i) A.V. Rajadurai Nadar v. Ayya Nadar and another  wherein it was held that the expression 'deceptively similar' as defined in S.2(d) means that the similarity or resemblance must be such as it would be likely to deceive or cause confusion. Any conclusion reasonable and proper can be arrived at by a meticulous examination of each detail and then making a comparison. At the same time what mainly strikes the eye must also be conducive. But, when one looks at it, especially from the standpoint of a person who is most likely to use a particular brand of matches, if it appears that the distinction is prominent and it cannot lead to any similarity or a deceptive similarity or confusion then there could be no objection to the two different trade marks.\n",
        "p_35": "(ii) J. and P. Coats Ltd. v. Chadha & Company(India) PTC Supp(1) 295 Del(DB), where colour of rival boxes was similar, the following view was taken:-\n",
        "p_36": " \"Marks, it must never be forgotten, are remembered rather by general impression or by some significant details than by any photographic recollection of the whole. Keeping in view the main idea, the essential feature or the leading characteristic represented by each one of the two rival marks, we feel that those who use the thread may well be expected to distinguish between the two figures of 'dog' and \"anchor\" and if they happen to be literate, they can easily distinguish one from the other. It is no doubt true that the colour of the boxes is very much similar, but then that is not conclusive nor is that the domination or the leading characteristic.\" \n",
        "p_37": "13. It was further contended by Mr. Anand that even if the colour combination is same on the packing or the container the offence of passing off is not made out once there is an added material showing permanently the source and in the instant case the added material when taken into account would show that on the label of the goods of the defendant there is sufficient indication as to the manufacture of the source or origin of the material besides many other qualities of the goods of the defendant and on account of other ingredients of added material the sting of passing off on account of colour combination vanishes.\n",
        "p_38": "14. The packaging of large number of manufacturers of tooth paste and tooth brush has been produced on the record by the defendant. All these packagings are on the red colour background with the trade name written in white colour having little stripes of blue and yellow colour printed thereon. In order to show that the plaintiff has no monopoly over the colour red or white, Mr. Anand has produced few packagings of Colgate tooth paste with different colours having the base of red colour interspersed with blue or yellow colour and, therefore, to say the colour combination of red and white is its exclusive right is to bely its own claim.\n",
        "p_39": "15. While canvassing the aforesaid proposition of law, Mr. Anand has placed reliance upon a decision of Division Bench of this Court in Kellogg Company v. Pravin Kumar Bhadabhai 1996 PTC (16). In this case the appellant was selling Corn Flakes with carton which described the cartons as Kellogg's CORN FLAKES(the original and the best). The respondent was also selling corn flakes using a carton more or less similar in size but with the title \"AIMS ARISTO CORN FLAKES\" written just at the place where appellant displayed the words 'Kellogg's CORN FLAKES. The grievance of the appellant was that carton of the respondent was having substantial deceptive similarities and that these goods are bound to cause confusion amongst the customeRs. Some of the similarities pointed out by the appellant as well as dis-similarities pointed out by the court were as under:-\n",
        "p_40": "(i)That the size and shape of the carton was similar being rectangular.\n",
        "p_41": "(ii)In the word 'FLAKES' in the appellan's carton the letters L and A were joined together closely or rather touch each other.\n",
        "p_42": "(iii)That both contain a picture of the corn flakes and that there was a small square on the left hand top where the words \"Kellogg's CORN FLAKES' were written inside the square and that the respondent had also put a square on the left hand top with the words \"AIMS ARISTO CORN FLAKES'.\n",
        "p_43": "(iv)There was a red band at the top which took off from the square on the left top and ran horizontally across on the front top into the right and to the other sides and respondent also used a similar red band taking off horizontally from the square on the left top.\n",
        "p_44": "(v)That even in regard to the square on the left side top, Kellogg's used an inner red border then a white gap and then an outer green border running all along the sides of the square while respondent was also using the same red and green borders for the square on the left top. \n",
        "p_45": "Dissimilarities observed by the court were:-\n",
        "p_46": "i)The word Kellogg's is displayed very prominently in fairly big letters above the words 'CORN FLAKES' in the square on the left hand top and then to the right of the words `Kellogg's CORNFLAKES there is the picture of the face of a hen, up to its neck.\n",
        "p_47": "ii) There is a bowl containing corn flakes and a cherry therein with a big spoon. Pouring of milk is shown into the plate. On the right side of the carton, it is stated prominently that the flakes are 99% fat free whereas in the respondent's carton in the left hand top rectangle the words `AIMS ARISTO' corn flakes prominently written. There is an ISI in a smaller rectangular bricket but shown quite prominently below the rectangle on the left top, a plate blue in colour with corn flakes and cashew etc. There is no picture of milk pouring into the plate. In other words while in the rectangle on the left hand top the words Kellog's corn flakes are prominent for the appellant, the words `AIMS ARISTO' corn flakes appear very prominently for the respondent at the same place. \n",
        "p_48": "The view taken by the court was as under:-\n",
        "p_49": " \"It is true that the appellant has referred to certain similarities in the size and shape of the carton, there being a square on the left top with word 'KELLOGG'S CORNFLAKE's, the words L&A being joined, border being red and green and a red band running round in the top horizontally. It is true that these similarities were not set out in the order. But in our prima facie view, the prominent display of the words 'Kellogg's' in bold red letters in white background inside the square on the left-top appellant's carton cannot go unnoticed by any buyer. We have to understand the learned Judge's words \"trade dress of the plaintiff is entirely different', in that light, prima facie.\n",
        "p_50": "The law relating to 'trade dress' is very clear. Kerly in 'Law of Trade Marks' (12th Ed, 1986, para 16.67) says that it is usually true in some degree that a trader's goods are recognised by their general appearance, or \"get-up\". Accordingly, resemblance or 'get-up' is not uncommonly an ingredient in passing off. Such cases are rare, since few traders rely on get-up alone to distinguish their goods, so that trade names and word trade marks are ordinarily present too\" and the author says:\n",
        "p_51": " \"and in these days, in this country, a difference in names is enough to warn the public that they are getting one trader's goods and not the others\"(Sapers v. Specters(1953) 70 RPC 173).\" \n",
        "p_52": "16. Mr. Anand also tried to draw support from Kuber Khaini Pvt. Ltd. v. Prabhoolal Ramratan Das Pvt. Ltd and another 2002 (24) PTC 135(Cal) wherein the product manufactured by both the parties were purchased by ordinary class of people mostly illiterate. The petitioner's case was that the petitioner has a distinctive design, colour scheme and get up which is an artistic work under the meaning of Copyright Act 1957 and his design was duly registered. Its grievance was that respondent No. 2 was distributing khaini and gutkhas of various manufacturers all in pouches and/or sachets having design, get up, colour scheme and dimension similar to the petitioner's distinctive pouch design. However, the trade name of the petitioner was KUBER whereas trade name adopted by the respondent was CHAKOR. It was averred that the purchaser would not be able to read the name \"CHAKOR\" in the pouch and will be guided by the get up of the same. The adoption and use of packaging design apart from the passing off and infringement of the trade mark is also an intention of the respondents and trading upon the reputation of the petitioner's kuber khaini. The emphasis was laid on the difference and dis-simalirities in respect of the mark used by the respondent. It was submitted that there is no question of being deceived inasmuch as the photograph on the pouch is different. The other dissimilarity is the name. It was held that except the colour combination the name and the get-up are different altogether and further that there are dissimilarities appearing on the face of those pouches/wrappers and, therefore, there is no scope for purchaser being misled. If a purchaser wants to purchase his goods, he must know the goods he is purchasing. The different name is a piece of evidence that the buyer will go by the name as well and therefore, there is no question of being deceived.\n",
        "p_53": "17. Another judgment relied upon by Mr. Anand is M/s. Amrit Banaspati Co. Ltd v. M/s Suraj Industries Ltd 1996 PTC (16) wherein following view was taken:-\n",
        "p_54": " \"Normally in an action for passing off the relief of injunction is not to be granted at the interim stage because still there has to be a trial but again in exceptional cases such an interim relief can definitely be made available to the aggrieved party in case prima facie it is established on record that the two products are so similar in appearance that there was absolutely no way of avoiding the grant of interim injunction.\"\n",
        "p_55": "18. It is contended by Mr. Anand that if the trade name of the product is prominently mentioned on the container and the trade name happens to be altogether different, the colour combination, get up, colour scheme have no relevance and similarities in the colour combination and get up are no ground for injunction as difference in the trade name is sufficient to distinguish the goods of the plaintiff from those of the defendants.\n",
        "p_56": "19. On other ancillary points, Mr. Anand has also argued at great length. Attempt needs to be made to precise them. At first instance, Mr. Anand has relied heavily upon the judgment of Bombay High Court. Relevant extracts need to be reproduced. These are:-\n",
        "p_57": " \"Leave under Rules 147 and 148 of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay(Original Side) Rules, 1980 granted to the plaintiffs to take out notice of motion in terms of the draft notice of motion handed in. Notice of motion is made returnable on 23rd December, 1996. Mr. Dwarkadas waives service for the defendants.\n",
        "p_58": "I have heard the learned counsel for the parties at considerable length and having compared the two marks on the two sets of cartons. One of the plaintiffs and the other of the defendants, I do not think any case for ad-interim relief is made out. Ordered accordingly.\" \n",
        "p_59": "20. Aforesaid order was passed when ex parte ad interim injunction was sought. However the application for interim injunction was decided on merits with the following observations:-\n",
        "p_60": " \"The plaintiffs filed a suit for infringement of trade mark. By the instant Notice of Motion, plaintiffs is seeking injunction against the defendants from using label mark. Learned counsel for the plaintiffs urged that the colour scheme(colour combination) red and white, is a part of registered trade mark. The defendants for their product of dental cream using the similar colour combination to mis-guide the customers and thus it has caused prejudice to the marketing of the Colgate dental cream.\n",
        "p_61": "With the assistance of the learned counsel, I perused both the label marks. No doubt, the colour combination, to some extent, is identical. However, the defendant has prominently exposed the brand name \"Anchor\" on the label mark. As a result, according to me, even for a ordinary customer, though the colour combination is similar, could not get idea that they are otherwise purchasing Anchor in place of Colgate. The trade mark being so prominent, as pointed out, has a definite distinctive mark of the consumer product. As such, I do not find a fit case for grant of injunction in favor of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_62": "With this direction Notice of Motion is disposed of.\" \n",
        "p_63": "21. According to Mr. Anand, the judgment of the Bombay High Court is binding upon both the parties for following reasons:-\n",
        "p_64": "i)That the ground for seeking injunction propounded by the plaintiff in respect of label mark as well as container of tooth paste is under the trade name of COLGATE.\n",
        "p_65": "ii)The plea of the plaintiff was that colour combination or colour scheme of red and white is the part of registered trademark and the defendants by using the same colour combination in respect of dental cream is with an intention to misguide the customeRs. \n",
        "p_66": "iii)That the court though observed that the colour combination to some extent is identical yet found that the brand name ANCHOR on the label mark was so prominent than the brand name COLGATE that even an ordinary customer could get an idea in respect of similarity of colour combination that they are otherwise purchasing ANCHOR in place of COLGATE. \n",
        "p_67": "22. Mr. Anand contends that the trademark being prominently distinctive does not entitle the plaintiff to injunction merely on the ground of similarity of colour combination on the label.\n",
        "p_68": "23. Mr. Anand has relied upon Arjun Singh v. Mohindra Kumar and others  in support of his contention that once the decision has been given on the question of interim injunction in a suit between the same parties and in respect of same pleas which the plaintiff might have raised in the subsequent suits the principle of res judicata is invoked. On the concept of res judicata the Supreme Court made the following observations:-\n",
        "p_69": " \"Scope of the principle of res judicata is not confined to what is contained in S.11 but is of more general application. Again, res judicata could be as much applicable to different stages of the same suit as to findings on issues in different suits. If the court which rendered the first decision was competent to entertain the suit or other proceeding, and had therefore competency to decide the issue or matter, the circumstance that it is a tribunal of exclusive jurisdiction or one from whose decision no appeal lay would not by themselves negative the finding on the issue by it being res judicata in later proceedings. Where the principle of res judicata is invoked in the case of the different stages of proceedings in the same suit, the nature of the proceedings, the scope of the enquiry which the adjectival law provides for the decision being reached, as well as the specific provisions made on matters touching such decision are some of the material and relevant factors to be considered before the principle is held applicable.\"\n",
        "p_70": "24. Thus Mr. Anand has questioned the maintainability of the suit in view of the provisions of Section 10 of the CPC inasmuch as that direct and substantial question of the use of red and white colour by the defendant is pending before the Bombay High Court and Section 10 prohibits a subsequent suit involving the same dispute or issue or question. \n",
        "p_71": "25. Mr. Anand also tried to assail the maintainability of the suit by the provisions of Order 2 Rule 2 CPC as the kernel of the pleadings of the plaintiffs is the colour scheme of red and white on its container and before the Bombay High Court also identical plea was taken in respect of tooth paste and since the cause of action in respect of tooth powder was available to the plaintiff at the time of the filing of the suit against the defendant in the Bombay High Court and after having failed to obtain an injunction the instant suit is nothing but an attempt to indulge in hit and trial method and taking chances.\n",
        "p_72": "26. Order 2 Rule 2 CPC provides as under:-\n",
        "p_73": " \"decree\" means the formal expression of an adjudication which, so far as regards the Court expressing it, conclusively determines the rights of the parties with regard to all or any of the matters in controversy in the suit and may be either preliminary or final. It shall be deemed to include the rejection of a plaint and the determination of any question within section 144, but shall not include---\n",
        "p_74": "(a) any adjudication from which an appeal lies as an appeal from an order, or\n \n\n",
        "p_75": "(b) any order of dismissal for default.\"  \n",
        "p_76": "27. Next contention of Mr. Anand is that Plaintiff No. 2 cannot claim to be the registered or licensed user of the trademark Colgate and plaintiff No. 1, the proprietor unless and until it is registered as a registered user under Section 48(1) of the Trade Mark Act, 1995 and in the instant case plaintiff No. 2 is neither registered as a registered user nor as a licensed user as required under Section 48 and as such there is no user of any trademark of plaintiff No. 1 in India. Section 48 provides as under:-\n",
        "p_77": " \"48. Registered users-(1) Subject to the provisions of section 49, a person other than the registered proprietor of a trade mark may be registered as a registered user thereof in respect of any or all of the goods or services in respect of which the trademark is registered.\n",
        "p_78": "(2)The permitted use of a trade mark shall be deemed to be used by the proprietor thereof, and shall be deemed not to be used by a person other than the proprietor, for the purposes of section 47 or for any other purpose for which such use is material under this Act or any other law.\" \n",
        "p_79": "28. Mr. Anand further contended that plaintiff No. 1 has only applied for the registration of the trademark Colgate in respect of tooth powder Can and tooth powder and it neither manufactures such a product in India nor sells such a product in India. It only claims to hold trademark registrations for the plaintiff No. 2 who can derive its right as a registered user of the trademark of plaintiff No. 1 and, therefore, cannot be deemed as either a registered user or a licensed user of trademark of plaintiff No. 1 as envisaged in sub-section(2) of Section 48. In other words unless and until the proprietor under the Trade Mark Act is registered it can neither permit the use of trademark and if the proprietor of a trademark happens to be a registered proprietor there is also a requirement of law under Section 48(1) of the Act to seek protection as a permitted or licensed user.\n",
        "p_80": "29. The emphasis has been laid by Mr. Anand on the word \"registered user\" appearing in sub clause (1) which in his perception means that the registered user has to be necessarily registered as such in case it seeks the protection of the trademark of its registered owner or proprietor.\n",
        "p_81": "30. In support of this proposition of law Mr. Anand has relied upon K.R.Beri & Co. l v. The Metal Goods Mfg. Co. Pvt. Ltd.  wherein the Division Bench repelled the contention that even without the use by a registered user of the trademark use by any person can be equated as a use by the proprietor if it is with the latters consent. While arriving at this conclusion their Lordships observed as under:-\n",
        "p_82": " \" when the legislature is creating a fiction by means of Section 48(2) to equate the use by a registered user only as that of proprietor, the court cannot ignore this mandate of the legislature and hold that the use of trade mark by an unregistered user can be equated to the user by the proprietor.\"\n",
        "p_83": "31. Put briefly the ratio of the aforesaid authority is that use of the trademark by an unregistered user cannot be equated to the user by the proprietor.\n",
        "p_84": "32. To cap it all Mr. Anand also contended that neither plaintiff No. 1 nor plaintiff No. 2 has filed a single document showing the sale of tooth powder Can of the trademark Colgate with the get up and the red and white colour scheme in India and in the opinion of Mr. Anand the effect is that there is no evidence on the record to show that there is a user of either of get up or red and white colour scheme by any of the plaintiffs in India and, therefore, the question of passing off of the goods of the plaintiffs does not arise nor does the element of confusion or deception exist whereas on the contrary the defendant proved documents in support of its use of not only of user of its trademark but also of get up and red and white colour scheme of the container in respect of \"tooth powder\" showing the huge sales figures as well as the expenses spent upon the advertisements in the newspapers and in the electronic media. \n",
        "p_85": "33. Mr. Anand has relied upon the judgment in Cycle Corporation of India Limited v. T.I.Raleigh Industries Pvt. Ltd. And others  wherein the interpretation of provisions of Section 46(1)(b) read with Section 48 was involved and the following view was taken:-\n",
        "p_86": " \"The expression \"by an registered proprietor\" in Section 46(1)(b) should not be restricted to user by proprietor or registered user who should also include bona fide or authorised user. The legislature did not intend to register proprietor to be deprived of their property at the instance of user whose use is unregistered. The expression, therefore, should not be restricted to user by the proprietor himself or any registered user but should also take into account bona fide authorised user.\"\n",
        "p_87": "34. Mr. R.K.Anand has further contended that as the plaintiffs have relied upon two trademarks registered as 290361 and 434311 in respect of Colgate tooth powder and the documents placed on record by the plaintiff are the marks other than the said two marks and this shows that the plaintiffs are not the registered users of the aforesaid trademark and, therefore, the user by plaintiff No. 2 is not the user by plaintiff No. 1.\n",
        "p_88": "35. In nutshell unless and until the plaintiffs file the documents in respect of aforesaid two marks they cannot claim to be registered user of the trademarks of the plaintiff No. 1.\n",
        "p_89": "36. Last but not the least, Mr. Anand contended that on account of unexplained delay in taking action the plaintiff has dis-entitled itself to the relief of interim injunction. According to Mr. Anand the plaintiff sent notice to the defendant in the year 1998 calling upon the defendant to stop using the colour combination of red and white on the packaging of their goods and therefore according to the plaintiff, the cause of action arose in July, 1998 when the notice was sent but the averments made by the plaintiff are that the defendant keeps on changing the colour combination and pattern and whenever the plaintiff changes his pattern he always introduces an element of deceptive similarity. But on the contrary there is no evidence to that effect. May be that the plaintiff may be using the same from time to time as and when the defendant changes as the defendant has the registered copy right in respect of his colour combination and the packing style as the registered copy right is not in respect of tooth powder and is in respect of logo.\n",
        "p_90": "37. Mr. Anand stated that first notice in respect of tooth powder was given on 13.7.1998 whereby the plaintiff called upon the defendant to restrain from manufacturing, distributing or selling the goods packed in cans having the similar get up and colour scheme of red and white but for five years they did not take any action till the suit was filed. Such an inordinate delay is not only fatal but sufficient to oust the plaintiff. In support of this contention Mr. Anand has drawn strength from the following:-\n",
        "p_91": "In Sudhir Bhatia and others v. Midas Hygiene Industries(P) Ltd. 2992(24) PTC 94 Delhi (DB) observations of Eve, J in Codes v. Addis & Sons 1923(40)RPC 130 were cited. The observations of Eve, J. are as under:-\n",
        "p_92": " \"For the purpose of determining this issue I must assume that the plaintiffs are traders who have started in this more or less small way in this country, and have been continuously carrying on this business. But I must assume also that they have not, during that period, been adopting a sort of Rip Winkle Policy of going to sleep and not watching what their rivals and competitors in the same line of business were doing. I accept the evidence of any gentleman who comes into the box and gives his evidence in a way which satisfies me that he is speaking the truth when he says that he individually did not know of the existence of a particular element or a particular factor in the goods marketing by his opponents. But the question is a wider question than that : ought not he to have known is he entitled to shut his eyes to everything that is going on around him, and then when his rivals have perhaps built a very important trade by the user of indicia which he might have prevented their using had he moved in time, come to the court and say : \"Now stop them from doing it further, because a moment of time has arrived when I have awakened to the fact that this is calculated to infringe my rights.\" Certainly not. He is bound, like everybody else who wishes to stop that which he says is an invasion of his rights, to adopt a position of aggression at once, and insist, as soon as the matter is brought to court, it ought to have come to his attention, to take steps to prevent its continuance; it would be an insufferable injustice were the court to allow a man to lie by while his competitors are building up an important industry and then to come forward, so soon as the importance of the industry has been brought home to his mind, and endeavor to take from them that of which they had legitimately made use every day when they used it satisfying them more and more that there was no one who either could or would complain of their so doing. The position might be altogether altered had the user of the factor or the element in question been of a secretive or surreptitious nature; but when a man is openly using, as part of his business, names and phrases, or other elements, which persons in the same trade would be entitled, if they took steps, to stop him from using, he gets in time a right to sue them which prevents those who could have stopped him at one time from asserting at a later stage their right to an injunction.\" \n",
        "p_93": "38. Pitted against such a long strip of pleas against injuncting the defendant which according to Mr. Anand is difficult to cross, Mr. Kapil Sibal has the following to offer.\n",
        "p_94": "39. Mr. Sibal has contended that the definition of the mark under Section 2-J takes the colour combination within its fold and has placed reliance upon Anglo-Dutch P C & V Works Pvt. Ltd. v. India Trading House  wherein the container of the plaintiff had following distinctive features:-\n",
        "p_95": " \"(i) a large circle with the numeral 1001 appearing in gray on white background, \n \n\n",
        "p_96": "(ii)this large circle is super-imposed on voilet background, \n \n\n",
        "p_97": "(iii)the top and bottom figures in gray on white portions and\n \n\n",
        "p_98": "(iv) on the back-side the trading style in the white circle with gray lettering and a small monogram in the centre.\" \n",
        "p_99": "40. The container of the defendant, to the eye, was practically identical to that of the plaintiff except for the difference that instead of numeral 1001 the defendant had changed the numeral 9001. There were other imperceptible differences also. It was held that the confusion of voilet background and grey lettering was distinguished combination of colour and, therefore, could be acquired as a trademark for plaintiff's container.\n",
        "p_100": "41. Mr. Sibal went to the extent that even a single colour can achieve the status of a trademark and has taken support from an American decision Qualitex v. Jacobson 514 US 159 wherein the following view was taken:-\n",
        "p_101": " \"We cannot find in the basic objectives of trademark law any obvious theoretical objection to the use of colour alone as a trademark, where that colour has attained \"secondary meaning\" and therefore identifies and distinguishes a particular brand (and thus indicates its \"source\"). In principle, trademark law, by preventing others from copying a source-identifying mark, \"reduce(s) the customer's costs of shopping and making purchasing decisions\". \n",
        "p_102": "42. In the same vein Mr. Sibal also contended that the containers or goods of particular get up with distinctiveness also acquire the protection like that of a trade mark and in support of this relied upon Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. v. DDSA Pharmaceuticals Limited 1972 RPC 1. Views of Lord Justice Harman are as under:-\n",
        "p_103": " \"Goods of a particular get-up just as much proclaim their origin as if they had a particular name attached to them, and it is well known that when goods are sold with a particular get-up for long enough to be recognized by the public as goods of a particular manufacturer it does not matter whether you know who the manufacturer is.\"\n",
        "p_104": "43. On the concept that if there is an overall confusing similarity in the design, colour scheme between the conflicting labels inspite of there being no conflict with the trademark it is a case of passing off Mr. Sibal equipped himself with foreign decisions besides two Indian decisions (i) Camlin Pvt. Ltd. v. National Pencil Industries 1989 IPLR 215; and (ii) Vicco Laboratories Bombay v. Hindustan Rimmer, Delhi . In Camlin's case a prima facie view of passing off was taken where the get up, colour combination and overall arrangement of the pencils of the plaintiff had become associated exclusively with their goods as understood by the trade and public as well as the reputation of the plaintiff in respect of those pencils.\n",
        "p_105": "44. In Vicco Laboratories case also the plaintiffs were selling their goods with descriptive get up and colour scheme for long in 1995 while the defendants started selling their products in 1997 in the cartons which appeared to be copies of the entire get up and the colour scheme adopted by the plaintiff. It was held to be a case of passing off and fit for injuncting the defendants. The foreign decisions relied upon by Mr. Sibal on the concept of trade dress encompassing colour combination, get up and lay out inspite of there being no similarity in the trade name are as under:-\n",
        "p_106": "(i)White Hudson & Company Limited v. Asian Organization Limited 1965 RPC 144. In this case the plaintiffs sold their cough sweets in Singapore since 1953. The sweets were sold loose in orange colored cellophane wrappers on which was printed the word \"Hacks\" in Roman characters only. In March, 1958 the defendants entered the same market with cough sweets in a white cellophane wrapper. But in May of that year they went over to using an orange wrapper similar to the plaintiffs' but bearing the word \"Pecto\". The plaintiffs brought an action to restrain passing off. The trial judge found that no other wrapper cough sweets had been sold loose, that the sweets were called by the local population \"red paper cough sweets\", that the plaintiffs' get-up had become distinctive of their goods, that the get-up of the defendants' sweets resembled the plaintiffs' to such an extent as to lead to confusion, that the difference in the names printed on the wrappers was not sufficient to distinguish the goods in the eyes of a purchasing public largely unable to read English, and that passing-off had therefore been established.\n",
        "p_107": "(ii)Tavener Rutledge Ld. v. Specters Ld. 1959 RPC 83 \n \n\nIt was also a case of Colgate tooth paste pertaining to its label. The defendant introduced and had taken to sale in the local market fluoride treated tooth paste. It was held that the act of the defendant constituted an infringement of their said trade marks as it was calculated to deceive and had in fact led to deception and the belief that his toothpaste was the goods of the appellants or either of them; and was calculated to cause and must have caused sale of toothpaste which was not manufactured or marketed by the appellants to be passed off as their goods.\n",
        "p_108": "45. While emphasizing the significance of trade dress Mr. Sibal vehemently contended that trade dress involves the total image of a product and includes features such as size, shape and graphics and needs to be protected like trade mark. Such a doctrine was enunciated in Vision Sports, Inc. v. Melville Corp. 12 USPQ 2d 1740 like this-\n",
        "p_109": " \"In contrast, trade dress involves the total image of a product and \"may include features such as size, shape, colour combinations, texture, or graphics. Trade dress protection is broader in scope than trademark protection, both because it protects aspects of packaging and product design that cannot be registered for trademark protection and because evaluation of trade dress infringement claims requires the court to focus on the plaintiff's entire selling image, rather than the narrower single facet of trademark. \n",
        "p_110": "46. While meeting the challenge of the defendant that the plaintiff is ousted from instituting the suit on account of delay, laches and acquiescence Mr. Sibal has contended that the plaintiff had issued a notice in July, 1998 and, therefore, any use is at the defendants risk and peril. In support of this contention Mr. Sibal has placed reliance upon the following:-\n",
        "p_111": "(i)My-T Fine Corporation v. Gertrude Samuels & Others 21 USPQ 94 where delay of two years before beginning suit was held to be of no importance. It was held that were it not for the intent to trade unfairly, we might hesitate but advantages built upon a deliberately plagiarized make-up do not seem to us to give the borrower any standing to complain that his vested interests will be disturbed.\n",
        "p_112": "(ii)Hindustan Pencils Pvt. Ltd. v. India Stationery Products  where this court held that in defense of laches in equity both the parties must come to the court with clean hands and present who is guilty.\n",
        "p_113": "(iii) Alfred Dunhill Limited v. Kartar Singh Makkar 1999 PTC (19) 294 where there was a delay of 11 years and arguments were advanced that delay is fatal to the plaintiff's application for temporary injunction as in that case plaintiff refrained from instituting common law suit presumably with the belief that the matter would be resolved in the proceedings initiated by it against the defendant company, it was held that it cannot be said that plaintiff company had been sleeping over on its rights while on the other hand, defendant company acted on its own peril by continuing to use the mark and in such eventuality delay of 11 years was excusable. \n",
        "p_114": "(iv) In Massdak Hossain v. State of West Bengal and others  it was held that where the respondents are put on notice no surprise can be caused by filing of the suit. In other words if the sales are insignificant or have not affected the plaintiff, to expect the plaintiff to institute a suit immediately after service of notices is not a valid expectation.  \n",
        "p_115": "47. Mr. Sibal referred to the conduct of the defendant in following the shape and the size of the containers of the plaintiffs whenever plaintiffs come out with new container also shows or demonstrates its intention to encash upon the reputation and goodwill of the plaintiff. Whenever the plaintiffs come out with the same product but in different sizes of containers, the defendant does not lag behind and immediately comes out with the same size of containers nevertheless to say with the same colour combination and get up. \n",
        "p_116": "48. While expounding the doctrine of confusion arising from the deceptive similarities as to the trade dress that may fail the unwary customer to distinguish between the rival goods Mr. Sibal placed strong reliance upon Harold F.Ritchie, Inc. v. Chesebrough-Pond's Inc, 26 USPQ 310 wherein it was held that while entering a field of endeavor already occupied by another the second comer should, in the selection of a trade name or trade mark, keep far enough away to avoid all possible confusion and the leading case on this concept is Florence Mfg. Co. v. J.C.Dowd & CO., 2 Cir. 178 F.73, 75 which again was an American case. The law laid down in this respect is as under:-\n",
        "p_117": " \"It is so easy for the honest business man, who wishes to sell his goods upon their merits, to select from the entire material universe, which is before him, symbols, marks and covering which by no possibility can cause confusion between his goods and those of his competitors, that the courts look with suspicion upon one who, in dressing his goods for the market, approaches so near to his successful rival that the public may fail to distinguish between them\". \n",
        "p_118": "49. As regards the objection that the benefit of use claimed by plaintiff No. 1 in respect of the use alleged to have been made by the plaintiff No. 2 cannot accrue to plaintiff No. 1 unless and until the license used is duly registered under the provisions of Section 48 of the Act, Mr. Sibal contended that this may be relevant in context of a suit for infringement as the defendant can claim that the registration is invalid since the trademark to which it pertains has not been in use. \n",
        "p_119": "50. As regards the previous proceedings between the parties in Mumbai and the injunction refused by the Mumbai High Court Mr. Sibal has contended that the previous proceedings have no relevance as these related to \"tooth paste\" while the present proceedings relate to \"tooth powder\"which has not only a distinctive container but distinctive colour combination and get up on the container.\n",
        "p_120": "51. I have accorded my careful and cautious consideration to the rival contentions for the purpose of ad interim injunction and have come to the following conclusions:-\n",
        "p_121": "52. It is the overall impression that customer gets as to the source and origin of the goods from visual impression of colour combination, shape of the container, packaging etc. If illiterate, unwary and gullible customer gets confused as to the source and origin of the goods which he has been using for longer period by way of getting the goods in a container having particular shape, colour combination and getup, it amounts to passing off. In other words if the first glance of the article without going into the minute details of the colour combination, getup or lay out appearing on the container and packaging gives the impression as to deceptive or near similarities in respect of these ingredients, it is a case of confusion and amounts to passing off one's own goods as those of the other with a view to encash upon the goodwill and reputation of the latter. \n",
        "p_122": "53. The plaintiffs have succeeded prima facie in showing from the look of trade dress of the two articles, one manufactured by the plaintiff and another by the defendant from the point of view of not only unwary, illiterate customer/servants of the household but semi-literate also as the trademarks \"Colgate\" and \"Anchor\" are written in English language cannot be distinguished by ordinary customer of a country where bare literacy level is abysmally low. There is every likelihood of confusion as to the source on account of the similarity of substantial portion of the container having particular colour combination and also shape of the container which alone helps in determining the allegations of passing off despite stripes in the same colour or in different colour. The criteria is the overall impression from the look of packaging/container containing the goods and articles that can legitimately injunct its rival. Such an action on the part of infringing party also has an element of unfair competition. \n",
        "p_123": "54. May be, no party can have monopoly over a particular colour but if there is substantial reproduction of the colour combination in the similar order either on the container or packing which over a period has been imprinted upon the minds of customers it certainly is liable to cause not only confusion but also dilution of distinctiveness of colour combination. Colour combination, get up, lay out and size of container is sort of trade dress which involves overall image of the product's features. There is a wide protection against imitation or deceptive similarities of trade dress as trade dress is the soul for identification of the goods as to its source and origin and as such is liable to cause confusion in the minds of unwary customers particularly those who have been using the product over a long period. \n",
        "p_124": "55. The difference in the style of the words appearing on the container or packing identifying its manufacturers by way of style, colour combination or textures or graphics is certainly significant or relevant for determining the overall imitation of the container but if a product having distinctive colour combination, style, shape and texture has been in the market for decades as in this case it is in the market since 1951 it leads to ineluctable inference of having acquired secondary meaning on account of its reputation and goodwill earned at huge cost.\n",
        "p_125": "56. It is not the diligent or literate or conscious customer who always remain conscious to the quality of goods he has been purchasing which determines an offence of passing off. It is the unwary, illiterate and gullible persons who determine by arriving at a conclusion whether the infringed goods are confusingly similar in colour combination, get up, lay-out printed over the container or packing. If it is not so then the offence of passing off will cease to have its existence once the guilty party chooses a different trade name. \n",
        "p_126": "57. Words \"Colgate\" and \"Anchor\" are distinct and have not an iota of similarities either in look or in sound. That is why the ingredients of trade dress, get up, colour combination, lay out of the container or packing acquire significance and relevance for determining the offence of passing off. This criteria flows from the concept of action of passing off developed over the years that it is the similarities and not the dissimilarities which go to determine whether the action for passing off is required or not. That is why in trademark cases even the deceptive similarities are considered sufficient for infringement of trademark. If similarities of trade dress are substantial from the look of the two goods, it comes within the mischief of passing off.\n",
        "p_127": "58. As in Hudson's case, for non-speaking English, purchasers get up was held to be all important. In the instant case for unwary, illiterate and gullible customer, who is as good as non-English knowing purchaser, trade dress in the form of colour combination of Red and White in that order and proportion is all pertinent and relevant and nothing else. Distinctive differences in name is of no significance. Reason is simple. If an illiterate servant or village folk goes to the shop with the instruction to bring Colgate Tooth Power having a container of particular shop with trade dress of colour combination of Red and White in 1/3 and 2/3 proportion he will not be in position to distinguish if he is handed over \"Anchor\" Tooth Powder contained in a container having the identical trade dress and colour combination of \"Red and White\"in that order and proportion. Confusion is writ large as to source and origin as the difference in name will not make any difference to such a customer and the goods of the defendant can easily be passed off as goods of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_128": "59. Conscious imitation or substantial imitation of colour combination or get up or lay out of container again bares the design of the defendant in causing confusion in the minds of customeRs. The court is not required to find out whether there is confusion or deceptiveness. The test is whether there is likelihood of confusion or deceptiveness in the minds of unwary customers irrespective of dissimilarities in the trade name.\n",
        "p_129": "60. In the case of passing off and for that purpose infringement of trade mark which are already in existence, the second or for that purpose the subsequent comer has certain obligation to avoid unfair competition and become unjustly rich by encashing on the goodwill or reputation of the prior comer. They have to establish and bank upon on their own trade dress or distinctive features so as to establish their own merit and reputation and attract the attention of the purchasing public and if there are no substantial dissimilarities of marks, colour combination, get up or lay out on the container or packing or covering of the goods of the prior comer these are likely to create confusion in the minds of customers between his goods and the goods of the prior comer in the market as underlying and hidden intention of the second comer is to encash upon the successful rival. \n",
        "p_130": "61. Though in Harold F.Ritchie's case observations emanate from the competitiveness of American economy and therefore the second comer in an already occupied field has always endeavor to capture as much of the first comer market as he can. \n",
        "p_131": "62. Significance of trade dress and colour combination is so immense that in some cases even single colour has been taken to be a trde mark to be protected from passing off action. Colour combination is a trade mark within the definition of the TMM Act as there is no exclusion in the definition. Even a single colour has been held to be a trade mark. There may be exception also. Exception is that where the colour cannot be protected as the blue colour is for the Ink and red colour is for the lipstick. Red and white has nothing to do with the pink. Teeth as white line and Gum as Pink colour alone at least sometimes can meet the basic requirements as a trade mark. Colour depletion theory is unpursuasive only in cases where a blanket prohibition is being sought.\n",
        "p_132": "63. As to the element of deceit and confusion it varies from product to product, customer to customer. As regards the objection that the court should not interfere that this case pertains to two separate products that namely tooth powder and tooth paste the facts are different, the containers are different and the packaging is different. As regards the defense that the red and white colour is common to the trade fact remains that no manufacturer is using colour combination of red and white in respect of tooth powder nor has any other manufacturer used colour combination of red and white colour in respect of tooth powder. \n",
        "p_133": "64. Even in changing competitive commercial complexion of Indian economy, the second comer is also required by giving his product a name and dress descriptive and fanciful in its own right and selling it on its own merit not by confusing the public into mistakenly purchasing his product for his competitor's and the second comer must create a reputation of its own and not trade on the goodwill of another product already established at considerable cost and risks. \n",
        "p_134": "65. As regards the plea of the defendant that plaintiff are not entitled to interim injunction because of delay, laches and acquiescence inasmuch as notice was issued in July, 1998 and action was brought in 2003, such a defense is not available as it is well settled principle of law that if use is found to be dishonest, delay or acquiescence has no relevance. The very fact that notice was served upon the defendant, the bringing of the action after two or three years becomes insignificant and irrelevant. \n",
        "p_135": "66. Further, though notice was given to the defendant on 13/7/98 against the old product but when the defendant discontinued with the old product and brought out a new product in 2002 the instant action was taken within three months and therefore the question of delay does not arise. The notice was given against the use of red and white colour combination with blue line in between. Admittedly the plaintiff did not take any action as the sales were insignificant but when they modified the product with red and white colour combination alone in October, 2002 and the sales of the defendants goods have suddenly went up the instant action was taken. \n",
        "p_136": "67. As regards defense of delay, it is well settled that delay simplicitor is not a defense. Delay is relevant so far as damages are concerned. This cannot stand in the way of injunction. If the original use is dishonest where the notice has been issued inordinate delay or laches may at the most defeat the claim of rendition of accounts. Party is not supposed or expected to rush to the Court immediately.\n",
        "p_137": "68. As regards the objection that use made by plaintiff No. 2 cannot accrue to the plaintiff No. 1, there is no substance as this is not the scope of the instant suit as the present case is essentially a case of passing off and there is no registration of the plaintiff which has been put into attack on the ground of non-use.\n",
        "p_138": "69. Upshot of aforesaid discussion leads to the most ineluctable conclusion that the plaintiffs have successfully established a prima facie case for injuncting the defendant from using the colour combination of red and white in that order as trade dress on the container and packaging. As a consequence the application is allowed and defendants are, by way of ad interim injunction, restrained from using the colour combination of red and white in that order on the container/packaging of its goods viz. the \"Tooth Powder\".\n"

Lotlikar, the learned Senior Counsel for the appellants strenuously urged that there was nothing on record to indicate that the agreements dated 3-9-1990 and 2-2-1991, of which specific performance is sought, were entered into during the ordinary course of business of the first Plaintiff firm with the Defendant Nos. 1 and 2 and, therefore, bar of section 69(2) of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 was not attracted.

In the light of the controversy involved in this appeal it is not necessary to refer to the facts in details. Suffice it to say that the Plaintiffs averred that the firm (first Plaintiff) was registered under the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 at Bombay. The details of the two agreements dated 3-9-1990 and 2-2-1991 were given and it was averred that the Plaintiffs had so far paid a consideration of Rs. 50,000/- as part payment of the price of the suit property. The Plaintiffs averred that the Defendant Nos. 1 and 2 failed to obtain the requisite permission from the Reserve Bank of India for the sale of the suit property and do necessary acts for the sale. The Plaintiffs claimed that in the event the specific performance as prayed for was not being granted, the damages in the sum of Rs. 50,00,000/- being 10% profit in the building project proposed to be undertaken on the site of the suit property, be granted.\n",

In the light of the objection raised by the Defendants that the suit was hit by the provisions contained in Section 69(2) of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 the trial Court heard the parties on the said question and by the impugned Judgment dated 10-6-1999 held that since the firm was not registered on the date of the filing of the suit, the provisions of Section 69(2) of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 were attracted and the suit was liable to be dismissed and was dismissed accordingly. \n",
        "p_7": "6. The learned Senior Counsel for the Appellants/Original Plaintiffs did not dispute the position that on the date of the filing of the suit i.e. 30-8-1993, the first Plaintiff firm was not registered nor the second and the third Plaintiffs were shown as partners in the Register of firms. He, however, submitted that on 19-8-1993 (before the suit was filed) the application for registration of the first Plaintiff firm was made and during the pendency of suit on 20-9-1993 the first Plaintiff firm was registered.\n",
        "p_8": "7. That on the date of the filing of the suit, the first Plaintiff firm was not registered, thus, is not in dispute.\n",
        "p_9": "8. In Shreeram Finance Corporation v. Yasin Khan and Ors.  the Supreme Court held that if on the date of the filing of the suit by and on behalf of a firm against any third party, if the firm is not registered and the persons suing have not been shown in the Register of the Firms as partners in the firm, the suit was hit by the provisions of Sub- section (2) of Section 69. In paragraph 6 of the report the Supreme Court held thus:\n",
        "p_10": " 6. In the present case the suit filed by the appellants is clearly hit by the provisions of Sub-section (2) of Section 69 of the said Partnership Act, as on the date when the suit was filed, two of the partners shown as partners as per the relevant entries in the Register of Firms were not, in fact, partners, one new partner had come in and two minors had been admitted to the benefit of the partnership firm regarding which no notice was given to the Registrar of Firms. Thus, the persons suing, namely, the current partners as on the date of the suit were not shown as partners in the Register of Firms. The result is that the suit was not maintainable in view of the provisions of Sub-section (2) of Section 69 of the said Partnership Act and the view taken by the trial Court and confirmed by the High Court in this connection is correct. Although the plaint was amended on a later date that cannot save the suit. Reference has been made to some decisions in the judgment of the trial Court; however, we do not find it necessary to refer to any of them as the position in law, in our opinion, is clear on a plain reading of Sub-section (2) of Section 69 of the said Partnership Act.\n",
        "p_11": "9. It is true that the view taken in Shreeram Finance Corporation (supra) was doubted in the case of Raptakos Brett & Co. Ltd. v. Ganesh Property . However, the Supreme Court thought it fit not to express any final opinion about its earlier decision in Shreeram Finance Corporation (supra). In Raptakos Brett & Co. Ltd., this is what the Supreme Court observed:\n",
        "p_12": " 29. We, prima facie, find substance in what is contended by Dr. Singhvi for the respondent. It is obvious that even if the suit is filed by an unregistered partnership firm against a third party and is treated to be incompetent as per Section 69 Sub-section (2) of the Partnership Act, if pending the suit before a decree is obtained, the plaintiff puts its house in order and gets itself registered, the defect in the earlier filing which even though may result in treating the original suit as stillborn, would no longer survive if the suit is treated to be deemed to be instituted on the date on which registration is obtained. If such an approach is adopted, no real harm would be caused to either side. As rightly submitted by Dr. Singhvi, Order 7, Rule 13 of the CPC would permit the filing of a fresh suit on the same cause of action and if the earlier suit is permitted to be continued, it would continue in the old number and the parties to the litigation would be able to get their claim adjudicated on merits earlier while on the other hand, if such subsequent registration is not held to be of any avail, all that would happen is that a fresh suit can be filed immediately after such registration, and then it will bear a new number of a subsequent year. That would further delay the adjudicatory process of the Court as such a new suit would take years before it gets ready for trial and the parties will be further deprived of an opportunity to get their disputes adjudicated on merits at the earliest and the arrears of cases pending in the Court would go on mounting. It is axiomatic to say that as a result of protracted litigation spread over tiers and tiers of Court proceedings in the hierarchy, the ultimate result before the highest Court would leave both the parties completely frustrated and financially drained off. To borrow the analogy from an English poem with the caption \"death the leveller\" with appropriate modifications, the situation emerging in such cases can be visualised as under: \"upon final Court's purple altar see how victor victim bleed\". All these considerations in an appropriate case may require a relook at the decision of the two Member Bench of this Court in Shreeram Finance. However, as we have noted earlier, on the facts of the present case, it is not necessary for us to express any final opinion on this question or to direct reference to a larger Bench for reconsidering the aforesaid decision. With these observations, we bring down the curtains on this controversy. Point 2, therefore, is answered by observing that it is not necessary on the facts of the present case in the light of our decision on the first point to decide this point one way or the other. Point 2 is, therefore, left undecided as not surviving for consideration.\n",
        "p_13": "10. Insofar as we are concerned, the Judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Shreeram Finance Corporation (supra) holds the field and binds us. In view of the decision in that case, the first Plaintiff firm being not registered on the date of the filing of the suit, it has to be held and rightly so held by the trial Court that it was liable to be dismissed in view of Section 69(2) of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932.\n",
        "p_14": "11. The learned Senior Counsel for the Appellants, however, urged that the agreements, of which specific performance is sought in the suit, were not entered into by the firm with the Defendants in the course of business dealings by the first Plaintiff firm and as such bar of Section 69(2) was not attracted. The learned Senior Counsel sought to place reliance on the Judgment of the Supreme Court in Haldiram Bhujiawala (supra).\n",
        "p_15": "12. In Haldiram Bhujiawala (supra) the Supreme Court observed thus:\n",
        "p_16": "24. The further and additional but equally important aspect which has to be made clear is that the contract by the unregistered firm referred to in Section 69(2) must not only be one entered into by the firm with the third party defendant but must also be one entered into by the plaintiff firm in the course of the business dealings of the plaintiffs firm with such third party defendant.\n",
        "p_17": "25. It will also be seen that the present defendants who are sued by the plaintiff firm are third parties to the 1st plaintiff firm. Section 2(d) of the Act defines 'third parties' as persons who are not partners of the firm. The defendants in the present case are also third parties to the contract of dissolution dated 16-11-74. Their mother, Kamla Devi was no doubt a party to the contract of dissolution. The defendants are only claiming a right said to have accrued to their mother under the said contract dated 16-11-74 and then to the defendants. In fact, the said contract of dissolution is not a contract to which even the present 1st plaintiff firm or its partners or the 2nd plaintiff were parties. Their father Moolchand was a party and his right to the trade mark devolved in plaintiffs. The real crux of the question is that the legislature when it used the words \"arising out of a contract\" in Section 69(2), it is referring to a contract entered into in course of business transactions by the unregistered plaintiff firm with its customers defendants and the idea is to protect those in commerce who deal with such a partnership firm in business. Such third parties who deal with the partners ought to be enabled to know what the names of the partners of the firm are before they deal with them in business.\n",
        "p_18": "13. It is not mistaken supposition in law that the right that is sought to be enforced by the unregistered firm must be a right arising out of the contract with the third party in the course of business transactions. Adverting to the averments made in the plaint, it would be seen that there is no averment made by the Plaintiffs that the agreements were not entered into the ordinary course of business dealings of the first Plaintiff firm. Rather a close scan of the plaint shows that the subject agreements were in the course of the business dealings of the first Plaintiff firm and the Plaintiffs have set up the case that due to non performance of the contracts by the Defendants, the first Plaintiff firm suffered loss of business profit in the proposed building project. In this view of the matter, we find no merit in the submission of the learned Senior Counsel for the appellants that the question whether the subject contracts were entered into during the course of business dealings of the first Plaintiff firm ought to have been decided after recording the evidence. As we have indicated above, from the facts averred in the plaint, it cannot be said that the subject contracts were not entered into during the course of business dealings. The impugned Judgment does not suffer from any infirmity.\n",
        "p_19": "14. First Appeal is, accordingly, dismissed with no order as to costs since the other side has not chosen to appear.\n"

        "p_1": "JUDGMENT\n \n\nSanjay Kishan Kaul, J.\n",
        "p_2": "1. The plaintiff is an existing Public Limited Company within the meaning of Companies Act, 1956 and has instituted the present suit for permanent injunction restraining infringement of trademark, passing off, delivery up and rendition of accounts etc. against the sole defendant.\n",
        "p_3": "2. The plaintiff claims to be a reputed and established company inter alia engaged in the manufacture of pressure cookers and parts thereof under the trademark HAWKINS for the last 30 years. The name of the plaintiff company was changed from M/s Pressure Cookers and Appliances Limited to the present name of M/s Hawkins Cookers Limited in the year 1986. The plaintiff is the registered proprietor of the trademark HAWKINS from 06.05.1957 in Class 21 under the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 in respect of pressure cookers and parts thereof. The trademark registration No. 179714 is for HAWKINS UNIVERSAL but the mark registered is HAWKINS and the word UNIVERSAL is subject to disclaimer. The registrations are stated to be valid and subsisting. The plaintiff claims that the trademark HAWKINS forms a predominant feature of the corporate name and trading style of the plaintiff and the plaintiff is also referred in the abbreviated form of 'Hawkins'.\n",
        "p_4": "3. The trademark HAWKINS is inter alia used for parts of the pressure cookers known as gaskets. The gaskets of the pressure cookers are sold as independent items and are purchased as such by the housewives and servants whenever the old pieces are worn out or need replacement. The gaskets are one of the most crucial and intergral part of a pressure cooker which prevents the steam from leaking out of the cooker. It is the steam pressure inside the cooker which cooks the food quickly. Thus, gaskets of poor quality or defective gaskets can lead to bursting of cooker and consequential burn injuries. It is in view thereof that the plaintiff has a quality control department to ensure that its pressure cookers and various parts thereof are of the required quality and standard. The plaintiff claims that since these gaskets are sold all over the country including rural as well as urban areas, the uneducated intending purchasers of below average intelligence, being illiterate and having imperfect recollection, identify such gaskets by their features and get-up of their packing as well as the trademark HAWKINS. It is in order to promote the pressure cookers and parts thereof manufactured by the plaintiff that the plaintiff has spent a sum of Rs.  111 crore between October, 1986 and March, 2005 towards advertisements and promotions.\n",
        "p_5": "4. The plaintiff in January, 2000 came to know that the defendant was using the trademark HAWKINS/Hawkins in respect of parts of pressure cooker and thus served a Cease and Desist Notice on the defendant vide its letter dated 03.01.2000. The claim of the plaintiff was disputed by the defendant on the ground that the gaskets were being sold under their own trademark and the use of the word 'Hawkins' by the defendant on their products/gaskets was to inform the purchasers that the gaskets being manufactured by the defendant were suitable for Hawkins pressure cookers. The plaintiff claims that they did not see the product subsequently in the market till October, 2004 when the plaintiff again noticed the defendant's gaskets being sold in the market and thus again a Cease and Desist Notice dated 08.11.2004 was issued, which was disputed by the defendant vide its letter dated 17.11.2004\n \n\n",
        "p_6": "5. The principal defense of the defendant is that they have adopted the trademark MAYUR and only state on their product/gasket that the same is suitable was Hawkins Pressure Cookers. Thus there is no chance of deception or infringement of the trademark of the plaintiff since the trademark of the defendant MAYUR has been used prominently on the packing of their product/gasket.\n",
        "p_7": "6. On the other hand, the case of the plaintiff is that the unauthorized use of the trademark Hawkins by the defendant on the packaging of their product/gasket is likely to cause confusion or deception about a nexus, trade connection or association between the goods and business of the defendant with that of the plaintiff. This is more so since the purchasers of the plaintiff's products are not so wary customers. The plaintiff claims that the use of the trademark 'Hawkins' by the defendant is detrimental to the plaintiff's reputation since the plaintiff has no control or supervision over the quality of spare parts manufactured by the defendant. The use of the trademark 'Hawkins' by the defendant is alleged to be motivated only with the intent of the defendant to trade upon the goodwill and reputation enjoyed by the trademark HAWKINS of the plaintiff in the market and amongst the customers. The trademark HAWKINS of the plaintiff is also used in the price list of the defendant as MAYUR-HAWKINS. It is in view thereof that the present suit has been filed by the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_8": "7. The suit is resisted by the defendant. The defendant claims that the plaintiff wants to monopolize the sale of gaskets which are used in pressure cookers in the market. The defendant manufactures gaskets which can be used for different types of pressure cookers including the pressure cookers manufactured by the plaintiff. The defendant claims that it is a common knowledge that there is always a second line of manufacturers of spare parts, accessories and replacement items of machines, articles of everyday use, domestic appliances and even for automobiles for every description, which is known as ancillary industry. It is the well known custom of usage of the trade of the second line manufacturers to specifically indicate the compatibility of the various accessories, appliances and spares to the main item for which they supply the ancillary product. This is stated to be essential information to the customers so that they can select articles of a particular specification for the main items used by them. The defendant thus states that the use of a trademark of one person as a referral cannot be termed as infringement of trademark and such user is not prohibited by any law much less by the Trade and Merchandise Act, 1958 or the Trade Marks Act, 1999 ('the said Act' for short). The object is only to inform the public that MAYUR gaskets can be used for HAWKINS pressure cookers and it is only this much information which is set out on the packaging of the defendant. The defendant claims to be manufacturing MAYUR gaskets continuously and openly from the year 1994 onwards. The defendant claims to have adopted the trademark MAYUR and device of PEACOCK from 1994. The trademark of the defendant is stated to have been registered with the Registrar of Trademarks. It is thus claimed that the defendant's trademark as also the device of peacock have acquired good reputation in the market and the sales of the defendant's product/gasket is only in Tamil Nadu. The defendant has also raised a plea of acquiescence on account of the fact that after giving the initial Cease and Desist Notice as far back as January, 2000, the plaintiff kept silent for a period of four years thereafter. Even on merits, it is stated that there can be no question of passing off the goods by the defendant as the gaskets manufactured by the defendant come in different colours with a different packaging as compared to the gaskets supplied by the plaintiff which come in black colour.\n",
        "p_9": "8. The defendant naturally claims that the product manufactured by it is of high value and there is no question of the product of the defendant being inferior to that of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_10": "9. The gasket is used in the pressure cooker more as a sealing mechanism to prevent leakage of steam, which seals the upper and lower portion of the cooker but it does not lock the metal portion of the cooker. Thus there is no question of the role of any defective gasket in bursting of a pressure cooker. The defendant claims that it commenced business from 1991 and the quality standards of the gaskets manufactured by the defendant are approved by the Bureau of Indian Standards. However, the trademark MAYUR and the device of PEACOCK were adopted in the year 1994.\n",
        "p_11": "10. On the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed:\n",
        "p_12": "i) Whether this Court has no territorial jurisdiction to try and adjudicate the present suit? OPD\n \n\n",
        "p_13": "ii) Whether the defendant is using 'Hawkins' as a trademark? OPP\n \n\n",
        "p_14": "iii) If issue No. 2 is answered in favor of the plaintiff : Whether the defendant is infringing the trademark 'Hawkins' of the plaintiff? OPP\n \n\n",
        "p_15": "iv) If issue No. 2 is answered in favor of the plaintiff : Whether the defendant is passing of its goods as that of the plaintiff? OPP\n \n\n",
        "p_16": "v) Whether the plaintiff is entitled to damages/rendition of accounts? If so, the extent and period thereof? OPP\n \n\n",
        "p_17": "vi) Relief.\n",
        "p_18": "11. The parties subsequently agreed on 21.05.2007 that really there was no cross examination required and that the parties would file their affidavits of examination in chief. The parties have thereafter led their evidence.\n",
        "p_19": "12. The plaintiff has examined Sh. K.Sundararaghavan as PW1 being the Executive Director (Finance and Administration) of the plaintiff-company, who has proved the Power of Attorney executed in his favor as ExPW1/1. A certified copy of the Certificate of Incorporation pursuant to the change of name of the plaintiff has been proved as ExPW1/2. Certified copies of certificate of registration have been proved as ExPW1/3 and ExPW1/4. The booklet containing the information about the names and addresses of all the authorized dealers and service centres of the plaintiff has been proved as ExPW1/6. The notice dated 03.01.2000 has been proved as Ex P-1 and the reply of the defendant dated 10.01.2000 has been proved as ExP-2. The exchange of correspondence between the parties in November, 2004 has been proved as ExP-3 and ExP-4. The other communications have also been proved, but it is not necessary to go into details in that behalf. The packaging of the defendant has been proved as ExP-10. The witness has affirmed to what is stated in the plaint.\n",
        "p_20": "13. PW1 has also gone on to state that there are two types of pressure cookers with following particulars:\n",
        "p_21": "(1) Pressure Cookers with outside fitting lid; and\n \n\n(2) Pressure Cookers with inside fitting lid.\n",
        "p_22": "14. The pressure cookers being manufactured by the plaintiff are stated to fall in the second category. The dimensions of all the pressure cookers with inside fitting lid and the size of the corresponding gasket are stated to be generally identical to the various pressure cookers of the same variety and thus the gaskets of all inside fitting lid pressure cookers are generally interchangeable. It is in view thereof that the plaintiff claims that the defendant cannot use the trademark HAWKINS or the endorsement i.e. the gasket manufactured by the defendant is suitable for Hawkins pressure cookers.\n",
        "p_23": "15. In order to prove that the product of the defendant was inferior, a report dated 18.01.2007 has been proved as ExPW1/10 given by Indian Rubber Manufacturers Research Association affiliated to Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India for the purpose of evaluation of quality of the gaskets on various parameters prescribed for the gaskets. The report shows that the defendant's gasket failed the test in vital parameters of i)Tensile Strength, ii) Change in hardness and iii) Compression.\n",
        "p_24": "16. Mr. Hansraj Karsan Satra has appeared as PW2 who runs a shop by the name of Mahavir at Naupada, Thane (W) since the year 1979 and claims to be selling HAWKINS pressure cookers and parts thereof. The witness has also stated that there are two kinds of pressure cookers as mentioned aforesaid and that the dimensions of all the lids which are inward opening are the same. Thus the gaskets for inward opening lid of various brands of pressure cookers can be interchangeably used. The importance of gasket in the performance of the pressure cookers has been emphasized by this witness and various gaskets being sold in the market under different trade names have been annexed to the affidavit.\n",
        "p_25": "17. The defendant has led evidence of Mr. V.K.Radhakrishnan, partner of the defendant-firm. This witness has proved the Certificate of Registration of the trademark MAYUR and the device of PEACOCK as ExDW1/1. The Certificate of Bureau of Indian Standards to the defendant-firm has been proved as ExDW1/2 and the Registration Certificate dated 07.05.2004 issued to the defendant-firm by the Director General of Quality Assurance, Ministry of defense has been proved as ExDW1/3 to show the distinction between the packaging of the plaintiff's product and the defendant's product. The witness stated that the indication as to the compatibility of the various accessories, appliances and spares to the main item for which they supply the ancillary product is essential to the customers so that they can select articles of a particular specification for the main items used by them.\n",
        "p_26": "18. Learned Counsel for the parties were heard at length and the findings on the issues are as under:\n",
        "p_27": "Issue No.1\n \n\nWhether this Court has no territorial jurisdiction to try and adjudicate the present suit? OPD\n \n\n",

Learned Counsel for the plaintiff drew the attention of this Court to para 32 of the plaint whereby jurisdiction is claimed of this Court under Section 134 of the said Act since the plaintiff carries on business at Delhi. It is further claimed that the goods of the defendant are being sold and are being offered for sale at Delhi. Section 134 of the said Act reads as under:\n",

        "p_35": "Explanation.- For the purpose of Sub-section (2), ``person'` includes the registered proprietor and the registered user.\n",
        "p_36": "20. The aforesaid provision is a digression from the general norm as contained in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 ('the said Code' for short) inasmuch as it gives the jurisdiction to a Court where the plaintiff resides or carries on business or works for gain.\n",
        "p_37": "21. It is the case of the plaintiff that it is carrying on business at Delhi. Learned Counsel for the plaintiff has drawn the attention of this Court in Intas Pharmaceuticals Limited v. Allergan Inc.; 2006 (32) PTC 272. A reference has also been made to two other judgments of the learned single Judge of this Court. In Pfizer Products Inc. v. Rajesh Chopra and Ors.  the learned single Judge of this Court has rejected the argument of the defendant since the defendant had not sold any goods in Delhi, no cause of action arose in Delhi. In LG Corporation and Anr. v. Intermarket Electroplasters (P) Ltd. and Anr. 2006 (32) PTC 429, it was held that the fact of sale of infringing goods in Delhi has the nexus and relevance with the lis that is involved in the case.\n",
        "p_38": "22. On the other hand, the plea of learned Counsel for the defendant is that the Cease and Desist notices were sent from Bombay and thus this Court would have no territorial jurisdiction to try and determine the present suit.\n",
        "p_39": "23. In my considered view such a plea on the part of the defendant cannot be accepted for the reason that it is the case of the plaintiff that it is carrying on business at Delhi and the same is confirmed in the affidavits of evidence to which there is really no denial on the part of the defendant. I am of the view that this Court would have the territorial jurisdiction to try and determine the present suit.\n",

Learned Counsel for the plaintiff emphasized that the plaintiff did not dispute that the defendant can use the trade name to indicate that the spare part is fit for use in a particular machinery but for the same it should be accompanied with a disclaimer that the spare part is not manufactured by the original manufacturer. The object should be to ensure that the public knows whether the product purchased emanates from the plaintiff or somewhere else.

Learned Counsel for the plaintiff thus contended that the defendant's gasket may mention that it can be used for different brands of pressure cookers and specify the number of such brands including 'Hawkins' but the defendant cannot single out 'Hawkins' because that would amount to trying to take advantage of the reputation of the plaintiff's trademark.\n",
        "p_74": "31. The second limb of the argument of learned Counsel for the plaintiff is based on the reading of the provisions of Section 30(2)(d) of the said Act which provides for protection for the defendant : i) if the use of the trademark is reasonably necessary; and ii) neither the purpose nor the effect of the use of the trade mark is to indicate a connection. Thus it should be an honest practice which is necessary to describe the use.\n",
        "p_75": "32. The plaintiff pleaded that it has come in the testimony of PW2 that the dimensions of all pressure cookers are same and the annexures filed with the testimony of PW2 would also show that the trade practice is not to use the brand but to go by the nature of pressure cookers and thus it was not necessary to state that the gasket was meant for Hawkins pressure cooker. There was neither any necessity for the same nor it was an honest practice which was a pre-requisite under Section 30(2)(d) of the said Act. The reputation of a pressure cooker manufacturer could also be affected in case of lack of proper quality of gasket as stated in the affidavit of PW1. The plaintiff also drew strength from the manner of published price list. Learned Counsel for the plaintiff fairly conceded that there was apparently no judgment of any Indian Court on this aspect and sought to rely upon the case of Gillette Co. v. LA- Laboratories Ltd. 2005 FSR (Vol.37) 808 which is a judgment rendered by Court of Justice of the European Communities (Third Chamber). In order to appreciate the aforesaid judgment which has formed the basis of submission of both the learned Counsel for the parties, it would be necessary to examine the factual matrix in which the said judgment was delivered.\n",
        "p_76": "33. The Gillette Group of Companies being registered proprietor of GILLETTE and SENSOR were arrayed as the plaintiff No. 1 while the second plaintiff was their exclusive licensee. The defendant was selling similar razors and blades as being manufactured by the plaintiff under the mark PARASON FLEXOR in packaging which had affixed to it a sticker bearing the words: 'All Parason Flexor and Gillette Sensor handles are compatible with this blade'. The proceedings were brought for infringement of trademark on the ground that the defendant's packaging was such as to create a link in the mind of the consumers between the defendant's product and those of the plaintiffs or at least to give an impression that the defendant was authorised by virtue of a license or for some other reason to use the GILLETTE and SENSOR marks. It was held that using the plaintiff's marks in an eye-catching manner on its packaging by the defendant amounted to an infringement of trade mark of the plaintiff by the defendant. It was further held that both the blade and the handle were essential parts of the razor and not spare parts or accessories and thus the 'spare part' exception to infringement provided by Article 4 (2) of the Finnish Law on Trade Marks would not apply.\n",
        "p_77": "34. On an appeal, the Court of Appeal held that where a razor comprised a handle and a blade and the consumer could replace the blade by a new one sold separately, the blade could be regarded as a spare part. The information given about the compatibility of the blades with both the defendant's and the claimants handles was held to be useful to the consumers and thus the defendant was held entitled to be able to demonstrate the need to mention the GILLETTE and SENSOR marks in small standard lettering on the stickers of a relatively modest size and it was held that it could not in any way give the impression that there was a commercial connection between the claimants and the defendant. It is against the said judgment that a further appeal was preferred and various questions were referred to the European Court. In substance, the questions referred to were:\n",
        "p_78": "(1) What are the criteria for deciding whether a product is a spare part or accessory;\n",
        "p_79": "(2) The permissibility of the use of a third party's trade mark to be assessed differently, depending on whether the product is like a spare part or accessory;\n",
        "p_80": "(3) The parameters to determine the requirement that the use must be 'necessary' to indicate the intended purpose of a product and the difficulty for a consumer to understand if there is no express reference to the third party's trade mark.\n",
        "p_81": "(4) The factors to be taken into account while determining an honest commercial practice and whether the mention of a third party's trademark in connection with marketing of one's own product would constitute a reference to the fact that the own product corresponds in quality and technicality or as regards its other properties to the product designed by the third party's trade mark.\n",
        "p_82": "(5) Whether the permissibility of user of a third party's trademark would be affected on the ground that the economic operator who refers to the third party's trademark also markets in addition to a spare part or accessory a product of his own with which the spare part or accessory is intended to be used with.\n",
        "p_83": "35. The European Court gave its findings and some of the findings are material for the present case which are as under:\n",
        "p_84": "(1) Use of the trademark by a third party who was not its owner was necessary in order to indicate the intended purpose of a product marketed by that third party where such use in practice constituted the only means of providing the public with comprehensible and complete information on that intended purpose in order to preserve the undistorted system of competition in the market for that product. Thus the lawfulness or otherwise of the use of the trademark depended on the necessity of the use to indicate the intended purpose of a product.\n",
        "p_85": "(2) The condition of 'honest use' constituted in substance the expression of a duty to act fairly in relation to the legitimate interests of the trade mark owner. The use of the trademark would not be in accordance with honest practices in industrial and commercial matters if for example it was done in such a manner as to give the impression that there was a commercial connection between the third party and the trademark owner or it affected the value of the trade mark by taking unfair advantage of its distinctive character or repute.\n",
        "p_86": "(3) The mere fact that third party used a trade mark of which it was not the owner in order to indicate the intended purpose of the product which it marketed did not necessarily mean that it was presenting it as being of the same quality as or having equivalent properties to those of the product bearing the trade mark. The relevant Article 6 is as under:\n",
        "p_87": "Limitation of the effects of a trade mark:\n",
        "p_88": "1. The trademark shall not entitle the proprietor to prohibit a third party from using, in the course of trade,....\n",

        "p_90": "provided he uses them in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial matters....\n",
        "p_91": "36. The condition of honest use within the meaning of the aforesaid Article 6 (1) (c) of the Directive 89/104 was held to be in substance the expression of a duty to act fairly in relation to the legitimate interests of the trade mark owner.

        "p_95": "37. Learned Counsel for the parties have also referred to another judgment of the Chancery Division in Aktiebolaget Volvo and Anr. v. Heritage (Leicester)Limited; Fleet Street Reports (2000). In the said case, the plaintiff owned various registered trademarks including the word VOLVO. The defendant-company had been an authorized Volvo dealer and thus licensed to use the Volvo mark. The authorised dealership was revoked, but the defendant continued to use the word Volvo in a similar (but not identical) style to the registered mark, accompanied by the words 'independent' and 'specialist' appearing in much smaller lettering so that the signs read 'Independent Volvo Specialist'. The defendant used this wording on signs outside its garage, on an entrance sign, and on its letterhead. The defendant was also alleged to have used the word Volvo on a loyalty card and in the text of various letters sent by the defendant to its customers. The defense was that by virtue of its use of the words 'independent' and 'specialist' in its mark, the trademark was not identical. Alternatively, the plea advanced by the defendant was that it was the using the plaintiff's mark to indicate the kind of vehicle dealt with or the intended purpose of its services and thus ought to be exempted.\n",
        "p_96": "38. The para materia provisions under which such protection was sought under the Indian Act would be Sections 30(1)(b) and 30(2)(d) of the said Act. It was held that association of the words 'independent' and 'specialist' with the word Volvo did not render the defendant's mark non identical to the registered mark.\n",
        "p_97": "39. The aforesaid judgment was relied by the learned Counsel for the plaintiff to advance the plea that the same principle would apply to indication given by the defendant on its product 'Suitable for: Hawkins pressure cookers' as in the present case while learned Counsel for the defendant emphasized the factual matrix of that case whereby the defendant had past association with the plaintiff being the authorized dealer and was using the two words in very small alphabets with the emphasis being on the trademark VOLVO. In the present case, it was emphasized that the trademark of the defendant was being used prominently and the indication given was for the benefit of the customer.\n",
        "p_98": "40. Learned Counsel for the defendant thus drew the attention of this Court including the use of the stationery in the business of the defendant in Aktiebolaget Volvo and Anr. v. Heritage (Leicester)Limited's case (supra). The new letterhead mentioned other brands of the car. The lettering was in such a manner that above the word 'Volvo' in very small capital letters, the word 'Independent' was used and below the word 'Volvo' in slightly larger capital letters, but still much smaller than the letters used for the word Volvo, the word 'specialist' was used.\n",
        "p_99": "41. It has been held that the well settled principle is that the test of honesty for the purposes of proviso is the one that has to be judged by an objective standard and the appropriate question to be asked in relation to that test in the present case is whether a reasonable motor service provider would think the use complained of in the present case to be honest, or, rather in accordance with honest practices in that business.\n",
        "p_100": "42. Learned Counsel for the plaintiff sought to derive strength from these observations to contend that the defendant had to establish that the use of the word 'Hawkins' in such a manner was part of the trade practice which the defendant had failed to so establish.\n",
        "p_101": "43. In the facts of the case Rattee, J found that in order to constitute infringement what is necessary is the use of identical word in the course of trade as a distinctive word, whether with or without other words or material added to it. The test is of honest use in the commercial activity in which such trader is involved and thus all circumstances surrounding the use complained of and the context in which the use was made would be material.\n",
        "p_102": "44. The important facts taken note of by the learned Judge are as under:\n",
        "p_103": "In my judgment the relevant context in the present case includes the following. The defendant had been an authorized Volvo dealer for a long time. Customers knew it as such and dealt with it as such. On the signs and the letter head complained of by the claimants the word Volvo appears in a colour very similar to that used by Volvo for its own logo. The word appears in letters using a very similar font, though without the serifs, as I have mentioned. The word appears on the signs and the letter head complained of immediately alongside or underneath the names of other makes of cars for which the defendant is and holds itself out as, an authorized dealer. The word Volvo appears in lettering of similar size to that used in the name of both other makes of car concerned. The word 'independent' and 'specialist' are printed in much smaller and less obvious form than the word Volvo so that on looking at the sign or the letter head the immediate impression is of the word Volvo although if one looks more closely certainly one can see the words 'Independent' and 'Specialist' above and below it.\n",
        "p_104": "Certain letters have been written in the past to customers of the defendant by the defendant to which I should refer as forming part of the relevant context in which I have to consider the honesty of the use complained of. The first of those letters was written before the defendant ceased to be an authorized Volvo dealer. It was dated November 27, 1996 and apparently is a circular letter sent out widely by the defendant to its customers. It includes the following. It is headed 'Exciting News' and then says:\n",
        "p_105": "As a valued customer I am writing to inform you of two exciting developments at Heritage Leicester (that is the name of the defendant).\n",
        "p_106": "First I am proud to announce that the Heritage Leicester team has recently achieved accreditation for ISO9002 (BS5750). This reflects our commitment always to offer you a level of service second to none by continually improving the standards by which we operate our business on a day to day basis.\n",
        "p_107": "Secondly, at the end of this year we will become an Independent Volvo Specialist, a member of the new 'Association of Independent Volvo Specialists', a national organization of more than 30 members all of whom have spent many years within the Volvo franchise.\n",
        "p_108": "As an Independent Volvo Specialist we will be able to provide you with an unrivalled service by offering you the full range of Volvo services from our fully trained Volvo staff utilizing our Volvo specialist equipment.\n",
        "p_109": "Furthermore we will be free to purchase on more competitive terms a wider range of Volvo cars and original equipment parts therefore providing you with greater choice and more competitive prices, making Volvo motoring more affordable.\n",
        "p_110": "We will continue to offer for sale a wide range of new and used vehicles; all our used vehicles will continue to have comprehensive Mechanical Breakdown Insurance. Our After Sales Department will continue to sell genuine Volvo parts and accessories and to service, repair and MOT your car to main dealer standards. Our comprehensively equipped Body and Paint Centre will also remain available enabling us to meet all of your Volvo motoring needs.\n",
        "p_111": "Within the next few weeks you will be receiving your personal Heritage Leicester Loyalty Card which will entitle you to discounts on our full range of Volvo services. In addition we will be offering monthly 'Special Offers' to all Loyalty Card Holders.\n",
        "p_112": "I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your past custom and look forward to your continued support in the future.\n",
        "p_113": "Be assured that our commitment to you, our valued Volvo customer, will be even stronger than ever.\n",
        "p_114": "45. The learned Judge recorded his conclusion as under:\n",
        "p_115": "In my judgment the defendant's use of the word Volvo, comprising the registered trade mark of the claimants, in the context of its having previously for so long been an authorized dealer of Volvos, was calculated to cause at least confusion in the minds of customers, and probably, indeed, also the belief that there was still, to put it at its lowest, some trading connection between the defendant and Volvo. As I have said, I entirely reject the submission that the letter which I have read, which was written to customers in November 1996 could properly be said to have been calculated to convey the impending change of status to the recipient. Using the word Volvo in the manner and in the context which I have described in my judgment was so obviously likely to cause at least confusion in the minds of the customers of the defendant that no reasonable motor trader would say that such use constituted honest use in the course of the motor trading and servicing business. I do not overlook the fact that there is evidence that Volvo itself took steps in December 1996 to notify such Volvo owning customers of the defendant as the plaintiffs had records of the change of the defendant's status, but, in my judgment, that is quite immaterial in considering the honesty from the objective point of view of the defendant's conduct, not least when the letter which I have described, which was written in November 1996, was written before the defendant had any reason to believe that its customers would be more frankly and clearly notified of the impending change of status of Volvo itself.\n",
        "p_116": "The conclusion which I have just expressed in my judgment is in no way inconsistent with the judgment of the European Court on which the defendant placed reliance, that is to say the judgment of the case of BMW v. Deenik Case C-63/97 in which the judgment of the European Court of Justice was given on February 23 of this year. The reference which I have to it is as having been reported in (1999) All E.R. (D.) 183. The situation before the Court in that case was in some ways not dissimilar from that in the present case, although in other ways very dissimilar, but it also concerned the question of whether a trader, not being an authorized dealer, in that case, in BMW motor cars was entitled to use the name BMW being a registered trade mark of the BMW manufacturing company in the context of holding itself out as having specialist expertise in servicing BMW cars. In its conclusion, paragraph 3, the Court said this: 'Articles 5 to 7 of First Directive 89/104..., and those, as I understand it, are Articles which were incorporated into the English 1994 Act in Sections 6, 10 and 11,\n \n\n... do not entitle the proprietor of a trade mark to prohibit a third party from using the mark for the purpose of informing the public that he carries out the repair and maintenance of goods covered by that trade mark and put on the market under that mark by the proprietor or with his consent, or that he has specialized or is a specialist in the sale or the repair and maintenance of such goods....\n",
        "p_117": "and then come the important words for present purposes:\n",
        "p_118": "...unless the mark is used in a way that may create the impression that there is a commercial connection between the other undertaking and the trade mark proprietor, and in particular that the reseller's business is affiliated to the trade mark proprietor's distribution network or that there is a special relationship between the two undertakings.\n",
        "p_119": "In my judgment the proviso expressed in that paragraph of the European Court of Justice's judgment in the BMW case reflects the honest proviso as I may call it, to Section 11(2) of the Trade Marks Act, 1994, in the context of a case such as that which was before the European Court and that which is before me.\n",
        "p_120": "46. The learned Judge thus found that the use was not in accordance with the honest practices in industrial or commercial matters.\n",
        "p_121": "47. Learned Counsel for the plaintiff also referred to the judgment of the Supreme Court in Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma v. Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories 1965 SCR 737 where in para 28 it was observed as under:\n",
        "p_122": "In an action for infringement, the plaintiff must, no doubt, make out that the use of the defendant's mark is likely to deceive, but where the similarity between the plaintiff's and the defendant's mark is so close either visually, phonetically or otherwise and the court reaches the conclusion that there is an imitation, no further evidence is required to establish that the plaintiff's rights are violated. Expressed in another way, if the essential features of the trademark of the plaintiff have been adopted by the defendant, the fact that the get-up, packing and other writing or marks on the goods or on the packets in which he offers his goods for sale show marked differences, or indicate clearly a trade origin different from that of the registered proprietor of the mark would be immaterial; whereas in the case of passing off, the defendant may escape liability if he can show that the added matter is sufficient to distinguish his goods form those of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_123": "When once the use by the defendant of the mark which is claimed to infringe the plaintiff's mark is shown to be 'in the course of trade', the question whether there has been an infringement is to be decided by the comparison of the two mark.\n",
        "p_124": "48. A careful consideration of the aforesaid judgments and the pleas advanced by learned Counsel for the parties shows that the complete emphasis of the plaintiff is on the fact that it owns the registered trademark HAWKINS and thus has a statutory right to exclusive use in relation to its pressure cookers and spare parts including gaskets. Thus the use of any identical or deceptively similar trademark by any unauthorized person in relation to goods including gaskets amounts to an infringement under Section 29 of the said Act irrespective of any addition either preceding or succeeding it. Thus the added matter to the trademark by the defendant is pleaded to be irrelevant for the purposes of infringement. It is, however, not disputed that there is an exception to the same as envisaged under Section 30 of the said Act but the onus is on the defendant to prove that it falls within the exception so envisaged.\n",
        "p_125": "49. It is thus the plea of the plaintiff that in order for the defendant to seek protection under Section 30 of the said Act, it must be proved that a)Use of the trademark Hawkins by the defendant is reasonably necessary to indicate that the gaskets are so adapted; b) Neither the purpose nor the effect of such indication is to show a connection in the course of trade between the goods of the defendant and those of the plaintiff, c) Use of the trademark by the defendant is in accordance with an honest practice in industrial or commercial matters and d) it is not an endeavor on the part of the defendant to take unfair advantage of the mark of the plaintiff or is detrimental to the repute of the mark of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_126": "50. Learned Counsel for the plaintiff thus contended that the only honest use of the trademark is in respect of distinction between pressure cookers with outside fitting lid and pressure cookers with inside fitting lid and a number of pressure cookers under different trademarks are sold which are all similar to the lid of Hawkins pressure cookers. Thus the user of only name of 'Hawkins' to show suitability of the product is stated to be not an honest business practice but an endeavor to encash on the goodwill and reputation of the brand of HAWKINS.\n",
        "p_127": "51. Learned Counsel for the defendant has, however, pleaded that the defendant is manufacturing the gasket under the registered trademark MAYUR with the device of PEACOCK and has large and extensive sale because of its product's good quality, good market and sales promotion. Thus there was no occasion for the defendant to infringe the trademark of the plaintiff. The defendant's line of business is one of ancillary nature and the indication given on the packaging is an essential information to the customers so that they can select an accessory of a particular specification which is suitable for the main article. The expression ' suitable for HAWKINS pressure cookers' is thus said to fall within the exception of Section 30(2)(d) of the said Act. The indication is stated to be only to show compatibility of the product of the defendant with that of the plaintiff. The filing of the suit is alleged to be motivated by the oblique object of the plaintiff to have monopoly in the market of spare parts/accessories for its pressure cookers including gaskets and the garb of infringement of its trademark is being used for the said purpose.\n",
        "p_128": "52. In order to further substantiate its plea, learned Counsel for the defendant has referred to the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, Second Circuit in the matter of The Electric Auto-Lite Company v. P and D Manufacturing Co. Inc. reported as (44 USPQ 377 (2nd Circuit 1940). The case related to alleged infringement of patent and it was held that replacement of new for worn out parts in devices sold by the plaintiff would not amount to infringement of the patent of the plaintiff although part replaced includes portion not worn out where it would cost more to replace the worn out part alone. The plaintiff with a third party and other manufacturers published a joint catalogue in which appeared side by side the service parts of both the companies. The sale of the parts by such third party jointly advertised in this way was held not to be infringement of the plaintiff's patent of machine and that the defendant could not be contributory infringer by sale of parts by such third parties to the users.\n",
        "p_129": "53. Further in Taylor Instrument Companies v. Fawley-Brost Company 59 USPQ 384 (7th Circuit 1943) it was held that having the right to make and sell chart designed to fit plaintiff's (Taylor)machine and the advertisement thereof does not support the conclusion of infringement of the trademark and the machine of the plaintiff. It was held that the defendant can advise public on price card ( carrying prominently defendant's name) bearing 'TAY', that it has for sale 'Chart to fit' such machine sold under the trademark 'Taylor'.\n",
        "p_130": "54. I have given deep thoughts to the submissions of learned Counsel for the parties conscious of the fact that insofar as the Indian Courts are concerned, it is an unchartered area. However, the observations and views expressed in Aktiebolaget Volvo and Anr. v. Heritage (Leicester)Limited's Case (supra) and Gillette Co. v. LA-Laboratories Ltd's Case (supra) have material bearing in view of the provisions of the said Act which are similar in nature and intent. (55)A reading of Section 29 of the said Act shows that the use of a registered trade mark by a third party in the course of trade or user of a deceptively or identical trademark is not permissible when it renders the use of the mark likely to be taken as being used as a trademark. The provision of the said Act would work in the following manner:\n",
        "p_131": "(1) The first party has to be owner of the registered trademark;\n",
        "p_132": "(2) The second party uses the mark in the course of trade which is identical with or deceptively similar to trademark in relation to goods and services in respect of which the trademark is registered;\n",
        "p_133": "(3) The use is in such a manner as to render the use of the trademark by the second party likely to be taken as being used as a trademark.\n",
        "p_134": "56. If the provision is read in the aforesaid manner, the interpretation put forth by the learned Counsel for the defendant has to be accepted that though the expression used is a mark insofar as the second party is concerned, in order to constitute an infringement the use of the said mark should be such as to lead to deception of it being taken to be used as a trademark.\n",
        "p_135": "57. The second aspect is the wording of Section 29 to the effect 'use of the mark likely to be taken as being used as a trade mark'. Thus the deception should be such that the purchasing public would assume that the mark is indicative of the same being a trademark of the first party.\n",
        "p_136": "58. The exception to the aforesaid is provided in Section 30 of the said Act. Section 30(1) of the said Act stipulates that use of a registered trade mark is not prevented if the purpose is of identifying goods or services as that of the proprietor and such use should be: a) in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial matters and is not such as to take unfair advantage of or be detrimental to the distinctive character or repute of the trade mark. Section 30(2)(a) of the said Act provides an exception where the user is in relation to goods or services inter alia for its intended purpose. Another exception is Section 30(2)(d) of the said Act which permits the use of a trade mark where it is accessory to other goods or services to which the trademark has been used without infringement of the right given by registration if such use is reasonably necessary in order to indicate that the goods or services are so adapted and the purpose and the effect of the use should not be to indicate a connection in the course of trade between any person and the goods or services.\n",
        "p_137": "59. It is the aforesaid principles which have been kept in mind by the Chancery Division in Aktiebolaget Volvo and Anr. v. Heritage (Leicester) Limited's case (supra) and the Court Justice of the European Communities (Third Chamber) in Gillette Co. v. LA-Laboratories Ltd's case (supra).\n",
        "p_138": "60. It is trite to say that a judgment is as good as its facts. The facts of the Aktiebolaget Volvo and Anr. v. Heritage (Leicester)Limited's case (supra) stare one in the face. There was a past association between the plaintiff and the defendant as the defendant was an authorized Volvo dealer. Such dealership was revoked. It is thereafter the defendant started to use the work VOLVO in a similar style to the registered trademark accompanied by the prefix 'independent' and the suffix 'specialist' but both in much smaller lettering. Not only that, past customers of Volvo were also said to be informed accordingly. The object and intent of the defendant was clear that it wanted to indicate a connection with VOLVO and such user could hardly be called as an honest practice in industrial and commercial use. It squarely fell within the parameters of the defendant trying to take unfair advantage of the distinctive character and repute of the trademark VOLVO. Thus the mere use of suffix or prefix would not make any difference. It is in view thereof that the learned Judge had observed that the test of honesty for the purposes of infringement has to be judged by an objective standard and in the given facts of the case, the test would be whether a reasonable motor service provider would think that the use complained of is honest or amounts to an honest practice.\n",
        "p_139": "61. If the aforesaid test is applied to the facts of the present case, it is found that the defendant has its own well established trademark MAYUR and the device of PEACOCK. The defendant has prominently displayed both the trademark and the device on the packaging. The trademark MAYUR has been put prominently in red on the green coloured packaging, both in the front and the back. At the back of the packaging of the defendant's product, there is a sticker prominently displaying that the product is manufactured and marketed by Murugan Enterprises.\n",
        "p_140": "In the front of the packaging of the defendant's product, in a small print, it is written 'Suitable for: Hawkins Pressure Cookers'. The front and back of the packaging of the product of the defendant are being re-produced herein to fully appreciate the visual impact of the packaging.\n",
        "p_141": "62. The aforesaid in my considered view leaves no manner of doubt that no reasonable person or purchaser can ever assume a trade connection between MAYUR brand of gaskets and Hawkins. It is not a case where the defendant is seeking to take advantage of the trademark of the plaintiff or seeking to show any connection therewith. The approach which is apparent from the manner of use of this is only to show the suitability of the product as an ancillary one to be used in the Hawkins pressure cookers. Such a use thus would clearly fall within the exception carved out under Section 30 of the said Act. Further the evidence placed on record shows that the object of use of the trademark is reasonably necessary to indicate the fitness of gasket for the HAWKINS brand of pressure cookers.\n",
        "p_142": "63. The conclusion in Gillette Co. v. LA-Laboratories Ltd's case (supra) is predicated on a packaging, which would create a link in the mind of the consumers between the defendant's products and those of the plaintiff's or at least to give an impression that the defendant was authorised by virtue of a license or for some other reason to use GILLETTE and SENSOR marks. As discussed above, this was not so in the present case. In fact, the trademark of the defendant is what is prominently displayed. The present case is, thus, one where the condition of 'honest use' is satisfied, since one cannot decipher a commercial connection between the plaintiff and the defendant by use of the word HAWKINS by the defendant. It is, thus, not a case where there is dilution of the value of the trademark of the plaintiff by unfair advantage being taken of its distinctive character or repute by the defendant. The use is more in the nature of the intending purpose of the product marketed by the defendant.\n",
        "p_143": "64. There is also force in the contention of the learned Counsel for the defendant that the concept of pressure cookers with inside fitting lid and pressure cookers with outside fitting lid and there being two kinds of gaskets was not even forming part of the pleadings and the case set up is thus clearly an afterthought when the affidavits of evidence were being filed. The affidavits of evidence in this behalf, in fact, for the first time, set out this plea of pressure cookers with an outside fitting lid and inside fitting lid seeking to categorize them as such. The plaintiff has no objection if the defendant indicates the fitness of the gasket for the complete line of pressure cookers with inside fitting lid categories like Hawkins but objects to the use of Hawkins alone. The defendant in the affidavit has emphasized that the gaskets manufactured by them are specifically made for them to be fitted in the Hawkins pressure cookers. The plaintiff also manufactures all kinds of ancillary products including gaskets. The object of filing of the suit thus appears to be to create a monopoly over such ancillary items so that no third party is able to sell the same in the market. This course of action is not permissible as it is really not in dispute that the defendant can carry out an ancillary industry of manufacturing such gaskets.\n",
        "p_144": "65. I am thus of the considered view that the issue has to be answered against the plaintiff as the defendant is not using the trademark Hawkins.\n",
        "p_145": "Issue No. 3:\n",
        "p_146": "If issue No. 2 is answered in favor of the plaintiff : Whether the defendant is infringing the trademark 'Hawkins' of the plaintiff? OPP (66)This issue is predicated on a finding to be arrived on the previous issue and only if the defendant is using the mark Hawkins as a trademark, the question would arise whether the defendant is infringing the trademark. Since the use of the defendant is only indicative of its purpose and is not being used as a trademark, there can be no question of the defendant infringing the trademark of the plaintiff. The issue is accordingly answered against the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_147": "Issue No. 4:\n",
        "p_148": "If issue No. 2 is answered in favor of the plaintiff : Whether the defendant is passing of its goods as that of the plaintiff? OPP\n \n\n",
        "p_149": "67. Once again the defendant passing off its goods as that of the plaintiff would not arise in the present case in view of the fact that the defendant is not using the trademark of the plaintiff nor is it infringing the trademark. The mode and manner of use shows only the purpose of user and there is no indication of any business connections between the two. The prominent display of the own trademark of the defendant along with prominent display of the address of its manufacturers as against the same is indication of the suitability of the gaskets for Hawkins pressure cookers and leaves no manner of doubt that the present case is not one of passing off by the defendant of its goods as that of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_150": "68. The issue is answered against the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_151": "Issue No. 5:\n",

Lokesh Srivastava and Anr. 2005 (30) PTC 3 (Delhi) and Hero Honda Motors Ltd. v. Shree Assuramji Scooters 2006 (32) PTC 117 (Delhi). However, the question of damages would arise if there is any infringement by the defendant and thus it is not necessary to go into the aspect of quantification of damages since there is no infringement by the defendant. The evidence filed by the plaintiff also does not establish any case for any damages other than the plea of general damages which may be awarded in case of infringement of trademark of copyright.\n",

        "p_3": "1. The plaintiff has filed a suit for permanent injunction for infringement of trademark, copyright, passing off, delivery up, rendition of accounts, damages, etc. against the defendant. The plaintiff is a limited company incorporated and registered under the Companies Act, 1956 and is a Joint Venture incorporated on 19.01.1984 whereby 26% of the equity is held by the Indian Group being the Hero Group and 26% by the Honda Motors Company of Japan, while the remaining equity is stated to be widely spread. The plaintiff is involved in the business of manufacture and sale of motorcycles under the trademark HERO HONDA since 09.04.1985. It is stated that apart from the said business, the plaintiff is also engaged in the manufacture of sale of readymade garments, hosiery, gloves, etc.\n \n\n",
        "p_4": "2. The Joint Venture Group is stated to be mainly dealing with the manufacture of cycle and cycle parts and the Japanese Joint Venture partner, Honda Motor Co. Ltd. is an internationally renowned name and trademark HONDA. The Joint Venture, thus, adopted the trademark HERO HONDA to reflect the goodwill of the business of both the two Joint Venture Groups as an arbitrarily coined trademark.\n",
        "p_5": "3. The plaintiff has set out the sales figures in para 5 of the plaint as under:-\n",
        "p_6": "  ------------------------------------------------------------\n",
        "p_7": "5. The plaintiff claims that by adoption of long and extensive user goods bearing the trademark HERO HONDA are exclusively associated with the products originating from the plaintiff. Apart from the Common Law Rights, the plaintiff is also the registered proprietor of the following marks:-\n",
        "p_8": " ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
        "p_9": "6. The plaintiff has adopted a logo to represent its products consisting of three parallel lines at the base surmounted by a semi-circle, which is surmounted by a crown like structure. This logo was created by M/s. Shobhagya Advertisiing Services on behalf of the plaintiff and is, thus, claimed to be the original artistic work of the plaintiff within the meaning of Section 2(c) of The Copyright Act, 1957. The packaging of spare parts was created by M/s. Mansa Packagers Pvt. Ltd., which is an artistic work owned by the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_10": "7. The plaintiff came to know that there were several unscrupulous traders manufacturing motorcycle parts and other items bearing the plaintiff trademark HERO HONDA and the logo with the result that there was not only loss of profit, but the brand equity of the plaintiff was affected on account of inferior quality of the product sold in the market by such traders. The public was also stated to be, thus, a direct sufferer of the same. The defendant is stated to be one such trader. The plaintiff purchased the product of the defendant and found that apart from infringing the logo and the mark of the plaintiff, the product was of poor quality in finish and packaging. Thus, the defendant was counterfeiting the product of the plaintiff and selling the goods as that of the plaintiff. There was also violation of the registered trademark of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_11": "8. At the stage of filing of the suit, interim orders were granted and Local Commissioner was also appointed to seize the goods in question. The goods were Page 2505 taken possession of and then released on superdari to the defendant. The defendant, however, did not put in appearance and was proceeded ex parte. The plaintiff has filed the affidavit of ex parte evidence of Shri Sanjay Mittal, the constituted Attorney of the plaintiff. The witness has proved the certified copy of the Board Resolution of the plaintiff along with the Power of Attorney as Exhibit P-1, which authorised institution of the suit. The sample invoices of the plaintiff have been proved as Exhibit P-2 and the advertisements of the plaintiff as Exhibit P-3. The Certificate of Registration of the two trademarks referred to above have been proved as Exhibit P-4 and Exhibit P-5. The plaintiff has proved as Exhibit P-6 the assignment made by M/s. Shobhagya Advertisiing Services in respect of the logo and as Exhibit P-7 the assignment in respect of the the packaging by M/s. Mansa Packagers Pvt. Ltd. The plaintiff has relied on the affidavit of one Shri Rajiv Manchanda filed in the proceedings showing the cash memo of purchase of the defendant as well as the photographs of the product of the defendant. The said affidavit has been exhibited as Exhibit P-8 while the photographs of the product and packaging are exhibited as Exhibit P-9.\n",
        "p_12": "9. The aforesaid facts and circumstances show that the plaintiff has the exclusive right to use their trademark HERO HONDA and the logo as also the packaging material in question. The defendant is attempting to counterfeit the products of the plaintiff and pass off its goods as that of the plaintiff. This not only causes loss of profits to the plaintiff, but results in inferior products made available to the public at large who are deceived by the conduct of the defendant.\n",
        "p_13": "10. In view of the aforesaid, the plaintiff is entitled to a decree of permanent injunction against the defendant from dealing with the goods having infringing mark in terms of prayers (a) to (c) of para 18 of the prayer clause.\n",
        "p_14": "11. Insofar as the prayer (d) is concerned, the seized goods were released on superdari by the Local Commissioner to the defendant and the said goods are liable to be destroyed. The plaintiff is, thus, entitled to a decree of delivery up of all the infringing products so that the same can be destroyed.\n",
        "p_15": "12. The last aspect to be considered is the issue of damages for loss of reputation and business as also the cost of the present proceedings.\n",
        "p_16": "13. Insofar as the issue of damages is concerned, learned counsel for the plaintiff submits that even in the absence of specific evidence to the same effect, such damages can be granted.\n",
        "p_17": "14. It is trite to say that the defendant has deliberately stayed away from the present proceedings with the result that an enquiry into the accounts of the defendant for determination of damages cannot take place. However, the infringement of the trademark of the plaintiff as also its logo is not in dispute. The plaintiff has claimed token damages and compensation of Rs. 5 lakhs as it was not possible to determine the exact nature of damages at the stage of filing of the suit. The attention of this Court has been drawn to a number of judgments in this behalf where dealing with similar situations, damages have been awarded.\n",
        "p_18": "15. In Relaxo Rubber Limited and Anr. v. Selection Footwear and Anr., 1999 PTC 578, the defendant did not file the written statement after taking time for the same and a decree was passed under Order VIII Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Against the claim of tentative damages of Rs. 5 lakhs, Rs. 3 lakhs Page 2506 was awarded as damages. Similarly in Hindustan Machines v. Royal Electrical Applies, 1999 PTC (19) 685, a sum of Rs. 3 lakhs was awarded. In the recent judgments, this Court in CS (OS) No. 2711/1999 titled 'L.T. Overseas Ltd. v. Guruji Trading Co. and Anr.' decided on 07.09.2005 had granted Rs. 3 lakhs damages in a similar case. In the present case, punitive damages have not been specifically claimed.\n",
        "p_19": "16. Learned counsel for the plaintiff has, however, drawn the attention of this Court to the judgment of this Court in Time Incorporated v. Lokesh Srivastava and Anr., 2005 (30) PTC 3 (Del) where apart from compensatory damages of Rs. 5 lakhs, punitive damages have also been awarded. It would be useful to reproduce paras 7 and 8 of the said judgment, which are as under:-\n",
        "p_20": "\"7. Coming to the claim of Rs. 5 lacs as punitive and exemplary damages for the flagrant infringement of the plaintiff's trade mark, this Court is of the considered view that a distinction has to be drawn between compensatory damages and punitive damages. The award of compensatory damages to a plaintiff is aimed at compensating him for the loss suffered by him whereas punitive damages are aimed at deterring a wrong doer and the like minded from indulging in such unlawful activities. Whenever an action has criminal propensity also the punitive damages are clearly called for so that the tendency to violate the laws and infringe the rights of others with a view to make money is curbed. The punitive damages are founded on the philosophy of corrective justice and as such, in appropriate cases these must be awarded to give a signal to the wrong doers that law does not take a breach merely as a matter between rival parties but feels concerned about those also who are not party to the lis but suffer on account of the breach. In the case in hand itself, it is not only the plaintiff, who has suffered on account of the infringement of its trade mark and Magazine design but a large number of readers of the defendants' Magazine 'TIME ASIA SANSKARAN' also have suffered by purchasing the defendants' Magazines under an impression that the same are from teh reputed publishing house of the plaintiff company.\n",
        "p_21": "8. This Court has no hesitation in saying that the time has come when the Courts dealing actions for infringement of trade marks, copy rights, patents, etc. should not only grant compensatory damages but award punitive damages also with a view to discourage and dishearten law breakers who indulge in violations with impunity out of lust for money so that they realize that in case they are caught, they would be liable not only to reimburse the aggrieved party but would be liable to pay punitive damages also, which may spell financial disaster for them. In Mathias v. Accor Economi Lodging, Inc., 347 F.3d 672 (7th Cir. 2003) the factors underlying the grant of punitive damages were discussed and it was observed that one function of punitive damages is to relieve the pressure on an overloaded system of criminal justice by providing a civil alternative to criminal prosecution of minor crimes. It was further observed that the award of punitive damages serves the additional purpose of limiting the defendant's ability to profit from its fraud by escaping detection and prosecution. If a tortfeasor is caught only half the time he commits torts, then when he is caught he should be punished twice as heavily in order to Page 2507 make up for the reason that it is very difficult for a plaintiff to give proof of actual damages suffered by him as the defendants who indulge in such activities never maintain proper accounts of their transactions who they know that the same are objectionable and unlawful. In the present case, the claim of punitive damages is of Rs. 5 lacs only which can be safely awarded. Had it been higher even this court would not have hesitated in awarding the same. The Court is of the view that the punitive damages should be really punitive and not flee bite and quantum thereof should depend upon the flagrancy of infringement.\"\n",
        "p_22": "17. Learned counsel for the plaintiff states that damages have been claimed in the present suit, though it is not specified separately as to the nature of damages. Learned counsel further states that in any case the plaintiff should be entitled to at least the damages of Rs. 5 lakhs.\n",
        "p_23": "18. I am in agreement with the aforesaid submission of learned counsel for the plaintiff that damages in such cases must be awarded and a defendant, who chooses to stay away from the proceedings of the Court, should not be permitted to enjoy the benefits of evasion of court proceedings. Any view to the contrary would result in a situation where the defendant who appears in Court and submits its account books would be liable for damages, while a party which chooses to stay away from court proceedings would escape the liability on account failure of the availability of account books. A party who chooses to not participate in court proceedings and stay away must, thus, suffer the consequences of damages as stated and set out by the plaintiff. Of course, this would not imply that the plaintiff would be entitled to any figure quoted by it which may be astronomical. The figure of Rs. 5 lakhs as damages can hardly be said to be astronomical keeping in mind the nature of deception alleged by the plaintiff which not only causes direct loss to the plaintiff, but also affects the reputation of the plaintiff by selling sub-standard goods in the market where the public may be deceived in buying the goods thinking the same to be that of the plaintiff. There is a larger public purpose involved to discourage such parties from indulging in such acts of deception and, thus, even if the same has a punitive element, it must be granted. R.C. Chopra, J. has very succinctly set out in Time Incorporated's case (supra) that punitive damages are founded on the philosophy of corrective justice. That was the case where the publishers of Time Magazine had come to Court and one of the factors which weighed while awarding punitive damages was that the readers had been sufferers of the infringement of the mark of the plaintiff. The only difference is that in the present case it is the consumer of the products of the plaintiff, who have suffered as a consequence of the infringement of the mark and logo of the plaintiff by the defendant.\n",
        "p_24": "19. The second aspect emphasized in Times Incorporated's case (supra) has also material bearing as the object is to relieve the pressure on over-loaded system of criminal justice by providing civil alternative to criminal prosecution of minor crimes. The defendant could have been prosecuted for such counterfeiting, but the plaintiff has considered appropriate to confine the relief to civil proceedings.\n",
        "p_25": "20. Learned counsel for the plaintiff also rightly points out that instead of the plaintiff utilising its energy for expansion of its business and sale of its Page 2508 products, the resources have to be spread over a number of such litigations to bring to book the offending traders in the market. In such a case, both compensatory and punitive damages ought to be granted apart from the costs incurred by the plaintiff in such litigation.\n",
        "p_26": "21. In view of the aforesaid position, a decree for permanent injunction is passed in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant restraining the defendant from selling motorcycle parts bearing the trademark HERO HONDA with or without the logo or any other trademark deceptively similar to the plaintiff's mark HERO HONDA and logo as also selling such goods in the packaging identical or deceptively similar to that of the plaintiff. A decree is also passed in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant for the defendant to hand over the seized goods released by the Local Commissioner on superdari to the defendant so that the same can be destroyed by the plaintiff. A decree of damages is also passed in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant for a sum of Rs. 5 lakhs. The plaintiff shall also be entitled to costs of the present proceedings.\n",
        "p_27": "22. Decree-sheet be drawn up accordingly.\n",
        "p_28": "23. It is, however, observed on a perusal of the plaint that the suit is deficiently stamped in view of judgment of this Court in CS(OS) No. 1165/2001 titled 'Pfizer Products, Inc. v. B.L. & Co. and Ors.' decided on 03.10.2005. Learned counsel for the plaintiff states that he will file the deficient court fee within a week. Decree-sheet be drawn up only on such court fee being paid.\n"

Section 3 em-powers the Central\nGovernment to make provisions by order published in the official gazette\nfor prohibiting, restricting or otherwise controlling the import into and\nexport of the goods. from the country. The expression licence\" is defined\nin clause: (i) of Section 2 to mean a licence granted, including a customs\nclearance permit issued; under any control order, Pursuant to Section 3:\nand Section 4(a) of the said Act, the Central Government issued the Imports\n(Control) Order, 1955. Clause (3)(i) of the Order provides that \"save as\notherwise provided in this Order, no person shall import any goods of the\ndescription specified in Schedule I except under and in accordance with a\nlicence of a customs clearance permit granted by the Central Government or\nby any Officer specified in Schedule II.

The Central Government has been issuing, from time to time, what is\nSailed the Import and Export Policy; published in the form of a brochure.\nThe Import Policy in vogue during the years concerned herein provided for\nissuance Of what is called replenishment licences\" (for short \"R.E..P.\nLicences\"). The objective behind the licences was to provide to the\nregistered exporters the facility of importing the essential inputs\nrequired for the manufacture of the products exported. The essential idea\nwas to encourage exports and for that purpose import licences called R.E.P.\nLicences were issued equal to the prescribed percentage of the value of\nexports. These licences were made freely transferable. It was provided that\nthe transfer such licences did not require any endorsement or permission\nfrom the licencing authority. It was clarified that such would be:\n\"governed by the ordinary law\". It only required a letter from the\ntransferor recording. and evidencing the transfer. On that basis, the\ntransferee; became the due and lawful holder of the licence: and could\neither import the goods per-mitted thereunder or sell it to another in\nturn.\n",
        "p_4": "4. With effect from July 3, 1991, the name of the licence was .changed to\nExim Scrip (Export -Import Licence): The provisions governing the Exim\nScrip were broadly the same as those governing the R.E.P. Licence with\ncertain minor variations, which are not relevant for our purposes.\n",
        "p_5": "5.  Several registered exporters who obtained R.E.P. licence/Exim Scrips'\nsold them to others for profit. In fact, these licences/Exim Scrips were\nbeing traded freely in the market and on stock exchanges. The sales tax\nauthorities of certain States proceeded to subject such sales to sales tax\nunder their respective enactments. The assessees immediately protested\ncontending that these licences/Exim Scrips do not constitute ''goods\"\nwithin the meaning of the relevant .sales tax enactments. and, therefore,\nnot' exigible to tax. The matter came up for consideration in the first\ninstance before a learned Single- Judge of the Karnataka High Court in\nBharat  Fritz Werner Ltd. v. Commissioner of Commercial Taxes ,(1992) 86\nS;T.C. 170. It. was a writ petition challenging the validity of a circular\nissued by the Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, Karnataka, stating that\nwhenever an Import licence is transferred, it attracts tax Under Section\n5(1) of the Karnataka Sales. Tax Act, 1957 as unclassified goods at the\nrate of seven percent and directing the: assessing authorities and other\nconcerned authorities to levy tax accordingly. The learned Judge considered\nthe definition of \"goods' in. Section 2(m) of the: Karnataka: Act and held\nFollowing Anraj that having: regard to the nature and character of the said\nlicences .and their free. transferability, they .constitute goods, the sale\nwhereof is subject sales tax. The learned judge rejected the. argument.\nthat the said licences :are in the nature .of actionable claims. He held\nthe import licence not merely enables a person: the: right of indulging in\na business of importing goods but it also. excludes competition. There\nfore, it cannot be said. that it is only a beneficial interest' in respect\nof a movable property not in possession of the person but is itself a\nValuable right which. according to the petitioners themselves. is freely\ntransferable The import, licence therefore must be treated as merchandise\nfor the purposes of the Act and clearly falls within the definition of\n'goods'\". The learned: Judge further held that the right under this licence\nis infact , more concrete and. substantial than the right under a lottery\nticket considered in Anraj. On appeal, a Division Bench of the Karnataka,\nHigh Court affirmed the judgment of the learned Single Judge. The Division\nBench too felted upon the ratio of Anraj and dismissed the appeal in the\nfollowing words :\n",
        "p_6": "\"In, the instant .case, the transfer of R.E.P. Licences confer upon the.\ntransferee the immediate right to clear. goods covered by the licences at\nthe Customs barrier. This is .not an inchoate of incomplete right it cannot\nbe held to materialise in future because its exercise is dependent upon the\ntransferee buying goods covered by. the licence and bringing them to Indian\nshores. Nor can R.E.P. licences be held to be actionable claims .because\nthe Customs authorities might not clear the goods and the: transferee would\nhave to commence an action against them: in a Court of Law. In our view.\nthe transfer of an R.E.P. licence confers upon the transferee. a right\nwhich is choate and perfected and exercisable immediately he presents 16\nthe.

In other\nwords, these licences/'Exim Scrips have an inherent value of their own and\nare traded as such. They are treated and dealt with in the commercial world\nas merchandise, as goods. A REP Licence/Exim Scrip is neither a chose-in-\naction nor an actionable -claim. It is also not in the nature of a title\ndeed. It has a value of its own.

The contention of the State was that they were goods and,\ntherefore, attract the sales tax on their sale. According to assessees, the\nlottery tickets were in the nature of actionable claims but not goods. They\nquestioned the legislative competence of the State Legislatures to levy\nsales tax on their sale. They contended that the expression \"sale of goods\"\nhas to be construed in the sense in which it is used in the Sale of Goods\nAct, as has been held by this Court in Gannon Dunkerley. They submitted\nthat the definition of \"goods\" in Sale of Goods Act excludes from\n\nits purview actionable claims and that the essence of the lottery being\nmerely a chance for a prize for a price, it does not constitute goods but a\nmere actionable claim. It was argued that the lottery ticket is a mere slip\nof paper or a memorandum evidencing the right of the holder thereof to\nclaim or receive a prize if successful in the draw.\n",
        "p_51": "25-A. The arguments of the assessees were rejected by this Court. The Court\nreferred to the definition of \"goods\" and \"sale\" in both the aforesaid\nenactments, the definition of \"goods\" in Article 366(12) and the definition\nof \"tax on the sale or purchase of goods\" in Article 366(29A). It referred\nto the meaning of the expression \"lottery ticket in law dictionaries and\ndecided cases ;it referred to the definition of ''movable property\" in the\nGeneral Clauses Act, .1897 and the definition of the expression 'actionable\nclaims\" in Section 3 of the Transfer of Property Act and observed\n(Tulzapurkar , J., speaking for the Bench comprising himself and Sabyasachi\nMukherji, J.).\n",
        "p_52": "\"If incorporeal right like copyright or an intangible  thing like electric\nenergy can be regarded as goods eligible to sales tax there is no reason\nwhy the entitlement to  right to a participate in a draw which is\nbeneficial interest in movable property of incorporeal or intangible\ncharacter should not be regarded as goods for the purpose ;of levying-sales\ntax. As stated above lottery tickets which comprise such entitlement do\nconstitute a stock-in-trade of every dealer and therefore is merchandise\nwhich can be bought and sold 'in the market Lottery tickets comprising such\nentitlement, therefore, would fall within the definition. of goods given in\nthe Tamil Nadu Act and the Bengal Act.\n",
        "p_53": "In the light of the aforesaid discussion my conclusions .are that lottery\ntickets to the extent that they comprise the entitlement to participate in\nthe draw are goods properly so-called, squarely falling within the\ndefinition of that expression as given in the Tamil Nadu Act, 1959 and the\nBengal Act, 1941, that to that extent they are not actionable claims and\nthat in every sale there of a transfer of property in the goods is\ninvolved\"'\n\nWith respect to the nature and content of the lottery: ticket, the learned\nJudge observed that it confers upon the holder thereof \"the right to\nparticipate (in the draw) and: the right to claim a prize if\nsuccessful.....In other words lottery tickets not as physical articles but\nas slips of paper or memoranda evidencing the right to participate in the\ndraw must in a sense be regarded as the dealer's merchandise and, there\nfore goods capable of being bought or sold in the market. They: can also\nchange from hand to hand as goods.''\n\nWe are of the opinion that .the ratio of the said decision fully supports\nthe contention of the States here in As rightly pointed out by the\nKarnataka. High Court the content of R.E.P. Licence/Exim Scrip is far more\nsubstantial and real than that of a lottery ticket, If lottery tickets are\ngoods there is no reason why these licences/scrips are not goods, We see no\nsubstance in the argument based upon the decision in Gannon Dunkerley. On\nthe basis of this decision, it is contended that the expression \"goods\" and\n\"sale of food\" must be Under stood in the sense they are used in the Sale\nof Goods Act. We need not quarrel with this proposition. We have not only\nreferred herein before the definition of \"goods\" and \"property\" in the Sale\nof Goods Act but have also pointed out that in material particulars it is\nsimilar to the definition of \"goods\" in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala\nSales Tax Acts, All of them uniformly say \"goods\" mean \"every kind of\nmovable property\" (Sale of Goods Act) and \"all kinds of movable property\"\n(Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala Acts). As a matter of fact, this\nsubmission was made but not pursued by any of the counsel for the\npetitioners.\n",
        "p_54": "26. We are also of the opinion that these licences/scrips cannot be\ntreated as actionable claims. \"Actionable claims\" is defined in Section: 3\nof the Transfer of Property Act in the following Words\n\n'\"Actionable claim means a claim to any debt; other than a debt secured by\nmortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of movable\nproperty, or to any beneficial interest in movable property not in the\npossession, either actual or construc-tive of the claimant, which the Civil\nCourts recognise as affording grounds for relief, whether such debt or\nbeneficial interest be existent accruing, conditional or contingent\"\n",
        "p_55": "When these licences/scrips are being bought and sold freely in the market\nas goods and when then have a value of their, own unrelated to the goods\nwhich can .be imported thereunder, it is idle to contend that they are in\nthe nature of actionable claims. Indeed, in Anraj, the main contention of\nthe petitioners was that a lottery ticket was in the nature of an\nactionable claim. The said argument was rejected after an elaborate\ndiscussion of law on the subject, We agree with the said decision and on\nthat basis hold that the R.E.P. Licences/Exim Scrips are not in the nature\nof actionable claims.\n",
        "p_56": "Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the licence is something\nless than property, because the licencing authority can always cancel .it,\nin which event, it becomes a mere scrap of paper. That feature, in our\nopinion, has no relevance on the question at issue ,Cancellation can be\neffected by the appropriate authority in accordance with the :procedure\nprescribed by law and on proof of permissible grounds. We are unable to see\nhow the said factor detracts from the inherent value of these licences. Far\nthat matter, many a grant is subject to such a condition That circumstance\nis in no way affects the content of the grant. The further contention that\nthe licence/Scrip merely gives of right to import certain goods, that in\nCase; the licence is lost, one can always obtain a copy from the authority\nand, there fore, the licence has-no value of its own is .equally\nunacceptable We have already pointed out how the commercial world treats\nthese licences and trades in them.

Applying the rule of pith and\nsubstance, it must be held that the enactments in question are referable to\nEntry 54 in List-II and :not to Entry 41 in List-L By no stretch of\nimagination can they be related to entry 41 in List-I. The State\nLegislatures are not seeking to: make a law with respect to customs duties.\nThey are seeking only to levy tax upon. the sale of goods. The test to be.\napplied in this behalf has been authoritatively stated by the Constitution\nBench of this Court in A.S. Krishnan v. State of Madras, [1957] S.C.R. 399.\n",

Mohan\nis that even if the said licences/scrips are treated as goods, the tax must\nbe levied at the first point of sale, viz ,, upon the authority issuing the\nlicence. We cannot agree. The grant of licence by the licencing authority\nto the registered exporter is not a sale. The sale is when the registered\nexporter or the purchaser Sells it to another person for consideration.\n",

She argues that there is no force in the\nsubmission of the defendants that there is an extensive use\nof the word \"PANTO\" in common by various third parties in\nmedicinal trade. It is submitted by her that mere printouts of\nsearch results of the Trade Mark Registry does not by itself\nestablish that the word PANTO has              become publici juris or\ngeneric.      Mere presence in the database of Trade Marks\nRegistry of the mark as either pending or registered does not\nmake a mark publici juris.            Further,     it is most humbly\nsubmitted that defendant No.1 has itself applied before the\nTrade Marks Registry            for registration of the trademark\n\"PANTOBLOC\" and now defendants cannot claim that word\n\"PANTO\" has become \"publici juris\" or generic and that\nnobody is entitled to claim exclusive rights over the same.\nShe submits that none of decisions delivered by the Supreme\nCourt has been discussed by this case on the points raised by\nthe plaintiff in the present case.

In para 18, a reference to the defendant\u201fs\nwebsite www.aureatehealthcare.com was given.

The documents filed by the defendants also\nreveal that the defendants do not have any drug approval for\nmanufacturing this product.

The reason given by Mr. Mangla, learned counsel\nappearing on behalf of the defendant, is that the expression\n\u201ePANTO\u201f is a generic term which has been derived from the\nname of chemical salt PANTOPRAZOLE.             As far as suffix\ncomponents of both the marks i.e. DAC and BLOC are\nconcerned, the same are totally different. Thus the question of\ninfringement of trade mark does not arise.\n",

The plaintiff has been carrying on his business of manufacturing and marketing of hardware goods under the name and style of M/s. Acme Industries. It is stated that during the year 1979 the plaintiff bonafide and honestly adopted and conceived the trade mark Flora in relation to his aforesaid goods. The plaintiff states that the said mark is being used by him since then openly, continuously, exclusively and extensively. In the same year the plaintiff also honestly devised the label/wrapper/ carton entitled Flora in a attractive lettering style to which the plaintiff is the first adopter, originator and author. It is stated that on account of continuous, regular & extensive use of the said trade mark Flora in relation to hardware goods of the plaintiff the said trade mark has come to be associated with the name of the plaintiff. The plaintiff has also applied for the registration of the said trade mark Flora in the Trade Marks Registry under the provisions of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958, which application is pending. The petitioner has also made large scale publicity in respect of the aforesaid trade mark Flora of the plaintiff in view of which the said trade mark has acquired secondary meaning coming to be exclusively identified and recognised with the plaintiff. It is stated that the plaintiff received a legal notice dated 10.6.1996 served upon him by the defendant through its Counsel, that the defendant is a registered proprietor and owner of the said trade mark Flora in respect of hardwares on account of its adoption by it during the year 1987. By the aforesaid notice the plaintiff was asked to stop its user. In view of the aforesaid legal notice received from the defendant and also in view of the fact that the registration of the aforesaid trade mark has been obtained by the defendant behind the back of the plaintiff and through suppression of facts and also in view of the fact that the defendant has dishonestly and mala fide pirated the trade mark/label/wrapper with trade mark Flora of the plaintiff the present suit has been instituted by the plaintiff. \n",
        "p_3": "(2) It has also been brought to the notice of this Court that the plaintiff has filed an application for rectification of the registration of the trade mark granted in favour of the defendant and the said application was filed on 21.6.1996 which is pending disposal. Alongwith the aforesaid suit the plaintiff also filed an application under Order 39 Rules 1 & 2, Civil Procedure Code which was registered as I.A.No. 6641/1996, seeking for temporary in junction restraining the defendants from using the aforesaid trade mark in relation to hardware goods during the pendency of the suit. \n",
        "p_4": "(3) Summons and notices of the suit as also of the in junction application having been issued, the defendant filed the written statement as also reply to the application under Order 39 Rules 1 & 2, CPC. The defendant also filed counter claim against the plaintiff in the present suit. Besides the defendant also filed an application under Order 39 Rules 1 & 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure praying for a temporary in junction restraining the plaintiff from manufacturing, selling, offering for sale, and/or directly or indirectly dealing with hardware goods under the trade mark Flora or any other trade mark identical with or deceptively similar to the trade mark Flora of the defendant. The said application was registered as I.A.No. 8765/ 1996. Reply to the said application has also been filed by the plaintiff. \n",
        "p_5": "(4) The defendant's case as disclosed from the written statement and reply as also from the application filed under Order 39 Rules 1 & 2, Civil Procedure Code is that the defendant has been continuously using the trade mark Flora since 29.10.1987 and that the defendant is the registered proprietor of the said mark being registered on 29.10.1987. The further defense of the defendant is that the invoices and documentary evidence filed by the plaintiff are false and fabricated. The defendant further pleaded that the present proceedings initiated by the plaintiff are liable to be dismissed on the ground of laches and unexplained delay. \n",
        "p_6": "(5) I have heard the learned Counsel appearing for the parties on the issue as to whether the plaintiff is entitled to grant of a temporary in junction as prayed for in the suit or whether the defendant is entitled to grant of such an in junction, it being the registered proprietor of the trade mark Flora in respect of the hardware goods against the plaintiff as prayed for in its application. \n",
        "p_7": "(6) The learned Counsel appearing for the parties advanced their arguments at length and I propose to dispose of both the applications (I.A.No. 6641/1996 filed by the plaintiff and I.A.No. 8765/1996 filed by the defendant) under Order 39 Rules 1 & 2, Civil Procedure Code respectively by this common order. \n",
        "p_8": "(7) For the purpose of adjudicating the issues posed before me it would be necessary to deal with the main questions which arise for my prima facie determination,    (I)whether the plaintiff not being a registered proprietor of trade mark Flora in respect of hardware goods can maintain an action for passing off against the defendant in respect of the use of the same which has been registered in its favour in respect of the said goods; (ii) whether the present application filed by the plaintiff seeking for temporary in junction is liable to be dismissed on the ground of unexplained delay on the part of the plaintiff in approaching this Court, in view of the fact that the defendant was registered as proprietor of the trade mark Flora in respect of hardware goods in 1987, whereas the present suit was instituted only in 1996.   \n",
        "p_9": "(8) Under Section 28(1) of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act (hereinafter called the Act) registration of a trade mark gives to the registered proprietor thereof exclusive right to use the same in relation to the goods in respect of which it has been registered. Accordingly, in the present case in terms of the aforesaid provision the defendant being the registered proprietor of the trade mark Flora in respect of hardware goods could claim to have the exclusive right to use the same in relation to hardware goods in respect of which it is registered. But when the opening words of Section 28(1) are noticed which opens with the expression \"subject to other provisions\" it is crystal clear that the aforesaid right conferred on a registered proprietor is not an absolute right as the same is made subject to other provisions of the Act. The aforesaid view is fortified by the provisions of Section 27(2) of the Act which provides that \"nothing in this Act shall be deemed to affect rights of action against any person for passing off goods as the goods of another person or the remedies in respect thereof\". Accordingly, it is manifestly clear that Section 28 of the Act and other provisions come within the over-riding effect of Section 27(2) of the Act. Similarly, the provisions of Section 33 of the Act also saves vested right of a prior user when it lays down that \"nothing in the Act shall entitle the proprietor or a registered user of a registered trade mark to interfere with or restrain the use by any person of a trade mark identical with or nearly resembling it in relation to goods in relation to which that person or a predecessor in title of his has continuously used that trade mark from a prior date\".    THUS a conjoint reading of the aforesaid provisions persuaded me to conclude on a reading of the aforesaid provisions conjointly the natural deduction is that the right conferred by Section 28(1) of the Act in favour of a registered proprietor of a trade mark is not an absolute right but is subject to the other provisions of the Act namely - Sections 27(2) and 33. It is also to be noted that neither Section 28 nor any other provision of the Act prohibits an action for passing off by an anterior user of a trade mark against a registered user of the same. In other words registration of a trade mark does not provide a defense to the proceedings for passing off as provided for under Section 27(2) of the Act. A prior user of a trade mark is entitled to maintain an action against a subsequent user of identical trade mark including registered user thereof.   \n",
        "p_10": "(9) In N.R.Dongre v. Whirlpool Corporation; , a Division Bench of this Court held that registration of a trade mark under the Act would be irrelevant in an action for passing off. It was further held that the registration of a trade mark in fact does not confer any new right on the proprietor thereof than what already existed at common law without registration of the mark. In the aforesaid decision the Division Bench noticed and relied upon, on the Division Bench decision of this Court in Century Traders v. Roshan Lal Duggar & Co. . In the said decision of this Court (Century Traders) while construing Sections 27(2) and 106 of the Act it was held as follows ;    \"FROM a reading of the above sections it is clear that registration of mark in the trade mark registry would be irrelevant in an action for passing off. Thus, the law is pretty well settled that in order to succeed at this stage the appellant had to establish user of the aforesaid mark prior in point of time than the impugned user by the respondents. The registration of the said mark or similar mark prior in point of time to user by the appellant is irrelevant in an action for passing off and the mere presence of the mark in the register maintained by the Trade Mark Registry did not prove its user by the persons in whose names the mark was registered and was irrelevant for the purposes of deciding the application for interim in junction unless evidence had been led or was available of user of the registered trade marks. In our opinion, these clear rules of law were not kept in view by the learned Single Judge and led him to commit an error\".   \n",
        "p_11": "(10) It is also to be noted that the Special Leave Petition preferred as against the decision of the Division Bench in N.R. Dongre's case (supra) was heard by the Supreme Court and was dismissed by a speaking order upholding the decision of the Division Bench of this Court (See 1996 Ptc (16) 583 (SC); N.R. Dongre v. Whirlpool Corporation). \n",
        "p_12": "(11) In the decision of the Bombay High Court in Consolidated Foods Corporation v. Brandon & Co. Pvt. Ltd. , it was held that registration under the statute does not confer any new right to the mark claimed or any greater right than what already existed in common law and at equity without registration. It was further held that registration itself does not create a trade mark and that the trade mark exists independently of the registration which merely affords further protection under the Statute. The Bombay High Court further went on to hold that common law rights are left wholly unaffected and that priority in adoption and use of a trade mark is superior to priority in registration. \n",
        "p_13": "(12) Reference may also be made to a Single Bench decision of this Court in M/s. L.D. Malhotra Industries v. M/s. Ropi Industries; reported in Ilr 1976(1) Delhi page 278. The aforesaid decision in M/s. L.D. Malhotra's case (supra) was noticed in the decision of Division Bench of this Court in Century Traders' case (supra). In N.R. Dongre (supra) the Division Bench of this Court, after noticing the aforesaid judgments, held that under Section 27(2) an action for passing off against a registered user of trade mark is maintainable at the instance of a prior user of the same, similar or identical mark and since such a remedy is available against the registered user of trade mark, an interim in junction restraining him to use the mark can also be granted to make the remedy effective. \n",
        "p_14": "(13) In Imperial Group Limited v. Philip Morris & Co. Ltd., reported in Fleet Street Reports (1982) page 72, Lawton L.J. held that the use of the mark Merit was limited in size, time and area and that it was not accompanied, nor did the plaintiffs want it to be, by what they call \"Press Support\" and the advertising was small in amount and that compared with the ordinary way in which the plaintiffs marketed new brands of cigarettes, the effort they put into introducing the Merit brand was tiny, but not so tiny as to be de- minimis. The Court considered as to whether such use could be said to be bona fide and while considering that the Court considered the judgment in Electrolux Ltd. v. Electrix Ltd., (1954) 71 Rpc 23 and found that according to the said judgment in that case a bonafide use should be \"ordinary and genuine\", \"perfectly genuine\", \"substantial in amount\", \"a real commercial use on a substantial scale\" and not some \"fictitious or colourable use but a real or genuine use\". In the same judgment Lord Lawton L.J. observed that the plaintiffs never intended to use the mark \"Merit\" in the ordinary course of their business; their use of it was not substantial; it was not a real use in any commercial sense, and that it was a colourable stratagem for making their trade rivals think that they were using the mark \"Merit\" in a way which gave it the protection of the Act. In the same judgment Lord Shaw L.J. observed that unlike copyright, a trade mark does not arise from the mere use of the word or words or a formula or a mark; it derives from the use of words or marks in relation to a course of trade in goods giving rise to a goodwill connecting the trade with the goods by reason of the trade mark under which the goods are marketed. He concluded that where, in relation to particular goods, there is no such course of trading as to give rise to a goodwill, there is no interest to be protected by a trade mark, and no such mark can subsist in vacuo. \n",
        "p_15": "(14) At this stage I may also appropriately refer to another Single Bench Decision of this Court in Jai prakash Gupta v. Vishal Aluminium Mfg. Co., reported in 1996 Ptc (16) page 575=63 (1996) Dlt 947. In para 10 of the said judgment the learned Single Judge held that there is no dispute and can be none with the legal proposition that as between the two parties, who proposed to use a particular trade mark the person who designs the mark will get preference over the other and in case of one party proposing to use the mark against the actual user, the later will take precedence. The learned Single Judge further held that in between the two parties clarifying actual user as against the prior user, the party, who is prior in point of time will have the advantage over the other. The Bench held that even in regard to the prior registration of the trade mark as against the prior user the action of the later will prevail. \n",
        "p_16": "(15) The legal proposition that emerges from all the aforesaid decisions is that the registration is immaterial in a case of passing off and the criteria for granting an in junction is the prior user of the trade mark by the parties. In other words, \"in an action for passing off, in order to succeed in getting an interim in junction the plaintiff has to establish user of the mark prior in point of time than the impugned user by the defendant and that the registration of the mark or similar mark prior in point of time to user of the plaintiff is irrelevant in an action of passing off and the mere presence of the mark in the register maintained by the Trade Mark Registry did not prove its user by the persons in whose names the mark was registered and it is irrelevant for the purposes of deciding the application for interim in junction unless evidence had been led or was available of user of the registered trade mark\". (Jai Prakash Gupta's case (supra). \n",
        "p_17": "(16) In view of the aforesaid legal proposition emerging from the various decisions it is manifestly clear that the registration of the trade mark Flora obtained by the defendant in respect of hardware goods in 1987 would be of little consequence if the plaintiff could establish user of the said mark Flora in respect of the hardware goods prior in point of time than the impugned user by the defendant. It is admitted position as disclosed from the pleadings of the parties that the defendant has been using the trade mark Flora in respect of hardware goods only from the year 1987 whereas it is the specific case of the plaintiff that he has been using the said trade mark in respect of his hardware goods from the year 1979. In support of the aforesaid claim the plaintiff has also produced on record documentary evidence in the nature of carbon copies of bills and invoices. My attention has been drawn to some of the aforesaid bills and invoices filed by the plaintiff in support of his contention that it has been using the trade mark Flora in respect of hardware goods from 1979. The contention of the learned Counsel appearing for the defendant is that some of the carbon copies of the aforesaid bills and invoices are dubious and of doubtful character and that atleast some of them are fabricated for the purpose of the present case. The learned Counsel appearing for the defendant particularly drew my attention to Bill No. 048 dated 5.6.1980 in the name of Sr. Raghvendra Agencies, Bangalore and same Bill No. 048 dated 5.6.1980 in the name of M/s. V. Samaras am & Co., Bangalore, and submitted that both the bills bear the same order No. 048 and same date. He also drew my attention to document Nos. 47 & 48 in plaintiff's list of documents dated 28.10.1996. According to him the document No. 47 which is Bill No. 292 dated 21.10.1981 shows that the invoice is against Brass double ball catches while the transport receipt shows that Electrical brass parts have been sent against invoice No. 292. According to him same is the case with documents No. 99,101,173,174,175 and 176 of the list dated 8.10.1996. As against the aforesaid allegations in respect of particular bills and invoices, raised on behalf of the defendant the plaintiff has given explanations by filing an affidavit which is on record. In view of the explanation in respect of the said bills by the plaintiff the issue as to whether the said bills were fabricated or not is a matter to be decided after a full fledged trial. \n",
        "p_18": "(17) It is no doubt true that an arguable dispute has been raised by the defendant as regards some of the bills and invoices but at this stage, as was held in the decision Jai Prakash Gupta (supra) it would not be appropriate without further evidence to give any finding about the said dispute raised by the defendant as to whether the plaintiff is guilty of fabrication or not, which would be a matter to be considered and decided during the course of the hearing of the suit. \n",
        "p_19": "(18) However, on going through the records of the case I find that prima facie the plaintiff has been able to place atleast some documents on record namely the carbon copies of the bills and invoices from 1979 onwards to show that the plaintiff has been using the trade mark Flora in respect of hardware goods. As against such documents the defendant has failed to lead and/or produce any evidence to prove that it has been using the trade mark Flora in respect of hardware goods even from 1987 i.e. even after obtaining the registration. Thus the material placed on record prima facie proves and establishes the case of the plaintiff that the plaintiff is the prior user of the trade mark Flora with respect to hardware goods than the defendant and that its application seeking for registration is pending before the Competent Authority as also its application seeking for rectification of the trade mark FLORA. \n",
        "p_20": "(19) I have also given my thoughtful consideration to the other arguments advanced by the learned Counsel for the defendant that the present application filed by the plaintiff seeking for temporary in junction is liable to be dismissed in view of inordinate delay on the part of the plaintiff in approaching this Court. According to the learned Counsel the registration of the trade mark Flora in respect of hardware goods was granted by the Competent Authority to the defendant in the year 1987 whereas the present petition has been filed only in the year 1996. On consideration of the records of the case I find that apart from the fact that the plaintiff has given some explanation explaining the delay in approaching this Court, the defendant is also equally liable on the same count in view of the fact that although it was to the knowledge of the defendant that the plaintiff had been using the same trade mark in respect of the same material/ goods, it never approached this Court claiming relief against the plaintiff except for giving a legal notice to the plaintiff only in the year 1996 and did not even institute a suit in this Court except for raising a counter claim and filing an application under Order 39 Rules 1 & 2, Civil Procedure Code in the present suit. Therefore, for the delay, if any, in my considered opinion, both the plaintiff and the defendant are equally liable. However, in an act of passing off which is an act of deceit fresh cause of action accrues at every moment of time during which the breach is committed. In other words, in a matter of passing off by the defendant by selling their goods as if they are the goods of the plaintiff gives a continuous and recurring cause of action and therefore, fresh period of limitation begins to run at every moment of time during which such breach is committed. In M/s. Bengal Waterproof Limited v. M/s. Bombay Waterproof Manufacturing Company & Another, , the Supreme Court after noticing the provisions of Section 22 of the Limitation Act, 1963 held that as the act of passing off is an act of deceit and tort every time when such tortuous act or deceit is committed by the defendant the plaintiff gets a fresh cause of action to come to the Court by appropriate proceedings.    IN the light of the aforesaid settled legal principle, in my considered opinion, the present application filed by the plaintiff seeking for temporary in Junction and for that matter even the suit cannot be dismissed on the ground of delay.   \n",
        "p_21": "(20) Considering all the aforesaid factors, the in junction as prayed for in the application is granted in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant restraining the defendant, their servants, agents, dealers and representatives from manufacturing, selling, offering for sale under the trade mark Flora in respect of hardware goods or any other trade mark identical with or deceptively similar to the trade mark Flora of the plaintiff till the disposal of the suit. Consequently, the application filed by the plaintiff (I.A. No. 6641 /1996) stands allowed to the extent indicated above and the application (I.A. No. 8765/96) filed by the defendant stands dismissed. However, in the interest of justice I deem it appropriate to put a condition on the aforesaid order of temporary in junction granted by me that the plaintiff shall maintain account of the sale and submit the same quarterly to this Court till the disposal of the suit.    BEFORE parting with the records of the case, I may however observe that whatever, opinion and observations are made by me herein are my prima facie view for the purpose of deciding the in junction application and shall not in any manner be interpreted as the final opinion on the merits of the case.   \n",

A reference to the above said two paras shows that the learned\n\nSingle Judge has held that on account of various facts there is no\n\nFAO(OS) No. 286/08                                               Page 3 of 16\n deceptive similarity or chance of confusion.       Some of these facts\n\ndistinguishing the two marks are that there is a single deer in the\n\ntrademark of the respondent whereas there are two deers in the\n\ntrademark of the appellant, the figure of the deer is different, the\n\nappellant\u201fs deers are males with antlers while the respondent\u201fs deer is\n\na female having only ears and no antlers, the appellant\u201fs deers are\n\nrunning deers with both front feet bent and rear feet stretched but the\n\ndeer in the respondent\u201fs trademark is a standing deer with one front\n\nfeet a little raised and bent and so on. The learned Single Judge has\n\narrived at a conclusion that there is no chance of confusion because\n\nthe appellant\u201fs goods were not known by the name of \u201edeer\u201f alone.\n\nThe learned Single Judge held that the labels and the devices of the\n\ntwo trademarks are different and the same are not therefore resulting\n\nin confusion.\n",

The\n\noverriding aspect in a case such as the present is that deer is a\n\nprominent part of the trademark of the appellant.          Copying of a\n\nprominent part of a trademark leads to deceptive similarity especially\n\nwhen the product of both the parties is the same.        The expression\n\n\"Deer\" was arbitrarily adopted by the appellant with respect to its\n\nproduct being rice. A deer has no connection or co-relation with the\n\nproduct namely rice.    Such arbitrary adoption of a word mark with\n\nrespect to a product with which it has no co-relation, is entitled to a\n\nFAO(OS) No. 286/08                                             Page 4 of 16\n very high degree of protection, more so, as the appellant\u201fs trademark\n\nis a registered trademark. The use by the respondent of its trademark\n\nis admittedly subsequent to that of the appellant. The first registration\n\nof the appellant is of the year 1985 and then of 1990. The respondent\n\nclaims the first user only from the year 1999, and, as the later\n\ndiscussion will show, that is also not a correct fact because the user of\n\nthe respondent is prima facie only from around the year 2003.\n\n",

That copying of a prominent part of a trademark of a person is\n\nprohibited, more so, when the same is a registered trademark, is clear\n\nfrom the following observations of a judgment of a Division Bench of\n\nthis court in the case reported as Goenka Institute of Education\n\nand Research Vs.

The aforesaid ratio of the Division Bench in the case of Amar\n\nSingh Chawal Wala (supra) squarely applies to the facts of the\n\npresent case because the expression \"Deer\" is arbitrarily adopted with\n\nrespect to the product rice and \u201edeer\u201f is a prominent part of the\n\ntrademark \"Double Deer\" of the appellant, similar to the prominent\n\nword mark Qilla in the case of Amar Singh Chawal Wala (supra).\n\nThe respondent has also failed to give any satisfactory explanation as\n\nto why it adopted the expression \" Deer\" when there already existed a\n\nregistered trademark \"Double Deer\" of the appellant.\n\n",
        "p_9": "9.    Before us, the learned counsel for the respondent laid stress on\n\nthree aspects; (i) that there is no deceptive similarity between the two\n\ntrademarks ; (ii) that the claim of injunction is barred by delay and\n\nlaches inasmuch as the respondent has been using the mark since\n\n1999; (iii) there are other users of the trademark \"Deer\" including for\n\nFAO(OS) No. 286/08                                             Page 11 of 16\n that of rice and therefore the word mark \"Deer\" is common to the\n\ntrade.\n",
        "p_10": "10.   The aspect of deceptive similarity we have already discussed\n\nabove and held in favour of the appellant.      In support of his second\n\ncontention pertaining to delay/latches, learned counsel referred to\n\nsome stray bills from 1999 till the year 2003 and more specifically\n\nrelied upon a typed chart showing the alleged sale figures of the\n\nrespondent with respect to the mark \"Golden Deer\" that the sales were\n\nin the region of 3 to 5 crores.    In our opinion, the documents relied\n\nupon by the respondent do not inspire confidence.         Merely because\n\nsome documents are filed by a party, the court is not bound to believe\n\nthem. A court must apply its mind to such documents to ensure that\n\nthere is reasonable credibility and genuineness in the same so that the\n\nsame can be relied upon to weigh the respective strength of the cases\n\nof the parties, otherwise, any and every document not having\n\ngenuineness/credibility will be filed to deny relief to the opposite party.\n\nNo doubt a mini trial is not conducted at the stage of grant of an\n\ninterim injunction, however, the respective strength of the cases of the\n\nparties have to be considered and inherent in the same is right to see\n\nthe genuineness and credibility of the documents. That respective\n\nstrength of the cases set up by the parties have to be seen is no longer\n\nres integra and this has been so held by the Supreme Court in its two\n\njudgments     reported   as   Colgate   Pamolive      (India)   Ltd.

Arvindbhai Rambhai Patel & others (2006) 8 SCC 726 It is,\n\nin order to judge the prima facie genuineness and credibility of the\n\ndocuments of the respondent, we put it to the counsel for the\n\nrespondent that if the sales were such huge why only stray bills were\n\nfiled and that no profit and loss account and balance sheet or the\n\naudited accounts were filed so as to substantiate the credibility and\n\ngenuineness of the documents being relied upon. The counsel for the\n\nrespondent had no answer. In our opinion, after all, if there were such\n\nhuge sales as claimed by the respondent with respect to the trademark\n\n\"Golden Deer\" from the year 1999-2000 then surely it was not difficult\n\nfor the respondent to file audited accounts showing the sale of \"Double\n\nDeer\" from 1999-2000 and myriad other documents.             In fact, we\n\nfurther and again put to learned counsel for the respondent that\n\nwhether any such documents have been filed either before this court or\n\nbefore the learned Single Judge, to which the counsel for the\n\nrespondent admitted that no such documents have been filed either\n\nbefore the learned Single Judge or this Court. As held by the Supreme\n\nCourt in the case of Midas Hygiene Industries (P) Ltd & Anr. Vs.\n\nSudhir Bhatia & others (2004) 3 SCC 90 once there is a registered\n\ntrademark, certain amount of delay would not prevent grant of an\n\ninterim injunction. The delay is only of just about 2 odd years.   Interim\n\ninjunction could have been refused only if the delay on the part of the\n\nappellant/plaintiff was such so as to result in acquiescence or grave\n\nprejudice to the respondent. There is no question of acquiescence in\n\nFAO(OS) No. 286/08                                            Page 13 of 16\n the facts of the present case, more so, because the adoption of the\n\nrespondent is not honest and the defence that the mark \"Deer\" was\n\ncommon to the trade is clearly misconceived. It is in the light of this,\n\nwe are convinced that the respondent does not have any strength in its\n\ncase as compared to the case set up on the registered trademark of\n\nthe appellant.\n",
        "p_11": "          Our belief is further confirmed because the counsel for the\n\nrespondent stated that others traders were also using the word mark\n\n\"Deer\" and that is why the respondent adopted the same as it was\n\ncommon to trade, however, when we refer to the documents which\n\nwere relied upon by the respondent on this aspect we find that as\n\nregards the others who are using the word mark \"Deer\", the said trade\n\nmark \"Deer\" is not being used with respect to the product rice but is\n\nbeing used with respect to products such as Masalas, Chicory Powder\n\nand Wheat Flour.     Clearly, therefore, the contention of the learned\n\ncounsel for the respondent is misconceived that the word mark \"Deer\"\n\nis common to the trade of rice. In fact this shows that the dishonest\n\nadoption of the word mark \"Deer\" by the respondent in its trademark\n\n\"Golden Deer\" inasmuch as the appellant was already an established\n\nand registered user of the trademark \"Double Deer\" from 1985 when\n\nregistration was first granted.\n",
        "p_12": "11.   In view of the said discussion, since the learned Judge has clearly\n\nmisapplied the law and arrived at a conclusion which is quite\n\nunsustainable in law, this court is of the opinion that the impugned\n\nFAO(OS) No. 286/08                                            Page 14 of 16\n order is liable to be set aside. Ordinarily, if two views were possible,\n\nthis court would not have interfered, however, we are of the firm\n\nopinion that only one view is possible in the facts of the present case\n\nbecause not only the appellant/plaintiff was the prior and the\n\nregistered     user        of      the     trademark,    the      adoption     of     the\n\nrespondent/defendant was not honest and it is not permissible to copy\n\na prominent part of the registered trademark of another person, more\n\nso, when the said word mark is arbitrarily adopted with respect to the\n\nproduct in question.            The balance of convenience is          clearly not in\n\nfavour of the              defendant/respondent but is in            favour of the\n\nappellant/plaintiff who will be caused serious, grave and irreparable\n\ninjury with respect to its ownership and goodwill in the trademark\n\n\"Double Deer\". The Supreme Court in the case of                      Ram Dev Food\n\nProducts (P) Ltd. (supra) has held that an Appellate Court is entitled\n\nin certain circumstances to interfere with the order of a learned Single\n\nJudge in such matters where the discretion has been exercised by the\n\nlearned Single Judge arbitrarily, capriciously, perversely or where the\n\ncourt has ignored the settled principles of law regulating the grant or\n\nrefusal of interlocutory injunctions. We find the present case to be fit\n\ncase in accordance with the above for interference and the impugned\n\norder of the learned Single Judge dated 21.5.2008 is set aside and the\n\nI.A. 1315/2006 as filed by the appellant/plaintiff before the learned\n\nSingle    Judge       is        entitled    to   be     allowed     and      thus     the\n\nrespondent/defendant is restrained from in any manner using the\n\nFAO(OS) No. 286/08                                                           Page 15 of 16\n trademark \"Golden Deer\" or any other mark deceptive similar to the\n\nappellant/plaintiff\u201fs registered trademark \"Double Deer\" with respect\n\nto the product namely rice and such other products as fall in the class\n\nof goods for which the trademark of the appellant/plaintiff is registered\n\nand for which the appellant/plaintiff is using the said trademark\n\n",

        "p_5": "     The various stages through which Special Case No. 24 of\n1982 progressed\t upto and inclusive of October 18, 1982 have\nbeen set  out in  our Judgment\trendered  today\t in  cognate\nCriminal Appeal\t No. 356  of  1983  and\t they  need  not  be\nrecapitulated here.  After the learned special Judge Shri P.\nS. Bhutta  took cognizance  of the offences upon a complaint\nof Ramdas  Sriniwas Nayak,  the first  respondent  (Original\ncomplainant), the case was adjourned to October 18, 1982 for\nrecording the  evidence of  the complainant.  On  that\tday,\nlearned counsel\t appearing for\tthe appellant  in the  trial\ncourt moved  an application  questioning the jurisdiction of\nthe court  on two  specific counts;  (i) that  the Court  of\nspecial Judge  set up  under Sec.  6  of  the  Criminal\t Law\nAmendment Act,\t1952 ('1952  Act'  for\tshort)\tcannot\ttake\ncognizance of  any of  the offences enumerated in Sec. 6 (1)\n",
        "p_6": "(a) and\t (b) upon  a private complaint of facts constituting\nthe offence  and (ii)  that where  there  are  more  special\nJudges\tthan   one  for\t any  area,  in\t the  absence  of  a\nspecification  by  the\tState  Government  in  this  behalf,\nspecifying the\tlocal area  over which\teach  special  Judge\nwould have  jurisdiction, the special Judge (Mr. Bhutta) had\nno jurisdiction\t to take  cognizance of the offences and try\nthe case.  The\tlearned\t special  Judge\t rejected  both\t the\ncontentions.   The   appellant\t filed\t Criminal   Revision\nApplication No.\t 510 of\t 1982 in the Bombay High Court. On a\nreference made\tby the\tlearned Single\tJudge, this revision\napplication was heard by a Division Bench of the High Court.\nThe learned  Judges by two separate but concurring judgments\nheld that special Judge is competent and is entitled to take\ncognizance of  offences set  out in  Sec. 6  (1) (a) and (b)\nupon a\tprivate complaint  of facts constituting the offence\nand consequently  rejected the first contention. In reaching\nthis  conclusion  the  learned\tJudges\theld  that  a  prior\ninvestigation under Sec. 5 A of the Prevention of Corruption\nAct, 1947  ('1947 Act' for short) by a police officer of the\ndesignated rank\t is not a condition precedent to the special\nJudge taking  cognizance of the offences under Sec. 8 (1) of\n1952 Act.  The learned Judges also held that by the time the\nmatter was  heard by them, the Government of Maharashtra had\nissued a  notification dated  January 15, 1983, under sub-s.\n(2) of\tSec. 7\tof 1952\t Act specifying\t Shri  R.  B.  Sule,\nspecial Judge for Greater Bombay for trying Special Case No.\n24 of  1982, After  taking note of this notification and the\nstatement of  Shri P.  R. Vakil,  learned  counsel  for\t the\nrespondent, the second contention of the learned counsel for\nthe  appellant\t was  also   rejected.\tThe  learned  Judges\naccordingly  rejected  the  revision  petition.\t Hence\tthis\nappeal by special leave.\n",
        "p_7": "     On behalf of the appellant, the pivotal point canvassed\nwas that  a private  complaint cannot  be entertained by the\nspecial Judge  in respect  of all  or any  of  the  offences\nenumerated in  Sec. 6  (1) (a)\tand (b)\t of the 1952 Act. In\nsupport of  this submission,  it was  very vehemently  urged\nthat the provision contained in Sec. 5 A of the 1952 Act has\nbeen repeatedly held to be mandatory in character and if its\nnon-compliance is  brought to  the notice  of  the  superior\ncourt at a stage anterior to the conclusion of the trial the\nproceeding would  be vitiated.\tIt was\turged that  Sec.  5A\nincorporates a safe guard against frivolous, speculative and\ntendentious prosecutions  and therefore,  it must  not\tonly\nheld to\t be mandatory  but it  must be\tso interpreted as to\nmake an investigation under Sec. 5A a condition precedent to\nthe taking  of the  cognizance of  an  offence\tor  offences\ncommitted by a public servant by the special Judge. A number\nof subsidiary  points were  submitted  in  support  of\tthis\nprincipal contention which need not be enumerated, but would\nbe dealt with in the course of the judgment.\n",
        "p_8": "     On behalf\tof the\trespondent-complainant it  was urged\nthat  it  is  one  of  the  fundamental\t postulates  of\t the\nadministration of  criminal justice  that anyone can set the\ncriminal law  into motion  unless the  statute enacting\t the\noffence makes  a special provision to the contrary both with\nregard to  the locus  standi of\t the complainant, the manner\nand method  of investigation  and the  person  competent  to\ninvestigate the\t offence, and  the court  competent to\ttake\ncognizance. It\twas submitted  that  in\t Sec.  8  (1)  which\nspecifically confers  power on\tthe special  Judge  to\ttake\ncognizance of  an offence  without commitment of the case to\nit there  is nothing which would preclude a complainant from\nfiling a  private complaint or which would deny jurisdiction\nof the\tspecial Judge  to take cognizance of the offences on\nsuch a private complaint. It was submitted that even if Sec.\n5A is  treated as mandatory and incorporates a safeguard, it\nis a  safeguard against\t investigation of offences committed\nby a  public servant  by police\t officers of  lower rank and\nnothing more.  It was  lastly urged  that on a comprehensive\nview of\t the provisions\t of 1952  Act, it does not transpire\nthat any  of its  provisions and  more specifically  Sec. 5A\ndenies the  power to the special Judge to take cognizance of\noffences enumerated in Sec. 6 (1) (a) and (b) upon a private\ncomplaint. It  was also\t contended that before taking such a\ndrastic view  of blocking  the access  to justice by holding\nthat a\tprivate\t complaint  cannot  be\tentertained  by\t the\nspecial\t Judge,\t the  court  must  insist  on  specific\t and\npositive provision  of such incontrovertible character as to\nsupplant the  scheme of\t Code of  Criminal  Procedure  which\npermits two\n923\nparallel and  independent agencies to take criminal offences\nto court.  An incidental submission was that the Legislature\nclearly\t expresses   itself  when   it\trequires  a  certain\nqualification for  filing the  complaint, and  to specify  a\ncertain court  competent to  take cognizance  and the method\nand manner of taking cognizance of those specified offences.\nTo substantiate this submission our attention was drawn to a\nnumber of statutes which we will presently mention.\n",
        "p_9": "     The contention  put in  the forefront  was that Sec. 5A\nupon its  true interpretation  and keeping  in view  that it\nenacts a  mandatory safeguard  in favour of public servants,\ninvestigation therein  contemplated is a condition precedent\nto taking  cognizance of  offences enumerated  in Sec. 6 (1)\n",
        "p_10": "(a) and (b) and as a corollary a private complaint would not\nlie and\t cannot be entertained by a special Judge under Sec.\n8 (1)  of 1952\tAct.  The  contention  may  be\texamined  on\nprinciple and precedent.\n",
        "p_11": "     It\t is   a\t well\trecognised  principle\tof  criminal\njurisprudence that  anyone can\tset or\tput the criminal law\ninto motion except where the statute enacting or creating an\noffence indicates to the contrary. The scheme of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure  envisages two  parallel and\t independent\nagencies for taking criminal offences to court. Even for the\nmost serious  offence of  murder, it was not disputed that a\nprivate\t complaint  can,  not  only  be\t filed\tbut  can  be\nentertained and\t proceeded  with  according  to\t law.  Locus\nstandi of  the complainant  is a concept foreign to criminal\njurisprudence save and except that where the statue creating\nan offence  provides for the eligibility of the complainant,\nby necessary implication the general principle gets excluded\nby such\t statutory provision  Numerous statutory provisions,\ncan be referred to in support of this legal position such as\n",
        "p_12": "(i) Sec. 187 A of Sea Customs Act, 1878 (ii) Sec. 97 of Gold\nControl Act,  1968 (iii) Sec. 6 of Import and Export Control\nAct, 1947  (iv) Sec. 271 and Sec. 279 of the Income Tax Act,\n1961 (v)  Sec. 61  of the  Foreign Exchange  Regulation Act,\n1973,(vi) Sec. 621 of the Companies Act, 1956 and (vii) Sec.\n77  of\tthe  Electricity  Supply  Act.\tThis  list  is\tonly\nillustrative and  not exhaustive. While Sec. 190 of the Code\nof  Criminal   Procedure  permits  anyone  to  approach\t the\nMagistrate with\t a complaint,  it  does\t not  prescribe\t any\nqualification the  complainant is  required to\tfulfil to be\neligible to  file a  complaint.\t But  where  an\t eligibility\ncriterion  for\t a  complainant\t  is  contemplated  specific\nprovisions have\t been made  such as to be found in Secs. 195\nto 199\tof the\tCr. P.\tC. These specific provisions clearly\nindicate  that\t in  the   absence  of\tany  such  statutory\nprovision, a locus\n924\nstandi of  a complainant  is a\tconcept foreign\t to criminal\njurisprudence. In other words, the principle that anyone can\nset or\tput the criminal law in motion remains intact unless\ncontra-indicated by  a\tstatutory  provision.  This  general\nprinciple of  nearly universal\tapplication is\tfounded on a\npolicy that  an offence\t i.  e.\t an  act  or  omission\tmade\npunishable by  any law for the time being in force (See Sec.\n2 (n),\tCr. P.\tC.) is\tnot merely  an offence\tcommitted in\nrelation to  the person\t who suffers  harm but\tis  also  an\noffence against\t society. The  society for  its orderly\t and\npeaceful development  is interested in the punishment of the\noffender. Therefore,  prosecution for  serious\toffences  is\nundertaken in  the name of the State representing the people\nwhich would  exclude any  element  of  private\tvendatta  or\nvengeance. If  such is\tthe public  policy underlying  penal\nstatutes who  brings an\t act or\t omission made punishable by\nlaw to\tthe notice  of the  authority competent to deal with\nit,  is\t  immaterial  and   irrelevant\tunless\tthe  statute\nindicates to the contrary. Punishment of the offender in the\ninterest of  the society  being one  of the  objects  behind\npenal statutes enacted for larger good of the society, right\nto   initiate\tproceedings   cannot   be   whittled   down,\ncircumscribed or  fettered by  putting it  into\t a  straight\njacket\tformula\t  of  locus   standi  unknown\tto  criminal\njurisprudence, save and except specific statutory exception.\nTo hold\t that  such  an\t exception  exists  that  a  private\ncomplaint for  offences of  corruption committed  by  public\nservant is  not maintainable,  the court  would\t require  an\nunambiguous  statutory\t provision  and\t a  tangled  web  of\nargument for  drawing a far fetched implication, cannot be a\nsubstitute for an express statutory provision. In the matter\nof initiation  of proceeding  before a\tspecial Judge  under\nSec. 8\t(1), the  Legislature while conferring power to take\ncognizance had\tthree opportunities  to unambiguously  state\nits mind  whether the  cognizance can  be taken on a private\ncomplaint or  not. The\tfirst  one  was\t an  opportunity  to\nprovide in  Sec. 8  (1) itself\tby merely  stating that\t the\nspecial Judge  may take cognizance of an offence on a police\nreport\tsubmitted   to\tit   by\t an   investigating  officer\nconducting investigation  as contemplated  by Sec. 5A. While\nproviding for investigation by designated police officers of\nsuperior rank,\tthe Legislature\t did not fetter the power of\nspecial Judge  to take cognizance in a manner otherwise than\non police  report. The second opportunity was when by Sec. 8\n(3) a  status of a deemed public prosecutor was conferred on\na  private   complainant  if   he  chooses  to\tconduct\t the\nprosecution. The Legislature being aware of a provision like\nthe one\t contained in  Sec. 225 of the Cr. P. C., could have\nas well\t provided that in every trial before a special Judge\nthe prosecution\t shall be  conducted by a Public Prosecutor,\nthough that\n925\nitself would  not have\tbeen decisive of the matter. And the\nthird opportunity was when the Legislature while prescribing\nthe procedure prescribed for warrant cases to be followed by\nspecial Judge  did not\texclude by a specific provision that\nthe only procedure which the special Judge can follow is the\none prescribed\tfor trial  of  warrant\tcases  on  a  police\nreport. The  disinclination of the Legislature to so provide\npoints to  the contrary and no canon of construction permits\nthe court  to go in search of a hidden or implied limitation\non the\tpower  of  the\tspecial\t Judge\tto  take  cognizance\nunfettered by such requirement of its being done on a police\nreport alone. In our opinion, it is no answer to this fairly\nwell-established legal\tposition that  for the last 32 years\nno case\t has come  to the  notice  of  the  court  in  which\ncognizance was\ttaken  by  a  special  Judge  in  a  private\ncomplaint for  offences punishable  under the  1947 Act.  If\nsomething that\tdid not happen in the past is to be the sole\nreliable guide so as to deny any such thing happening in the\nfuture, law  would be  rendered static\tand  slowly  whither\naway.\n",
        "p_13": "     The  scheme   underlying  Code  of\t Criminal  Procedure\nclearly reveals that anyone who wants to give information of\nan offence may either approach the Magistrate or the officer\nin charge  of a Police Station. If the offence complained of\nis a  non-cognizable one,  the\tPolice\tOfficer\t can  either\ndirect the  complainant to approach the Magistrate or he may\nobtain permission  of the  Magistrate  and  investigate\t the\noffence. Similarly anyone can approach the Magistrate with a\ncomplaint and  even if\tthe offence  disclosed is  a serious\none, the  Magistrate is\t competent to take cognizance of the\noffence\t and   initiate\t proceedings.  It  is  open  to\t the\nMagistrate  but\t  not  obligatory   upon   him\t to   direct\ninvestigation by  police. Thus two agencies have been set up\nfor taking offences to court. One would therefore, require a\ncogent and explicit provision to hold that Sec. 5A displaces\nthis scheme.\n",

Prior thereto, Sec.\n3 of  the 1947\tAct which  made the offences under Secs. 161\nand 165\t IPC cognizable\t had a proviso engrafted to it which\nprecluded investigation of the offences under the Prevention\nof Corruption  Act by  a police\t officer below\tthe rank  of\nDeputy Superintendent  of Police except without the order of\na Magistrate  of the  first class.

C. to mean 'an offence for which, and \"cognizable\ncase\" means  a case  in which,\ta  police  officer  may,  in\naccordance with\t the First Schedule or under any law for the\ntime being  in force,  arrest without warrant.' Complaint is\ndefined in Sec. 2 (d) to mean 'any allegation made orally or\nin writing to a Magistrate, with a view to his taking action\nunder the  Code, that some person, whether known or unknown,\nhas committed  an offence,  but does  not include  a  police\nreport.' There\tis an  explanation appended  to the  section\nwhich has some relevance. 'A report made by a police officer\nin  a\tcase  which   disclosed,  after\t investigation,\t the\ncommission of a non-cognizable offence shall be deemed to be\na complaint;  and the  police officer by whom such report is\nmade shall  be deemed  to be  the complainant.'\t Sec. 2\t (e)\ndefines 'non-cognizable\t offence' to  mean 'an\toffence\t for\nwhich' and  \"non-cognizable\" case  means a  case in which, a\npolice officer, has no authority to arrest without warrant.'\nPolice report  is defined  in Sec.  2 (r)  to mean 'a report\nforwarded by a police officer to a Magistrate under sub-sec.\n(2) of\tSec. 173.'  'Officer in\t charge of a police station'\nhas been defined in Sec. 2 (o) to include any police officer\npresent at  the station\t house who  is next  in rank to such\nofficer and  is above  the rank\t of constable  or, when\t the\nState Government  so directs,  any other  police officer  so\npresent.'\n928\nIn other  words, a Head-constable of Police that is one step\nhigher from  a constable  can  be  in  charge  of  a  police\nstation.\n",
        "p_16": "     It may  now be mentioned that offences under Secs. 161,\n162, 163,  164, 165, 165A IPC and Sec. 5 (2) of the 1947 Act\nare cognizable\toffences. If  they are\tcognizable offences,\nanyone can  go to  a police station under Sec. 154 IPC, give\ninformation of\tthe offence and an officer of the level of a\nHead-constable of  Police can  start  investigation  to\t the\nchagrin and  annoyance of  a public  servant who  may  be  a\nhighly placed  officer. It  must also be recalled that prior\nto 1947,  offence under\t Sec. 161  IPC was  a non-cognizable\noffence meaning\t thereby that a Magistrate under Sec. 190 of\nthe Code  of Criminal Procedure would take cognizance upon a\nprivate complaint  and initiate\t a proceeding.\tBy Sec. 3 of\nthe 1947  Act, offences\t under Sec.  161 and  165 were\tmade\ncognizable. Legislature\t being aware  that  once  these\t two\noffences are  made cognizable,\ta police officer of the rank\nof   Head-constable    would   be   entitled   to   initiate\ninvestigation against  the public servant who may as well be\nhighly placed  officer in police, revenue, taxation or other\ndepartments.  In  order\t to  guard  against  this  invidious\nsituation, while  making offences  under Secs.\t161 and\t 165\ncognizable by Sec. 3, as it stood in 1947, care was taken to\nintroduce a proviso to Sec. 3 which reads as under:\n",
        "p_17": "     While   investigating   a\t cognizable   offence,\t the\ninvestigating officer  who is  an officer  in  charge  of  a\npolice station\thas a  right to arrest the accused without a\nwarrant. On  these offences  being made cognizable, in order\nto protect  public servant  from being\tarrested by  a petty\npolice officer\tas well to avoid investigation of an offence\nof corruption  being conducted\tby police officers below the\nspecified rank the proviso was enacted thereby depriving low\nlevel police  officers from  exercising this  drastic power.\nHowever, Legislature  was aware that an officer of a rank of\nDeputy Superintendent  of Police may not always be available\nand to\tguard against  offences going, undetected, a further\npower was  conferred that although ordinarily the offence by\npublic servant\tunder the  aforementioned sections shall not\nbe investigated by an officer below the rank of\n929\nDeputy Superintendent of Police, the Magistrate of the first\nclass can  grant permission  to an officer of the lower rank\nto  investigate\t  the  offence\tin  teeth  of  the  statute.\nTherefore, two\tsafeguards were sought to be incorporated in\nthe predecessor\t provision of the present Sec. 5A, being the\nproviso to  Sec. 3,  namely, these  offences  having  become\ncognizable shall not be investigated by an officer of a rank\nbelow that  of a  Deputy Superintendent\t of Police but it if\nbecomes so necessary, it shall not be done without the order\nof  a  Magistrate  of  the  first  class.  Left\t to  police,\ninvestigation by  the designated  officer of  superior\trank\nguaranteed a  protection against frivolous investigation. In\nlarger\tpublic\tinterest  non-availability  of\tsuch  higher\nofficers  was\tcatered\t to   by  conferring  power  on\t the\nMagistrate of  the first  class to  grant permission  to  an\nofficer of  the rank  lower than  the designated  officer to\ninvestigate such  offences. Two conclusions emerge from this\nsituation, that\t investigation by  a police  officer of\t the\nhigher rank  on his  own  may  tend  to\t curb  frivolous  or\nspeculative prosecution\t but even  if an  officer of  a rank\nlower than  the\t designated  officer  is  to  undertake\t the\ninvestigation for  the reasons\twhich he  must convince\t the\nMagistrate of  the first  class, the  Legislature considered\ncourts'\t  intervention\t as   adequate\t safeguard   against\ninvestigation by  police officer  of a lower rank. It may be\nmentioned  that\t  Sec.\t5A   was  first\t introduced  by\t the\nPrevention of  Corruption (Second  Amendment) Act,  1952 but\nwas substituted\t by the\t present Sec  5A by  Act 40  of 1964\nwhich was  enacted to  give effect to the recommendations of\nthe Santhanam  Committee. Sec.\t5A specifies the officers of\nsuperior  rank\t in  police  force  on\twhom  the  power  to\ninvestigate offences under Secs. 161, 165, 165A IPC and Sec.\n5 of  the 1947\tAct is\tconferred. Simultaneously  power was\nconferred on  the Presidency  Magistrate or  a Magistrate of\nthe first  class, as  the case\tmay be, to permit an officer\ninferior in  rank to  the designated  officer  to  undertake\ninvestigation and  to make  an arrest without a warrant. The\nLegislative intention  is further  manifested by the proviso\nto Sec.\t 5A which  enables the State Government to authorise\npolice officer\tnot below the rank of an Inspector of Police\nby   general   or   special   order   to   investigate\t the\naforementioned offences\t without the order of the Presidency\nMagistrate or  a Magistrate of the first class, and may make\nan arrest without a warrant. Again while specifying officers\nof higher  rank in  clauses (a)\t to (d)\t of Sec.  5A (1) who\nwould, by  virtue of  office, be entitled to investigate the\naforementioned offences\t as cognizable\toffences  and  could\nalso make  arrest without warrant power was conferred on the\nPresidency Magistrate  or the  Magistrate of the first class\nto remove this umbrella of protection by giving an authority\nto investigate such offences\n930\nto a  police officer  of rank  lower than  the\tofficers  of\ndesignated rank, and the proviso makes a further dent in the\nsafeguard in that the State Government by general or special\norder can  bring down  the designated  rank to\tthe level of\nInspector of Police to investigate these offences.\n",
        "p_18": "     The whole gamut of argument is that Sec. 5A of 1947 Act\nincorporates such  a safeguard in favour of the accused that\nupon its  true interpretation  it is not open to the special\nJudge to  take cognizance of an offence except upon a police\nreport that  may be  submitted by officers of the designated\nrank or\t officers authorised by the Presidency Magistrate or\nthe Magistrate of the first class or the Inspector of Police\nauthorised by  the State  Government by a general or special\norder, and  therefore a fortiori, it must exclude cognizance\nbeing taken  by the  special Judge  upon a private complaint\nbecause that  would completely render illusory the safeguard\nprescribed in  Sec. 5A.\t It was\t said that where a person is\nthreatened with\t the deprivation  of  his  liberty  and\t the\nprocedure prescribed  incorporates statutory safeguards, the\ncourt should  be very  slow to\tdilute or  do away  with the\nsafeguards or  render the same ineffective. It was said that\nif the\tcourts were  to hold that a private complaint can be\nentertained by\tthe special Judge and the latter is under no\nobligation to direct investigation of the same by an officer\nof the\tdesignated rank,  the safeguard incorporated in Sec.\n5A becomes illusory and that is impermissible.\n",
        "p_19": "     Before we\tproceed further, it is now necessary to take\nnotice of  salient provisions  of the Criminal Law Amendment\nAct, 1952.  The Act  was enacted  as its long title shows to\namend the  Indian  Penal  Code\tand  the  Code\tof  Criminal\nProcedure, 1898\t and to\t provide for  a more speedy trial of\ncertain offences.  Sec. 1A is the dictionary clause. Sec. 2,\n3, 4  and 5  have been\trepealed by various amendments. Then\ncomes Sec. 6. It reads as under:\n",
        "p_20": "     Sec.7 confers  exclusive jurisdiction  on\tthe  special\nJudge appointed\t under Sec.  6 to  try the  cases set out in\nSec. 6\t(1) (a)\t and 6\t(1) (b).  Sub-sec.  (2)\t of  Sec.  7\nprovides that \"Every offence specified in sub-section (1) of\nSec.6 shall  be tried  by the  special Judge  for  the\tarea\nwithin which  it was  committed, or  where  there  are\tmore\nspecial Judges\tthan one  for such area, by such one of them\nas may be specified in this behalf by the State Government.\"\nSubsec. (3)  enlarges the  jurisdiction of the special Judge\nnot only  to try  offences set out in Sec. 6 (1) (a) and (b)\nbut also  to try offences other than those mentioned therein\nwith which  the accused\t may, under  the  Code\tof  Criminal\nProcedure, be charged at the same trial. Three things emerge\nfrom Sec. 7. The special Judge has exclusive jurisdiction to\ntry offences  enumerated in  Sec. 6  (1) (a)  and (b). Where\nthere are more than one special Judge for the same area, the\nState Government is under an obligation to specify the local\njurisdiction of\t each special Judge, it may be case-wise, it\nmay be\tarea-wise. Sub-sec. (3) enlarges the jurisdiction to\ntry other  offences which  have been committed in the course\nof the\tsame transaction  and for which the accused could be\ncharged at  the same  trial. Then  comes Sec. 8. It reads as\nunder:\n",
        "p_21": "     It may  be mentioned  that Sec. 8 does not apply to the\nState of  West\tBengal.\t This  has  some  relevance  to\t the\nunderstanding of  some\tof  the\t decisions  bearing  on\t the\nsubject arising\t from the  State  of  West  Bengal.  Sec.  9\nprovides for  the subordination\t of the special Judge to the\nHigh Court  of the  State in  the matter of appeal, revision\nand other  incidental powers  which the High Court exercises\nover subordinate  courts. Sec.\t10 provided  for transfer of\ncertain cases, which were pending at the commencement of the\n1952 Act.\n",
        "p_22": "     Before we\tundertake  a  detailed\texamination  of\t the\nsubmission that\t Sec. 5A  incorporates a condition precedent\nto the\ttaking of  the cognizance of an offence by a special\nJudge, it  is necessary\t to state with clarity and precision\nthat Sec.  8 (1) which confers power on the special Judge to\ntake cognizance\t of offences  set out  in Sec. 6 (1) (a) and\n",
        "p_23": "(b)  does  not\tdirectly  or  indirectly,  expressly  or  by\nnecessary implication  indicate\t that  the  only  method  of\ntaking cognizance is the police report under Sec. 173 (2) of\nthe Code of Crimi-\n",
        "p_24": "nal  Procedure\t submitted  by\t a  police  officer  of\t the\ndesignated rank\t or permissible rank as set out in Secs. 5A.\nIt merely  says 'A  special Judge  may\ttake  cognizance  of\noffences without  the accused  being committed\tto  him\t for\ntrial, and  in trying  the accused  person, shall follow the\nprocedure prescribed by the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898\nfor the\t trial of warrant cases by Magistrates.' The Code of\nCriminal Procedure  has prescribed  four  known\t methods  of\ntaking cognizance of offences by the courts competent to try\nthe same.  The court  has to  take cognizance of the offence\nbefore initiation  of the proceeding can be contemplated The\ncourt called  upon to  take cognizance\tof the\toffence must\napply its  mind to  the facts placed before it either upon a\npolice report  or upon\ta complaint  or in some other manner\nthe court  came to know about it and in the case of Court of\nSessions upon commitment of the case by the Magistrate.\n",
        "p_25": "     Sec. 6  of the  Code of Criminal Procedure provides for\nsetting up  of criminal courts under the High Court in every\nState.\tThey  are  (i)\tCourts\tof  Session:  (ii)  Judicial\nMagistrates of\tthe first  class and,  in  any\tmetropolitan\narea, Metropolitan Magistrate, (iii) Judicial Magistrates of\nthe second  class, and (iv) Executive Magistrates. These are\nto be  the criminal  courts in\tevery State.  The Code\tmade\ndetailed provision for powers of police officers entitled to\ninvestigate offences,  procedure of investigation, powers of\nvarious courts\tto take\t cognizance of\toffences which\tthat\nparticular court is entitled to try under the Code. Sec. 190\nCr. P. C. confers power on the Magistrate to take cognizance\nof an  offence in one of the manners therein prescribed. The\nexpression `Magistrate'\t in Sec.  190 is  a compendious term\nwhich includes\tJudicial  Magistrate  of  the  first  class,\nMetropolitan Magistrate,  Judicial Magistrate  of the second\nclass  and   Executive\tMagistrate,   All  the\t three\t are\ncomprehended in Sec. 190. But then there is another court of\noriginal jurisdiction,\tnamely, Court  of Session also being\nset up\tunder Sec.  6. Can  Court of Session take cognizance\ndirectly upon  a complaint  filed before  it ? The answer is\nobviously in  the negative. Sec. 193 provides that except as\notherwise expressly provided by the Code or by any other law\nfor the\t time being in force, no Court of Session shall take\ncognizance  of\t any  offence\tas  a\tCourt  of   original\njurisdiction unless  the case  has been committed to it by a\nMagistrate. In\tother  words,  Court  of  Session  can\ttake\ncognizance of  an offence  only upon  an order of commitment\nmade  by  the  Magistrate  and\tin  no\tother  manner.\tThis\nnecessitated conferring\t power on  the Magistrate  to commit\ncases to the Court of Session. Code of Criminal Procedure\n934\nmakes ample provisions specifying offences which are triable\nby  Magistrate\t of  the   first  class\t  and\tMetropolitan\nMagistrate, those  triable by  a Judicial  Magistrate of the\nsecond class  and those\t exclusively triable by the Court of\nSession. Column\t 6 in the First Schedule annexed to the Code\nof Criminal  Procedure\tspecifies  which  court\t can  try  a\nparticular offence under the Indian Penal Code. Accordingly,\nprovision was  made  in\t Sec.  209  for\t commitment  by\t the\nMagistrate of  a case  brought to  him either upon a private\ncomplaint or  upon a police report provided that the offence\nis exclusively\ttriable by  the Court  of  Session.  If\t the\nMagistrate took\t cognizance of\tan offence upon a complaint,\nwhich appears  to be exclusively triable by Court of Session\nhe has\tto proceed  according to  Sections 202\t(2), 208 and\n",
        "p_26": "209.  Chapter\tXVIII  incorporates  provisions\t prescribing\nprocedure for  the trial before a Court of Session. Sec. 226\nsays that  the case  comes to  the Court  in pursuance\tof a\ncommitment of  the case under Sec. 209. Sec. 209 caters to a\nsituation  where   the\tcase   was  instituted\t before\t the\nMagistrate on  a police\t report or  otherwise. In  both\t the\ncases, if  it appears  to him  that  the  offence  which  is\nalleged against\t the accused  is exclusively  triable by the\nCourt of  Session there\t is no option but to commit the case\nto the\tCourt of  Session. The\tCourt of  Session thus takes\ncognizance of the offence upon commitment by the Magistrate.\nAnd any\t other mode  of taking\tcognizance  is\tspecifically\nbarred under Sec. 193.\n",
        "p_27": "     Sec. 4  of the  Code of  Criminal Procedure provides as\nunder:\n",
        "p_28": "     Sec. 4 (1) provides for investigation, inquiry or trial\nfor every  offence under  the Indian Penal Code according to\nthe provisions of the Code. Sec. 4 (2) provides for offences\nunder other  law which\tmay be\tinvestigated, inquired into,\ntried and  otherwise dealt  with according to the provisions\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure but\n935\nsubject to  any\t enactment  for\t the  time  being  in  force\nregulating the\tmanner or  place of investigation, inquiring\ninto, trying or otherwise dealing with such offences. In the\nabsence\t of   a\t specific  provision  made  in\tthe  statute\nindicating that\t offences  will\t have  to  be  investigated,\ninquired into,\ttried and  otherwise dealt with according to\nthat  statute,\tthe  same  will\t have  to  be  investigated,\ninquired into,\ttried and  otherwise dealt with according to\nthe Code  of Criminal  Procedure. In  other words,  Code  of\nCriminal Procedure  is the parent statute which provides for\ninvestigation, inquiring into and trial of cases by criminal\ncourts of various designations.\n",
        "p_29": "     Now the Code of Criminal Procedure prescribed only four\nmethods of  taking cognizance  of an offence whether it be a\nMagistrate or  a  Sessions  Court  is  for  the\t time  being\nimmaterial. The\t Code prescribes  four\tmethods\t for  taking\ncognizance upon\t a complaint, or upon a report of the police\nofficer or where the Magistrate himself comes to know of the\ncommission of  offence through\tsome other source and in the\ncase of\t Sessions Court upon a commitment by the Magistrate.\nThere is  no  other  known  or\trecognised  mode  of  taking\ncognizance of  an offence  by a criminal court. Now if Court\nof special  Judge is a criminal court, which atleast was not\ndisputed, and  jurisdiction is\tconferred upon the presiding\nofficer of  the Court of special Judge to take cognizance of\noffences simultaneously excluding one of the four recognised\nmodes of  taking cognizance,  namely, upon  commitment by  a\nMagistrate as  set out\tin Sec 193, the only other method by\nwhich the  Court of  special Judge can take cognizance of an\noffence for  the trial of which it was set up, is any one of\nthe remaining  three other  methods known  to law by which a\ncriminal court\twould take  cognizance of an offence, not as\nan idle\t formality but with a view to initiating proceedings\nand ultimately\tto try the accused. If the language employed\nin Sec.\t 8 (1)\tis read in this light and in this background\nthat a\tspecial Judge may take cognizance of offence without\nthe accused being committed to him for trial, it necessarily\nimplies that  the Court of special Judge is armed with power\nto take\t cognizance of\toffences but  that it  is denied the\npower to  take cognizance  on commitment  by the Magistrate.\nThis excludes  the mode of taking cognizance under Sec. 193.\nThen remains only Sec. 190 which provides various methods of\ntaking cognizance  of offences\tby courts. It is idle to say\nthat Sec. 190 is confined to Magistrate and special Judge is\nnot a  Magistrate. We  shall deal  with the  position  of  a\nspecial Judge  a little later. The fact however remains that\nthe Court  of the special Judge as the expression is used in\nsub-sec. (3) of Sec. 8 is a criminal court and in view of\n936\nSec. 9\tit is under the appellate and administrative control\nof the\tHigh Court. It must take cognizance of offences with\na view\tto trying  the same  but it  shall not\ttake  it  on\ncommitment of  the accused  to the  court.  As\ta  necessary\ncorollary, it  must appear  that the  special Judge can take\ncognizance of  offences enumerated  in Sec. 6 (1)(a) and (b)\nupon a\tcomplaint or upon a police report or upon his coming\nto know in some manner of the offence having been committed.\nWith regard  to the  last of the modes of taking cognizance,\nit was\turged that  there is  inherent evidence to show that\nSec.190 (1)(c)\tcannot\tbe  availed  off  by  special  Judge\nbecause Sec.  191 is  not available to him so as to transfer\nthe case.  A little while later, we shall point out that the\nprovisions of  the Court of special Judge in such manner and\nto such\t extent as  to retain  the separate  identity of the\nCourt of  special Judge and not that he must either fulfil a\nrole of a Magistrate or a Session Court.\n",
        "p_30": "     It is a well-established canon of construction that the\ncourt should read the section as it is and cannot rewrite it\nto suit\t its convenience; nor does any canon of construction\npermit the  court to  read the\tsection in such manner as to\nrender it  to some  extent otiose.  Sec. 8 (1) says that the\nspecial Judge  shall take cognizance of an offence and shall\nnot take  it on\t commitment of\tthe accused. The Legislature\nprovided  for\tboth  the  positive  and  the  negative.  It\npositively  conferred\tpower  on   special  Judge  to\ttake\ncognizance of offences and it negatively removed any concept\nof commitment.\tIt is not possible therefore, to read Sec. 8\n(1) as\teanvassed on behalf of the appellant that cognizance\ncan only  be taken  upon a  police report and any other view\nwill render the safeguard under Sec. 5A illusory.\n",
        "p_31": "     It\t appears   well-established  that  an  investigation\ncontemplated by Sec. 5A must ordinarily be undertaken by the\npolice officers\t of the\t designated rank and except with the\npermission of  the Magistrate  bars investigation  by police\nofficers of  lower rank.  It may  be that  in a\t given\tcase\npermission granted  by the Magistrate for investigation by a\npolice officer\tof a rank lower than the designated rank may\nbe judicially  reviewable. If  in cases where any illegality\nor irregularity\t in the\t process of investigation under Sec.\n5A has\tbeen brought  to the notice of the court at an early\nstage, a  direction has been given for a fresh investigation\nby a  police officer  of the  designated rank.\tBut this  is\nsubject to  a well  recognised legal position that the court\nwould not  attach any  importance to  any illegality  in the\nmatter\tof  investigation  if  it  is  relied  upon  at\t the\nconclusion of  a trial\tin the\tabsence of prejudice pleaded\nand proved. The question is whether\n937\nthese aspects  are sufficient to provide an exception to the\nwell recognised\t general principle  apart from\tthe specific\npower conferred\t under Sec.  8(1) of  the 1952\tAct  on\t the\nspecial Judge  to take\tcognizance of the offences, the only\nexception being not upon a commitment to him that anyone can\nset the criminal law into motion ?\n",
        "p_32": "     Let us  therefore, turn  to some  of the  decisions  to\nwhich our attention was drawn to substantiate the submission\nthat Sec.  5A incorporates  a safeguard\t in  favour  of\t the\naccused. In  fact, it  is really  not necessary\t to  analyse\nthese decisions\t in detail to arrive at the ratio of each of\nthem  because  it  is  not  controverted  that\tSec.5A\tdoes\nincorporate a  safeguard but the parameters of the safeguard\nare against investigation by police officers of fairly lower\nrank once  the offences enumerated in Sec. 6 (1) (a) and (b)\nwere made  cognizable. The  limit of  the safeguard  is that\nordinarily  investigation   of\tsuch   offences\t  shall\t  be\nundertaken only\t by officers of the designated rank save and\nexcept with  the permission  of the Magistrate or as per the\nfirst proviso  to Sec.\t5A The\tsubmission is  that upon its\ntrue  evaluation,   the\t safeguard  clearly  points  in\t the\ndirection of  a prior investigation before cognizance of the\noffences can  be taken\tby the\tspecial Judge  and any other\nview would  dilute the\tsafeguard or  render it illusory. It\nwas also  submitted  that  if  defective  investigation\t can\nvitiate the  proceedings a fortiori the total absence of and\ninvestigation whatsoever  as contemplated  by Sec. 5A, which\nwould be the position if a private complaint can be directly\nentertained by the special Judge, would of necessity vitiate\nthe proceeding.\n",
        "p_33": "     The sheet\tanchor of the supmission was the decision of\nthis Court  in M.N.  Rishbud &\tInder Singh  v. The State of\nDelhi.(') In  that case\t the question posed was\t whether the\nprovision Sec.\t5A  of\tthe  1947  Act\trequiring  that\t the\ninvestigation into  the offences specified therein shall not\nbe conducted  by any  police officer  of a rank lower than a\nDeputy Superintendent  of Police  without the specific order\nof a  Magistrate, is  directory or  mandatory  ?  The  Court\nrendered the  opinion that  Sec. 5A  is\t mandatory  and\t not\ndirectory, and\tthat an investigation conducted in violation\nthereof bears  the stamp  of  illegality.  Thus\t so  far  as\ninvestigation  of  a  case  is\tconcerned,  this  Court\t has\nrecorded a  definite opinion  that investigation by a police\nofficer in  contravention of the provision contained in Sec.\n5A bears the stamp of illegality. What is the effect of this\n938\nillegality on  the outcome  of a  concluded trial  does\t not\narise  for   our  consideration\t  but  there   are   certain\nobservations which  were relied\t upon to  urge that  a prior\ninvestigation under  Sec. 5A  being held to be mandatory and\nas a  special Judge can take cognizance of an offence upon a\npolice report  submitted at  the end  of a  valid and  legal\ninvestigation in  consonance  with  Sec.  5A,  by  necessary\nimplication, taking  cognizance of  an offence\tby a special\nJudge under  Sec. 8(1)\tof 1952 Act upon a private complaint\nis excluded.  We must  frankly say  that we  find nothing in\nthis judgment even remotely to bear out the submission. Sec.\n5A is  a safeguard  against investigation by police officers\nlower in  rank than  designated officers. In this connection\nat page 1159, the Court has observed as under:\n",
        "p_34": "     This observation  will leave no room for doubt that the\nsafeguard  incorporated\t  in  Sec.   5A\t  is   one   against\ninvestigation by  police officer  of a\trank lower  than the\ndesignated  rank   and\tthat   the  Magistrate\t con  permit\ninvestigation by  police  officer  of  lower  rank.  It\t was\nhowever, urged\tthat the  three\t vital\tstages\trelevant  to\ninitiation of  proceedings in respect of offences enumerated\nin Sec.\t 6(1) (a)  and (b)  have been  clearly delineated in\nthis judgment  when at\tpage 1162  it  is  observed;  'trial\nfollows\t  cognizance   and   cognizance\t  is   preceded\t  by\ninvestigation.' This  is the  basic scheme  of the  Code  in\nrespect of cognizable offences but that too where in respect\nof a cognizable offence, the informant approaches an officer\nin charge\n939\nof a  police station.  When in\tthe  case  of  a  cognizable\noffence, a  police officer  on receipt\tof information of an\noffence\t proceeds   under  Chapter   XII,  he\tstarts\twith\ninvestigation and then submits his report, called the police\nreport, upon which cognizance is taken, and then follows the\ntrial. And these three stages in that chronology are set out\nwith regard to an investigation by an officer in charge of a\npolice station\tor a  police officer entitled to investigate\nany particular\toffence. This  sentence cannot\tbe  read  in\nisolation or  torn out of the context to lend support to the\nsubmission that\t in no\tcase cognizance can be taken without\nprior  investigation  under  Sec.  5A.\tIn  fact  the  Court\nproceeded to  make it  abundantly clear\t that 'a  defect  or\nillegality in  investigation however  serious, has no direct\nbearing on  the competence  or\tthe  procedure\trelating  to\ncognizance or  trial.' The Court examined the scheme of Secs\n190, 193  and 195  to 199  of the Code of Criminal Procedure\nand observed:  that 'the  language of  Sec. 190 is in marked\ncontrast with  that of the other sections of the group under\nthe same  heading i.e.\tSections 193  and 195  to 199. These\nlatter sections regulate the competence of the Court and bar\nits jurisdiction  in certain  cases excepting  in compliance\ntherewith, Section  190 does  not.' The\t Court concluded  by\nobserving 'that where the cognizance of the case has in fact\nbeen taken  and the  case has  proceeded to termination, the\ninvalidity of  the precedent  investigation does not vitiate\nthe result,  unless miscarriage\t of justice  has been caused\nthereby.' Having  minutely read\t this judgment on which firm\nreliance was  placed on\t behalf of  the appellant,  we\tfind\nnothing\t in   it  to   come  to\t  the  conclusion   that  an\ninvestigation under  Sec. 5A is a condition precedent before\ncognizance can\tbe taken  of  offences\ttriable\t by  special\nJudge. Reliance\t next was  placed upon\tthe decision of this\nCourt in The State of Madhya Pradesh v. Mubarak Ali (') This\nCourt held  that Sec  5A was  inserted in  the 1952  Act  to\nprotect\t the   public  servants\t  against   harassment\t and\nvictimization. If  it was in the interest of the public that\ncorruption should  be eradicated,  it  was  equally  in\t the\ninterest of the public that honest public servants should be\nable to\t discharge their  duties free  from false, frivolous\nand malicious  accusations. To achieve this object, Sections\n5A and\t6 introduced  the following  two safeguards;  (1) no\npolice\tofficer\t below\tthe  rank  of  a  designated  police\nofficer, shall investigate any offence punishable under Sec.\n161, Sec. 165 or Sec. 165A of the Indian Penal Code or under\nsub-Sec. (2) of Sec. 5A of the 1947 Act without the order of\na  Presidency\tMagistrate  and\t (2)  no  court\t shall\ttake\ncognizance of offences hereinabove enumerated\n940\nexcept\twith  the  previous  sanction,\tof  the\t appropriate\nGovernment. The\t Court held  that these statutory safeguards\nmust be\t complied with,\t for they  were conceived  in public\ninterest and  were provided as a guarantee against frivolous\nand vexatious  prosecutions. The Court further observed that\nthe Legislature\t was prepared  to believe  an officer  of an\nassured status\timplicity, and\tit prescribed  an additional\nguarantee that\tin the\tcase of\t police officers  below\t the\nrank, the  previous order  of a\t Presidency Magistrate\tor a\nMagistrate of  the first  class as  the case  may be.  Comes\nthereafter a  pertinent observation  'that the\tMagistrate's\nstatus\t gives\t assurance   to\t  the\tbonafides   of\t the\ninvestigation. 'This  would  rather  show  that\t Legislature\nwhile on the one hand conferred power on the police officers\nof  the\t  designated  rank   to\t take  upon  themselves\t the\ninvestigation of  offences committed  by public servants, it\nconsidered  intervention  of  the  Magistrate  as  the\treal\nsafeguard when investigation was permitted by officers lower\nin rank\t then the  designated officers.\t In other words, the\nCourt was  a safeguard\tand it\tought to  be so\t because the\njudicially trained  mind is  any day a better safeguard then\nany police officer or any rank. In State of Uttar Pradesh v.\nBhagwant Kishore  Joshi the  observation  of  the  Court  in\nMubarak Ali's  case was\t affirmed. In  S.N. Bose v. State of\nBihar.(2) this\tCourt held  that the order of the Magistrate\ngiving permission  to the Inspector of Police to investigate\nthe case  did not  give any  reasons and  there was  thus  a\nviolation of  Sec. 5A.\tYet this illegality committed in the\ncourse of  an investigation  does not  affect the competence\nand jurisdiction of the court for trial and where cognizance\nof the\tcase has  in  fact  been  taken\t and  the  case\t has\nproceeded to  termination the  invalidity of  the  preceding\ninvestigation  does   not  vitiate  the\t result\t unless\t the\nmiscarriage of\tjustice has  been  caused  thereby,  and  in\nreaching this  conclusion reliance was placed on the case of\nM.N. Rishbud  In P.  Sirajuddin\t etc.  v.  State  of  Madras\netc.(3) it  was held that' the Code of Criminal Procedure is\nan  enactment\tdesigned  inter\t  alia\tto   ensure  a\tfair\ninvestigation of  the allegations  against a  person charged\nwith criminal  misconduct. This is undeniable but has hardly\nany relevance. Some guidance is given to the enquiry officer\nand the\t means to  be adopted  in investigation of offences.\nThis has no bearing on the issue under discussion. Reference\nwas also  made to Union of India v. Mahesh Chandra Sharma(4)\nwhich does  not advance\t the case  at all.  Having carefully\nexamined\n941\nthese judgments\t in the\t light of  the submissions made, the\nonly conclusion\t that unquestionably emerges is that Sec. 5A\nis a  safeguard against\t investigation of offences committed\nby public  servants, by\t petty or lower rank police officer.\nIt has\tnothing to  do directly\t or indirectly with the mode\nand method  of taking cognizance of offences by the court of\nspecial Judge. It also follows as a necessary corollary that\nprovision of  Sec.  5A\tis  not\t a  condition  precedent  to\ninitiation of  proceedings  before  the\t special  Judge\t who\nacquires  power\t under\tSec.  8(1)  to\ttake  cognizance  of\noffences enumerated  in Sec.  6(1) (a)\tand (b),  with\tthis\nlimitation alone that is shall not be upon commitment to him\nby the Magistrate.\n",
        "p_35": "     Once the  contention on  behalf of\t the appellant\tthat\ninvestigation under  Sec. 5A is a condition precedent to the\ninitiation  of\t proceedings  before  a\t special  Judge\t and\ntherefore cognizance  of an  offence cannot  be taken except\nupon a\tpolice report,\tdoes not  commend to  us and  has no\nfoundation in  law, it\tis unnecessary\tto refer to the long\nline of decisions commencing from Taylor v Taylor, (1) Nazir\nAhamad v.  King Emperor (2) and ending with Chettiam Veettil\nAhmad and Anr. v. Taluk Land Board and Ors., (3) laying down\nhitherto uncontroverted legal principle that where a statute\nrequires to  do a  certain thing in a certain way, the thing\nmust be\t done in  that way  or not  at all  Other methods of\nperformance are necessarily forbidden.\n",
        "p_36": "     Once Sec.\t5A is out of the way in the matter of taking\ncognizance of  offences committed  by public  servants by  a\nspecial Judge,\tthe power  of  the  special  Judge  to\ttake\ncognizance of such offences conferred by Sec. 8(1) with only\none limitation,\t in any\t one of\t the known methods of taking\ncognizance of  offences by  courts of  original jurisdiction\nremains undented. One such statutorily recognised well-known\nmethod of taking cognizance of offences by a court competent\nto take\t cognizance is\tupon receiving\ta complaint of facts\nwhich constitutes  the offence.\t And Sec. 8(1) says that the\nspecial Judge  has the\tpower to take cognizance of offences\nenumerated in  Sec. 6(1)(a)  and (b)  and the  only mode  of\ntaking\tcognizance   excluded  by   the\t provision  is\tupon\ncommitment. It therefore, follows that the special Judge can\ntake cognizance of offences committed by\n942\npublic\tservants   upon\t receiving   a\tcomplaint  of  facts\nconstituting such offences.\n",
        "p_37": "     It was, however, submitted that even if it be held that\nthe  special  Judge  is\t entitled  to  entertain  a  private\ncomplaint, no  further steps  can be  taken by\thim  without\ndirecting  an\tinvestigation  under  Sec  5A  so  that\t the\nsafeguard of  Sec. 5A is not whittled down. This is the self\nsame argument  under a\tdifferent apparel.  Accepting such a\nsubmission would tantamount to saying that on receipt of the\ncomplaint the  special Judge  must direct  an  investigation\nunder Sec.  5A. There  is no  warrant for  such an approach.\nAstounding as  it appeared  to us,  in all  solemnity it was\nsubmitted that\tinvestigation of  an offence  by a  superior\npolice officer\taffords a more solid safeguard compared to a\ncourt.\tMyopic\t as  this  is,\tit  would  topsy  turvy\t the\nfundamental belief  that to  a person  accused of an offence\nthere is  no better  safeguard than  a court.  And  this  is\nconstitutionally epitomised  in Art.  22 that upon arrest by\npolice, the  arrested person  must be  produced\t before\t the\nnearest Magistrate  within twenty-four\thours of the arrest.\nFurther,  numerous   provisions\t of  the  Code\tof  Criminal\nprocedure such\tas Sec.\t 161, Sec  164, and  Sec. 25  of the\nIndian Evidence\t Act would show the Legislature's hesitation\nin placing  confidence on  police officers away from court's\ngaze. And  the very  fact  that\t power\tis  conferred  on  a\nPresidency Magistrate  or Magistrate  of the  first class to\npermit police  officers of  lower rank\tto investigate these\noffences would\tspeak for  the mind  of the Legislature that\nthe court  is a\t more reliable\tsafeguard than even superior\npolice officers.\n",
        "p_38": "     It was  urged that\t there is inherent evidence in other\nprovisions  of\tthe  1952  Act\tand  the  Code\tof  Criminal\nProcedure which\t would\tbuttress  the  submission  that\t the\nspecial\t Judge\t cannot\t take\tcognizance  upon  a  private\ncomplaint. Even\t if Sec.  8(1) confers\tspecific  powers  of\ntaking cognizance  of offences\twithout the necessity of the\naccused\t being\t committed  for\t trial\tand  prescribes\t the\nprocedure for  trial of\t warrant cases\tby Magistrates to be\nadopted by  a special  Judge, it  is necessary\tto determine\nwith accuracy  whether a  special Judge is a Magistrate or a\nSessions Judge.\t After referring to Sec. 8(3) which provides\nthat save  as provided\tin sub-sec. (1) or sub-sec. (2), the\nprovisions of  the Code of Criminal procedure, 1898 shall so\nfar as\tthey are not inconsistent with the 1952 Act apply to\nthe proceedings before a special Judge; and for the purposes\nof the\tsaid provisions,  the Court of a special Judge shall\nbe deemed to be a Court of Sessions trying cases without\n943\na jury\tor without  the aid  of\t assessors  and\t the  person\nconducting a  prosecution before  a special  Judge shall  be\ndeemed to  be a public prosecutor; it was urged that for the\npurpose of  procedure to  be followed  by a special Judge in\nthe trial  of the  case before\thim, he\t is a  Magistrate as\nprovided in  Sec. 8(1)\tbut not\t a Sessions Judge because no\nSessions Court\tcan  take  cognizance  of  offences  without\ncommitment while  a special  Judge has to take cognizance of\noffences without  accused being\t committed to  him for trial\nyet the\t provisions of sub-Secs. (2) and (3) leave no one in\ndoubt that  for all  other purposes he is to be treated as a\nSessions Judge\tor a  Court of Sessions. Proceeding along it\nwas urged  that if  a special Judge has all the trappings of\nthe Court of Sessions, he cannot take cognizance as provided\nby  Sec.  190,\tCr.  P.\t C.  because  it  confers  power  on\nMagistrate to  take cognizance\tof any offence in any one of\nthe  three  modes  therein  prescribed.\t Therefore,  it\t was\nsubmitted that a private complaint cannot be entertained.\n",
        "p_39": "     For more  than one\t reason it is not possible to accept\nthis submission.  If Sec.  190 cannot be availed, we fail to\nsee how a special Judge would be entitled to take cognizance\non a  police report.  If Sec.  190 is  not attracted all the\nthree modalities  of taking cognizance of offences would not\nbe available.  One cannot  pick and choose as it suits one's\nconvenience. Either  all the  three modalities are available\nor none.  And  Sec.  8(1)  which  confers  power  of  taking\ncognizance does\t not show  any\tpreference.  On\t this  short\nground, the submission must be rejected.\n",
        "p_40": "     It is,  however, necessary to decide with precision and\naccuracy the  position of a special Judge and the Court over\nwhich he  presides styled  as the  Court of  a special Judge\nbecause\t unending   confusions\t have\tarisen\t by   either\nassimilating him with a Magistrate or with a Sessions Court.\nThe Prevention\tof Corruption Act, 1947 was enacted for more\neffective prevention of bribery and corruption. Years rolled\nby and\texperience gathered  showed that  unless  a  special\nforum for  the trial  of such  offences as enumerated in the\n1947 Act  is created,  the object  underlying the  1947\t Act\nwould remain  a distant\t dream. This led to the enactment of\nthe Criminal  Law Amendment  Act,  1952.  The  Statement  of\nobjects and  Reasons accompanying  the Bill  refers  to\t the\nrecommendations of  the Committee  chaired by Dr. Bakshi Tek\nChand appointed\t to review the working of the Special Police\nEstablishment and to make recommendations for improvement of\nlaws relating  to bribery  and corruption. To take the cases\nof corruption out of the maze of cases handled\n944\nby Magistrates,\t it was\t decided to  set up  special courts.\nSec. 6 conferred power on the State Government to appoint as\nmany special  Judges as\t may be\t necessary with power to try\nthe offences  set out in clauses (a) and (b). Now if at this\nstage a\t reference is made to Sec. 6 of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure  which   provides  for  constitution\tof  criminal\ncourts, it  would become  clear that  a new court with a new\ndesignation was being set up and that it has to be under the\nadministrative and  judicial  superintendence  of  the\tHigh\nCourt. As  already pointed  out, there\twere four  types  of\ncriminal courts\t functioning under  the High  Court. To this\nlist was  added the court of a special Judge. Now when a new\ncourt which  is indisputably a criminal court because it was\nnot even  whispered that the Court of special Judge is not a\ncriminal  court,  is  set  up,\tto  make  it  effective\t and\nfunctionally oriented, it becomes necessary to prescribe its\npowers, procedure,  status  and\t all  ancillary\t provisions.\nWhile setting  up a court of a special Judge keeping in view\nthe fact that the high dignitaries in public life are likely\nto be  tried by\t such a\t court, the qualification prescribed\nwas that  the person to be appointed as special Judge has to\nbe either  a Sessions  Judge, Additional  Sessions Judge  or\nAssistant Sessions  Judge. These three dignitaries are above\nthe  level   of\t a   Magistrate.   After   prescribing\t the\nqualification, the  Legislature proceeded  to  confer  power\nupon a\tspecial Judge to take cognizance of offences for the\ntrial of  which a  special court with exclusive jurisdiction\nwas being  set up. If a special Judge has to take cognizance\nof offences,  ipso facto  the procedure\t for trial  of\tsuch\noffences has  to be  prescribed.  Now  the  Code  prescribes\ndifferent procedures for trial of cases by different courts.\nProcedure  for\t trial\tof  a  cases  by  different  courts.\nProcedure for  trial of a case before a Court of Sessions is\nset  out  in  Chapter  XVIII,  trial  of  warrant  cases  by\nMagistrates is\tset out\t in Chapter  XIX and  the provisions\ntherein included  catered to  both the types of cases coming\nbefore\tthe   Magistrate,  namely,  upon  police  report  or\notherwise than on a police report. Chapter XX prescribes the\nprocedure for  trial of\t summons cases\tby  Magistrates\t and\nChapter XXI  prescribes the procedure for summary trial. Now\nthat a\tnew criminal court was being set up, the Legislature\ntook the first step of providing its comparative position in\nthe hierarchy of courts under Sec. 6 Cr. P.C. by bringing it\non level  more or  less comparable to the Court of Sessions,\nbut  in\t  order\t to  avoid  any\t confusion  arising  out  of\ncomparison by  level, it  was made  explicit in\t Sec. 8\t (1)\nitself that  it is  not a  Court of  Sessions because it can\ntake  cognizance   of\toffences   without   commitment\t  as\ncontemplated by Sec. 193 Cr. P. C. Undoubtedly in Sec. 8 (3)\nit was clearly laid down that subject to the provi-\n",
        "p_41": "sions of  sub-Sec. (1)\tand (2)\t of Sec.  8,  the  Court  of\nspecial Judge  shall be\t deemed to  be a  Court of  Sessions\ntrying cases without a jury or without the aid of assessors.\nIn contra-distinction  to the  Sessions Court this new court\nwas to\tbe a court of original jurisdiction. The Legislature\nthen  proceeded\t  to  specify\twhich  out  of\tthe  various\nprocedures set\tout in the Code, this new court shall follow\nfor trial of offences before it. Sec 1 (1) specifically says\nthat a\tspecial Judge  in trial of offences before him shall\nfollow the  procedure prescribed  in the  Code\tof  Criminal\nProcedure for  trial of\t warrant cases\tby Magistrates.\t The\nprovisions for\ttrial of warrant cases by the Magistrate are\nto be  found in\t Chapter XXI  of 1898 Code. A glance through\nthe  provisions\t  will\tshow  that  the\t provisions  therein\nincluded catered  to both  the situations namely, trial of a\ncase initiated\tupon police  report (Sec. 251A) and trial of\ncases instituted otherwise than on police report (Sec 252 to\n",
        "p_42": "257). If  a special  Judge is  enjoined with  a duty  to try\ncases according\t to the\t procedure prescribed  in  foregoing\nprovisions he will have to first decide whether the case was\ninstituted upon\t a police report or otherwise than on police\nreport and  follow the\tprocedure in  the relevant  group of\nsections. Each\tof the\tSecs. 251A to 257 of 1898 Code which\nare in pari materia with Secs 238 to 250 of 1973 Code refers\nto what\t the Magistrate should do. Does the special Judge in\nSecs 238 to 250 wherever the expression 'Magistrate' occurs.\nThis is\t what is  called legislation  by the  incorporation.\nSimilarly, whether the question of taking congnizane arises,\nit  is\tfutile\tto  go\tin  search  of\tquestion  of  taking\ncongnizance arises,  it is  futile to  go in  search of\t the\nMagistrate to  take cognizance of the offence, special Judge\nis a  Magistrate? What is to be done is that one has to read\nthe expression\t'special Judge'\t in place of Magistrate, and\nthe whole  thing  becomes  crystal  clear.  The\t Legislature\nwherever it  found the\tgrey area  clarified  it  by  making\nspecific provision  such as  the one  in sub-s (2) of Sec. 8\nand to\tleave no one in doubt further provided in sub-s. (3)\nthat all  the provisions  of the  Code of Criminal Procedure\nshall so far as they are not inconsistent with the Act apply\nto the\tproceedings before a special Judge. At the time when\nthe 1952  Act was enacted what was in operation was the Code\nof Criminal  Procedure, 1898.  It did not envisage any Court\nof a  special Judge and the Legislature never wanted to draw\nup an  exhaustive Code\tof Procedure  for this\tnew criminal\ncourt which  was being set up. Therefore, it conferred power\n(taking cognizance of offences), prescribed procedure (trial\nof warrant  cases by  a Magistrate),  indicated authority to\ntender pardon  (Sec 338)  and then after declaring is status\nas comparable to a Court of Sessions proceeded to pres-\n",
        "p_43": "cribe that  all provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure\nwill apply  in so  far as they are not inconsistent with the\nprovisions of the 1952 Act. The net outcome of this position\nis that\t a new court of original jurisdiction was set up and\nwhenever a  question arose  as to  what are  its  powers  in\nrespect of  specific questions brought before it as court of\noriginal criminal  jurisdiction, it had to refer to the Code\nof Criminal Procedure undaunted by any designation claptrap.\nWhen taking cognizance, a Court of special Judge enjoyed the\npowers under  Sec. 190.\t When trying cases, it is obligatory\nto follow  the procedure  for trial  of warrant\t cases by  a\nMagistrate though  as and  by way  of status  it was equated\nwith a Court of Sessions. The entire argument inviting us to\nspecifically decide whether a court of a special Judge for a\ncertain purpose\t is a  Court of\t Magistrate or\ta  Court  of\nSessions revolves  round a  mistaken belief  that a  special\nJudge has  to be one or the other, and must fit in  the slot\nof a  Magistrate or  a Court  of Sessions.  Such an approach\nwould strangulate  the functioning  of the court and must be\neschewed. Shorn of all embellishment, the court or a special\nJudge is  a court  of original\tcriminal jurisdiction.\tAs a\ncourt of  original criminal jurisdiction in order to make it\nfunctionally oriented  some powers  were  conferred  by\t the\nstatute setting\t up the\t court.\t Except\t those\tspecifically\nconferred and  specifically denied,  it has to function as a\ncourt of original criminal jurisdiction not being hide bound\nby the\tterminological status description of Magistrate or a\nCourt of  Sessions. Under  the Code it will enjoy all powers\nwhich a\t court of original criminal jurisdiction enjoys save\nand except the ones specifically denied.\n",
        "p_44": "     Sec 9  of the 1952 Act would equally be helpful in this\nbehalf. Once court of a special Judge is a court of original\ncriminal  jurisdiction,\t  it  became  necessary\t to  provide\nwhether it  is subordinate to the High Court, whether appeal\nand revision  against its  judgments and orders would lie to\nthe High Court and whether the High Court would have general\nsuperintendence over a Court of special Judge as it has over\nall criminal  courts as\t enumerated in Sec. 6 of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure.  The court\tof  a  special\tJudge,\tonce\ncreated by  an independent  statute, has  been brought\tas a\ncourt of original criminal jurisdiction under the High Court\nbecause Sec.  9 confers\t on the\t High Court  all the  powers\nconferred by  Chapters\tXXXI  and  XXXIII  of  the  Code  of\nCriminal Procedure,  1898 on a High Court as if the court of\nspecial Judge  were a court of Sessions trying cases without\na jury\twithin the  local limits  of the jurisdiction of the\nHigh Court. Therefore, there is no gainsaying the fact that\n947\na  new\t criminal  court   with\t a   name,  designation\t and\nqualification of  the officer  eligible to  preside over  it\nwith powers  specified and the particular procedure which it\nmust follow  has been  set up  under the 1952 Act.

        "p_45": "     Once the  position and  power of the Court of a special\nJudge in  the hierarchy\t of criminal  courts under  the High\nCourt  is  clearly  and\t unambiguously\testablished,  it  is\nunnecessary to\troam into  an enquiry examining large number\nof decisions  laying down  in the  context of each case that\nthe Court  of a special Judge is a Court of Sessions and the\ncontrary view  taken in\t some other  decisions. Reference to\nthose judgments would be merely adding to the length of this\njudgment without achieving any useful purpose.\n",
        "p_46": "     It\t was   submitted  that\tthere  is  further  internal\nevidence pointing  in the direction that a private complaint\ncannot be  entertained by  a  special  Judge.  Sec.  225  in\nChapter XVIII containing provisions prescribing procedure of\ntrial before  a Court  of Sessions  provides that  'in every\ntrial before  a Court  of Sessions' the prosecution shall be\nconducted by  a Public\tProsecutor.' Last part of Sec. 8 (3)\nof the\t1952 Act  provides that'.... the person conducting a\nprosecution before  a special  Judge shall be deemed to be a\npublic prosecutor. It was urged that public prosecutions are\nordinarily launched  in the  name of  the State\t because  in\nmatters of  serious offences  the society  is interested  in\npunishing the  anti-social elements  who may  be a menace to\nsociety and  that such\tprosecution is\tnot  for  satisfying\nprivate lust or sense of vengeance. Proceeding along, it was\nstated that  the scheme\t of Criminal  Procedure Code clearly\nshows that  serious offences  are exclusively  triable by  a\nCourt of Sessions and that even if a commitment to the Court\nof Sessions  is made  upon an  inquiry held  by a Magistrate\ntaking cognizance  of the  offence on  a private  complaint,\nonce the  case is committed to a Court of Sessions, the role\nof the\tprivate complainant becomes insignificant. The State\ntakes over  the prosecution  and the public prosecutor shall\nnecessarily be\tin charge  of the  prosecution. And  it\t was\npointed out  that public  prosecutor  is  appointed  by\t the\nCentral\t or   the  State   Government.\tIt  was\t urged\tthat\nappointment of a public prosecutor under Sec. 24 of the Code\nof Criminal  Procedure is  a solemn  duty to be performed by\nthe Central or the State Government, as the case may be, and\nthat too after consultation with the High Court.\n",
        "p_47": "     And it  is such  public prosecutor\t who shall  alone be\nentitled to  conduct the  trial before Court of Sessions. In\norder to  acquaint us  with the\t role, the  dignity and\t the\nresponsibility of  a public  prosecutor, attention was drawn\nto Shwe\t Pru v.\t The King(1)  Amlesh Ceandra  & Ors.  v. The\nState, (1)  Raj Kishore\t Rabidas  v.  The  State.(2)  In  Re\nBhupalli Malliah  and Ors (3) and Medichetty Ramakistiah and\nOrs. v.\t The State  of Andhra  Pradesh (4)  These  decisions\npurport to  indicate the  objectivity and  the fairness with\nwhich a\t public prosecutor  in\tcharge\tof  the\t case  shall\nconduct the  prosecution and  it is  no part  of his duty to\nattempt to  obtain a conviction at all costs. His duty is to\nfairly analyse\tthe evidence for and against the accused and\nthat he should not withheld any evidence which has a bearing\non the\tissues before  the court. In other words, he must be\nfair and objective in his approach to the case animated by a\ndesire to  vindicate justice  and no more. It was urged that\nif this\t be the well-recognised role of a public prosecutor,\nhow horrendous\tit would  appear if  a\tprivate\t complainant\nmotivated by a desire to wreck vengeance against the accused\nis to  be deemed to be a public prosecutor. It was said that\nsuch a\tprivate complainant cannot be elevated to the status\nof a  public prosecutor\t but the  deeming fiction enacted in\nlatter part  of Sec.  8 (3)  would clothe  him with  such  a\nstatus of  a public prosecutor which he was hardly qualified\nto enjoy.  As a\t second string\tto the bow, it was said that\nSec. 321 of the Code of Criminal Procedure generally confers\npower on  a public  prosecutor to  withdraw the\t prosecution\nsubject to limitations therein prescribed. The submission is\nthat if\t a private  complainant who  chooses to\t conduct his\ncase and  thereby enjoys  the  status  of  a  deemed  public\nprosecutor he would be able to poute the fountain of justice\nby initiating  some frivolous  prosecution and then withdraw\nit if  his palms  are greased.\tIt was\talso said  that\t the\naccused may  put up  a bogus complainant and make a pretence\nof trial  and escape  a serious\t prosecution upon high level\ninvestigation. These are wild imaginings, irrelevant for the\npurpose of construction of a provision in a statute. Further\nthis submission\t overlooks the vital role that the court has\nto play\t before any  prosecution can  be  withdrawn  at\t the\ninstance of  a public  prosecutor. That\t a public prosecutor\nmay abuse  his office  is not determinative as to who should\nbe a public\n949\nprosecutor. The\t deeming fiction  enabled in  Sec. 8  (3) is\nconfined to the limits of its requirement in that the person\nconducting a  prosecution before  a special  Judge is  to be\ndeemed to  be a\t public prosecutor.  In fact,  this  fiction\ncreated by  Sec. 8 (3) would rather negative the argument of\nthe appellant  that a private complaint is not maintainable,\ninasmuch as  the Legislature could have inserted a provision\nanalogous to  Sec. 225\tthat a\tprosecution before a special\nJudge shall  be conducted  by a\t public prosecutor.  On\t the\ncontrary, conscious of the position that a private complaint\nmay be\tfiled before a special Judge who may take cognizance\nof the\toffences on such a complaint, the Legislature wanted\nto clothe  the person  in charge of the prosecution before a\nspecial Judge with the status of a public prosecutor for the\npurposes of  the Code  of Criminal  Procedure.\tThis  is  an\nadditional reason why the contention of the appellant that a\nprivate complaint is not maintainable cannot be entertained.\n",
        "p_48": "     It was  then submitted  that if  the object  underlying\n1952 Act  was to provide for a more speedy trial of offences\nof corruption  by a  public servant,  this  laudable  object\nwould be  thwarted  if\tit  is\tever  held  that  a  private\ncomplaint can  be entertained by a special Judge. Developing\nthe argument it was pointed out that assuming that a private\ncomplaint  is\tmaintainable  before  taking  cognizance,  a\nspecial Judge  will have  to examine the complainant and all\nthe witnesses  present as  enjoined by\tSec. 200.  The Judge\nthereafter ordinarily will have to postpone issue of process\nagainst the  accused,  and  either  inquire  into  the\tcase\nhimself or  direct an  investigation to\t be made by a police\nofficer and  in cases  under the 1947 Act by police officers\nof designated  rank for\t the purpose  of deciding whether or\nnot  there   is\t sufficient  ground  for  proceeding.  (Sec.\n202(1)). If  the Judge proceeds to hold the inquiry himself,\nhe is  obliged to take evidence on oath but it was said that\nif the\tCourt of  special Judge\t is a Court of Sessions, the\ncase would  be governed by proviso to sub-s (2) of Sec. 202,\nCr P.C.\t and that  therefore, he  will have to call upon the\ncomplainant to produce all his witnesses and examine them on\noath. This  would certainly  thwart a  speedy trial  was the\napprehension disclosed and therefore, it was said that there\nis internal  contra-indication that  a private\tcomplaint is\nnot maintainable.  We find  no merit  in the submissions. As\nhas been distinctly made clear that a Court of special Judge\nis a court of original criminal jurisdiction and that it can\ntake cognizance\t of an\toffence in  the manner\thereinbefore\nindicated, it  may be  that in\torder to  test\twhether\t the\ncomplaint disclosed  a serious\toffence or that there is any\nfrivolity involved  in it, the Judge may insist upon holding\nan\n950\ninquiry by  postponing the  issue of process. When a private\ncomplaint is filed, the court has to examine the complainant\non oath save in the cases set out in the proviso to Sec. 200\nCr.P.C.\t After\t examining  the\t  complainant  on  oath\t and\nexamining the  witnesses present,  if any,  meaning  thereby\nthat the  witnesses not\t present need  not be  examined,  it\nwould open  to the  court to  judicially determine whether a\ncase is\t made out  for issuing process. When it is said that\ncourt  issues\tprocess,  it   means  the  court  has  taken\ncognizance of  the offence  and has  decided to initiate the\nproceeding  and\t  as  a\t  visible  manifestation  of  taking\ncognizance, process  is issued\twhich means that the accused\nis called  upon to  appear before the court. This may either\ntake the from of a summons or a warrant, as the case may be.\nIt may\tbe that\t after examining  the  complainant  and\t his\nwitnesses, the\tcourt in  order to  doubly assure itself may\npostpone the issue of process, and call upon the complainant\nto keep\t his witnesses present. The other option open to the\ncourt is  to direct  investigation to  be made\tby a  police\nofficer. And  if the offence is one covered by the 1947 Act,\nthe investigation,  if directed,  shall be  according to the\nprovision  contained   in  Sec.\t 5A  But  it  must  be\tmade\ndistinctly clear  that it  is neither obligatory to hold the\ninquiry before\tissuing process\t to direct the investigation\nof the\toffence by  police. The\t matter is  in the  judicial\ndiscretion  of\t the  court  and  is  judicially  reviewable\ndepending upon\tthe material disclosed by the complainant in\nhis statement  under oath  under Sec.  200,  called  in\t the\nparlance of  criminal courts  verification of  the complaint\nand evidence of witnesses if any. It was however, urged that\nif Sec.\t 5A can\t be dispensed with by holding that a private\ncomplaint is  maintainable, the\t court atleast should ensure\npre-process safeguard  by insisting  upon the examination of\nall witnesses that the complainant seeks to examine and this\nwill be\t counter-productive as far as the object of a speedy\ntrial is  concerned. Viewed  from either  angle, there is no\nmerit  in   this  submission.\tPrimarily,  examination\t  of\nwitnesses even at a preprocess stage by special Judge is not\nno the\tfooting that  case is exclusively triable by a Court\nof Sessions as contemplated by Sec. 202(2) proviso. There is\nno commitment  and therefore,  Sec. 202(2)  proviso  is\t not\nattracted.  Similarly,\ttill  the  process  is\tissued,\t the\naccused does  not come\tinto the  picture He  may physically\nattend but  is not  entitled to take part in the proceeding.\n(See Smt.  Nagawwa v.  Veeranna Shivalingappa  Konjalgi\t and\nOrs. (1))  Upon a  complaint being  received and  the  court\nrecords the verification, it is open to\n951\nthe court  to apply  its mind  to the facts disclosed and to\njudicially determine whether process should or should not be\nissued. It  is not  a condition\t precedent to  the issue  of\nprocess that the court of necessity must hold the inquiry as\nenvisaged by  Sec. 202\tor direct  investigation as  therein\ncontemplated. The  power to  take cognizance without holding\ninquiry or  directing investigation  is implicit in Sec. 202\nwhen it\t says that  the Magistrate  may if  he\tthinks\tfit,\npostpone the issue of process against the accused and either\ninquire into  the case himself or direct an investigation to\nbe made by a police officer..... for the purpose of deciding\nwhether or  not there  is sufficient ground for proceeding.'\nTherefore, the\tmatter is left to the judicial discretion of\nthe court  whether on  examining  the  complainant  and\t the\nwitnesses if  any as  contemplated  by\tSec.  200  to  issue\nprocess or to postpone the issue of process. This discretion\nwhich the  court enjoys cannot be circumscribed or denied by\nmaking it  mandatory upon  the\tcourt  either  to  hold\t the\ninquiry or  direct investigation.  Such an approach would be\ncontrary to  the statutory provision. Therefore, there is no\nmerit in  the contention  that\tby  entertaining  a  private\ncomplaint, the\tpurpose of speedy trial would be towarted or\nthat a pre-process safeguard would be denied.\n",
        "p_49": "     Further when cognizance is taken on a private complaint\nor to  be precise  otherwise than  on a\t police report,\t the\nspecial Judge has to try the case according to the procedure\nprescribed for\ttrial of  warrant cases instituted otherwise\nthan on\t police report\tby a  Magistrate (Sec. 252 to 258 of\n1898 Code  of Criminal\tProcedure). Sec.  252 requires\tthat\nwhen accused  is brought  before a  court, the\tcourt  shall\nproceed to  hear the  complainant and take all such evidence\nas may\tbe produced  in support\t of the prosecution. Accused\nhas a  right to cross examine complainant and his witnesses.\nIf upon\t considering the  evidence so  produced,  the  court\nfinds that  no case  against the  accused has  been made out\nwhich, if  undebutted, would  warrant  his  conviction,\t the\ncourt shall  discharge the  accused (Sec.  253 ibid). If, on\nthe other  hand, the  court is\tof the opinion that there is\nground for  presuming that  the\t accused  has  committed  an\noffence, which the court is competent to try, a charge shall\nbe framed  in writing  against the  accused (Sec. 254 ibid).\nAfter the  accused pleads  not guilty  to  the\tcharge,\t all\nprosection witnesses  examined before  the charge  shall  be\nrecalled for  further  cross  examination.  Prosecution\t may\nexamine additional  witnesses  whom  the  accused  would  be\nentitled to  cross examine. Thereafter the accused may enter\non his\tdefence and  may examine  witness in  defence.\tThis\nprocedure  provides   more  adequate   safeguard  than\t the\ninvestigation\n952\nby police  officer of  designated rank and therefore, search\nfor fresh or additional safeguard is irrelevant.\n",
        "p_50": "     It was  however urged  that while making the provisions\nof the\tCode of\t Criminal Procedure,  1898 applicable  to an\nProceeding in  relation to an offence punishable under Secs.\n161, 165  and 165  IPC and  under Sec.\t5 of  the 1947\tAct,\nmodification was  considered necessary in sub-s. (8) of Sec.\n251A which  prescribed procedure  for trial of warrant cases\ninstituted upon\t a  police  report  while  no  corresponding\namendment was made in any of the provisions contained in the\nsame Chapter  which prescribed\tprocedure for  warrant cases\ninstituted otherwise  than on  police report  and that\tthis\nwold show  that a private complainant which will be required\nto be  tried according to the procedure prescribed for trial\nof warrant  cases instituted  otherwise\t than  on  a  police\nreport was  not within the contemplation of the Legislature.\nThe modification made in sub-s. (8) of Sec. 251A is marginal\nand minimal.  It is  to the effect that instead of the words\n'the accused  shall then  be called  upon'  the\t words\t'the\naccused shall  then be\trequired to give in  writing at once\nor within  such time  as the Magistrate may allow, a list of\npersons (if  any)  whom\t he  proposes  to  examined  as\t his\nwitnesses and  all  the\t documents  (if\t any)  on  which  he\nproposes to  rely, and he shall then be called upon to enter\nhis defence'  shall be\tsubstituted. It\t was urged  that  no\ncorresponding amendment\t was made in Sec. 256 of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure,  1898 and  that  this  glaring  omission\nwould clearly  indicate that  the procedure  prescribed\t for\ntrial of  warrant cases\t otherwise than on police report was\nnot within the contemplation for the trial of offences under\nthe 1947 Act. Sec. 251A came to be introduced in the Code of\nCriminal Procedure,  1898 in  1955. Prior  thereto there was\nuniform procedure  for trial  of warrant cases by Magistrate\nirrespective of\t whether the case was instituted on a police\nreport or otherwise than on a police report. By the Amending\nAct, 1955,  two different  procedures came  to be prescribed\nfor trial of warrant cases (i) under Sec. 251A in respect of\ncases instituted on a police report and (ii) Sec. 252 to 258\nin cases  instituted otherwise than on a police report. This\ndistinction with  some modification has been retained in the\nCode of\t Criminal  Procedure,  1973.  The  Legislature\tmade\ncertain modifications in the procedure applicable to warrant\ncases instituted  otherwise than  on police report, but left\nthe other  provisions applicable  to trial  of warrant cases\ninstituted otherwise  that  on\tpolice\treport\tintact.\t The\nLegislature in\tits wisdom  may have considered it necessary\nto make\t changes in  one procedure  and not in the other. It\nshould not be\n953\nforgotten that\tprior to  1955, the  procedure for  trial of\nwarrant cases  instituted on  a police\treport and otherwise\nthan on\t police report\twas the same and the Act of 1952 set\nup the\tCourt of  special Judge\t to try cases under the 1947\nAct and\t the trial was to be held according to the procedure\nprescribed for trial of warrant case. It necessarily follows\nthat between  1952 to 1955, the Court of special Judge would\nhave followed  the  same  procedure  for  trial\t of  a\tcase\ninstituted upon\t a police  report or  otherwise\t than  on  a\npolice report.\tIf in  1955, the  Legislature prescribed two\ndifferent procedures  and left\tthe one for trial of warrant\ncases instituted  otherwise than on police report intact and\nthe position  remained unaltered even after the introduction\nof Sec\t7A. it is not suggestive of such a grave consequence\nthat a\tprivate complaint  is not  maintainable.  Therefore,\nthis additional limb does not advance the case any further.\n",
        "p_51": "     The learned  Judges composing the Division Bench of the\nHigh  Court   by  their\t separate  judgments  negatived\t the\ncontention of  the appellant holding that for the purpose of\ntaking cognizance  of an offence under the 1947 Act, special\nJudge was  a Magistrate\t and can take cognizance as provided\nby Sec,\t 190 of\t the Code of Criminal Procedure. In reaching\nthis conclusion,  the learned Judges were largely influenced\nby the\tdecision in  State of Tamil Nadu v. V. Krishnnaswami\nNaidu &\t Anr., (1) in which this Court held that the special\nJudge functioning  under Sec.  8 (1) is a Magistrate for the\npurposes of Sec. 167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. They\nalso relied upon the decision in Parasnath Pande and Anr. v.\nState(2) wherein  a Division  Bench of the Bombay High Court\nheld that a report submitted upon an investigation, which is\nfound to be defective, can be treated as a private complaint\nof  the\t  police  officer   submitting\tthe  report  and  if\ncongnizance is\ttaken on  such complaint,  it would  not  be\ninvalid. It  was said  that these  decisions run  counter to\nsome decisions of this Court. It is not necessary to examine\nthis aspect because as pointed out by us, a court of special\nJudge is a court of original criminal jurisdiction and it is\nnot necessary to treat him either a Magistrate or a Court of\nSessions save  and except  in respect  of specific provision\nwherein it  is so  provided. There  is the third decision in\nthis context,  which may  be briefly  referred to  here.  In\nJagdish Prasad\tVerma v.  The State, (3) a Division Bench of\nthe\n954\nPatna High  Court held\tthat  the  special  Judge  can\ttake\ncognizance  upon   receiving  a\t complaint  of\tfacts  which\nconstitute the\toffence or  even upon  information  received\nfrom any  person other than a police officer or upon his own\nknowledge of  suspicion that the offence has been committed.\nThis was treated as so obvious by the court that there is no\ndiscussion in  support of  the conclusion.  However, we\t are\nsatisfied that\tthese decisions\t lay down the correct law on\nthe point of maintainability of private complaint.\n",
        "p_52": "     Having examined  the  matter  from\t all  the  different\nangles, we are satisfied that the conclusion reached both by\nthe learned  special Judge  and Division Bench of the Bombay\nHigh Court that a private complaint filed by the complainant\nwas  clearly  maintainable  and\t that  the  cognizance,\t was\nproperly taken,\t is correct.  Accordingly, this appeal fails\nand is dismissed.\n"

This order shall dispose of plaintiffs' application under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 read with Section 151 of Code of Civil Procedure seeking restraint against the defendant from using his registered trade mark 'MEROMER' alleged to be deceptively similar to the plaintiffs' trade mark 'MERONEM' and defendant's application under Order XXXIX Rule 4 read with Section 151 of Code of Civil Procedure to vacate the interim order dated 6th October, 2005 whereby defendant was restrained from selling, marketing or in any manner dealing with pharmaceutical product under the name 'MEROMER'.\n",
        "p_3": "2. Brief facts to comprehend the disputes between the parties are that plaintiffs filed the suit for permanent injunction seeking restraint of infringement of their trade mark and passing off of his products by the defendant as that of plaintiff contending that plaintiff No. 1, Astrazeneca U.K. Limited, is a company constituted under the laws of England having its registered office at London which was formed as a result of the merger of two world renowned pharmaceutical groups, namely, Astra AB incorporated in Sweden and its subsidiary Zeneca Ltd. incorporated in the United Kingdom. It was asserted that pursuant to merger of Astra AB and Zeneca, plaintiff No. 1 became the assignee of registered trade mark 'MERONEM' bearing registration No. 532328 in class 5 in India from Zeneca Limited. Zeneca Ltd. had obtained the registration in its name on 27th June, 1990 which is valid and subsisting till 26th June, 2014 and this was assigned by Zeneca Limited in favor of plaintiff No. 1 by deed of assignment dated 4th January, 2000. It was further stated that another deed of assignment dated 9th August, 2000 was executed by Zeneca Limited to facilitate formal registration of the assignment of several of Zeneca's trade marks including 'MERONEM' and this assignment deed dated 9th August, 2000 along with form TM 24 was lodged with the Registrar of trade mark by letter dated 28th March, 2001 and the application is pending with the trade mark Registry, Bombay. The plaintiff No. 1 thus claimed all the rights in respect of registered trade mark 'MERONEM' until 26th June, 2014. Plaintiff No. 2, AstraZeneca Pharma India Limited, is stated to be a company incorporated in India which entered into a license agreement dated 1st March, 2002 with plaintiff No. 1 to use the trade mark 'MERONEM'.\n",
        "p_4": "3. The plaintiffs contended that the drug under the brand name 'MERONEM' is marketed by plaintiff No. 1 since 1995-96 in over 89 countries. Drug of the plaintiffs 'MERONEM' is a pharmaceutical preparation of 'MEROPENEM' which is a sterile dry powder for intravenous injection or infusion which has to be reconstituted before injecting and/or infusing intravenously. This drug belongs to carbapenem group of antibiotics and is used for curing serious life threatening infections such as Pneumonias and Nosocomial Pneumonias; Urinary tract infections; Intra abdominal infections; Gynaecological infections such as endometrIT is and pelvic inflammatory disease; Skin and skin structure infections, meningitis, septicaemia and Empiric treatment for presumed infections in adult patients with febrile neutropema used as mono-therapy or used in combination with antiviral or antifungal agents.\n",
        "p_5": "4. The dosages and administration of the drug depends on the age of the patient and the type and severity of the infection and it is administered as an intravenous bolus injection or by intravenous infusion. For intravenous bolus injection, the solution is made with sterile water and for using intravenous infusion, it is constituted with compatible infusion fluids. It is a prescription drug largely available at hospital pharmacies.\n",
        "p_6": "5. M/s. Zeneca Limited had launched the plaintiffs' drug 'MERONEM' in the United Kingdom in 1995 and plaintiff No. 2 had introduced it in the Indian market in March 2000. It was stated by the plaintiffs that the drug sold by them in India has a shelf-life of four years. The plaintiffs stated that they have spent and continued to spend considerable amounts by way of promotional expenditure on their brand 'MERONEM'. According to plaintiffs the medical fraternity, trade and consumers throughout the world and more particularly in India associate the drug only with the registered trademark 'MERONEM' and this trademark of plaintiffs has clear distinctiveness and is associated with the plaintiffs exclusively in India and worldwide.\n",
        "p_7": "6. It was asserted that plaintiffs learnt about the launch of the defendant's drug `MEROMER' sometime in early 2005. Medicinal preparation of the defendant was stated to be identical to that of plaintiffs and is sold in India in vials of 500 miligrams and 1 gram. Plaintiffs were emphatic that the composition, dosage and antibacterial spectrum of the plaintiffs product and the defendant's products, sold under their respective mark are also more or less the same/identical. It was categorically pleaded that the stark difference between the drug sold by plaintiffs under the registered trademark 'MERONEM' and the drug sold by the defendant, under the mark 'MEROMER' is that while the plaintiffs drug has been approved for a shelf life of four years, the defendant's drug has been approved for a shelf life of only two years. On the basis of the difference of the shelf life it was contended that there is considerable higher possibility and likelihood of deception and confusion between the drugs sold under the plaintiffs registered trademark 'MERONEM' vis- a-vis the drug sold by the defendant under the mark 'MEROMER'.\n",
        "p_8": "7. The plaintiffs also challenged the sale of drug Meropenem by the defendant under the mark 'MEROMER' on the ground that the trade names of the plaintiffs and defendant are deceptively similar and the defendant is also resorting to the same colour scheme or blue and red. Allowing the defendant to continue the use of the trademark 'MEROMER' would create an impression amongst consumers in the trade that the trademark of the defendant is also connected with the plaintiffs and their business or that the goods sold by the defendant are being sold and manufactured under the sponsorship and with the approval of the plaintiffs. In the circumstances plaintiffs claim restraint against the defendant from using, selling, offering for sale, exporting, advertising, marketing and/or in any other manner dealing with any medicinal or pharmaceutical preparation or drug under the trademark 'MEROMER'.\n",
        "p_9": "8. On an interim application of the plaintiffs an ex-parte ad interim order was passed in favor of plaintiffs restraining the defendant from using the similar trademark 'MEROMER' which is deceptively similar to that of plaintiffs and the defendant was restrained from selling, marketing or in any manner dealing with the pharmaceutical products under the brand name 'MEROMER' by order dated 6.10.2005.\n",
        "p_10": "9. The defendant has contested the claim of the plaintiffs contending inter-alia that the trademark 'MEROMER' was adopted in an honest manner after taking all necessary safeguards prior to its adoption. It was pleaded that the defendant is in the business of manufacturing and selling various bulk drugs and formulations and had set up a plant at the cost of Rs. 1.68 crores to manufacture the molecule Meropenem. Before launching the formulation under the trademark 'MEROMER' a search was conducted at the office of the Trademark Registry and several pending trademark applications and registered trademarks with the prefix `MERO' were found and consequently defendant opted to register the trademark 'MEROMER' with prefix `MERO'. According to the defendant the prefix MERO is common to the trade and no single person or entity can claim exclusive rights to the same.\n",
        "p_11": "10. The defendant had also filed an application for registration of his trademark 'MEROMER' under number 1299987 dated 2.8.2004 in Class 5 and his application after due examination and in accordance with law is stated to have been allowed and a registration certificate dated 1.12.2005 was issued, a copy of which was filed by the defendant during the pendency of the case and consequent to the registration of the trademark of the defendant it has been asserted that the plaintiffs are not entitled for any relief on the basis of infringement of their registered trademark as the mark of the defendant is also registered and the trademark of the defendant shall relate back to the date of application which is prior to the date of institution of the suit. The defendant also contended that since plaintiffs and defendant are both having registered trademarks, the plaintiffs cannot exercise their rights on the basis of registered trademark against the defendant who also owns a registered trademark. It was further pleaded that the registration with respect to the trademark 'MEROMER' was completed on 30.8.2005 even prior to the institution of the suit. The mark of the defendant was stated to have been advertised in trademark journal No. 1328 Supplement 4 dated 28.2.2005 at page 329 and the time prescribed for filing opposition to the grant of registration on Form TM-5 expired on 30.8.2005 and no person including plaintiffs filed an opposition and, therefore, the mark 'MEROMER' for which an application for registration was filed was deemed to be registered on 30.8.2005 as no objection to the registration of the mark was filed by anyone including plaintiffs. Relying on the report of the Trademark Registry dated 20.9.2004 defendant contended that even an expert body like trademark Registry has not considered the trademark 'MEROMER' of the defendant as a conflicting mark in its examination report.\n",
        "p_12": "11. During the pendency of the present suit, the plaintiffs also filed a rectification application first before the Registrar and thereafter before the Appellate Board. Regarding the rectification proceedings initiated by plaintiff No. 1 before the Registrar of Trademarks and Intellectual Property Appellate Board it was pleaded by the defendant that the application has been filed by the plaintiff No. 1 without following the procedure. The application was alleged to be barred under Section 125 of the Trademarks Act, as when a suit is pending rectification application lies before the Intellectual Property Board and realizing his mistake the plaintiff No. 1 has filed yet another application before the Intellectual Property Appellate Board in contravention of procedure prescribed under Section 124 of the Trademarks Act and consequently no rectification application is pending as the plaintiffs were not entitled to file an application suo motto without the prima facie approval of the Court.\n",
        "p_13": "12. Regarding his mark 'MEROMER', the defendant contended that prefix `MERO' is common to the trade and cannot be appropriated by the plaintiffs alone. Relying on trade practices it was stated that as there are number of trademarks which are used in pharmaceutical industry with a common prefix derived from the generic name Meropenem, the defendant is entitled to use the mark `Meromer'. The plaintiffs and the defendant are marketing the molecule `meropenem' and the only difference between the two products is the shelf life and of course the price, as the drug marketed by the defendant is cheaper.\n",
        "p_14": "13. The defendant also refuted the allegations of the plaintiffs that they are the registered proprietors of trademark 'MERONEM'. It was stated that the certificate produced by the plaintiffs show that the mark 'MERONEM' is registered under number 532328 in Class 5 in favor of Zeneca Ltd which is not a party to the proceedings and the search conducted on 30.11.2005 shows that the mark is still registered in the name of Zeneca Ltd and, therefore, the plaintiffs are not the proprietors of the trademark 'MERONEM' and since neither of the plaintiffs are the registered proprietors of the trademark they are not entitled to institute the suit for infringement of the registered trademark. The defendant also highlighted the discrepancies in the statements made on behalf of plaintiffs in their pleadings. It was stated that the plaint is based on the merger of Astra AB incorporated in Sweden with its merger with Zeneca Ltd whereas in another affidavit the plea raised by the plaintiffs is that Astra AB of Sweden merged with Zeneca plc. Zeneca Ltd is not the Zeneca plc and in the pleadings in the plaint no mention of Zeneca plc was made. The assignment deed dated 4.1.2000 produced by the plaintiffs was also contended to be fabricated as assignment deed dated 4.1.2000 shows Zeneca Ltd. as an existing company which could not be after merger of Zeneca Ltd. with Astra AB.\n",
        "p_15": "14. Regarding the passing off action it was pleaded that added material is sufficient to distinguish the product of the defendant and so no passing off action can be taken against the defendant also on account of surrounding circumstances and the trade practices and trade channels through which the goods pass. According to defendant the mark 'MEROMER' and 'MERONEM' are not phonetically, visually or in any other manner deceptively similar to each other and their marketing is also done in different manner. Plaintiffs sell their product in beehive cartons of 10 vials and not in a carton for individual vial whereas the defendant sells the goods in mono cartons. The shape of the vials of the plaintiffs and defendant were also stated to be different as well as the colours used by them. The plaintiffs are stated to be using blue colour for its vial of 500 mg whereas defendant use red colour for 500 mg. For 1000 mg vial plaintiffs use red colour whereas defendant use blue and the style of writing adopted by plaintiffs and defendant are also stated to be different and the name of the manufacturer is clearly mentioned so as to lead to no confusion. Refuting the possibility of confusion it was stated that the drug is to be administered by trained professionals and there cannot be any confusion.\n",
        "p_16": "15. The emphasis was laid by the defendant on the price of the drug of the plaintiffs and the defendant. The only difference which has also been admitted by the plaintiffs is the shelf life. The shelf life of plaintiffs drug is four years whereas shelf life of defendant's drug is two years, however, the price difference is substantial. The price of plaintiffs drug is approximately Rs. 1200/- whereas the price of defendant's drug is about 2/3rd of the price of the plaintiffs.\n",
        "p_17": "16. The defendant has also sought vacation of the ex-parte ad interim order passed in favor of plaintiffs on the ground that plaintiffs were not the first manufacturer/marketer to adopt the prefix MERO and plaintiffs cannot allege that they have bonafide grievance against the defendant. The plaintiffs have mislead the Court and obtained the interim order by suppressing the facts. It is also contended that the balance of convenience is in favor of defendant as the defendant had already launched its goods in the market in November, 2004 and has invested 1.68 crores in setting up the manufacturing unit and the drugs of about 1.5 crores are in the stock to be marketed. The defendant also contended that interim injunction will cause irreparable loss and hardship as defendant is the largest pharmaceutical company in India which commenced business in 1992. The action of the plaintiffs have also been challenged on the ground that the plaintiffs have not taken any action against other persons and companies using the prefix MERO in their trade name and marketing the same drug.\n",
        "p_18": "17. I have heard the learned Counsels for the parties, Dr. Singhvi for the plaintiffs and Mr. Sundaram for the defendant, in great details for a number of days. The suit is at a stage when the existence of the rights of the plaintiffs and their violations are contested and uncertain. The rights of the plaintiffs are still to be established after the trial on evidence. Considering the magnitude of the sale of drug of both the parties the Court will have to go by the principle of `balance of inconvenience' which will be who will be more inconvenienced in case the injunction as prayed for by the plaintiff is granted or not granted and who will suffer irreparable loss. The principle enunciated by the Apex Court in the case of Wander Ltd. and Anr. v. Antox India (P) Ltd. be a guiding principle to resolve this controversy. In this case it was held by the Supreme Court as under:\n",
        "p_19": "'Usually, the prayer for grant of an interlocutory injunction is at a stage when the existence of the legal right asserted by the plaintiff and its alleged violation are both contested and uncertain and remain uncertain till they are established at the trial on evidence. The Court, at this stage, acts on certain well settled principles of administration of this form of interlocutory remedy which is both temporary and discretionary. The object of the interlocutory injunction, it stated:\n",
        "p_20": "...is to protect the plaintiff against injury by violation of his rights for which he could not adequately be compensated in damages recoverable in the action if the uncertainty were resolved in his favor at the trial. The need for such protection must be weighed against the corresponding need of the defendant to be protected against injury resulting form his having been prevented from exercising his own legal rights for which he could not be adequately compensated.\n",
        "p_21": "In the circumstances, this Court must weigh plaintiffs' need against the defendant's and determine where the 'balance of convenience lies and preserve the status quo in respect of rights of the parties which will appear on a prima facie case. This task is slightly more difficult because the defendant has already commenced his enterprise and production and substantial amount of his drug is in stock and in the market.\n",
        "p_22": "18. Broad similarities and dis-similarities between the products of the plaintiffs and defendant, who are marketing the same drug Meropenem which is used for curing life threatening infection, with only difference in their shelf life, are extracted in following table.",
        "p_23": "19. The defendant has produced a certificate of registration of his trade mark 'Meromer' which is dated 1st December, 2005 during the pendency of the case. His plea is that the registration will date back to the date of the application which is 2nd August, 2004 Perusal of the provision of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 demonstrate that the registration of the trade mark will relate back to the date of the application. Section 23 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 is as under:\n",
        "p_24": "23. Registration. '(1) Subject to the provisions of Section 19, when an application for registration of a trade mark has been accepted and either-\n",
        "p_25": "(a) the application has not been opposed and the time for notice of the opposition has expired; or\n \n\n",
        "p_26": "(b) the application has been opposed and the opposition has been decided in favor of the applicant, the registrar shall, unless the Central Government otherwise directs, register the said trade mark and the trade mark when registered shall be registered as of the date of the making of the said application and that date shall, subject to provisions of Section 154, be deemed to be the date of registration.\n",
        "p_27": "(2) On the registration of a trade mark, the Registrar shall issue to the applicant a certificate in the prescribed form of the registration thereof, sealed with the seal of the Trade Marks Registry.\n",
        "p_28": "(3) Where registration of a trade mark is not completed within twelve moths from the date of the application by reason of default on the part of the applicant, the Registrar may, after giving notice to the applicant in the prescribed manner, treat the application as abandoned unless it is completed within the time specified in that behalf in the notice.\n",
        "p_29": "(4) The Registrar may amend the register or a certificate of registration for the purpose of correcting a clerical error or an obvious mistake.\n",
        "p_30": "20. Plaintiffs filed their suit on 4th October,2005 on the basis of registration of trademark in favor of plaintiff No. 1 and prior user of plaintiffs, claiming both infringement and passing off by the defendant. According to plaintiffs at the time of filing of the suit, the trade mark of the defendant was not registered and therefore, the plaintiffs shall also be entitled to maintain an action for the infringement of their registered trademark.\n",
        "p_31": "21. If according to the provisions of the Trade Marks act, 1999 the registration of the trademark will relate back to the date of the application which is 2nd August, 2004 in the present case, the plea of the plaintiffs that they shall still entitled to maintain the action of infringement of their registered trademark will not sustainable because the trade mark `Meromer' of the defendant will be deemed to be registered from 2nd August, 2004 according to Section 23(1)(b) of the act. Plaintiff also cannot sustain his action for infringement of his registered trademark on the ground that the cause of action had arisen in June-July, 2005. On the same reasoning the registration of the trademark of defendant shall relate back to 2nd August, 2004 when the application was made by the defendant for registration of his trademark, therefore even on the date when the cause of action is alleged to have arisen in favor of plaintiffs, the trademark of the defendant was registered and in the circumstances the plaintiffs cannot sustain their action against the defendant on the ground that their registered trademark has been infringed, as the trademark of the defendant was also registered.\n",
        "p_32": "22. The allegation of the plaintiff is that defendant's mark is identical or nearly resembles the mark of the plaintiff. If the marks of plaintiffs and defendant are identical or resemble and both are registered, then both of them are not entitled to exclusive right to use any of the registered trademark against each other. Section 28 of the Trade Marks Act,1999 is as under: 28. Rights conferred by registration.--\n",
        "p_33": "(1) Subject to the other provisions of this Act, the registration of a trade mark shall, if valid, give to the registered proprietor of the trade mark the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation to the goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered and to obtain relief in respect of infringement of the trade mark in the manner provided by this Act.\n",
        "p_34": "(2) The exclusive right to the use of a trade mark given under Sub-section  (I) shall be subject to any conditions and limitations to which the registration is subject.\n",
        "p_35": "(3) Where two or more persons are registered proprietors of trade marks, which are identical with or nearly resemble each other, the exclusive right to the use of any of those trade marks shall not (except so far as their respective rights are subject to any conditions or limitations entered on the register) be deemed to have been acquired by any one of those persons as against any other of those persons merely by registration of the trade marks but each of those persons has otherwise the same rights as against other persons (not being registered users using by way of permitted use) as he would have if he were the sole registered proprietor.\n",
        "p_36": "23. Therefore the plaintiffs can not contend that they have exclusive and registered trademark against the defendant nor can seek relief against the defendant on the ground that there is infringement of their registered trademark. The plaintiffs will not have a legal rights emanating from infringement of registered trade mark, as one registered trademark is not infringed by another registered trademark. The two marks `Meronem' and `Meromer' having `Mero' as common word will not infringe each other on account of their registration in the present facts and circumstances. The Act specifically enumerates the circumstances when a registered trade mark is not infringed. Section 30 of the Act is as under:\n",
        "p_37": "30. Limits on effect of registered trade mark.--(1) Nothing in Section 29 shall be construed as preventing the use of a registered trade mark by any person for the purposes of identifying goods or services as those of the proprietor provided the use--\n",

        "p_43": "(c) the use by a person of a trade mark'\n  \n\n",
        "p_44": "(i) in relation to goods connected in the course of trade with the proprietor or a registered user of the trade mark if, as to those goods or a bulk or which they form part, the registered proprietor or the registered user conforming to the permitted use has applied the trade mark and has not subsequently removed or obliterated it, or has at any time expressly or impliedly consented to the use of the trade mark; or\n \n\n",
        "p_45": "(ii) in relation to services to which the proprietor of such mark or of a registered user conforming to the permitted use has applied the mark, where the purpose and effect of the use of the mark is to indicate, in accordance with the fact, that those services have been performed by the proprietor or a registered user of the mark.\n",
        "p_46": "(d) the use of a trade mark by a person in relation to goods adapted to form part of, or to be accessory to, other goods or services in relation to which the trade mark has been used without infringement of the right given by registration under this Act or might for the time being he so used, if the use of the trade mark is reasonably necessary in order to indicate that the goods or services are so adapted, and neither the purpose nor the effect of the use of the trade mark is to indicate, otherwise than in accordance with the fact, a connection in the course of trade between any person and the goods or services, as the case may be;\n",
        "p_47": "(e) the use of a registered trade mark, being one of two or more trade marks registered under this Act which are identical or nearly resemble each other, in exercise of the right to the use of that trade mark given by registration under this Act.\n",
        "p_48": "(3) Where the goods bearing a registered trade mark are lawfully acquired by a person, the sale of the goods in the market or otherwise dealing in those goods by that person or by a person claiming under or through him is not infringement of a trade by reason only of\n  \n\n",
        "p_49": "(a) the registered trade mark having been assigned by the registered proprietor to some other person, after the acquisition of those goods; or (b) the goods having been put on the market under the registered trade mark by the proprietor or with his consent.\n",
        "p_50": "(4) Sub-section (3) shall not apply where there exists legitimate reasons for the proprietor to oppose further dealings in the goods in particular, where the condition of the goods, has been changed or impaired after they have been put on the market.\n",
        "p_51": "24. Section 28(3) and 30(1)(d) deal with the rights of the registered proprietors of similar trade marks and bar action of infringement against each other as their reading show that the proprietor of registered trade mark can not file an infringement action against a proprietor of an identical or similar trade mark. However, Section 27(2) deals with passing off action and the rights for passing off are not affected by Section 28(2) and Section 30(1)(d). This position can not be disputed in view of N.R. Dongre and ors. v. Whirlpool Corporation and Ors.  holding:\n",
        "p_52": " A reading of Section 28(3) with Section 30(1)(d) shows that the proprietor of a registered trademark can not file an infringement action against a proprietor of an identical or a similar trademark. While Section 28(3) and 30(1)(d) on the one hand deal with the rights of registered proprietors of identical trade marks and bar action of infringement against each other. Section 27(2) on the other hand deals with the passing off action. The rights of action under Section 27(2) are not affected by Section 28(3) and Section 30(1)(d). Therefore, registration of a trade mark under the Act would be irrelevant in an action for passing off. Registration of a trade mark in fact does not confer any new rights on the proprietors thereof then what already existed at common law without registration of the mark. The right of goodwill and reputation in a trade mark was recognised at common law even before it will subject of statutory law. Prior to codification of trademark law there was no provision in India for registration of a trade mark. The right in the trademark was acquired only by their use. This right has not been affected by the act and is preserved and recognised by Sections 27(2) and 33.\n",
        "p_53": "25. Plaintiffs also seek action for infringement of their registered trademark on the ground that they have challenged the registration of the trademark of the defendant by filing the required application for rectification and removal before the appellant board under Trade Marks Act, 1999. This is refuted by the defendant contending that plaintiff No. 1 had filed an application for removal and rectification of the trademark of the defendant before the trade mark registry which was barred under Section 125 of the act, as the said section of the Act contemplates that in case of a suit pending, the application will be before the intellectual property appellate board. The fact that the application for removal and rectification of the trade mark was filed by the plaintiff No. 1 before the Trade Mark Registry is not denied. What is contended by the plaintiff No. 1 is that the application was filed before the trade mark registry which was withdrawn and the application thereafter was then filed before the Appellate Board for Intellectual Property which is still pending and consequently the plaintiffs can invoke their registered trade mark.\n",
        "p_54": "26. Admittedly the rectification application for the registered trade mark `Meromer' of the defendant was filed after the institution of the present suit. Whether this application could be filed without prima facie satisfaction of the Court about tenability of the plea of the invalidity of the defendant's mark with the Appellate Board or pending adjudication of his plea of invalidity of the defendant's mark, the plaintiffs can enforce their rights for infringement of their trade mark'\n \n\n",
        "p_55": "27. Since the application for rectification of defendant's mark filed by the plaintiffs is pending, mere pendency of their application will not give any right to the plaintiffs to sustain their action for infringement of their registered trade mark. Mere filing of the application for invalidity of the trade mark of the defendant does not ipso facto results into stay of the registration or putting of any fetters on the rights of the registered owner of the trade mark flowing from the registration of the mark. If the rights of a registered owner of the trade mark are not clouded on account of pendency of the application of rectification, a fortiori the applicant for rectification also can not maintain action for the infringement of his registered trade mark against another person having a similar registered trade mark in accordance with Section 30 of the Act.\n",
        "p_56": "28. Section 124 of the act contemplates stay of proceedings where the validity of registration of the trademark is in question. Said Section 124 of the Act is as under: 124. Stay of proceedings where the validity of registration of the trade mark is questioned, etc.--\n",
        "p_57": "(1) Where in any suit for infringement of a trade mark-\n",
        "p_58": "(a) the defendant pleads that registration of the plaintiffs trade mark is invalid; or\n \n\n",
        "p_59": "(b) the defendant raises a defense under Clause (e) of Sub-section (2) of Section 30 and the plaintiff pleads the invalidity of registration of the defendant's trade mark, the court trying the suit (hereinafter referred to as the court), shall,--\n",
        "p_60": "(i) if any proceedings for rectification of the register in relation to the plaintiffs or defendant's trade mark are pending before the Registrar or the Appellate Board, stay the suit pending the final disposal of such proceedings;\n",
        "p_61": "(ii) if no such proceedings are pending and the court is satisfied that the plea regarding the invalidity of the registration of the plaintiffs or defendant's trade mark is prima facie tenable, raise an issue regarding the same and adjourn the case for a period of three months from the date of the framing of the issue in order to enable the party concerned to apply to the Appellate Board for rectification of the register.\n",
        "p_62": "(2) If the party concerned proves to the court that he has made any such application as is referred to in Clause (b) (ii) of Sub-section (I) within the time specified therein or within such extended time as the court may for sufficient cause allow, the trial of the suit shall stand stayed until the final disposal of the rectification proceedings.\n",
        "p_63": "(3) If no such application as aforesaid has been made within the time so specified or within such extended time as the court may allow, the issue as to the validity of the registration of the trade mark concerned shall be deemed to have been abandoned and the court shall proceed with the suit in regard to the other issues in the case.\n",
        "p_64": "(4) The final order made in any rectification proceedings referred to in Sub- section (1) or Sub-section (2) shall be binding upon the parties and the court shall dispose of the suit conformably to such order in so far as it relates to the issue as to the validity of the registration of the trade mark.\n",
        "p_65": "(5) The stay of a suit for the infringement of a trade mark under this section shall not preclude the court from making any interlocutory order (including any order granting an injunction directing account to be kept, appointing a receiver or attaching any property), during the period of the stay of the suit.\n",
        "p_66": "29. The said provision envisages two eventualities in case the defendant has raised a defense under Section 30 of the Act and the plaintiff has pleaded invalidity of the registration of the defendant's trade mark, one where the application seeking rectification is already pending and the other where the application is to be filed seeking rectification. In the present case the application for rectification is filed after the institution of the suit which fact has not been denied.\n",
        "p_67": "30. Under Section 124(b) if the application for rectification is already pending the suit can be stayed pending final disposal of such proceedings. In case the application for rectification or any such proceeding is not pending, then a party seeking rectification can apply for rectification subject to prima facie satisfaction of the Court regarding invalidity of the registration of the mark of the opposite party. In the present case the plaintiffs, however, have sought rectification of the trade mark of the defendant by filing an application first to the Registrar and thereafter to the Appellate Board without seeking prima facie satisfaction of this Court.\n",
        "p_68": "31. On plain reading of this provision, it is apparent that the plaintiffs could not file the application for rectification without showing and obtaining prima facie satisfaction of the Court about their plea of the invalidity of the registration of the mark of the Defendant. Section 124 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 is similar to the Section 111 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act,1958. Under the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act,1958 in , Kedar Nath v. Monga Perfumary and Flour Mills, this Court had held that an application could not be filed subsequent to the institution of the suit under Section 111(1)(i) of the earlier Act. The Learned Single Judge had held as under:\n",
        "p_69": "19. The defendant can not file an application subsequent to the institution of the suit under Section 111(1)(i) and claim that the plaintiff suit for infringement must be stayed. If not proceeding for rectification of the register is pending on the date of the institution of the suit by the plaintiff then Section 111(1)(ii) is attracted and the Court may adjourn the case for a period of three months in order to enable the defendant to apply to the High Court for rectification of the register. In that case the court must be satisfied that the contention as to validity of the defendant's registration is bona fide and prime facie sustainable. In the present case I am not satisfied that the contention as to validity and raised by the defendant is bona fide and prima facie sustainable. No material has been placed on the record to prove a prime facie case that the plaintiff's registration is invalid or that the defendant has been carrying on business since 1952 as alleged by him.' Reliance can also be placed on Patel Field marshal Agencies v. P.M. Diesels Ltd. 1999 IPLR 1425 where it was held that if the proceedings are not pending and the plea regarding invalidity of registration of the mark is raised, the Court trying the suit is to be prima facie satisfied about tenability of the issue. The Division bench of the Gujrat High Court had held:\n",
        "p_70": "10. As we notice, under Section 107, it has been provided that on such plea being raised, the plea can be decided only in an appropriate rectification proceedings. In conformity with that provision, Section 111 envisages that if proceeding for rectification of the register in relation to plaintiff or defendant's trademark, as the case may be, are pending before the registrar or the High Court, further proceedings in the suit shall be stayed, until final disposal of rectification proceedings. If proceeding are not pending, and the plea regarding invalidity of registration of concerned mark is raised, the Court trying the suit is to be prima facie satisfied about tenability of the issue, and if it is so satisfied, it shall frame an issue to that effect and adjourn the case for three months, from the date of framing of the issue, in order to enable the party concerned to apply to the High Court for rectification of register. The consequences of the raising of issue are two fold. In case, the party concerned, makes an application for rectification within the time allowed, under sub Clause (ii) of sub Clause (b) of sub section (1), whether originally specified or extended later on, the civil Court trying the suit has to stay the further proceedings of the suit until disposal of the rectification proceeding. At the same time, if no such application is made within the time allowed, the party, has raised the plea of invalidity of the opponent's registered mart, is deemed to have abandoned the issue. This provision permitting raising of an issue only on prima facie satisfaction of the Court, with further requirement that the party, at whose instance an issue has been framed, is to apply for rectification before the High Court concerned, and failure to make such application within the time allowed results in deemed abandonment of plea, leads us to conclude that once a suit has been filed, the rectification proceedings at the instance of either party to the suit against the other, must take the course and envisaged under Section 111, that is to say, if proceedings for rectification are already pending before raising the plea of an invalidity, that is to say, the attention of an appropriate forum having already been invited to that issue, those proceedings must first be continued, decision thereon to be obtained and then civil suit for infringement can proceed in the light of that decision. In case, no such proceedings for rectification are pending at the time of raising the plea of invalidity, the prosecution of such plea by the reason raising it depends on prima facie satisfaction of the Court, about the tenability of this plea. If the plea has been found to be prima facie tenable and an issue is raised to that effect then the matter is to be adjourned for three months at least to enable the person raising such plea to approach the High Court concerned, with a rectification application. In case, the rectification proceedings are not already pending, and the Court is not even prima facie satisfied about the tenability of the plea raised before it, the matter rests there.\n",
        "p_71": "32. The Learned counsel for the plaintiffs has tried to distinguish these cases. According to him on the date of filing of the present suit, no application seeking invalidity of the registration of the defendant's trade mark was pending as the trade mark of the defendant has been registered during the pendency of the suit and the certificate of registration was issued after filing of the suit and therefore, the application for rectification could not be filed prior to the institution of the suit. The plea of the plaintiffs therefore, is that their application for rectification filed before the Appellate Board is maintainable without prima facie satisfaction of the tenability of their plea by the Court. If the application for rectification of the defendant's trade mark is maintainable without prima facie satisfaction of this Court, then this suit is also liable to be stayed as claimed by the plaintiffs under Section 124(b) of the Act, though under Section of 124(5) of the Act, the application for injunction and for vacation or modification of an ex parte order can be considered and decided by this Court. The distinction between Section 124(b)(i) and 124(b)(ii) is on the basis of pendency of the proceedings for rectification of the register and not on the basis of whether the party initiating the proceedings for rectification could initiate such proceedings before the institution of the suit or not. There can be other eventualities under which a party may not be able to initiate the proceedings for rectification before the institution of the suit, but that will not give them a right to circumvent the prima facie satisfaction of his plea for invalidity, by the Court. The distinguishing feature of the two sub clauses is only pendency of the proceedings and nothing more can be read into them. The plea of substantial compliance of the requirement of Section 124 by the plaintiffs is also not sustainable. Either there is compliance of the said provision or non compliance in the facts and circumstances. Compliance will be when after the institution of the suit, if an application for rectification is to be filed, prima facie invalidity of the opposing mark is to be demonstrated to the Court. The fact that the application could not be filed prior to the institution of the suit, will not entitle a party to circumvent the prima facie satisfaction of the Court. Consequently the proceedings for rectification of the defendant's mark could not be initiated by the plaintiffs without the prima facie satisfaction of their plea by this Court nor this case is liable to be adjourned or stayed for three months in terms of Section 124(b)(i) of the Act to await the outcome of the rectification proceedings initiated by the plaintiffs before the Appellate Board.\n",
        "p_72": "33. Whether the plaintiff No. 1 is the assignee of the trade mark and its registered proprietor. The plaintiff first contended that Astrazeneca U.K. Limited, is a company constituted under the laws of England having its registered office at London which was formed as a result of the merger of two world renowned pharmaceutical groups, namely, Astra AB incorporated in Sweden and its subsidiary Zeneca Ltd. incorporated in the United Kingdom. Pursuant to merger of Astra AB and Zeneca, plaintiff No. 1 became the assignee of registered trade mark 'MERONEM' bearing registration No. 532328 in class 5 in India from Zeneca Limited. Zeneca Ltd. had obtained the registration in its name on 27th June, 1990 which is valid and subsisting till 26th June, 2014 and this was assigned by Zeneca Limited in favor of plaintiff No. 1 by deed of assignment dated 4th January, 2000. Another deed of assignment dated 9th August, 2000 was also stated to be executed by Zeneca Limited to facilitate formal registration of the assignment of several of Zeneca's trade marks including 'MERONEM' and this assignment deed dated 9th August, 2000 along with form TM 24 was lodged with the Registrar of trade mark by letter dated 28th March, 2001 and the application is pending with the trade mark Registry, Bombay.\n",
        "p_73": "34. After the above stated plea in the plaint, in the replies to the applications filed by the defendant and the written statement, it was pleaded by the plaintiffs that the trade mark belonges to Zeneca Ltd. which was wholly owned subsidiary of Zeneca Group PLC. Astra, AB Sweden merged with Zeneca from 6th April,1999 and its name became Astra Zeneca PLC and continued its existence as the same company. Zeneca Ltd. also continued its existence after the merger of Astra Sweden with Zeneca and remained a wholly owned subsidiary of Astra Zeneca Plc. Plaintiff No. 1 stated to be incorporated under the laws of England is wholly owned subsidiary of Astra Zeneca Plc and claims rights in the trade mark `Meronem' by deeds of assignment dated 4th January, 2000 and 9th August,2000 whereby Zeneca Ltd.. assigned its rights in the trade mark in favor of the plaintiff No. 1. Though there are variations in the contentions of the plaintiffs in the plaint and subsequently in the replies filed to the applications of the defendant, however, considering the entirety of the plea, it can not be inferred that even prima facie the plaintiffs have not been able to show assignment of trade mark `Meronem' in favor of plaintiff No. 1. The trade mark is registered in the name of Zeneca Ltd. and copies of the assignment deeds executed by the Zeneca Ltd. have been filed by the plaintiffs. Though the plaintiffs ought to have given the appropriate particulars about assignment of trade mark in favor of plaintiff No. 1 in the plaint itself, however, giving correct particulars and details in subsequent replies and variance between the two, will not negate their rights emanating from the assignment of rights in the trade mark by virtue of assignment deeds.\n",
        "p_74": "35. The defendant has challenged the right of the plaintiffs in the trade mark also on the ground that the trade mark `Meronem' is still registered under No. 532328 in class 5 in favor of Zeneca Ltd. and therefore the plaintiffs are not the proprietor of the said trade mark and the suit could be filed by the registered proprietor and suit will not lie on account of an unregistered trade mark under Section 27(2) of the Act in favor of plaintiff No. 1 and that the plaintiffs have also admitted on their cartons for the sale of `Meronem' that the mark is yet to be recorded in their favor. The plaintiffs have filed the form TM-24 with the Registry of Trade Mark, Mumbai. The letters filed by the plaintiffs with Trade Marks registry have also been filed and it is also contended that formal registration takes a number of years and during this period, an assignee can not be denied his rights in the assignment of the trade mark.\n",
        "p_75": "36. The application for registration of trademark in favor of plaintiff No. 1 is still pending with the Registrar of trademarks. During the interregnum the rights emanating from the assignment cannot be denied to the plaintiffs on account of non-registration by the Trademark registry. The plaintiffs have filed the appropriate application and form and have also filed the copies of the correspondence with the Trademark Registry in this Court to show that their application for registration is still pending. Prima facie it can not be inferred that the application for registration of trade mark on the basis of assignment of the plaintiffs is not pending. Registration/ recordal of the name of the proprietor does not confer title but is merely an evidence of title. The rights in the trademark have come to the plaintiffs on the basis of assignment deeds which cannot be denied, prima facie in the facts and circumstances. Reliance can be placed on Grandlay Electricals (India ) Ltd. and Ors. v. Vidya Batra and Ors. 1998 PTC (18) 646 (Del) and Modi Threads Limited v. Sam Soot Gola Factory and Anr. . The learned judge in M/s Mode Threads (supra) while dealing with the said proposition opined in the following words:\n",
        "p_76": " It is true that the plaintiff's application for getting transferred the registered trademark in its name in the office of the registrar is a still pending but that does not debar the plaintiff to protect the violation of the aforesaid trademark at the hands of unscrupulous persons by filing an action in court of law for injunction. It is, prima facie, clear to me that during the interregnum period when the application of the plaintiff is Pending for consideration by the registrar of trademarks, the dishonest persons cannot be allowed to make use of the said trademark in order to get themselves illegally enriched earning upon the reputation built up qua that trademark by the predecessors-in-interest of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_77": "Thus the plaintiffs cannot be denied the rights in the trademark which they have got on the basis of assignment deeds in their favor on the ground that in the records of the Registrar of trademark, the trademark is a still shown in the name of assignor. The interim order granted in favor of plaintiffs, therefore, cannot be vacated on this ground.\n",
        "p_78": "37. The defendant has also sought vacation of interim order in favor of plaintiffs and dismissal of their application for injunction on the ground that the plaintiffs have instituted the suit without a power of attorney to institute the same on account of passing off and therefore the suit has not been properly instituted and plaintiffs are not entitled to an order of interim injunction. The power of attorney in favor of Mr. S.K. Guha and Mr. B.V. Iyer by plaintiff No. 1 has been filed by the plaintiffs which authorize the attorneys to continue the proceedings in the present suit for infringement and passing off of trade Mark `Meronem' and to do execute and perform all or any acts, deeds matters and things necessary or required for the purpose of continuing and pursuing the suit. Therefore, it can not be inferred that the suit has not been filed by authorized attorneys. In these circumstances, prima facie, the interim order passed in favor of plaintiffs cannot be vacated nor their application for interim injunction can be dismissed on this ground.\n",
        "p_79": "38. The plaintiffs have also claimed action for passing off against the defendant on the ground that plaintiffs are prior user and can fully maintain an action for injunction against the defendant for passing of his goods on the basis of deceptively similar trade mark. The plaintiffs have stated that `Meronem', was launched globally in 1995 and in India in 2000. The Astra Zeneca Group's sales turnover in US was 340 million in 2004 and in India the sales for the years 2002,2003,2004 are Rs. 184.07 million, Rs. 368.51 million and Rs. 445 million respectively and they have incurred huge amounts on the promotional expenses. They contended that they are not claiming monopoly over word `Mero' which may be descriptive or generic but on the entire trade mark `Meronem'. Whether the word is generic/public juris/common to the trade is a question of fact and is to be decided on its own facts. According to the plaintiffs only six companies are using the word `Mero' as a part of their trade name of which two are plaintiffs and defendant. The applications of other traders with the prefix Mero in their trade name pending with the trademark registry do not confer any rights capable of protection prior to the registration of the mark and mere presence of marks on the trademark register does not prove user thereof. It was claimed by the plaintiffs that even a generic/descriptive mark can by long user become associated as the trademark of the product with a particular manufacturer and the use of a deceptively similar trademark would cause irreparable loss and injury to the manufacturer concern. Plaintiffs claimed that even if ' Mero ' is held to be a generic word, the injunction cannot be denied to the plaintiff against the defendant as he is using a deceptively similar mark, which is both phonetically and visually similar, to the plaintiffs' mark. The added matter as contended by the defendant are not sufficient to distinguish the marks of plaintiffs and the defendant. As the products of the plaintiffs and the defendant are medicine, stricter approach was canvassed for medicinal preparation relying on Cadilla Health Care Ltd. v. Cadilla Pharmaceuticals Ltd. . It was held that where medicinal products are involved, the test applicable to judge violation of trademark is not at par with the cases involving non medicinal products. Plaintiffs relied on the test of one of possibility and not one of probability or confusion. Regarding the drug marketed by the plaintiffs and the defendant being schedule ' H ' drug being sold under prescription and the same being injectable or administered by professionals, it was submitted that even they are not immune from mistakes when confronted with deceptively similar marks. Plaintiffs asserted that in India it is not always necessary to have a prescription in order to obtain a prescription medicine. Relying on 2004 (29) PTC 421 (Del), Glaxo SmithKline Pharmaceuticals Ltd. and Anr. v. Naval Kishore Goyal and Ors it was contended that even if the word ' Mero ' is held to be generic, what is to be seen is what would remain in the memory of the customer. Reliance was also placed on USV Limited v. IPCA Laboratories Limited 2003 (26) PTC 21; Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. v. Wyeth Holdings Corporaton and Anr. 2005 (30) PTC 14; Boots Company Plc v. Registrar of Trade Marks, Mumbai 2002 (25) PTC 784; Medley Laboratories (P) Ltd. Mumbai and Anr. v. Alkem Laboratories Limited (2002) (25) PTC 592 and Elofix Industries (India) v. Steel Bird Industries and Ors. AIR 1985 Delhi 258 to confirm the interim order dated 6th October,2005 already passed in favor of the plaintiffs.\n",
        "p_80": "39. Per contra, the defendant pleas for even declining the relief of passing of to the plaintiffs are that prefix MERO is common to the trade and cannot be appropriated by the plaintiffs alone. Relying on trade practices it was stated that there are number of trademarks which are used in pharmaceutical industry with a common prefix derived from the generic name and so the plaintiffs can not claim exclusive rights and therefore, the defendant is entitled to use the mark `Meromer'.\n",
        "p_81": "40. The plaintiffs and the defendant are marketing the molecule `meropenem' and the only difference between the two products is the shelf life and of course the price as the drug marketed by the defendant is much cheaper. Relying on Section 144 of the Act it was contended that trade practices have also to be taken into consideration. Referring to added material it was pleaded that there is no likelihood of passing off. According to defendant marks `Meronem' and 'Meromer' are not phonetically, visually or in any other manner deceptively similar to each other. The defendant sells the goods in mono cartons whereas plaintiffs sell their goods in beehive cartons of 10 vials. The goods of the plaintiffs are made available to the purchaser in the vials as such without any cartons for the individual vial. Shapes of vials were also stated to be different as plaintiffs' vial is narrow and the defendant's vial is broad and from the bottom tapers towards the neck. Colures used on different vials were also stated to be different as well as the style of writing. The goods of the plaintiffs and defendant are schedule `H' drug and are sold on prescription and therefore the confusion between the two trademarks is almost none. The defendant highlighted the difference in price of the products of the plaintiffs and the defendant. It had been contended that the plaintiffs are also liable to provide the medicine at price at which it is marketed by the defendant. Denying any trans-border reputation, it was contended that the plaintiffs have not made any averments regarding trans-border reputation. Referring to the judgment of the Apex Court in Whirlpool (supra) it was stated that the trans-border reputation applies with respect to marks that are not derivative of the products.\n",
        "p_82": "41. Referring to admission of the plaintiffs that four more companies are manufacturing `Meropenem' molecule with the prefix `Mero' it was emphasised that no action is initiated by the plaintiffs against these other companies and therefore even against the defendant they cannot have any legitimate grievance for use of mark 'Meromer'. The plaintiffs had not even filed the objection against the registration of trademark `Meromer' when it was advertised. According to the defendant the genesis of the plaintiffs' complaint is the perception of threat by them to their business on account of low price of the defendant's product and present action has been initiated in order to stifle competition in the market. Contending that balance of convenience is in favor of defendant, it was stated that the defendant has already launched its goods in the market in November,2004 and has already invested 1.68 crores in setting up the manufacturing unit. It is stated that goods worth about rupees 1.5 crores has been held up and in case injunction is not vacated, the defendant's goods may perish and will cause greater inconvenience and irreparable loss and hardship to the defendant. Relying on Novartis AG v. Wanbury Ltd. 2005 DLT 316; East African Remedies Pvt. Ltd. v. Wallace Pharmaceuticals 2003 (27) PTC 18; J.R. Kapoor v. Micronix India (1994) Supp 3 SCC 215; F. Hoffimann-La Roche and Co. Ltd. v. Geoffrey Manners and Co Pvt. Ltd., ; SBL Ltd. v. Himalaya Drug Co. 1997 PTC (17) 540; Indo Pharmaceutical Works Ltd. v. Citadel Fine Pharmaceuticals Ltd. AIR 1988 Madras 347; USV Ltd. v. Systopic Laboratories Ltd. 1004 (1) CTC 418; Aviat Chemicals Pvt. Ltd. v. Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd. 2001 PTC 601 and Regency Sanitary Ware Pvt. Ltd. v. Madhusudhan Industries Ltd. 2001 PTC 482, it was contended that the interim order be vacated and the application for interim injunction filed by the plaintiffs be dismissed.\n",
        "p_83": "42. The counsels for both sides have referred to and relied on various observations of the decision of the Apex Court in case of Cadila Health Care Ltd. (supra). The Supreme Court dealt with passing off of medicinal preparation and drugs in this case. Principles laid down by the Apex Court exhaustively deal with the passing off the drugs and therefore this judgment is very relevant. Following factors are relevant for consideration while dealing with an action for passing off of similar trade marks for drugs and medicine:\n",
        "p_84": "(1) The nature of the marks i.e. whether the marks are word marks of label marks or composite marks, i.e. both words and lable marks.\n",
        "p_85": "(2) The degree or resembleness between the marks, phonetically similar and hence similar in idea.\n",
        "p_86": "(3) The nature of the goods in respect of which they are used as trade marks.\n",
        "p_87": "(4) The similarity in the nature, character and performance of the goods of the rival traders.\n",
        "p_88": "(5) The class of purchasers who are likely to buy the goods bearing the marks they require, on their education and intelligence and a degree of care they are likely to exercise in purchasing and/or using the goods.\n",
        "p_89": "(6) The mode of purchasing the goods or placing order for the goods and.\n",
        "p_90": "(7) Any other surrounding circumstances which may be relevant in the extent of dissimilarity between the competing marks.\n",
        "p_91": "43. In the Cadilla Health Care Ltd. (supra) the Apex Court also held that when the question of passing of action is to be decided in a case involving medicinal products, the test to be applied to adjudge the violation of trade mark law may not be at par with cases involving non-medicinal products. Following principles/peculiar features can be highlighted :\n",
        "p_92": "(i) The drugs have a marked difference in the compositions with completely different side effects, the test should be applied strictly as the possibility of harm resulting from any kind of confusion by the consumer can have unpleasant if not disastrous results. The Courts need to be particularly vigilant where the defendant's drug, of which passing off is alleged, is meant for curing the same ailment as the plaintiff's medicine but the compositions are different. The confusion is more likely in such cases and the incorrect intake of medicine may even result in loss of life or other serious health problems.\n",
        "p_93": "(ii) Although both the drugs are sold under prescription but this fact alone is not sufficient to prevent confusion which is otherwise likely to occur. In view of the varying infrastructure of supervision or physicians and pharmacists of medical profession in our country due to linguistic, urban, semi-urban and rural divide across the country and with high degree of possibility of even accidental negligence, strict measures to prevent any confusion arising from similarity of marks among medicines are required to be taken.\n",
        "p_94": "(iii) Trade mark is essentially adopted to advertise one's product and to make it known to the purchaser. It attempts to portray the nature and, if possible, the quality of the product and over a period of time the mark may become popular. It is usually at that stage that other people are tempted to pass off their products as that of the original owner of the mark.\n",
        "p_95": "(iv) Public interest would support lesser degree of proof showing confusing similarity in the case of the trade mark in respect of medicinal product as against other non-medicinal products. Drugs are poisons, not sweets. Confusion between medicinal products may, therefore, be life threatening, not merely inconvenient. Nothing the frailty of human nature and the pressures placed by society on doctors, there should be as many clear indicators as possible to distinguish two medicinal products from each other. It is not uncommon that in hospital, drugs can be requested verbally and/or under critical/pressure situations. Many patients may be elderly, infirm or illiterate. They may not be in a position to differentiate between the medicine prescribed and bought which is ultimately handed over to them.\n",
        "p_96": "(v) While dealing with cases relating to passing off, one of the important tests which was to be applied in each case is whether the misrepresentation made by the defendant is of such a nature as is likely to cause an ordinary consumer to confuse one product or another due to similarity or marks and other surrounding factors. What is likely to cause confusion would vary from case to case.\n",
        "p_97": "44. While confusion in the case of non-medicinal products may only cause economic loss, confusion between the two medicinal products may have disastrous effects on health and life. Stringent measures should be adopted especially where medicines are the medicines of last resort as any confusion in such medicines may be fatal or could have disastrous effects. The confusion as to the identity of the product itself could have dire effects on the public health. Therefore, these principles are to be kept in mind while deciding these applications, according to the judgment of the Apex Court and in case of confusion what will be the result. The emphasis is on whether on confusion the effect would be disastrous and its effect on the life. These tests are applicable for medicines for the same ailments and similar products and medicine because different medicines may have profound effect on the human body. But can these test be applied for same medicine which are marketed in different names by different persons and companies. If the same medicine is used by two different competitors having the common name of the drug as their prefix, the tests for passing off as enumerated hereinabove may not be applicable as the effect of two medicines will be the same. The Apex Court was concerned about the drugs and pharmaceutical preparations which are similar but which may have profound different effects on the human body and not with the same drug. The tests laid down by the Apex Court are in context of different medicine, howsoever slight may be the difference, on account of deceptively similar trade names and not for the same medicine. One of the test laid down is about the similarity in the nature, character and performance of the goods of the rival traders. In case of same medicine or drug this test which is the basis for considering the effect on the health and life will be redundant. Same drug having same composition will not have different side effects leading to any disastrous results. The difference in shelf life of the drug on account of different content of buffering agent will not make the drug having different shelf life different.\n",
        "p_98": "45. Regarding use of descriptive word or use of part of the name of the common medicine, no one can claim monopoly over the use of the said word. The Apex Court was concerned with the use of `Micro' in Micronix and Microtel in J.R. Kapoor v. Micronix India 1994 Supp (3) SCC 215 and it observed as under:\n",
        "p_99": "6 Thus micro-chip technology being the base of many of the products, the word 'micro' has much relevance in describing the products. Further, the word 'micro' being descriptive of the micro technology used for production of many electronic goods which daily come to the market, no one can claim monopoly over the use of the said word. Anyone producing any product with the use of micro- chip technology would be justified in using the said word as a prefix to his trade name. What is further, those who are familiar with the use of electronic goods know fully well and are not likely to be misguided or confused merely by, the prefix 'micro' in the trade name. Once, therefore, it is held that the word 'micro' is a common or general name descriptive of the products which are sold or of the technology by which the products are manufactured, and the users of such products are, therefore, not likely to be misguided or confused by the said word, the only question which has to be prima facie decided at this stage is whether the words 'tel' and 'nix' in the trade names of the appellant and the respondent are deceptive for the buyers and users and are likely to misguide or confuse them in purchasing one for the other. According to us, phonetically the words being totally dissimilar are not going to create any such confusion in the mind of the users.\n",
        "p_100": "After comparing added information of the two marks Micronix and Microtel, the Apex Court held that there was no chance of users being misguided or confused. The Supreme Court observed:\n",
        "p_101": "... This being the case, we are of the view that there is not even the remotest chance of the buyers and users being misguided or confused by the two trade names and logos. Same is the case with the carton which merely reproduces both the trade names and the logos.\n",
        "p_102": "46. The argument of the Learned counsel for the plaintiffs that even if the word 'Mero' is descriptive, the plaintiff is not claiming monopoly over `Mero' but on `Meronem', is not logical. If `Mero' is on account of common name of medicine which are marketed by both the parties and if it can be used by either of the parties and no party can claim exclusive rights, then the comparison should be of `Nem' and 'Mer'. Phonetically both the words are very different and distinct. The argument of the plaintiffs' counsel that in these two suffixes one alphabet is different i.e `N' and `R' is a feeble attempt to ignore the distinctiveness in them. In a word, placement of letters is very material. In the two suffixes `Mer' and`Nem' the placement of letters are different which creates a very pronounced distinctiveness.\n",
        "p_103": "47. The test for comparison of the two word marks was formulated by Lord Parker in Pianotist Co. Ltd.'s application 23 RPC 774 as follows: 'You must take the two words. You must judge them, both by their look and by their sound. You must consider the goods to which they are to be applied. You must consider the nature and kind of customer who would be likely to buy those goods. In fact, you must consider all the surrounding circumstances; and you must further consider what is likely to happen if each of those trade marks is used in a normal way as a trade mark for the goods of the respective owners of the marks. If, considering all those circumstances, you come to the conclusion that there will be a confusion, that is to say, not necessarily that one man will be injured and the other will gain illicit benefit, but that there will be a confusion in the mind of the public which will lead to confusion in the goods ' then you may refuse the registration, or rather you must refuse the registration in that case.'\n \n\n",
        "p_104": "48. In F. Hoffmann-La Roche and Co. Ltd. v. Geoffrey Manner and Co. (P) Ltd.,  the Apex Court had considered `Dropovit' and `Protovit' holding that `Vit' indicated that the goods were Vitamin preparation and terminable syllable is both descriptive and common. Paying greater regard to the uncommon elements, it was held that it is difficult that one will be mistaken for or confused with the other. The letters 'D' and 'P' in 'Dropovit' and the corresponding letters 'P' and 'T' in 'Protovit' cannot possibly be slurred over in pronunciation and the words are so dissimilar that there is no reasonable probability of confusion between the words either from the visual or phonetic point of view. The Supreme Court had held:\n",
        "p_105": " 8. In order to decide whether the word 'Dropovit' is deceptively similar to the word 'Protovit' each of the two words must, therefore, be taken as a whole word. Each of the two words consists of eight letters, the last three letters are common, and in the uncommon part the first two are consonants, the next is the same vowel 'O', the next is a consonant and the fifth is again a common vowel 'O'. The combined effect is to produce an alliteration. The affidavits of the appellant indicate that last three letters 'Vit' is a well known common abbreviation used in the pharmaceutical trade to denote vitamin preparations. In his affidavit, dated January 11, 1961 Frank Murdoch, has referred to the existence on the register of about 57 trade marks which have the common suffix 'Vit' indicating that the goods are vitamin preparations. It is apparent that the terminal syllable 'Vit' in the two marks is both descriptive and common to the trade. If greater regard is paid to the uncommon element in these two words, it is difficult to hold that one will be mistaken for or confused with the other. The letters 'D' and 'P' in 'Dropovit' and the corresponding letters 'P' and 'T' in 'Protovit' cannot possibly be slurred over in pronunciation and the words are so dissimilar that there is no reasonable probability of confusion between the words either from the visual or phonetic point of view.\n",
        "p_106": "49. The non descriptive words `NEM' and ' MER' in two trademarks of the plaintiffs and defendant cannot be slurred over in pronunciation and there is no reasonable possibility of confusion. As already observed in order to assess the similarity and dissimilarity in words, not only the letters but their placement is also relevant and material. In the circumstances, the submission of the plaintiffs that in two non-descriptive words `NEM' and `MER' the difference is in letters `N' and `R' and the letters `E' and `M' are common, does not reflect similarities because the placement of letters has not been considered. In my view the non descriptive words `NEM' and 'MER` are distinctly dissimilar.\n",
        "p_107": "50. Proprietor of Liv-52 was held not entitled for interim injunction against the use of Liv-T, by a division bench of this Court in  (DB) S.B.L. Ltd. v. The Himalaya Drug Company. It was held that no body can claim exclusive right to use any word, abbreviation, or acronym which is publici juris. The practice to name a drug by the name of the organ or ailment is common practice. The Court had held:\n",
        "p_108": " The decision on the question of likelihood of deception is to be left to the Court. (3) Nobody can claim exclusive right to use any word, abbreviation, or acronym which has become publici juris. In the trade of drugs it is common practice to name a drug by the name of the organ or ailment which it treats or the main ingredient of the drug. Such organ, ailment or ingredient being publici Jurisdiction or generic cannot be owned by anyone for use as trade mark; (4) Whether such feature is publici Jurisdiction or geric is a question of fact; (5) If the two trade marks by two competing traders use a generic word or an expression publici Jurisdiction common to both the trade marks it has to be seen if the customers who purchase the goods would be guided by the use of such word or expression or would ignore it and give emphasis to prefixes or suffixes or words used in association therewith. The primary question to be asked is What would remain in the memory of customer' The surrounding circumstances such as the presentation of goods, colour scheme and lettering style etc. used on the packing also assume significance.\n",
        "p_109": "51. The name `Mero' is from the common name of the drug, Meropenem and the defendant and the plaintiffs both can not claim exclusive right to the same. The non descriptive words `Nem' and `Mer' of the two trade names are distinct. This distinction coupled with others, colour scheme and shape of the vial, which have been perused by me, demonstrate quite dis-similarities between the two products, which is the same medicine, marketed under the different trade names. The only difference is the shelf life which can be ascertained from the date of expiry and the price, as the drug marketed by the plaintiffs is costlier than the same drug marketed by the defendant. The principals laid down by the Apex Court in Cadilla do not overrule most of the ratios of S.B.L Ltd. (supra) and therefore the distinction carved out by the learned Counsel for the plaintiffs can not sustain the pleas of the plaintiffs. Even if the entire trade mark is to be considered, for various factors as detailed herein above the two trade marks will be essentially different. The reliance of the plaintiffs on Corn Products Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food Products Ltd.  also does not support their pleas. In Corn Products (supra) the two marks were `Glucovita' and `Gluvita' which were held to be dis-similar by the Registrar on the ground that word `co' between the prefixes and suffixes was sufficient to distinguish the two marks. The Apex Court however, did not agree that word `co' will distinguish two trade marks with prefixes and suffixed being same. The Supreme Court had held:\n",
        "p_110": " 18 ...Apart from the syllable 'co' in the appellant's mark, the two marks are identical. That syllable is not in our opinion such as would enable the buyers in our country to distinguish the one mark from the other.\n",
        "p_111": "52. A division Bench of Madras High Court in AIR 1998 Madras 347, Indo Pharma Pharmaceutical Works Ltd. v. Citadel Fine Pharmaceutical Ltd. had found words `Enerjex' and `Enerjase' dissimilar as the suffixes of both the words `jex' and `jase' were found to distinguishable and dissimilar and holding that these words will not create confusion. The plea of the counsel of the plaintiffs that in contradistinction the words` NEM' and `MER' are quite phonetically similar is not acceptable. Both the words are quite distinct and the similarity between the two is aberration of their perception.\n",
        "p_112": "53. Dissimilarities in `Meronem' and `Meromer' can further be perceived on the basis of principles enunciated in Aviat Chemicals Pvt. Ltd. v. Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd. PTC 601 (Delhi) contending that Lipicard and Lipicor are dissimilar; Novratis AG v. Wanbury Ltd. and Anr.  inferring that Coriminic viz a viz Triaminic/Triominic are quite dissimilar and distinquishable and Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma v. Navratna Pharmaceuticals Laboratories  finding Navaratna and Navaratna Kalpa different and dissimilar.\n",
        "p_113": "54. The plaintiffs have tried to distinguish the case of Liv-52 (supra) on the ground that in that case it was found that about hundred drugs in the market were using the abbreviation `Liv' from liver, an organ of human body as constituent of names of medicinal preparations meant for treatment of ailments and diseases associated with liver where as in the case of plaintiffs there are only six companies, two of which are plaintiffs and defendant. Regarding 30 to 35 applications, contended by the defendant with the registrar of trademarks with the prefix `Mero' , plaintiffs stated that the presence of a mark on the register does not prove its user and consequently the plea of the defendant that `Mero' is commonly used in the trade is not sustainable.\n",
        "p_114": "55. This submission of the plaintiffs is based on their own assumption. At the interim stage 30 to 35 application with the registrar of trademarks with the prefix ' mero ' will rather demonstrate that the word `Mero' emanating from the common name of the medicine Meropenem, is commonly used. In any case even the plaintiffs have admitted that four more persons/companies are also marketing the drug `Meropenem' with the trademarks having prefix `Maro'. No hard and fast rule can be laid down as to how many more persons or companies should be using a particular name so as to infer its commonality. In my opinion it will depend on the product and trade and in some cases even if only one more company is using a similar trade name, it may show the commonality of the name. The plaintiffs have admitted that four more companies are marketing the same drug having prefix `Maro' and no action has been taken against them. I am not quite convinced with the argument of the plaintiffs that list of trade marks given by the defendant without any corroborative evidence of views cannot be relied upon as evidence in support of plea that `MERO' is common to trade. The trade marks of the plaintiffs and the defendant have not been spilt for purpose of comparison but because both of them have prefix MERO which is generic word. This generic word is used not only by the parties to the suit but by a number of other such drug manufacturers. In the circumstances, action of infringement and passing off only against the defendant, prima facie also points towards other factors. In the circumstances the plea of the defendant that the present action is being initiated against him to wipe off the competition raised by the defendant, on account of marketing the same drug at a much lower price becomes significant in order to a ascertain the balance of convenience between the parties.\n",
        "p_115": "56. The ratio of the judgments relied on by the plaintiff do not support their pleas and contentions and they are clearly distinguishable. In 2005(30) PTC 14 (BOM), Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. v. Wyeth Holdings Corporation and Anr., a division Bench of Bombay High Court had declined to interfere with the discretion exercised by the Single Judge in granting injunction in similar trade marks 'Pacitane' which was a registered trade mark and ' Parkitane' which was not a registered trade mark. Relying on the observation in N.R. Dongre v. Whirlpool Corporation (supra) and Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd. v. Pothan Joseph  about the interference in the appeal arising out of discretionary order of the temporary injunction, it was held that the interference in appeal will be called for only if the conclusion reached is that the exercise of discretion by the trial judge was contrary to the settled principles for the grant of temporary injunction or that it is arbitrary or perverse. Similarly in the , Glaxo Smithkline Pharmaceuticals Ltd. and Anr. v. Naval Kishore Goyal and ors the defendant's proposed trade mark had not been published and therefore at the threshold and a preliminary stage of a suit, the holder of registered trade mark was accorded jural protection. In , Sanat Products Ltd. v. Glade Drugs and Nutraceuticals Pvt. Ltd. and anr the drugs `REFORM' and `REFIRM' were found to be deceptively similar but these names did not have any common prefixes based on some ailment, organ of the body or on the name of common medicine in contradistinction to the present case. The case of the SPOXIN and SUPAXI, 2002 (25) PTC 592 (Bom) (DB) is also clearly distinguishable on the same principle and does not support the contentions of the plaintiffs. These two trade marks were deceptively similar but the drugs were quite different and in case of confusion could lead to disastrous results in contradistinction to the plaintiffs' and defendant products which are the same drug marketed under the different names. The drug marketed by the parties to the suit is same except the content of buffering agent used by them which makes the shelf life different, shelf life is four years of plaintiffs' drug and two years of defendant drug.\n",
        "p_116": "57. Essential description and characteristics of the two medicines of plaintiffs and defendants are given herein before in a table. A mere look at them reveals that there is no difference in the properties of the two medicines except the shelf life and of course the price. The same drug is being marketed by the plaintiffs and the defendant. The price of the drug marketed by the defendant is cheaper to the drug marketed by the plaintiffs. The composition of the drug of the plaintiffs and the defendant is same except the content of buffering agent. As there is slight difference in the content of the buffering agent, that makes the shelf life different i.e the dates of expiry of the drug will be different for the drug of the plaintiffs and the defendant. The shelf life of the drug of the plaintiff is four years whereas in case of defendant it is two years. In the peculiar circumstances of the present case even if the of deceptive similarity is assumed between the trade marks of the plaintiffs and of the defendant, there will not be any disastrous or any harmful effect inasmuch as the drug is the same. The plea of the plaintiffs that the difference in shelf life shall lead to disastrous effect, seem to be hypothetical and assumptive and more of an attempt to some how discredit the product of the defendant. This acquires more significance because when the product of the defendant was advertised in trademark journal, no opposition was filed by the plaintiffs. Admittedly the drug Meropenem is marketed by others using the name with prefix `Mero' and no action has been taken by the plaintiffs against the manufacturers of such other companies. Date of expiry of every medicine is given on packing. It will be too much to assume that in case of the product of the plaintiffs before its administration by the qualified persons, they will be presume it to be four years without looking at the date of manufacture and date of expiry. Whether the shelf life of plaintiffs product is four years or two years in case of defendant, before administration by the qualified personals, the date of expiry will be checked and therefore it cannot be inferred that on account of difference in shelf life between the products of the plaintiffs and the defendant, will cause disastrous results or confusion which will result in loss of life or other serious health hazard.\n",
        "p_117": "58. Considering the averments made by the parties, it is difficult to infer at this stage that the adoption of the trademark` Meromer' by the defendant is with the intention to pass off his product as that of plaintiffs. The defendant has spent considerable amount in setting up the plant. The plaintiff was not the first to adopt and use the prefix ' MERO ' as trademark MEROCEL was registered in favor of M/s Merrel Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. No. 2110 East Galiraith Raod, Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S.A which fact can not be denied by the plaintiffs. There are other companies marketing the same drug, Meropenem, with the trade names having prefix `Mero'. Perusal of the plaint also reveals that the plaintiffs did not make any averment regarding trans border reputation. No material as has been relied on or produced by the plaintiffs to show its trans border reputation which were noticed by the Apex Court in N.R. Dongre v. Whirlpool Corporation .\n",
        "p_118": "59. Defendant is one of the companies in India which is marketing the drug `Meropenem' which is essentially the same as that marketed by plaintiff but at a cheaper price. The defendant had launched his drug in November, 2004 after investing considerable amount in setting up its unit for the manufacture of the said drug. The trademark of the defendant was advertised in the trademark journal but no opposition to it was filed by the plaintiffs. After the institution of the suit, the rectification proceedings were initiated first before the Registrar and thereafter before the Appellate Board without seeking prima facie satisfaction of this Court regarding invalidity of the registration of the defendant's mark. In the plaint and the application for interim injunction, correct particular and facts about the assignment of trade mark in favor of the plaintiffs were not given. The plaintiffs though have admitted that other companies are also marketing the same medicine with different trade marks having common prefix `Mero' and no action has been initiated by the plaintiffs against such other companies. In the entirety of the facts and circumstances, if the defendant shall be restrained from selling, marketing or in any manner dealing with the pharmaceutical drug Meropenem under the trade name 'MEROMER ' the of the inconvenience caused to the defendant shall be much more. Public interest will also support availability of same drug at a cheaper price. So prima facie, in my opinion the balance of convenience is in favor of the defendant. Any interim injunction in the facts and circumstances may also cause irreparable loss to the plaintiffs. The loss of the plaintiffs seems more to be financial which can be safeguarded by directing the defendant to maintain accounts of sale of the drug Meropenem under the trade name `Meromer' and submit the accounts regularly to this Court every half yearly.\n",
        "p_119": "60. For the foregoing reasons the order dated 6th October, 2005 needs to be vacated and injunction application filed by the plaintiffs merits rejection and therefore, I.A. No. 8078/2005 filed by the plaintiffs is accordingly dismissed and IA No. 8561/2005 filed by the defendant is hereby allowed. The interim order dated 6th October, 2005 is vacated. The defendant is, however, directed to maintain the account of sale of drug under the trade name `Meromer' which shall be submitted to this Court every half yearly.\n",
        "p_120": "61. Needless to mention, the views expressed above are tentative and prima facie conclusions which shall not be treated as expression of any final opinion on the final merits of the case. \n"

The plaintiffs had adopted the\ntrademark Golden Qilla in the year 1954 for rice and Lal Qilla in the year\n1961 and Neela Qilla in the year 1977. In the year 1986, the plaintiffs\nlearnt use of the trademark Hara Qilla by the defendant.

The Division Bench at the outset noted that the suit was essentially\none for infringement. Referring to the decision reported as (1965) 1 SCR\n737 Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma v. Navaratna Pharmaceutical\nLaboratories wherein it was, inter-alia, held that if the essential features of\na trademark of the plaintiff have been adopted by the defendant, the fact\nthat the get up, packing and other writing or marks on the goods or on the\npackets in which     defendant offers his goods for sales show marked\ndifferences or indicate clearly a trade origin different from that of the\nregistered proprietor of the mark, would be immaterial. The Division\nBench then referred to the decision reported as (1963) 2 SCR 484\nAmritdhara Pharmacy v. Satya Deo where, based on the imperfect\nrecollection of an average consumer who is not likely to split the\ncomponents of a name and consider the etymological meaning thereof, the\nrival marks 'Amritdhara\u201f and 'Lakshmandhara\u201f were held to be\nphonetically and deceptively similar. The Division Bench held that the\nimpugned trade mark 'Hara Qilla\u201f contained the essential feature of the\nplaintiff's trade mark i.e. the word 'Qilla\u201f which along with the device of a\nfort was deceptively similar to the registered trademarks, 'Lal Qilla' and\n'Golden Qilla\u201f. It was further held that significantly the said deception was\namplified by the phonetic similarity in the constituent and dominant\nelement 'Qilla\u201f of the rival marks \u201eGolden/Lal Qilla\u201f and \u201eHara Qilla\u201f.\nNoting that the trademarks had no connection with the product i.e. rice,\ninjunction was granted.\n",
        "p_20": " 19.   In the decision reported as 2010 (44) PTC 293 (Del.) (DB) M/S\nKirorimal Kashiram Marketing vs M/S. Shree Sita Chawal Udyog Mill,\nthe primary issue before the Division Bench was whether the\nrespondent's impugned trade mark 'Golden Deer' was deceptively\nsimilar to the appellant's registered trade mark \u201eDouble Deer\u201f with\nrespect to sale of the identical goods i.e. rice. The learned Single Judge\nhad refused an injunction. It was a case where the appellants were\nundisputedly the prior user of the trademark Double Deer. The Division\nBench opined that the word \u201eDeer\u201f was a prominent part of the\nappellant's trademark \u201eDouble Deer\u201f. The Division Bench noted the\ndecision in Amar Singh Chawal Wala case (supra). Rejecting that the\nword 'Deer\u201f was common to the trade and noting that the defendant had\nfailed to establish extensive use and reputation in its trademark 'Golden\nDeer\u201f, injunction was granted.\n",
        "p_21": "20.   It is often argued in trademark infringement cases that the\ntrademark has to be considered as a whole and has not to be dissected.\nThat is to say the anti-dissection rule is brought into force. On the other\nhand the theory of a dominant part of a trademark is propounded which\nessentially requires a Court to look at the trademark compositely but\nidentify if any part thereof is the dominant part. To a layman it may\nappear to be a legal paradox, for on the one hand there is a rule that you\ncannot dissect a composite mark and on the other hand you have a rule\nwhich has the feature of dissecting. In the decision reported as 2015\n(61) PTC 231 South India Beverages Pvt. Ltd. vs General Mills\n\n\n\n\nFAO(OS) (COMM) No.67/2016                                      Page 11 of 15\n Marketing Inc. this issue was addressed by a Division Bench of this\nCourt with respect to same products i.e. ice cream. The rival marks under\nconsideration were 'HAAGEN-DAZS\u201f and \u201eD\u201fDAAZS\u201f. Propounding the\nrule of anti-dissection to contend that the respondent's mark 'HAAGEN-\nDAZS\u201f should be viewed as an indivisible whole and when viewed in its\nentirety, it was not deceptively similar to the impugned trademark\n'D\u201fDAAZS\u201f, the rival argument was that \u201eDAZS\u201f formed a prominent part\nof the trademark 'HAAGEN-DAZS\u201f and therefore warranted protection\nagainst the impugned trademark. The Division Bench then referred to\nvarious judicial decisions and opined that the rule of anti-dissection\nessentially mandates that where the issue is of deceptive similarity\nbetween composite marks, the commercial impression of the mark as a\nwhole needs to be considered for the reason the jurisprudence behind the\nanti-dissection rule was that the combination of the terms in its entirety\nand not its dissected elements constitute the distinctive mark.           The\nDivision Bench then referred to the decision reported as 211 (2014) DLT\n296 Stiefel Laborataries v. Ajanta Pharma Ltd. and therefrom extracted\nthe rationale for the anti-dissection rule : \u201eThe rationale of the anti-\ndissection rule is based upon this assumption: \u201eAn average purchaser\ndoes not retain all the details of a mark, but rather the mental impression\nof the mark creates in its totality. It has been held to be a violation of the\nanti-dissection rule to focus upon the \u201eprominent\u201f feature of a mark and\ndecide likely confusion solely upon that feature, ignoring all other\nelements of the mark. Similarly, it is improper to find that one portion of\n\n\n\n\nFAO(OS) (COMM) No.67/2016                                         Page 12 of 15\n a composite mark has no trademark significance, leading to a direct\ncomparison between only that which remains.' In view of the aforesaid,\nthe Division Bench opined that the principles of 'anti- dissection' and that\nof 'identification of \u201edominant mark\u201f are not antithetical to one another\nbut are rather complimentary. It was held that the constituent elements\nmay be viewed as a preliminary step in ultimately determining probable\ncustomer reaction to the conflicting composites as a whole. The Division\nBench expounded that the rule of anti-dissection does not absolutely\nrestrict consideration of the constituent elements of a composite mark and\nmore significantly, where less than the entire trademark was appropriated\namounting to infringement thereof, there would be no violation of the\nanti-dissection rule. Reliance was placed on the decision reported as 380\nF.3d 1340 Re Chatam Int'l, Inc, where the Court held that the commercial\nimpression created by the dominant part 'GASPAR\u201f of the registered\nmark 'GASPAR'S ALE' was far more substantial than by its other part\n'ALE and therefore the impugned mark 'JOSE GASPAR GOLD\u201f was\nfound to be deceptively similar to the registered mark. Reference was\nthen made to decision reported as 405 F.Supp. 530 (1975) Eaton Allen\nCorp. v. Paco Impressions Corp where it was held that consideration of a\ntrademark as a whole does not preclude infringement where less than the\nentire trademark is appropriated. In the facts of the case, the Division\nBench, rejected the appellant's arguments advanced on the basis of the\nanti-dissection rule to hold that the impugned mark 'D\u201f DAAZS\u201f infringed\na dominant feature i.e. 'DAZS\u201f of the respondents' trademark 'HAAGEN\u201f\n\n\n\n\nFAO(OS) (COMM) No.67/2016                                       Page 13 of 15\n 'DAZS\u201f which feature can be easily relied on to trace the source of its\nproduct and therefore must be accorded protection. Thereafter, noting that\nthe expression 'HAAGEN DAZS\u201f, was a unique combination of Danish-\nsounding words having no dictionary meaning in any language, the\nDivision Bench reiterated that being an arbitrarily chosen trademark, the\nsame was entitled to a high degree of protection and referred to the\ndecision of this Court reported as 2010 (44) PTC 293 (Del) Kirorimal\nKashiram Marketing and Agencies Pvt. Ltd. v. Shree Sita Chawal Udyog\nMill in support thereof.     The Division Bench highlighted that the\nconsumer generally retained only a vague impression of a mark to\nascertain its similarity upon encountering a new rival mark. Interestingly,\nthe Division Bench imported the \u201eordinary observer\u201f test in copyright law\nto hold that this principle could be adopted if a dominant part of a\ntrademark which had acquired a goodwill had been adopted by the\ndefendant.\n",

        "p_1": "1.      By this order, I shall dispose of an application under Order 39 Rules 1 & 2 of Civil\nProcedure Code (CPC) preferred by the plaintiffs for grant of injunction against the defendants in\nrespect of use of trademark EQUAL. It is submitted by the counsel for plaintiffs that the plaintiffs\nwere engaged in manufacturing and marketing of granulated sweetener under the trademark\nEQUAL. The trademark of plaintiffs EQUAL was a well-known trademark in India and other\ncountries of the world. It was adopted by plaintiffs' predecessor in US in the year 1979 and major\ncommercial sales started in 1981. The plaintiffs' product was the first aspartame based low\ncalories sugar substitute ever marketed and this product was being marketed in various parts of\nthe world including India and the trademark EQUAL was exclusively associated with the business\nof plaintiffs. The reputation of the plaintiff's trademark EQUAL even extended to the cognate and\nallied goods being sold at the same counter manufactured by the same manufacturer. This\ntrademark EQUAL was registered vide No.376816 of 9th June, 1981 in Class 1 in respect of\nSynthetic low calorie sweetening preparations and was advertised in Trade Mark Journal No.850\ndated 1st February 1986. The trademark EQUAL was registered under Class 30 on 4th May, 1987\nin respect of food products (trademark was advertised in Trade Mark Journal No.970 dated 1 st\nNovember, 1989 at page No.994). Another application for registration of trademark under Class 5\nwas pending registration since 4th May, 1987. It is submitted that on account of priority in\nadoption, long, continuous and extensive use of the trademark EQUAL in India and other parts of\nthe world, the plaintiffs and predecessor have acquired and retained an exclusive right to use\n\n\nCS(OS) 895/2005         Merisant Company 2 SARL & Anr. v. Equal Minerals & Anr. Page 1 Of 5\n trademark EQUAL in respect of the sweeteners as well as other cognate and allied goods. It is\nfurther submitted that the plaintiffs spent huge amount on advertisements of trademark EQUAL\nand total sale figures of Plaintiff Company all over the world bearing the said trademark EQUAL\nwere considerably high. Defendant no.1 was manufacturing and marketing mineral water and\nsparkling sold and selling the same under the trademark EQUAL. Plaintiff also learnt that\ndefendants had applied for registration of the trademark EQUAL under various classes under the\nname and address of defendant no.2. Defendants no.1 and 2 were both owned by Narang family.\nPlaintiffs learnt about defendants' application for registration of trademark EQUAL in the year\n2002 and learnt that the defendants have applied for registration of trademark EQUAL in Classes\n1, 3, 4, 11, 25, 27, 29, 31 & 32. It is submitted that the defendants trademark EQUAL was\ndeceptively similar to the trademark of plaintiffs and was in similar style and thus defendants\nwere guilty of infringement of trademark of plaintiffs. Defendants were also guilty of passing off\nor enabling others to pass off their goods and business as the goods and business of plaintiffs\nbecause of user of trademark EQUAL, therefore, defendants were causing loss and there was\nlikelihood of other losses being suffered in the business of plaintiffs and reputation of plaintiffs.\nThe defendants were also liable to render the account to ascertain the loss.\n",
        "p_2": "2.      In reply to this application it is submitted by defendants that defendants trademark\n'EQUAL with a geometrical sign of EQUAL(=) was in use since July, 1988 and it was registered in\nClass 12 since 9th December, 1988, well within the knowledge of plaintiffs. This trademark was\nregistered in favour of defendants by Trademark Registry after a thorough search. The trademark\nwas initially got registered by defendants in respect of the plastic auto parts. The defendants had\nstarted their business under the name of M/s Narang Technoplast and got this trademark\nregistered when the plaintiffs were not even known anywhere and there was no other company\nusing trademark 'EQUAL'. Thus, the question of adopting trademark pertaining to plaintiff did not\narise. Defendants obtained further registration of trademark EQUAL in respect of cutlery, spoons\nin Class 8 & 12. These registrations were in the name of M/s Narang Technoplast owned by Shri\nAshok Narang. In the year 1995, Mr. Ashok Narang formed another sole proprietary firm under\nthe name and style of M/s EQUAL MINERALS in order to set up a business of packaged drinking\nwater and sparkling soda and started its unit at Rewari, Haryana which commenced production in\nAugust, 2001. Defendant no.1 continued to use the trademark EQUAL in respect of mineral\nwater, sparkling soda since August, 2001 and also continued the family business. The EQUAL\nMINERAL and EQUAL PLASTICS PVT. LTD were family business of Mr. Ashok Narang and his\nfamily members in respect of Plastic bottles, mineral water and plastic Auto Parts and the\ntrademark EQUAL was being used since July, 1988 exclusively by defendants for its products.\n",

        "p_4": " 3.      It is submitted that the plaintiff's allegations of passing off/ infringement were baseless.\nThe plaintiff had no reputation in India neither he had copyright over the design of word 'EQUAL'.\nThe trademark EQUAL in respect of mineral and aerated water was granted to the plaintiff only\non 20th March, 2003, much after the trademark EQUAL was registered in favour of defendant.\n",
        "p_5": "4.      It is also submitted that there was no evidence of user of trademark EQUAL by the\nplaintiffs in India. All documents filed by the plaintiffs along with the application and along with\nthe plaint only showed that the product of plaintiffs was being sold and marketed outside India\nviz. USA and Europe and the plaintiffs had no sale in India. The sales were disclosed in dollars\nand that itself shows that the sales were outside India. Plaintiffs had also not placed on record\nadvertisements of its products in any newspaper or magazine in India. All the advertisements\nplaced on record are only of US and the illustrations filed by the plaintiff also are of US. It is\nstated that mere registration of trademark EQUAL by the plaintiff in India does not amount to the\nuse of the trademark EQUAL in India and there was no evidence of transboarder reputation of\nplaintiff's trademark in India. The copy of advertisements filed by the plaintiff does not show that\nthe plaintiff had any reputation or even tried to create any reputation in India.\n",
        "p_6": "5.      It is argued by the defendants that the description of the goods as well as business\nactivities of the plaintiffs is absolutely different from the defendants products. The product\n'Aspartame based low calories sweetener' manufactured by the plaintiffs was a pharmaceutical\npreparation. The plaintiffs' product 'Low Calories Sweeteners-Aspartame' is used under medical\nadvice only by a limited class of people i.e. diabetic patients or the consumers who want to be on\nlow calories sweetener in order to avoid putting on more body weight. Whereas the defendants'\ngoods being Mineral Water, and Sparkling Soda for general use and purpose cannot be said to be\nidentical with and or deceptively similar to plaintiffs product in any manner. Thus, no case of\npassing off of the goods of defendants as that of plaintiff was made out because the defendant\ntrademark EQUAL had its own reputation in India and defendants had a goodwill of its products\nin India. The defendants trademark was also not identical or similar to that of the plaintiffs.\nDefendants were using Geometrical sings of EQUAL (=)under the word EQUAL. Even otherwise,\ndefendants' products or any product similar to that of defendants was not even manufactured by\nthe plaintiffs. Neither a case of infringement was made out against the defendants because\ntrademark EQUAL was registered in favour of defendants and defendants were using the\ntrademark EQUAL in its own right in view of Section 28 of the Trademark Act and hence\ndefendants have a right to use the trademark EQUAL. Defendants trademark was a registered\ntrademark and hence no occasion for infringement would lie.\n",

        "p_8": " 6.      In order to grant an interim injunction under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 CPC, party has\nto prove three elements. First is that it has a good prima facie case, second that in case\ninjunction is not granted, it will suffer irreparable loss and injury and the third is that the balance\nof convenience lies in its favour. There is no doubt that the plaintiffs trademark EQUAL was\nregistered in US and several other countries including India as is reflected from the documents\nbut there is no evidence that the plaintiffs was having any public acknowledgment or a reputation\nin India. The copies of advertisements placed on record by the plaintiffs show that these\nadvertisements were inserted in Journals and Magazines of US. Plaintiffs have not placed on\nrecord even a single advertisement inserted in Indian newspapers, magazines, journals etc.\nPlaintiffs have also not placed on record material to show that their trademark was being used for\nany other products except Low Calories Sweeteners in the world. All advertisements and other\ndocuments placed on record by plaintiffs show that Low Calories Sweetener was the only product\nof the plaintiffs which had been advertised or marketed. The plaintiffs had been propagating\nabout its 'Low Calories Sweeteners-Aspartame based' on account of its deictic value and claiming\nthat it was a substitute of sugar with almost no calorie and may be used as a Sweetener for all\nkinds of food products consumed by people. The documents also show that the plaintiffs never\npublished their advertisements in any Indian languages. All advertisements are in English and\nmeant for those who are health conscious or have sugar problems or want to reduce their weight.\nThe bills filed by the plaintiffs do not reflect sales or business in India. The plaintiffs only filed\nconsolidated sale figures, without reflecting as to what were their sales in India. No documents\nhave been filed to show that the plaintiffs had any sales in India reflecting business or reputation\nof plaintiffs in India in respect of its trademark EQUAL. Merely registration of a trademark,\nwithout marketing the products under it and without use of trademark, does not constitute a\nprima facie case in favour of plaintiffs.\n",
        "p_9": "7.      The defendants were in the business of Mineral Water and Sparkling Soda. The\ndefendants products is likely to be sold at those places where there would be no scope of\nplaintiffs products being sold. Plaintiffs products would be available either at grocery stores or\nwith the chemists whereas defendants products would be available at petrol pumps, restaurants,\nlocal shops, even at traffic signals and movable-cart shops. The consumer of plaintiffs products\nare naturally an elite class persons who are calorie conscious and would like to use it in place of\nsugar. Such persons purchase the same with advice of doctors or some friend. 'Low Calories\nSweeteners-Aspartame based' are not bought by people as a common use item without\nrecommendations. In view of the above, I consider that the plaintiffs do not have a prima facie\ncase in their favour.\n",

        "p_11": " 8.      Admittedly, the plaintiffs are not in the business of selling mineral water and sparkling\nsoda. Any kind of sale of products of defendants was not going to reduce the sale of the products\nof the plaintiffs resulting into any loss to the plaintiffs because plaintiffs are not in the business of\nmineral water and sparkling soda. Nor it is the claim of plaintiffs that it was selling mineral water.\nThus, there is no question of any loss much less irreparable loss being suffered by plaintiffs\nbecause of sale of mineral water or other products like plastic bottles or auto parts by defendants\nfor which defendants' trademark is registered.\n",
        "p_12": "9.      The balance of convenience also does not lie in faovur of plaintiffs. As far as India is\nconcerned, plaintiffs have not even prima facie been able to show that they have any reputation\nin India which was going to suffer because of use of trademark EQUAL by defendants. Moreover,\ndefendants were using this trademark since 1988 i.e. for above 20 years which itself shows that\nthe balance of convenience would lie in favour of defendants and not in favour of plaintiffs. The\ndefendants companies are registered in India. Defendants applied for registration of trademark\nand this trademark was registered after thorough search by the trademark Registry. EQUAL is not\na coined word and it is a common word and it can come to mind of anybody that why not EQUAL\nshould be used as trademark. It can be a coincidence that plaintiffs started use of word EQUAL in\nUSA and defendants used the same in India at different times. That does not create any balance\nof convenience in faovur of plaintiffs and against the defendants. I, therefore, find no force in this\napplication under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 CPC made by plaintiffs. The application is hereby\ndismissed.\n",

The Power of Attorney in his favor dated 27.1.2003 has been proved as Ex.P1. 3. The plaintiff is engaged in the business of manufacturing and marketing of paints, varnishes, enamels and other like products and colour concentrates for the last more than 50 year and is stated to be the market leader in its field. The products of the plaintiff are stated to be marketed under distinctive brand names in containers and packaging bearing a distinctive trade dress and get up.\n",

In the last week of July, 2005, the plaintiff came across persons in Delhi and adjoining areas who had commenced the use and started marketing synthetic enamel by adopting the trademarks of the plaintiff such as APCOLITE, APEX and TRACtor. Defendant No.1 was found to manufacture and defendant No.2 was found to be the retailer. On further enquiries, the plaintiff found that the defendants were also manufacturing the look alike products by using the trademarks SUPER ASIAN, GREAT ASIAN, ASIAN GOLD in the same manner as the trademark of the plaintiffs and the packaging material used by the defendants was identical to that of the plaintiff giving impression as if the product of the defendants is that of the plaintiff.

However, defendant No.1 failed to appear despite service and was proceeded ex-parte and the plaintiff has led ex-parte evidence by way of affidavit. The affidavit has been filed by Shri Jaifalkar who has affirmed to the contents set out in the plaint and has proved the documents referred to aforesaid. The said witness has also proved as Ex.P7 to Ex.P9, the Notary's reports regarding purchase of the goods of the defendants and has proved the photographs of the defendant's products as Ex.P10 to Ex.P15.\n",

The same show that the defendants have been adopting the trade marks of the plaintiff and trying to package their goods with the object of deceiving the public into believing that the goods sold by the defendants are those of the plaintiff. It cannot be lost sight that the purchaser of such material is not only the educated class and thus the chances of deception are even higher. The use by the defendants of the trademark cannot be said to be bona fide and there is infringement of the rights of the plaintiff. The defendant No.1 being the manufacturer is primarily liable but has failed to enter appearance.\n",
        "p_11": "11. Learned counsel for the plaintiff states that apart from the relief claimed for in paras (a) to (d) of para 33 of the plaint, the plaintiff is also entitled to damages. In this behalf, learned counsel has relied upon the judgments of this court in Relaxo Rubber Limited and Anr. v. Selection Footwear and Anr. 1999 PTC (19) 578, Hindustan Machines v. Royal Electrical Appliances 1999 PTC (19) 685 and CS (OS) 2711/1999 L.T. Overseas Ltd. v. Guruji Trading Co. and Anr. decided on 7.9.2003. In all these cases, damages of Rs.3 lakhs were awarded in favor of the plaintiff. In Time Incorporated v. Lokesh Srivastava and Anr. 2005 (30) PTC 3 (Del) apart from compensatory damages even punitive damages were awarded to discourage and dishearten law breakers who indulge in violation with impunity. In a recent judgment in Hero Honda Motors Ltd. v. Shree Assuramji Scooters 125 (2005) DLT 504 this court has taken the view that damages in such a case should be awarded against defendants who chose to stay away from proceedings of the court and they should not be permitted to enjoy the benefits of evasion of court proceedings. The rationale for the same is that while defendants who appeared in court may be burdened with damages while defendants who chose to stay away from the court would escape such damages. The actions of the defendants result in affecting the reputation of the plaintiff and every endeavor should be made for a larger public purpose to discourage such parties from indulging in acts of deception.\n",
        "p_12": "12. A further aspect which has been emphasised in Time Incorporated case (supra) is also material that the object is also to relieve a pressure on the over-loaded system of criminal justice by providing civil alternative to criminal prosecution of minor crimes. The result of the actions of defendants is that plaintiffs, instead of putting its energy for expansion of its business and sale of products, has to use its resources to be spread over a number of litigations to bring to book the offending traders in the market. In view of the aforesaid, I am of the considered view that the plaintiff would also be entitled to damages which are quantified at Rs.3 lakhs.\n",
        "p_13": "13. A decree is passed in favor of the plaintiff and against defendant No.1 in terms of prayers (a) to (d) of para 33 of the plaint. The plaintiff is held entitled to a decree for a sum of Rs.3 lakhs against defendant No.1. The plaintiff is also held entitled to costs including the amount spent on the fee of the Local Commissioner. The decree sheet be drawn up accordingly.\n"

Secondly,\n\nplaintiff no. 1 has not authorized the other plaintiffs to use the trade\n\nmark registered exclusively in her favour. Thirdly, the present suit has\n\nbeen filed against a non-juristic person as M/s. Anantam is a proprietary\n\nconcern and neither a legal entity not a juristic person, hence the suit\n\nought to be dismissed. Further, the plaintiffs have concealed material\n\nfacts from the court as the defendant had informed them about its\n\npending registration applications in its reply dated 6 th August, 2007 and\n\ninstead of filing an opposition, the plaintiffs kept tracking the progress of\n\nthe defendant\u201fs applications and when a certificate of Registration of\n\nTrade Mark was issued under No. 1506086 by the Registrar of Trade\n\nMarks on 21st November, 2006 (only with regard to class 35) the\n\nplaintiffs decided to harass the defendant with the knowledge that the\n\ndefendant\u201fs trade mark was under a different class which had no\n\nconnection to the plaintiffs\u201f registered trade mark, which was in totally\n\nseparate classes. Lastly, the plaintiffs have not complied with the\n\nprovision contained in Order 39 Rule 3 (b) of the CPC.\n\n",

On merits, the defendant has argued that a perusal of the\n\nplaintiffs\u201f registered trademarks would show that the name \u201eAnantam\u201f\n\nhas been granted in its simple form without any logo. The trade of the\n\ndefendant is covered under Classes 35 and 42 and that of the plaintiffs\n\nunder Classes 24 and 25, which itself reveals the difference between the\n\ntwo.

Further, the goods being traded\n\nunder the name \u201eAnantam\u201f are the goods of other manufacturers and\n\ntherefore, their receptivity with the clients does not establish the\n\nplaintiffs\u201f reputation at all.\n",

Further, the defendant has\n\npointed out the long gap between the plaintiffs\u201f second legal notice and\n\nthe defendant\u201fs reply to its earlier notice i.e. from 6 th August, 2007 to\n\n19th December, 2008. While highlighting this gap, the defendant has\n\ncontended that the plaintiffs\u201f disinclination to proceed with the matter\n\nshow that the marks used by the parties were not similar and were not\n\ncausing any deception.\n",

Further, the plaintiffs\u201f place of\n\nwork is in Gurgaon, Haryana and the defendant\u201fs place of work is in\n\nJaipur, Rajasthan therefore the situation of confusion would not arise and\n\nconsumers would not wrongly presume the defendant\u201fs products to be\n\nthose of the plaintiffs\u201f and due to this reason, this court also has no\n\njurisdiction to entertain the present suit.\n",

As per the defendant\u201fs contention, its trade mark is\n\nregistered under Class 35 of Schedule IV of the Rules. Schedule IV\n\nprovides the classes wherein classification of goods and services has\n\nbeen classified. A bare perusal of this Schedule reveals that Class 35\n\nrelates to services i.e. to advertising, business management, business\n\nadministration, office functions. The defendant got the mark \u201eAnantam\u201f\n\nregistered in class 35 in respect of complete family store dealing in\n\nreadymade garments, hosiery, sarees, suits, cosmetics, perfumes, ladies\n\npurses, watches, jewellery and all type of accessories and merchandise\n\ngoods as well as part of its trading name. Admittedly, the defendant is\n\nusing the name/ mark and logo of \u201eAnantam\u201f on packages, invoices and\n\nother printed material etc., as fact which has been admitted by the\n\ncounsel for defendant during the course of hearing of the interim\n\ninjunction. After examination of classification of goods it is clear that\n\nthe goods in which the defendant\u201fs mark/ name is registered fall in\n\nclasses 14, 18, 24 and 25 and not in class 35. I do not agree with the\n\nlearned counsel for the defendant that the defendant has only one shop\n\nfrom where these goods are being sold because of the reason that while\n\nselling the merchandise items, the defendant is admittedly using packing\n\nmaterial, advertisement products, plastic bags, invoices, sign board and\n\ngift packs where the name \u201eAnantam\u201f is mentioned, whether as a mark\n\nor a name and this has to be considered as a user if the mark/name\n\n\n\nCS (OS) No. 602/2009                                           Page 8 of 15\n \u201eAnantam\u201f.\n",

I am of the considered view that even\n\notherwise, in an action of passing off, the well settled law in Century\n\nTraders v. Roshan Lal Duggar Co., AIR 1978 (Del) 250 will be\n\napplicable. In this case it was held that for the purpose of claiming\n\nproprietorship of a mark, it is not necessary that the mark should have\n\nbeen used for considerable length of time. A single actual use with intent\n\nto continue such use eo instanti confers a right to such mark as a trade\n\nmark. Further, in order to succeed in an application for temporary\n\ninjunction the applicant has to establish user of the aforesaid mark prior\n\nin point of time than the impugned user by the non-applicant. Further\n\nstill, actual damage or fraud is unnecessary in a passing off action\n\nwhether the relief asked for is injunction alone or injunction, accounts\n\nand damages.

By the present judgment, I propose to decide IA No. 1879/2005, an application filed by the plaintiff under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 and IA No. 8252/2006 filed by the defendant under Section 124 of the Trademarks Act, 1999 wherein the defendant has prayed for stay of the suit of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_5": "3. Inasmuch as there is no material dispute to the facts and circumstances giving rise to the present case, the same are briefly noticed hereafter. The plaintiff has claimed that it is a corporation constituted under the laws of State of the United States of America and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer Inc. - a global research based pharmaceutical company claiming responsibility and credit for discovery and development of innovative value-added medicines which improve the quality of life of people around the world. Amongst the various drugs developed and sold by the plaintiff after investment of enormous sums of money on research and development worldwide, the plaintiff developed an anti-depressanty drug and coined the trademark 'Zoloft' in 1989 for use in its respect. The earliest registration for the trademark 'Zoloft' relates to 1989 and the plaintiff claims to have applied for and obtained registration of this mark in over 90 counties around the world. This drug has received the approval of the United States Food and Drug Administration ('FDA' for short) for its manufacture in marketing in December, 1991 and is stated to be sold in over 90 counties worldwide. Apart from the expenditure incurred on development of this medication, since 1991 the plaintiff has expended millions of dollars to promote and educate patients and medical professionals about the product sold under the trademark 'Zoloft'. This product is stated to have received enormous media attention. According to the plaintiff it has also achieved instant fame and recognition in the medical community as also members of the general public. This drug is utilized as an anti-depression drug and the plaintiff's product sold under the trademark 'Zoloft' is the first and only medicine approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of postphromatic stress disorder.\n",
        "p_6": "4. The plaintiff submits that it applied for registration of the trademark 'Zoloft' in India on the 18th of November, 1992 in class 5 under the Schedule to the Trademark & Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. This trademark has been registered by the Trademark Registry and the plaintiff is thus the registered proprietor thereof having exclusive statutory rights to use the same in respect of its goods. This registration is stated to be subsisting and valid even on date.\n",
        "p_7": "The registration certificate dated 4th June, 2005 of the trademark 'Zoloft' in favor of the plaintiff, which was issued on 4th of June, 2005 related back to its application dated 18th November, 1992. The same has been placed on record.\n",
        "p_8": "5. The plaintiff has complained that the defendant dishonestly made an application bearing No. 1165372 B in class-5 in respect of an identical trademark 'Zoloft' which was advertised for acceptance in the Trademark Journal Page 1656 No. Megha VI dated 25th November, 2003 wherein the defendant was claiming proprietorship of the trademark 'Zoloft' which was identical to the plaintiff's well-known prior trademark 'Zoloft'. The defendant has also claimed use of this mark since 1st January, 2003. The application was filed in the name of Shri Rajesh Chopra, defendant No. 1 trading as the defendant No. 2.\n",
        "p_9": "6. In these circumstances, the plaintiff caused a legal notice dated 8th July, 2004 to be issued to the defendants calling upon them to cease and desist from manufacturing, selling or offering for sale, any goods under the trademark 'Zoloft' or any other mark similar thereto. By a letter dated 15th July, 2004, the defendant's attorney informed the plaintiff that the defendants had searched the record of the Trademark registry and that the plaintiff's application was not shown in the pending applications in the Registry. In response thereto, the plaintiff's attorney enclosed the copy of the prior application of the plaintiff also mentioning that since the application was not opposed, it was likely to proceed to registration.\n",
        "p_10": "7. The plaintiff also filed a notice of objection against the defendant's trademark application seeking registration of the trademark 'Zoloft'. This opposition was filed on the 8th of June, 2004. The plaintiff's attorney again reminded the defendant by a communication dated 10th August, 2004 to comply with the requisitions contained in the previous letter. Instead of abiding by the notice demand, by a communication dated 16th August, 2004 the defendant sought proof of use by the plaintiff of the trademark 'Zoloft'. Despite responses from the plaintiff's attorney on the 20th of August, 2004 and a reminder on 24th September, 2004, nothing further was received from the defendant.\n",
        "p_11": "Instead the defendant filed a cancellation petition dated 9th November, 2005 against the plaintiff's trademark 'Zoloft' at the IPAB. The plaintiff filed a counter dated 25th January, 2006 to the defendant's cancellation petition. The defendant also filed a counter statement thereto on the 25th February, 2006. So far as the cancellation petition filed by the defendant on 9th November, 2005 is concerned, the defendant has filed the reply to the counter. However, no hearing has taken place in these proceedings.\n",
        "p_12": "8. In the present suit the plaintiff has also claimed exclusive proprietary rights in the trademark 'Geodon' in respect of which it received registration in India on the 18th of July, 1996. The plaintiff received the approval of this drug and name of the United States Food and Drug Administration in the year 2001. So far as 'Geodon' was concerned, the plaintiff launched the product under this trademark for the treatment of brain disorder called Schizophrenia and this product of the plaintiff contains Ziprasidone and is sold under the names Zeldox and 'Geodon' in more than 40 countries worldwide.\n",
        "p_13": "9. The plaintiff had applied for registration of the trademark 'Geodon' with the Trademark Registry in India on the 18th of July, 1996 in class-5 of the Schedule to the Trademark & Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. For this drug and mark, the plaintiff received the trademark registration certificate dated 24th February, 2005 from the Registrar of Trademarks after the filing of the suit which related back to the date of the application made on 18th of July, 1996. Consequent upon the registration of the trademark, and by virtue of Page 1657 the applicable statutory provisions, and now by virtue of Section 31 of the Trademarks Act, 1999 the plaintiff has exclusive proprietary rights in such trademark 'Geodon' also. The registration of the trademark 'Geodon' in favor of the plaintiff stands renewed till 18th of July, 2016 and copy thereof has been placed before this court.\n",
        "p_14": "10. The plaintiff became aware of the defendant's action when it saw the advertisement in respect of an identical trademark 'Geodon' advertised in the Trademark Journal No. Megha VI dated 25th November, 2003 issued in the name of Mr. Rajesh Chopra, defendant No. 1 herein also trading as defendant No. 2. The defendant had claimed proprietorship of 'Geodon' and use of the mark since 1st of June, 2003. Investigations revealed that the product under the trademark 'Geodon' of the defendants was available in the market and that the defendant No. 1 was also the director of defendant No. 2. The defendant No. 1 was using the trademark 'Geodon' for B-complex, multi-vitamins and zinc capsules.\n",
        "p_15": "11. The plaintiff immediately filed a notice of objection against the defendant's trademark application on the 21st of July, 2004. By a notice dated 3rd November, 2004, the defendants were called upon to seize and desist against the use of the trademark 'Geodon'. The defendants denied the plaintiff's contentions by the reply dated 8th November, 2004. Further correspondence included a letter of 17th December, 2004 from the plaintiff's counsel enclosing details of their trademark application and a legal notice dated 11th February, 2005 enclosing their drug license. On 23rd February, 2005, the defendant responded to the plaintiff's communication without enclosing any drug license. The defendant filed a counter statement dated 25th February, 2005 in form TM-6 to the plaintiff's opposition to its trademark application.\n",
        "p_16": "12. The plaintiff has asserted that it has expended millions of dollars not only in developing these drugs but in promoting and educating patients and medical professionals about the products sold under such trademarks. These products have also received extensive media attention and have been highly publicised having received coverage in many publications and periodicals whereby the drugs received instant fame and recognition in the medical community and general public which publicity has also reached the shores of India and is stated to be widely appreciated by members connected with the medical profession and the general public.\n",
        "p_17": "13. The plaintiff's website www.geodon.com provides extensive information about these drugs and their use which website is accessible anywhere in the world including in India. The products are extremely well known and have been discussed in several international conferences and seminars which were attended by members of the medical profession worldwide including by those from India.\n",
        "p_18": "14. As the defendant failed to respond positively, the plaintiff was left with no option but to file the present suit seeking an injunction against the defendant in respect of the user of the trademark 'Zoloft' and 'Geodon' on grounds of passing off and unfair competition on or around 7th of March, 2005.\n",
        "p_19": "Page 1658\n \n\n",
        "p_20": "15. The defendants were served with the summons in the suit and notice in the application and entered appearance on 3rd of May, 2005. Long thereafter, the defendant filed a cancellation petition on the 9th of November, 2005 against the plaintiff's registered trademark 'Geodon' at the IPAB. The plaintiff is contesting this cancellation petition. Evidence stands filed while the defendant's evidence is still awaited.\n",
        "p_21": "16. There is no dispute that these proceedings before the IPAB and the Registrar of Trademarks are still pending in respect of both the trademarks. 16.During the pendency of the present case, the plaintiff received the registration certificates in respect of these trademarks and filed an application seeking amendment of the plaint to incorporate an action for infringement of its registered trademark. This amendment was allowed by this Court by an order passed on 8th February, 2006 and hence the present suit in the present form.\n",
        "p_22": "17. It is noteworthy that during the pendency of the present case, the defendant filed I.A. No. 1347/2006 being an application under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 praying for rejection of the plaint for want of territorial jurisdiction. By a detailed judgment passed on 8th of February, 2006, this Court held that the courts at Delhi has jurisdiction to entertain the present suit claiming an injunction in respect of the threat of the defendant to sell the offending goods in Delhi.\n",
        "p_23": "18. So far as the present application seeking injunction is concerned, long arguments have been addressed by the defendant on the same issue. However, the order dated 8th February, 2006 passed by this Court in the facts of the present case has attained finality. It is well settled that principles of res judicata apply to different stages of the same proceedings as well. Ref : Satyadhyam Ghosal and Ors. v. Deorajin Devi ; Hindalco Industries Ltd. v. Suman Lata Tuteja \n\n \n\nI have no manner of doubt that the findings returned by this Court in the order dated 8th February, 2006 would guide and bind adjudication even on the objection again raised by the defendant so far as territorial jurisdiction of this Court is concerned during the hearing on these applications.\n",
        "p_24": "19. Even otherwise, I find that in para 48 of the plaint, the plaintiff has stated that the defendant has threatened to sell the offending goods under the infringing trademark at Delhi. There is no denial to these averments in the written statement filed by the defendant. The defendant has only made the application for registration of the trademarks at Delhi and has not restricted the same to any particular area.\n",
        "p_25": "20. I find that the judgment relied on by the defendant in support of this objection which is reported at (2006) 33 PTC 107 (Del) Dabur India Ltd. v. K.R. Industries is clearly distinguishable on facts. In this case, the defendant was not only based in Andhra Pradesh but was restricted to its business activities within Andhra Pradesh and the neighbouring States. The defendant had clearly stated that it had never sold any of its goods within the territorial Page 1659 jurisdiction of this court. The defendant had also averred that it had neither any place of business nor any dealer in Delhi. On these facts, the court came to a conclusion that so far as the cause of action of the plaintiff pertaining to passing off by the defendant was concerned, this Court does not have the territorial jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate upon the present case. For this reason, this judgment in (2006) 33 PTC 348 Dabur India Ltd. v. K.R. Industries, has no application, which was upheld by the Division Bench.\n",
        "p_26": "21. Mr. N.K. Manchanda, learned Counsel for the defendant has also vehemently urged that the plaintiff is selling these drugs only in the United States of America and is not selling them in Delhi and consequently, it cannot maintain the present suit in Delhi.\n",
        "p_27": "22. In my view, this fact would have no bearing so far as the examination of an issue or an objection relating to territorial jurisdiction of the court is concerned. Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure mandates that a suit is required to be filed, either where the cause of action has arisen wholly or in part or where the defendant resides.\n",
        "p_28": "Section 133(5) of the Trademarks Act, 1999 enable a plaintiff to bring an action for infringement of its registered trademark at a place where it is located. This in my view, is merely an additional option made statutorily available to the plaintiff as a place of suing the defendant for infringement of the trademark.\n",
        "p_29": "23. A threat received by the plaintiff of effecting sales in Delhi and apprehension of sales in this particular region would constitute cause of action for bringing an action for prohibitory injunction in the courts at Delhi. I find that on 8th of February, 2006, this Court has already held that cause of action has arisen within the territorial jurisdiction of the court.\n",
        "p_30": "For these reasons as well, the objection of the defendant has to be rejected.\n",
        "p_31": "24. The defendant before this Court has raised a strong objection that the plaintiff has failed to establish use of the trademark in India and consequently, on account of such non-use, it can claim no benefit there under and that the trademark is liable to be removed from the Register of Trademarks. So far as this submission is concerned, it is necessary to examine Section 47(1)(b) of the Trademarks Act, 1999 which is the relevant statutory provision in this behalf. This Section reads thus:\n",
        "p_32": "Section 47 - Removal from register and imposition of limitations on ground of non-use.-\n",
        "p_33": "(1) A registered trade mark may be taken off the register in respect of the goods or services in respect of which it is registered on application made in the prescribed manner to the Registrar or the Appellate Board by any person aggrieved on the ground either-\n",
        "p_34": "(a) ...\n",
        "p_35": "(b) that up to a date three months before the date of the application, a continuous period of five years from the date on which the trade mark is actually entered in the register or longer had elapsed during which the trade mark was registered and during which there was no bona fide use thereof in relation to those goods or services by any proprietor thereof for the time being.\n",
        "p_36": "Page 1660\n \n\nThis provision has not so far been the subject of interpretation by courts so far. However, I find that Section 46 of the earlier Trade & Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 is akin to Section 47 of the later statute.\n",
        "p_37": "The expression \"use\" in this statutory provision has been the subject matter of authoritative judicial pronouncement and would guide adjudication in the present case as well. In this behalf, it would be useful to refer to the pronouncement of the Apex Court reported in (2003) 27 PTC 241 Hardie Trading Ltd. v. Addisons Paint & Chemicals Ltd. The appellant herein was seeking an injunction based on the registered trademarks 'Sparton' and 'Sparton Velox'. These trademarks were used by the appellant/plaintiff or its predecessor in interest in respect of the paints and lacquers and others surface coatings since its registration in Australia, New Zealand and thereafter in this country. Consequently, by virtue of agreement between them, the appellants and the respondents were engaged in the introduction and sale in the Indian market of paints and lacquers prepared under the appellant's preparation and under its trademark. In this case, the appellant had filed an application in the Calcutta suit for stay of the rectification proceedings which had been filed by the respondents in Calcutta for rectification of the Register of Trademarks by deleting Hardie's trademarks under Section 46(1) of the Trade & Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. A rectification was sought inter alia on the ground that there was no bona fide use by the proprietor of the trademark and it ought to be removed. The court construed the meaning of the expression 'use' in Section 46(1) of the statute which required non-use for a period of five years prior to the date of the application. It was held that a proprietor's intention to abandon the trademark is a necessary component of their non-user justifying their removal. This was recognised as early as in 1884 by Chitty, J. in Mouson & Co. v. Boehm 26 Ch. D. 398.\n",
        "p_38": "25. So far as the expression 'use' in Section 46(1) of the Act of 1958 is concerned, it was observed by the Apex Court that the phrase which is used in Section 46 is 'bona fide use thereof in relation to those goods' which has been defined in Section 2(2)(b) of the Act (Act of 1958) thus:\n",
        "p_39": "2(2) In this act, unless the context otherwise requires any reference-\n",
        "p_40": "(a) ...\n",
        "p_41": "(b). to the use of a mark in relation to goods shall be construed as a reference to the use of the mark upon, or in any physical or in any relation whatsoever to such goods;\n",
        "p_42": "Further, Section 46(3) of the Act statutorily prescribes the intention to abandon as an essential component of non-use for the purpose of Section 46(1)\n",
        "p_43": "26. It is also necessary to bear in mind that under Section 18 of the Act of 1958 that any person who is claiming to be a proprietor of the trademark which is used or proposed to be used by him can apply for registration. Consequently, even if the plaintiff had not been manufacturing its products under these trademarks, it could have applied for the registration.\n",
        "p_44": "Page 1661\n \n\nThe Apex Court thus held that the use of the trademark may therefore be other than physical use thereof. It may be in any other relation to the goods. Given this statutory meaning, there was no reason to limit the use of the trademark to use of the goods or to the sale of goods bearing the trademark. In so holding the Apex Court placed reliance on Hermes Trademark, (1872) RPC 425, wherein the registered proprietor had inserted an advertisement in which the trademark appeared in relation to the watches it manufactured in the annual trade publication. It was also in evidence that the registered proprietor placed an order for parts of the watches during the period of alleged non-use although actual sale of the watches took place subsequently. The court held that the words 'other relation' in an identical statutory provision in the United Kingdom meant 'something other than actually being upon the goods or in physical relation to them that would cover the use of the mark...for example, in advertisements, in invoices, in orders and so on'. It was also said that the phrase 'in the course of trade' must be wide enough to embrace the steps necessary for the production of the goods as well the actual placing them on the market. Thus, it was held that even though there was no use of the mark upon or in physical relation to the goods, but it was used in 'other relation' i.e. to say in non-physical use.\n",
        "p_45": "27. In Bon Matin Trade Mark 1989 RPC 536 use of the trademark by issue of price lists and promotional literature on two occasions prior to the application for rectification, had been held to be 'non physical use' of the trademark.\n",
        "p_46": "28. The Apex Court thus held that the additional words 'any' and 'whatsoever' qualifying the words 'other relation' in Section 2(2)(b) of the Act of 1958 gave the words a much wider meaning. Reading this definition into Section 46(1), the Apex Court held that the word 'use' in Section 46(1) may encompass actions other than actual sale. The court also noticed that there may be other special circumstances existing which may provide a special defense to the registered proprietor in an action under Section 46(1) seeking removal of its trademark with the Registrar of Trademarks. This may include business exigencies even. In this case, the appellant before the Supreme Court had urged the restriction on its importing goods etc. The question therefore which had to be examined was as to whether there was non-physical use of the trademark within the meaning of the expression under Section 2(2)(b) of the Act of 1958 or any special circumstances which could be urged as a defense to a petition under Section 46(1).\n",
        "p_47": "29. It is imperative to notice that the Trade Marks Act of 1999 contains statutory provisions which are akin to the provisions contained in The Trade & Merchandise Marks Act, of 1958. Section 2(2)(c) of the Trade Marks Act of 1999 is pari materia to Section 2(b)(b) of the Act of 1958 which fell for consideration before the Apex Court in the Hardie Trading Ltd. case (Supra). Therefore, the principles of law laid down in Hardie Trading Ltd. v. Addisons Paint & Chemicals Ltd. will be applicable under the Trademarks Act, 1999 which has similar provisions.\n",
        "p_48": "Page 1662\n \n\n",
        "p_49": "30. In the present case, the plaintiff has placed extensive details of advertisements published by it and the seminars held by it in respect of both the trademarks 'Zoloft' and 'Geodon'. Such advertisements/material would in my view, satisfy the test of non-physical use laid down by the Apex Court in Hardie Trading Ltd. (supra) and would prima facie give a valid defense to the assertion of the defendant of non-use of the trademarks on the part of the plaintiff before this Court within the meaning of Section 2(2)(c) of the Trademarks Act, 1999.\n",
        "p_50": "The plaintiff has placed before this Court copies of the worldwide registration certificates of their trademarks in ZOLOFT as well as GEODON. The plaintiff has also listed several conferences and international functions conducted in USA, Europe and Canada where the trademarks ZOLOFT and GEODON have been discussed. These include the 57th APA Institute on Psyciatric Services in October 2005 in San Diego, USA; the 35th NCCBH Annual Training Conference in March, 2005 in San Francisco, USA; the 18th European Collage of Neuropsychopharmacology in October, 2005 in Amsterdam, Netherlands, and the 159th APA Annual Meeting in May, 2006 in Ontario, Canada. I find that the Food and Drug Administration Approval (FDA) for marketing ziprasidone (Zoloft & Geodon) have been placed before this Court as well as articles relating to Geodon in journals and newspapers such as American Family Physician, June 1st, 2002 entitled 'Significant FDA Approvals in 2001'; Clinical Psychiatry News, March 2005, Vol. 33 No. 3 entitled 'The Art of Meghan Caughey'; DG News (Doctors Guide), October 12th, 2004 discussing the comparative study between ziprasidone and olanzapine; Psychiatric Times, May, 2001, Vol. xviii Issue 5 entitled 'Examining the Factors that influence Antisychotic Prescribing Decisions'; American Family Physician, June 1st, 2003 entitled 'Use of Atypical Antisychotic Drugs in Patients with Dementia'; Psychiatric Times, April, 2001, Vol. xviii, Issue 4 entitled 'Treating Bipolar Disorder : Toward the 3rd Millennium'; JSWE Vol. 38 No. 2 entitled 'Research On the Drug Treatment of Schizophrenia : A Critical Appraisal and Implications for Social Work Education and also articles in newspapers featuring Zoloft such as Times of India, February 21st, 2001 entitled 'Medication Can Lessen the Trauma of OCD Patients'; Times of India, May 24th, 2000 entitled 'Anti Depressants Drive Midlife Blues Away'; Business Standard, October 25, 2005 entitled 'An Epidemic of Sadness and other newspaper articles published outside India in USA, France, Spain, Canada, Japan, Australia, UK, Korea, Germany, New Zealand, Pakistan, Singapore, South Africa, Argentina and Mexico. There are print outs from the plaintiff's website www.geodon.com and www.zoloft.com on record.\n",
        "p_51": "31. Further the annual reports of the plaintiff company for the years 2001-2005 prima facie evidence the extensive sales of the products Geodon and Zoloft and articles have been placed on record by the plaintiff regarding a drug sold by it under the trademark geodon and zoloft.\n",
        "p_52": "32. In view of the principles laid down in Hardie Trading Ltd. v. Addisons Paint & Chemicals Ltd., this certainly brings the action of the plaintiff within the meaning of use in Section 2(2)(c) and Section 47 of Trademarks Act of 1999.\n",
        "p_53": "Page 1663\n \n\n",
        "p_54": "33. The second limb of the defendant's objection has been that it is an admitted position that the plaintiff is not selling in India and there is no material of its sales placed before this court. For this reason, the defendant submits, that the plaintiff is disentitled to maintain an injunction action in India. It has further been urged that the plaintiff is bound to establish a presence and use within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court in order to be entitled to an injunction. In this behalf, reliance has been placed on  Consolidated Foods Corporation v. Brandon & Co.  Corn Products Refinery Co. v. Shangrila Food Products Ltd. 2001 PTC 889 Veerumal Praveen Kumar v. Needle Industries (India) Ltd. and Anr. (1992) PTC Roebuck & Co. v. Happy House (2004) 8 PTC 585 Milment Optho Industries v. Allegan Inc. (1998) PTC 18 156 Cluedent Body v. Aero Apparels.\n",
        "p_55": "34. There can be no dispute with the proposition laid down by the Apex Court in  Corn Products Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food Products Ltd. wherein the Apex Court has observed that the presence of a mark in the register does not by itself prove its use at all.\n",
        "p_56": "However, even the principles laid down by the Apex Court cannot be applied in abstract without regard to the facts of the case. Regard has to be had to the fact that the products in the present case are medicines and drugs. It is trite that an applicant can seek registration of a trademark on a proposed use basis as well.\n",
        "p_57": "35. In an action for infringement, it has been held in 1965 SCR 737 Kaviraj Pandit Durgadutt Sharma v. Navrattan Pharmaceutical Laboratory that the plaintiff must make out use by the defendant's of the plaintiff's trademark or adoption of its essential features of the trademark of the plaintiff. It was further held by the court that in an action for infringement, where the trademark of the defendant is so close to the plaintiff's mark, nothing further is required to establish the violation.\n",
        "p_58": "36. In this regard it is necessary to consider the relevant statutory provision which reads thus:\n",
        "p_59": "29. Infringement of registered trade marks - (1) A registered trade mark is infringed by a person who, not being a registered proprietor or a person using by way of permitted use, uses in the course of trade a mark which is identical with, or deceptively similar to, the trade mark in relation to goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered and in such manner as to render the use of the mark likely to be taken as being used as a trade mark.\n",

        "p_71": "37. The plaintiff before this Court has endeavored to establish the reputation of the trademark in question. However, I find that in 1986 PTC 71 American Home Products Corporation v. Mak Laboratories Pvt. Ltd., the court while dealing with the action for injunction against infringement of a registered trademark held that for the purposes of the registration of the trademark, it is not necessary that the goods should be in existence at the date of the application for registration and that in an infringement action, the plaintiff is not required to prove the reputation of his mark. The observations of the Apex Court in this behalf deserve to be considered in extenso and reads thus:\n",
        "p_72": "35. The reason why the two conditions specified in Clause (a) are made cumulative is obvious. As the definition of \"trade mark\" contained in Clause (v) of Section 2(1) shows, a trade mark is a mark used or proposed to be used in relation to goods for the purpose of indicating or so as to indicate a connection in the course of trade between the goods and some person having the right to use the mark. It is, therefore, not necessary for the purpose of registering a trade mark that those goods should be in existence at the date of application for registration. A person who intends to manufacture goods or has made preparations for the manufacture of goods but the manufacture has not commenced and, therefore, goods have not been marketed is none the less entitled to get the trade mark which he proposes to use in relation to those goods registered. In the present-day world of commerce and industry, a Page 1665 manufacturing industry can neither be commenced nor established overnight. There are innumerable preparatory steps required to be taken and formalities to be complied with before the manufacture of goods can start and the manufactured goods marketed. The process must of necessity take time. If the position were that the mere non-user of a trade mark for the period mentioned in Clause (a) or Section 46(1) would make a trademark liable to be taken off the Register, it would result in great hardship and cause a large number of trade marks to be removed from Register, because the moment one month has elapsed after the registration of a trademark has been ordered, a trade rival can make an application on the ground set out in Clause (a) of Section 46(1) claiming that there has been no bona fide use of the trade up to a date one month before the date of his application. It is in order to prevent such harassment and absurd result that the two conditions specified in Clause (a) have been made cumulative.\n",
        "p_73": "36. The object underlying Section 46(1) is to prevent trafficking in trade marks. This is, in fact, the object underlying all trade marks laws. A trade mark is meant to distinguish the goods made by one person from those made by another. A trade mark, therefore, cannot exist in vacuo. It can only exist in connection with the goods in relation to which it is used or intended to be used. Its object is to indicate a connection in the course of trade between the goods and some person having the right to use the mark either with or without any indication of the identity of that person. Clause (v) of Section 2(1) which defines the expression \"trade mark\" makes this abundantly clear. Trade marks became important after the Industrial Revolution as distinguishing goods made by one person from those made by another; and soon the need was felt to protect traders against those who were unauthorisedly using their marks and accordingly registration of trade marks was introduced in England by the Trade Marks Registration Act, 1875, which was soon replaced by more detailed and advance legislation. When a person gets his trade mark registered, he acquires valuable rights by reason of such registration. Registration of his trade mark gives him the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in connection with the goods in respect of which it is registered and if there is any invasion of this right by any other person using a mark which is the same or deceptively similar to his trade mark, he can protect his trade mark by an action for infringement in which he can obtain injunction, damages or an account of profits made by other person. In such an action, the registration of a trade mark is prima facie evidence of its validity. After the expiry of seven years from the date of the registration a trade mark is to be valid in all respects except in the three cases set out Section 32. The proprietor of an unregistered trade mark whose mark is unauthorisedly used by another cannot, however, sue for the infringement of such trade mark. His only remedy lies in bringing a passing-off action, an inconvenient remedy as compared to an infringement action. In a passing-off action the plaintiff will have to prove that his mark has by user acquired such reputation as to become distinctive of the plaintiffs goods so that if it is Page 1666 used in relation to any goods of the kind dealt with by the plaintiff, it will be understood by the trade and public as meaning that the goods are the plaintiffs goods. In an infringement action, the plaintiff is not required to prove the reputation of his mark. Further, under Section 37 a registered mark is assignable and transmissible either with or without goodwill of the business concerned while under Section 38, an unregistered trade mark is not assignable or transmissible except in the three cases set out in Section 38(2).\n",
        "p_74": "38. So far as acquisition of reputation in relation to a trademark attached to a product is concerned, law has evolved in tune with the technical developments and the milestones achieved in trade, industry, communication and the media especially the electronic modes. The courts have repeatedly held that goods do not now require to be physically traded for establishing existence of goodwill and reputation of the trademark attached to them. Non-physical use of a trademark is legally accepted as being covered under the expression 'use' under the trademark statute.\n",
        "p_75": "39. The principles which would govern a passing off action in deciding the question of deceptive similarity were laid down by the Apex Court in 2001 PTC 300 (SC) Cadila Health Care Ltd. v. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd. wherein the question had been raised as to whether the mark 'Falicigo' and 'Falcitab' were deceptively similar.\n",
        "p_76": "40. In this case, the Apex Court held that public interest support lesser degree of proof showing confusing similarity in the case of trademark in respect of medicinal products. Emphasising that confusion between medicinal products may be life threatening and not merely inconvenient, the court held thus:\n",
        "p_77": "Public interest would support lesser degree of proof showing confusing similarity in the case of trade mark in respect of medicinal product as against other non-medicinal products. Drugs are poisons, not sweets. Confusion between medicinal products may, therefore, be life threatening, not merely inconvenient. Nothing the frailty of human nature and the pressures placed by society on doctors, there should be as many clear indicators as possible to distinguish two medicinal products from each other. It is not uncommon that in hospitals, drugs can be requested verbally and/or under critical/pressure situations. Many patients may be elderly, infirm or illiterate. They may not be in a position to differentiate between the medicine prescribed and bought which is ultimately handed over to them. This view finds support from McCarthy on Trade Marks, 3rd Edition, para 23.12 of which reads as under:\n",
        "p_78": "The tests of confusing similarity are modified when the goods involved are medicinal products. Confusion of source or product between medicinal products may produce physically harmful results to purchasers and greater protection is required then in the ordinary case. If the goods involved are medicinal products each with different effects and designed for even subtly different uses, confusion among the products caused by similar marks could have disastrous effects. For these reasons, it is proper to require a lesser Page 1667 quantum of proof of confusing similarity fordrugs and medicinal preparations. The same standard has been applied to medical products such as surgical sutures and clavicle splints.\n",
        "p_79": "The decisions of English Courts would be relevant in a country where literacy is high and the marks used are in the language which the purchaser can understand. While English cases may be relevant in understanding the essential features of trade mark law but when we are dealing with the sale of consumer items in India, you have to see and bear in mind the difference in situation between England and India. Can English principles apply in their entirely in India with no regard to Indian conditions? We think not. In a country like India where there is no single common language, a large percentage of population is illiterate and a small fraction of people know English, then to apply the principles of English law regarding dissimilarity of the marks or the customer knowing about the distinguishing characteristics of the plaintiff's goods seems to over look the ground realities in India. While examining such cases in India, what has to be kept in mind is the purchaser of such goods in India who may have absolutely no knowledge of English language or of the language in which the trade mark is written and to whom different words with slight difference in spellings may sound phonetical the same. While dealing with cases relating to passing off one of the important tests which has to be applied in each case is whether the misrepresentation made by the defendant is of such a nature as is likely to cause an ordinary consumer to confuse one product for another due to similarity of marks and other surrounding factors. What is likely to cause confusion would vary from case to case. However, the appellants are right in contending that where medicinal products are involved, the test to be applied for adjudging the violation of trade mark law may not be at par with cases involving non-medicinal products. A stricter approach should be adopted while applying the test to judge the possibility of confusion of one medicinal product for another by the consumer. While confusion in the case of non-medicinal products may only cause economic loss to the plaintiff, confusion between the two medicinal products may have disastrous effects on health and in some cases life itself. Stringent measures should be adopted specially where medicines are the medicines of last resort as any confusion in such medicines may be fatal or could have disastrous effects. The confusion as to the identity of the product itself could have dire effects on the public health.\n",
        "p_80": "Keeping in view the provisions of Section 17B of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 which inter alia indicates an imitation or resemblance of another drug in a manner likely to deceive being regarded as a spurious drug it is but proper that before granting permission to manufacture a drug under a brand name the authority under that Act is satisfied that there will be no confusion or deception in the market. The authorities should consider requiring such an applicant to submit an official search report from the Trae Mark office pertaining to the trade mark in question which will enable the drug authority to arrive at a correct conclusion.\n",
        "p_81": "Page 1668\n \n\nSo far as medicinal products are concerned, the courts have emphasised that an exacting judicial scrutiny is required if there is a possibility of confusion over marks on medicinal products because the potential harm may be far more dire than that in confusion over ordinary consumer products Ref : American Cyamid Corporation v. Connaught Laboratories Inc. 231 USPQ 128 (2nd 1986). Physicians, parmacists, nurses and patients are human and are not infallible or immune from confusion or mistakes. Prescriptions are often handwritten and frequently telephoned. If drugs of markedly different compositions have trademarks which maybe visually or phonetically similar, human life may be imperiled.\n",
        "p_82": "The Apex Court also observed that in view of the varying infrastructure for supervision of physicians and pharmacists of medical profession in our country due to linguistic, urban, semi-urban and rural divide across the country and with high degree of possibility of even accidental negligence, strict measures to prevent any confusion arising from similarity of marks among medicines are required to be taken.\n",
        "p_83": "41. The Apex Court did not interfere with the judgments of the lower courts on the ground that the matter required evidence. However, the following principles in relation to adjudication on the question of deceptive similarity in a passing off action were laid down:\n",
        "p_84": "(a) The nature of the marks i.e. whether the marks are word marks or label marks or composite marks, i.e. both words and label works.\n",
        "p_85": "(b) The degree of resembleness between the marks, phonetically similar and hence similar in idea.\n",
        "p_86": "(c) The nature of the goods in respect of which they are used as trade marks.\n",
        "p_87": "(d) The similarity in the nature, character and performance of the goods of the rival traders.\n",
        "p_88": "(e) The class of purchasers who are likely to buy the goods bearing the marks they require, on their education and intelligence and a degree of care they are likely to exercise in purchasing and/or using the goods.\n",
        "p_89": "(f) The mode of purchasing the goods or placing orders for the goods, and\n \n\n",
        "p_90": "(g) Any other surrounding circumstances which may be relevant in the extent of dissimilarity between the competing marks.\n",
        "p_91": "42. These principles were reiterated in a recent pronouncement of the Apex Court reported in 2004 (28) PTC 585 (SC) Milment of the Industries and Ors. v. Allergan Inc. The appellants were an Indian pharmaceutical manufacturing company while the respondents were a pharmaceutical company manufacturing pharmaceutical products in several countries. The respondents filed a suit for injunction based on an action for passing off in respect of the mark 'Ocuflox' used on the medicinal preparations Page 1669 manufactured and marketed by it claiming prior user of this trademark in respect of eye care products, they sought an injunction against the appellants using 'Ocuflox' in medicinal preparation also for treatment of eye and ear.\n",
        "p_92": "The appellants assailed the grant of injunction on the ground that the respondent's products were not being sold in India and that the appellants were the first who introduced the product in India.\n",
        "p_93": "The court laid down the principles on which judicial scrutiny is required to be conducted in respect of medicinal products and observed thus:\n",
        "p_94": "8. In respect of medicinal products it was held that exacting judicial scrutiny is required if there was a possibility of confusion over marks on medicial products because the potential harm may be far more dire than that in confusion over ordinary consumer products. It was held that even though certain products may not be sold across the counter, nevertheless it was not uncommon that because of lack of competence or otherwise that mistakes arise specially where the trade marks are deceptively similar. It was held that confusion and mistakes could arise even for prescription drugs where the similar goods are marketed under marks which looks alike and sound alike. It was held that physicians are not immune from confusion or mistake. It was held that it was common knowledge that many prescriptions are telephoned to the pharmacists and others are handwritten, and frequently the handwriting is not legible. It was held that these facts enhance the chances of confusion or mistake by the pharmacists in filling the prescription if the marks appear too much alike.\n",
        "p_95": "9. We are in full agreement with what has been laid down by this court. Whilst considering the possibility of likelihood of deception or confusion, in present times and particularly in the field of medicines, the courts must also keep in mind the fact that nowadays the field of medicine is of an international character. The court has to keep in mind the possibility that with the passage of time, some conflict may occur between the use of the mark by the applicant in India and the user by the overseas company. The court must ensure that public interest is in no way imperiled. Doctors particularly eminent doctors, medical practitioners and persons or companies connected with medical field keep abreat of latest developments in medicine and preparations worldwide. Medical literature is freely available in this country. Doctors, medical practitioners and persons connected with the medical field regularly attend medical conferences, symposiums, lectures etc. It must also be remembered that nowadays goods are widely advertised in newspapers, periodicals, magazines and other media which is available in the country. This results in a product acquiring a worldwide reputation.\n",
        "p_96": "10. In the present case, the marks are the same. They are in respect of pharmaceutical products. The mere fact that the Respondents have not been using the mark in India would be irrelevant if they were first in the world market. The Division Bench had relied upon material which prima facie shows that the Respondents product was advertised before the Appellants entered the field. On the basis of that material, the Division Page 1670 Bench has concluded that the Respondents were first to adopt the mark. If that be so then no fault can be found with the conclusion drawn by the Division Bench.\n",
        "p_97": "43. I find that to the same effect are the observations and findings returned by a learned single Judge of the High Court of Judicature at Calcutta in the judgment rendered on 27th of February, 2006 in CS No. 349/1996 entitled Allergan Inc. v. Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.\n",
        "p_98": "44. The Apex court has repeatedly held that so far as medication was concerned, especially where it is extensively advertised, worldwide use would guide adjudication and that the mere fact that the plaintiff was not in the Indian market, in a given case may be irrelevant.\n",
        "p_99": "45. It is necessary to notice that in Milment Optho Industries, the trademark of the respondent was not even registered with the Registrar of Trademarks in India.\n",
        "p_100": "46. Entitlement to injunction relief based on trans-border reputation even without selling the product in India has been the subject matter of several judicial pronouncements today. The judgment in N.R. Dongre v. Whirlpool Corporation reported at  is a landmark decision on several legal issues. In this case the appellants got the mark \"Whirlpool\" registered in respect of washing machines. The Whirlpool Corporation (respondent before the Apex Court) brought a passing off action to restrain the appellants from manufacturing, selling, advertising or in any way using the trade mark \"Whirlpool\" over which they claimed exclusive rights. It was held that an injunction was a relief in equity and was based on equitable principles and that passing off action was maintainable in law even against the registered owner of the trademark. The court observed that the name \"Whirlpool\" was associated for long with the Whirlpool Corporation and that its trans-border reputation extended to India. It was held that the mark \"Whirlpool\" gave an indication of the origin of the goods as emanating from or relating to the Whirlpool Corporation. It was held that equity required that an injunction be granted in favor of the Whirlpool Corporation and that the refusal of an injunction could cause irreparable injury to the reputation of the Whirlpool Corporation, whereas grant of an injunction would cause no significant injury to the appellants who could sell their washing machines merely by removing a small label bearing the name \"Whirlpool\".\n",
        "p_101": "47. The defendants have placed reliance on the judgment reported at  Consolidated Foods Corporation v. Brandon & Co. Pvt. Ltd. to urge that registration of the trademarks by itself without use of the trademark would not establish the case of the plaintiff. This case raised a challenge by the petitioner to the rejection of its opposition to the application submitted by the respondent for registration of its trademark. The observations of the High Court in para 42 of the judgment deserve to be considered in extenso inasmuch as international or worldwide reputation has been accepted as Page 1671 an indicator of reputation and goodwill. Further the court has accepted promotional activity in India also as a concomitant of such reputation without the plaintiff having effected sales of the products in this country. Such advertisements were also accepted to attribute knowledge of the plaintiff's reputation to the defendant and the dishonest intention of the defendant. In this behalf, the court observed thus:\n",
        "p_102": " 42. Lastly, it was urged by Mr. Shah, the learned Counsel for the respondent company, as also by Mr. Sastri learned Counsel appearing for the Registrar of Trade Marks, that I should exercise my discretion under Sub-section (3) of Section 12 of the Act and order concurrent registration of the word 'Monarch' both in favor of the petitioner corporation as well as the respondent company. I am afraid, however, I cannot accept this contention in view of my finding that the respondent company has been guilty of having copied the mark of the petitioner corporation. The discretion under the section referred to by the two counsel can only be exercised where two or more parties unknown to each other innocently adopt and use the same mark in respect of their respective goods of the same nature. In this case, however, as I have found that the petitioner corporation was already the sole proprietor of the mark 'Monarch' in respect of its food products in several countries of the world and its products were widely advertised in various American magazines having a large circulation in different parts of the world including this country and in view of the fact that the petitioner corporation could have without importing any of its food products to this country bearing that mark applied for registration of that mark as proprietor thereof prior to 1951 before the respondent company started using that mark, it is difficult to hold that the respondent company had started using that mark quite innocently and without any knowledge on its part about the same being widely used by the petitioner corporation on its food products. On the facts of this case and also in the interest of business morality, it is impossible to exercise my discretion under Sub-section (3) of Section 12 of the Act and order concurrent registration of the mark 'Monarch' in favor of both the petitioner corporation and the respondent company.\n",
        "p_103": "48. In Consolidated Foods Corporation v. Brandon, the court was concerned with the trans-border reputation of the products and the trademark which were not being used in India especially the international character of medicines and the need to protect them. Taking notice of the extensive advertising by the petitioner, the court held that the adoption of the identical mark by the respondent were held to be deliberate and with the knowledge of the petitioner's mark.\n",
        "p_104": "In these circumstances, the order passed by the Joint Registrar of the Trademark on the respondent's application registering the trademark of the plaintiff in favor of the respondent was set aside.\n",

        "p_107": "49. Mr. N.K. Manchanda, learned Counsel for the defendant has vehemently urged that delay in bringing the suit would itself disentitle the plaintiff to the relief of injunction. In this behalf, reliance has been placed on 2001 PTC 889 Veerumal Praveen Kumar v. Needle Industries (India) Ltd. and Anr. This case is clearly distinguishable on facts of the present case.\n",
        "p_108": "The suit was filed two years after the cause of action stated to have arisen in favor of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_109": "50. In any case in the instant case, the trademark 'Zoloft' is registered with effect from 18th November, 1992 and 'Geodon' is registered from 18th July, 1996. The plaintiff has placed extensive evidence to show international use of the trademark 'Zoloft' since 1991 and of 'Geodon' since 2001. There is no dispute that the defendant's claimed use is much later.\n",
        "p_110": "51. Before this court, the plaintiff has urged that it learnt of the illegal actions of the defendants from the advertisements which were issued in the Trademark Journal. So far as 'Geodon' was concerned, the defendants application was advertised in Trademark Journal of which the plaintiff learnt in 2004 and it immediately filed the notice of objection with the Registrar of Trademark. Its counsel also issued legal notices to the defendant to cease and desist from using the registered trademark 'Geodon' of the plaintiff. So far as 'Zoloft' was concerned, the plaintiff learnt of the same from the publication of the defendants application in Trademark Journal in 2004 and identical steps were taken by the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_111": "The defendants have not claimed to have been a long user of these trademarks. The defendants have also admitted that the plaintiff had registrations in these trademarks and that, long after the filing of the present suit and receipt of summons by the defendants, they have initiated the steps for removal of these trademarks from the Registrar of Trademarks.\n",
        "p_112": "52. In these circumstances, on facts it cannot be held that the suit or the application of the plaintiff would be barred on grounds of unreasonable delay and latches.\n",
        "p_113": "53. In any case, I find that in a judgment of the Apex Court reported at 2004 (28) PTC 121 Midas Hygiene Industries Pvt. Ltd. v. Sudhir Bhatia and Ors. the Apex Court has held that in cases of infringement of trademark or copyright, normally an injunction must follow and that mere delay in bringing the action would not be sufficient to defeat grant of injunction in such cases.\n",
        "p_114": "In this behalf, the Apex Court has held thus:\n",
        "p_115": " 5. The law on the subject is well settled. In cases of infringement either of Trade Mark or of Copyright normally an injunction must follow. Mere delay in bringing action is not sufficient to defeat grant of injunction in such cases. The grant of injunction also becomes necessary if it prima facie appears that the adoption of the mark was itself dishonest.\n",
        "p_116": "54. This issue had also fallen for consideration before this Court in the pronouncement reported at 1989 PTC 61 Hindustan Pencils Pvt. Ltd. v. Page 1673 India Stationery Products Co. and Anr. wherein the court succinctly laid down the principles thus:\n",
        "p_117": "29. It would appear to be difficult to accept that relief of temporary injunction should not be granted, because of the delay on the part of the plaintiff, even though the court feels, at that point of time, that ultimately permanent injunction will have to be granted.\n",
        "p_118": "30. Even though there may be some doubt as to whether laches or acquiescence can deny the relief of a permanent injunction, judicial opinion has been consistent in holding that if the defendant acts fraudulently with the knowledge that he is violating the plaintiff's rights then in that case, even if there is an inordinate delay on the part of the plaintiff in taking action against the defendant, the relief of injunction is not denied. The defense of laches or inordinate delay is a defense in equity. In equity both the parties must come to the Court with clean hands. An equitable defense can be put up by a party who has acted fairly and honestly. A person who is guilty of violating the law or infringing or usurping somebody else's right cannot claim the continued misuse of the usurped right. It was observed by Romer, J. in the matter of an application brought by J.R. Parkington and Co. Ltd. 63 R.P.C. 171 at page 181 that \"in my judgment, the circumstances which attend the adoption of a trade mark in the first instance are of considerable importance when one comes to consider whether the use of that mark has or has not been a honest user. If the user in its inception was tainted it would be difficult in most cases to purify it subsequently\". It was further noted by the learned Judge in that case that he could not regard the equitable relief will be afforded only to that party who is not guilty of a fraud and whose conduct shows that there had been, on his part, an honest concurrent user of the mark in question. If a party, for no apparent or a valid an reason, adopts, with or without modifications, a mark belonging to another, whether registered or not, it will be difficult for that party to avoid an order of injunction because the 'Court may rightly assume that such adoption of the mark by the party was not an honest one. The Court would be justified in concluding that the defendant, in such an action, wanted to cash in on the plaintiff's name and reputation and that was the sole, primary or the real motive of the defendant adopting such a mark. Even if, in such a case, there may be an inordinate delay on the part of the plaintiff in bringing a suit for injunction, the application of the plaintiff for an interim injunction cannot be dismissed on the ground that the defendant has been using the mark for a number of years. Dealing with this aspect Harry D. Nims in his \"The Law of Unfair Competition and Trade-Marks\", Fourth Edition, volume Two at page 1282 noticed as follows:\n",
        "p_119": "Where infringement is deliberate and willful and the defendant acts fraudulently with knowledge that he is violating plaintiff's rights, essential elements of estoppel are lacking and in such a case the protection of plaintiff's rights by injunctive relief never is properly denied. The doctrine of estoppel can only be invoked to promote fair dealings.\n",
        "p_120": "Page 1674\n \n\n",
        "p_121": "31. It would appear to me that where there is an honest concurrent user by the defendant then inordinate delay or laches may defeat the claim of damages or rendition of accounts but the relief of injunction should not be refused. This so because it is the interest of the general public, which is the third party for such cases, which has to be kept in mind. In the case of inordinate delay or laches, as distinguished from the case of an acquiescence, the main prejudice which may be caused to the defendant is that by reasons of the plaintiff not acting at an earlier point of time the defendant has been able to establish his business by using the infringing mark. Inordinate delay or laches may be there because the plaintiff may not be aware of the infringement by the defendant or the plaintiff may consider such infringement by the defendant as not being serious enough to hurt the plaintiff's business. Nevertheless, if the Court comes to the conclusion that prejudice is likely to be caused to the general public who may be mislead into buying the goods manufactured by the defendant thinking them to be the goods of the plaintiff then an injunction must be issued. The Court may, in appropriate cases, allow some time to the defendants to sell off their existing stock but an injunction should not be denied.\n",
        "p_122": "For these reasons, the plaintiff cannot be denied relief on account of culpable delay and laches.\n",
        "p_123": "55. I also find that in the light of the principles laid down by the Apex Court in the afore noticed judgment and the facts of the instant case, the judicial pronouncements reported at AIR 1992 Delhi 302 Gopal Engineering v. POM Laboratories and PTC Supp. 1 page 681 Kerala Jewelleries Madras v. Kerala Jewel Trichy would have no bearing to the instant case. In any case, these judgments were rendered in the facts of the case and had not laid out an absolute principle of law prohibiting grant of an injunction. For the same reason, the pronouncement at 1997 PTC 17 at page 794 would also have no application.\n",
        "p_124": "Therefore in this factual and legal background, it certainly cannot be held that the suit is belated or that the plaintiff cannot be granted interim injunction on any such ground.\n",
        "p_125": "56. The defendant has placed reliance on 1992 PTC 59 Sears Roebuck & Co. v. Happy House (T.V.) Manufacturing Co. Pvt. Ltd. and Ors. In this case, on facts, the plaintiff was unable to establish reputation and goodwill of the trademark or the product and injunction was refused.\n",
        "p_126": "I find that the other pronouncements relied upon by the defendant in 2001 PTC 417 Uniply Industries v. Unicon Plywood and 1987 PTC 240 Usha International v. Usha Television also have no application inasmuch as in those cases, injunctions were not granted on the facts of the case.\n",
        "p_127": "57. I have no manner of doubt that the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case for grant of an ad interim injunction. I find that principles laid down in the judgment reported at Cluett Peabody & Co. Inc. v. Arrow Apparals 1998 PTC (18) relied upon by the defendants themselves render it imperative that the plaintiff is granted interim protection. In this case, the court had Page 1675 succinctly laid down the principles which are required to be noticed under the Trademarks Act, 1999 and culled out thus:\n",
        "p_128": "(i) Trademark is a property. A mark which is used in the course of trade to indicate a connection between the goods and the proprietor of the mark is a trademark. (See Trade Marks by Shavaksha, page 14). It is not a property in pervasive sense. It is property in the sense that proprietor is entitled to exclusive use of it or to prevent others from using it in relation to goods in respect of which it is registered or used. It must be adopted and used to distinguish the goods of the proprietor from goods of others. The mark must be distinctive. It must show the source or the goods to the customer. Words like, 'Best', 'Superior', etc. are not distinctive of the goods. They are only descriptive and hence cannot constitute trademark. The vendor who sells his goods under a trade mark acquires a limited right to the use of the mark.\n",
        "p_129": "(ii) The above mentioned limited exclusive right to the use of the mark is acquired by use. It is recognised as property. A person can also acquire it by registration. (See para 1.01 of Narayanan). The proprietor of the mark gets a perpetual right to the exclusive use of it in respect of particular goods in respect of which it is registered or used (see para 10.2 of Narayanan). Therefore, it can be acquired in three ways viz. Registration, User and Assignment.\n",
        "p_130": "(iii) An application for injunction is an infringement action based on trade marks. It is an application in support of the right to property.\n",
        "p_131": "(iv) An infringement action is based on invasion of the statutory right. The issues which arise in this action are whether the plaintiff is a proprietor of the Trade mark and whether the defendant's mark is identical or similar to trade mark of the plaintiff. In an infringement action the question of deception or confusion will not arise.\n",
        "p_132": "(v) Registration enables the registered proprietor to sue for infringement of registered trade mark irrespective of the fact whether it is used or not used. Registration confers on the proprietor a monopoly right over the use of the mark. But, proprietary rights in a trade mark acquired by use are superior to rights obtained by registration under the Act. This is the main defense put up on behalf of the defendants in this notice of motion. Therefore, prior user of the marks should be protected against monopoly rights conferred by the Act. (Pages 5 & 6 of Narayanan). A trade mark has no meaning even if it is registered unless it is used in relation to goods. Otherwise, its non-use may lead to its death. A trade mark which drops out of the use dies. Where there are no goods offered for sale, there is no use of trade mark.\n",
        "p_133": "(vi) In an infringement action, defendant is restrained from using the infringed mark whereas in passing off defendant is restrained from using the mark in such a way so as to pass off his goods as that of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_134": "(vii) Use of the trademark does not mean user by affixing the word on the goods. It could be in the form of advertisements in magazines, T.V. etc. It would be with regard to goods exported out of India. With advancement of technology and globalization after 1991, use of trade Page 1676 mark can take place in different ways. But, this case essentially concerns the period 1985-1990. Property in trade mark can be acquired by public use of it.\n",
        "p_135": "(viii) The mark can loose its distinctiveness by non-user (para 26 of Narayanana). Therefore, the enforcement of the right of exclusive use of a trade mark will depend on continuous use of the mark by the proprietor. If he fails, piracy will result and the mark will become common to the trade because there is no exclusive ownership of the symbol constituting a trade mark apart from the use of it in respect of vendible goods, particularly in context of principles governing them. Acquisition of proprietary right is different from enforcement of rights/reliefs.\n",
        "p_136": "(ix) Courts shall not protect this right of a proprietor unless there is sale of the articles to which trade mark is attached or related to (para 28 of Narayanan). Without use of the mark, the proprietor cannot restrain others from use of it on similar goods (page 29 of Narayanan).\n",
        "p_137": "(x) An infringement action is a suit on trade mark and not on reputation. The defendant (infringer) who copies the mark cannot plead delay as a defense particularly because the defendant is dishonest as he has copied the mark. But, priority in use cannot be dishonest and, therefore, the defendant who has prima facie evidence of priority in use, could plead delay as a strong defense. This principle is in context of defense to infringement action, particularly in context of this notice of motion.\n",
        "p_138": "(xi) Object of the Act is to protect the right and not to be a source of monopoly. It is also to protect bona fide interests of traders from harassment by registered owners of a trade mark, apart from protection of public fraud, fraud by infringers of genuine trademark.\n",
        "p_139": "(xii) The test as to 'who gets it there first' is not applicable in cases where registration is sought under Section 18 (page 26 of Narayanan).\n",
        "p_140": "After laying down these principles, the court had denied injunction to the plaintiff in this case only for the reason that the defendant had made out a prima facie case for using the trademark since 1985 to the knowledge of the world at large and without any objection from the plaintiff till 1994 when the suit was filed.\n",
        "p_141": "58. In the instant case, the defendants have failed to make out any such case. Learned Counsel for the plaintiff has urged at great length that the defendant has placed no evidence of sales of the products. As noticed above, the Apex Court has held that trade mark infringements so far as medical products are concerned have to be treated strictly. The medicines of the plaintiff's are used towards treatment of serious diseases and any confusion in the minds of the medical experts, pharmacists and the patients may lead to disastrous results. In my view, balance of convenience, interest of justice and equity are clearly in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants. The applicable principles of law are clear and unambiguous and lead up to only one inevitable consequence. In my view therefore this application deserves to be granted for all these reasons.\n",
        "p_142": "59. In a judgment dated 27th April, 1994 rendered by the Bombay High Court in Misc. Petition No. 3/1992 entitled Marion Merrell Dow. Inc. v. Unichem Page 1677 Laboratories Ltd. and Ors., the court held that the medical field has assumed an international character which is a fact of which judicial notice must be taken. The observations of the court in this regard are not only instructive but extremely topical for the purpose of the decision in the facts of the instant case. The court laid down the applicable principles as follows:\n",
        "p_143": " 33. I am unable to accept the submissions of Mr. Tulzapurkar. All the authorition relied by Mr. Tulzapurkar very significantly do not deal with the medical field. An already stated above and as set out in the various authorities relied upon by Mr. Chitnie, the medical field has assumed an international character. It is a fact of which judicial notice must be taken. Doctors particularly ominent Doctors, medical practitioners and persons of companies connected with the medical field keep abreast of latest developments in medicine and preparations worldwide. Medical literature is freely available in this country. Doctors, medical practitioners and persons connected with medical field regularly attend medical conference, symposium, lectures etc. Also set out hereinabove what is involved in public interest. It would be annomious situation if an identical mark in respect of an identical drug is associated all over the world with the petitioner but that mark remains of the registered ownership of the 1st Respondents in India. Such a situation would cause immence confusion and deception in the minds of the public. Also as stated above, the authority of the Supreme Court in the case of national Swening Thread Co. Ltd. is binding on this Court and prevals over all contrary authoritation of Foreign Courts.\n",
        "p_144": "60. The defendants had not proved any research or development and the court consequently held that the defendant had not developed the product but merely copied it. In this background, the court observed that the defendant had come to know of the product from international magazines, seminars. If the drug is copied, it follows that the mark is also copied. In this behalf, the observations of the court deserve to be considered in extenso and read thus:\n",
        "p_145": "11. The 1st respondents had filed a counter statement. It is an admitted position that in the counter statement they have not explained as to how they came upon the word \"CARAFATE\". In this Court also no affidavit in reply is filed. Thus, on record admittedly there is no explanation or submitted before this Court to show how the 1st respondents came upont he word \"CARAFATE\". Int his behalf it is relevant to note that the 1st respondents company is a company dealing in manufacture of medicines and pharmaceutical products. In my view, it is well known and well established that, in the field of medicine, doctors and persons connected with the field, keep themselves well abreast of developments which take place abroad. In my view, it is very relevant that the petitioners have applied for registration of this same mark for use in treatment of duodenal user. It is also not denred that the composition of the petitioners product is identical to the product of the 1st respondents, i.e. both are complex salt of polyaluminium hydroxide with a sulphated disaoharide akeleton. It is well known that before a medicinal product can be put into the market there would have to be research and Page 1678 development. This may some time take years. Very significantly, 1st respondents have not relied upon or shown that any research or development was carried out by them before they sought to register the mark.\n",
        "p_146": "12. Mr. Tulzapurkar submitted that the 1st respondent invented the word \"CARAFATE\" from sacraflfate. He submitted that the letters \"SU\" from the beginning of the word that the letter from the middle of the word were omitted. He submitted that the letter \"A\" was added between the letters \"c\" and \"r\". This ingenuines explanation given by the Counsel is made for the first time across the Bar. It is no where to be found in the proceedings before the Trade Mark Registry or in any affidavit before this court. It is undoubtedly an invention of the counsel, Such an oral submission made by the counsel cannot be accepted. In this behalf, it is pertinent to note that as shown by international Bibliography voluminous literature on sucrafate has been existing for a number of years. Not only that but in 1982 there was an international sucrafate symposium in the 7th world congress of Gastroenterology at Stockholm. Prior to that in June 1980 there was the 11th International Congress of Gantroonterology at Hardburg wherein the effect of Sucralfate on ulcer has been discussed. Not only that in October 1981 there is an article on Petitioners' product 'CARAFATE' as it being an anti-ulcer drug. The 1st respondents are a medicinal company. It is impossible to believe that they were not aware of these developments in the use of Sucralfate as an anti-ulcer drug and the invention of drug \"CARAFATE\" by the petitioners as an anti-ulcer drug. In my view, it is too much of a coincidence that the exact mark and the same preparation for treatment of deodenal ulcers has been suddenly thought of by the 1st respondent. As stated above a drug or a medicine is not something which can just be thought of. It needs years research and development. It is very clear that the 1st respondents have done no research and/or development in respect of this drug. It has not even been claimed, before the Trade Mark Registry as well as before this Court that any research was done. No proof of any research or development has been produced. It would therefore be clear that the 1st respondents have not developed this drug but merely copied it. They could only have learnt about it from international magazines or seminars. If the drug is copied, it follows that this mark is also copied. In the international market only the petitioners own the mark \"CARAFATE\" for an anti-ulcer drug. It is thus clear that it is the petitioners' mark and product which has been copied by the 1st respondents.\n",
        "p_147": "Thus it was held that judicial notice has to be taken of the fact that doctors and nurses connected with the case keep themselves abreast and updated on the developments in the pharmaceutical fields.\n",
        "p_148": "61. Before this Court also I find that the defendant has not placed any evidence or material of having developed these products. The defendants' \"Zoloft\" is identical with the product of the plaintiff. Even the trademarks are identical. The defendant gives no explanation as to why it has adopted the registered trademarks of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_149": "Page 1679\n \n\n",
        "p_150": "62. The defendants have filed documents of sales being conducted by it only in the year 2003. There is therefore admittedly no prior use of the trademark by the defendants conferring any rights in the defendant which could be urged to be superior than those of the plaintiff in its registered trademark. Other than the bald claim by the defendants in their application for registration of trademark that they commenced production in 2003, there is hardly any material on record to substantiate or support this assertion. There is therefore nothing on record to establish any promotional activity undertaken by the defendants nor any substantial evidence of any sales effected in the trademark ZOLOFT and GEODON.\n",
        "p_151": "So far as Zoloft is concerned, the trademark and the product of the defendant is identical to that of the plaintiff and the same class of consumers is being targeted. The mark Geodon of the defendant is also identical to that of the plaintiff's Geodon. Inasmuch as the plaintiff is extensively publicizing its products which is also feating in medical journals of repute, the plaintiff has made out a good prima facie case. So far as balance of convenience is concerned, the defendant has adopted the registered trademark which is identical to that of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_152": "63. I also find that Section 34 of the Trademarks Act requires that in order to successfully assert a right against the registered proprietor of a trademark, the defendant has to establish use of the trademark which is prior to the date of registration of the plaintiff's trademark. In this case, the plaintiff's registrations for Zoloft though granted in the year 2005 related back to 18th of November, 1992 while for the trademark Geodon, the registration granted in later related back to 18th of July, 1996.\n",
        "p_153": "The defendant has filed documents of sales being conducted by it only in the year 2003. There is therefore admittedly no prior user giving the defendant any right which could be urged to be superior to the rights of the plaintiff in the registered trademark.\n",
        "p_154": "64. Undoubtedly in the present case, though the suit is prior to the registration of the trademarks, however the registration which relates to the year 1992 & 1996. The application for injunction cannot be defeated only on the ground that the defendants have sought rectification. The defendant could not have filed the applications for rectification of the register of trademarks under Section 124 of the Act of 1999 without showing and obtaining prior satisfaction of the court about the plea of invalidty registration of the mark of the defendant.\n",
        "p_155": "65. From the foregoing, it is evident that the suit filed by the plaintiff is prior and that the applications for cancellation have been filed only after the defendants had entered appearance in the matter. The registrations of the plaintiff relate to the year 1992-96 and would have been registered after advertisements in the Trade Marks Journal. In any case, the defendant is admittedly manufacturing and trading in pharmaceuticals and consequently would be aware of the products of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_156": "66. The application for injunction cannot be defeated only for the reason that the defendant has filed the application for cancellation of the registered trademark. In the light of the judicial pronouncements noticed above, the Page 1680 defendant was required to satisfy this Court with regard to existing for prima facie in its favor case justifying the application for cancellation and invalidity of the registration of the trademark of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_157": "In this background, the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case for infringement of its registered trademark as well as dishonest passing off their products as those associated with the plaintiff entitling the plaintiff to grant of ad-interim injunction. Grave and irreparable loss shall ensure to the plaintiff in case interim protection is not granted. The injunction is also necessitated in the larger interests of the consumers of the products of the plaintiff, inasmuch as disasterous and irreversible consequences can result from an error made in purchase of the products of the defendants as if they were the drugs produced and manufactured by the plaintiffs. Balance of convenience, interest of justice and equity are clearly in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants.\n",
        "p_158": "Accordingly, this application is allowed.\n",

No. 8252/2006 filed by the defendant seeking stay of the suit on the ground that it had initiated proceedings for cancellation of the plaintiff's registration.

This Court has issued summons in the suit and notice in the application and the defendants were duly served in the plaint. The defendants first entered appearance on 3rd May, 2005. The application seeking cancellation of the registered trademarks 'Zoloft' and 'Geodon' of the plaintiff were filed by the defendant on 9th November, 2005.\n",
        "p_177": "70. A similar issue arose before this Court and by a judicial pronouncement reported at 2006 32 PTC 733 Astrazeneca UK Ltd. and Anr. v. Orchid C & P Ltd. The court considered this issue and held thus:\n",
        "p_178": "31. On plain reading of this provision, it is apparent that the plaintiffs could not file the application for rectification without showing and obtaining prima facie satisfaction of the Court about their plea of the invalidity of the registration of the mark of the Defendant. Section 124 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 is similar to the Section 111 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. Under the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 in , Kedar Nath v. Monga Perfumary & Floor Mills, this Court had held that an application could not be filed subsequent to the institution of the suit under Section 111(1)(i) of the earlier Act. The learned Single Judge had held as under:\n",
        "p_179": "19. ...The defendant cannot file an application subsequent to the institution of the suit under Section 111(1)(i) and claim that the plaintiff suit for infringement must be stayed. If no proceeding for rectification of the register is pending on the date of the institution of the suit by the plaintiff then Section 111(1)(ii) is attracted and the Court may adjourn the case for a period of three months in order to enable the defendant to apply to the High Court for rectification of the register. In that case the Court must be satisfied that the contention as to validity of the defendant's registration is bona fide and prima facie sustainable. In the present case I am not satisfied that the contention as to validity and raised by the defendant is bona fide and prima facie sustainable. No material has been placed on the record to prove a prima facie case that the plaintiff's registration is invalid or that the defendant has been carrying on business since 1952 as alleged by him.\n",
        "p_180": "Reliance can also be placed on Patel Field Marshal Agencies v. P.M. Diesels Ltd. 1999 IPLR 142 : 1999 PTC (19) 718 (Guj) (DB) where it was held that if the proceedings are not pending and the plea regarding invalidity of registration of the mark is raised, the Court trying the suit is to be prima facie satisfied about tenability of the issue. The Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court had held:\n",
        "p_181": " 10. ... As we notice, under Section 107, it has been provided that on such plea being raised, the plea can be decided only in an appropriate rectification proceedings. In conformity with that provision, Section 111 envisages that if proceeding for rectification Page 1683 of the register in relation to plaintiff or defendant's trademark, as the case maybe, are pending before the registrar or the High Court, further proceedings in the suit shall be stayed, until final disposal of rectification proceedings. If proceeding are not pending, and the plea regarding invalidity of registration of concerned mark is raised, the Court trying the suit is to be prima facie satisfied about tenability of the issue, and if it is so satisfied, it shall frame as issue to that effect and adjourn the case for three months, from the date of framing of the issue, in order to enable the party concerned to apply to the High Court for rectification of register. The consequences of the raising of issue are two fold. In case, the party concerned, makes an application for rectification within the time allowed, under Sub-clause (ii) of Sub-clause (b) of such Section (1), whether originally specified or extended later on, the civil Court trying the suit has to stay the further proceedings of the suit until disposal of the rectification proceeding. At the same time, if no such application is made within the time allowed, the party, has raised the plea of invalidity of the opponent's registered mark, is deemed to have abandoned the issue. This provision permitting raising of an issue only on prima facie satisfaction of the Court, with further requirement that the party, at whose instance an issue has been framed, is to apply for rectification before the High Court concerned, and failure to make such application within the time allowed results in deemed abandonment of plea, leads us to conclude that once a suit has been filed, the rectification proceedings at the instance of either party to the suit against the other, must take the course and envisaged under Section 111, that is to say, if proceedings for rectification are already pending before raising the plea of an invalidity, that is to say, the attention of an appropriate Forum having already been invited to that issue, those proceedings must first be continued, decision thereon to be obtained and then civil suit for infringement can proceed in the light of that decision. In case, no such proceedings for rectification are pending at the time of raising the plea of invalidity, the prosecution of such plea by the reason raising it depends on prima facie satisfaction of the Court, about the tenability of this plea. If the plea has been found to be prima facie tenable and an issue is raised to that effect then the matter is to be adjourned for three months at least to enable the person raising such plea to approach the High Court concerned, with a rectification application. In case, the rectification proceedings are not already pending, and the Court is not even prima facie satisfied about the tenability of the plea raised before it, the matter rests there.\n",
        "p_182": "71. Learned Counsel for the defendant has placed reliance on the pronouncement reported at 1981 PTC 14 Karam Singh Trading as Mankoo Engineering Works v. Master Machine & Service and Ors.\n",
        "p_183": "72. I find that in this case, it was held that even while directing that stay of the suit would require to be ordered for the reason that the defendant had Page 1684 filed an application for cancellation of the plaintiff's trademark, the court was amply empowered to pass interlocutory orders including injunction. The defendant have also placed reliance on Sarwan Singh and Ors. v. Rico Ind. and Ors. 1981 PTC 14. Even in this case the court stated that under Section 111(5) of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 (now Section 124(5) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999), the court has power to grant interlocutory orders including injunctions.\n",
        "p_184": "73. A bare perusal of the statute shows that it is only if there are pending proceedings for rectification of the register in relation to the plaintiffs or defendants trademark at the time of filing of the suit that the court is required to stay the suit pending final disposal of such proceedings. However, if no such proceedings are pending, the satisfaction of the court that the plea regarding the invalidity of the registrations of the plaintiffs or the defendant's trade mark is prima facie tenable, is a sine qua non under Section 124(1)(b)(ii). Upon such a prima facie view, the law requires the court to raise an issue regarding the same and adjourn the case for a period of three months from the date of framing of issue in order to enable the party concerned to apply to the appellate board for rectification of the register.\n",
        "p_185": "74. So far as this application is concerned, the defendant contends that it has filed objections and applications seeking cancellation of the registered trademark of the plaintiff which proceedings are admittedly pending. The prayer of the defendant is that for this reason, the present suit is liable to stayed.\n",

It is noteworthy that the present suit was filed by the plaintiff on or about 7th March, 2005, this Court had issued summons in the suit and notice in the application by orders passed on 10th March, 2005 and the defendant was duly served with the same. The defendant first entered appearance in the case on 3rd May, 2005. The application seeking cancellation of the registered trademark GEODON and ZOLOFT of the plaintiff was filed by the defendant on 29th November, 2005. There is no dispute that the defendants have not sought leave of this Court before filing the petition before the Registrar of Trademarks.\n",
        "p_187": "76. Furthermore, in the instant case, I have prima facie found against the defendant on the pleas raised by it and consequently there would be no requirement of taking recourse to the procedure stipulated under Section 124(1)(b)(ii). A contention has been raised that the rectification proceedings are pending. The validity of the same would, needless to say, be an issue raised by the present plaintiff before the Registrar of Trade Marks in view of the mandate of Section 124(1)(b)(ii) of the Trademarks Act and does not need to be commented upon herein. The defendant before this Court has not satisfied the requirement of law.\n",

Plaintiff has also established that the\n       plaintiff has created various stylized and device formats of the said\n       trade mark over a period of time and hence the plaintiff owns the\n       copyright therein by virtue of them being original artworks. Plaintiff\n       is an international company that deals in ready-to-assemble furniture,\n       home accessories etc. Plaintiff has also established that the trade\n       mark \"IKEA\" was coined by the plaintiff as far back as in the year\n       1943, which is evident from the timeline displayed by the plaintiff on\n       its website.

Having regard to the evidence on record and comparing the\n       impugned trademark of the defendant with that of the plaintiff, I am\n       of the view that the impugned trade mark of the defendant \"IKEA\" is\n       identical to that of the plaintiff in each and every respect including\n       phonetically, structurally, in its basic idea and in its essential features.\n       Furthermore, the defendant is engaged in the same trade/line of\n       business as the plaintiff namely manufacture of furniture etc. It has\n       been established by the plaintiff beyond reasonable doubt that the\n       said distinctive trade mark \"IKEA\" has come to be associated with\n       the plaintiff and plaintiff's goods for a long time now and the\n       purchasing public and the industry at large distinguishes and\n       identifies the goods under the said trade mark as originating from the\n       plaintiff. In light of the above, in my view, adoption of an identical\n       mark by the defendant, that too in the same line of business, is\n       malafide and illegal as it is bound to cause confusion and deception\n       in the minds of public at large with respect to the source of the goods\n       originating from the defendants and many existing/prospective\n       consumers may assume a commercial link/nexus between the\n       plaintiff and the defendant and otherwise also adoption of the\n       impugned mark by the defendant will lead to dilution of the trade\n       mark of the plaintiff if the quality of products originating from the\n       defendant is inferior to that of the plaintiff. Furthermore, by\n       projecting such a commercial connection or relationship with the\n       plaintiff, the defendants would be encashing on the hard earned\n       goodwill and reputation established by the plaintiff over the period of\n       years and passing off their goods as those of the plaintiff.\n",

Order sheets show that despite service of summons, the defendant has\n       deliberately stayed away from the present proceedings to ensure that\n       an enquiry into their accounts for determination of damages cannot\n       take place. In the case of Tata Sons Ltd. v Hoop Anin & Ors.\n       reported at 188(2012)DLT327 punitive damages to the tune of 5 lacs\n       were awarded to the plaintiff. Relevant paras of the judgment are\n       reproduced below:\n",

Another purpose behind awarding punitive damages is to deter those\n       who may be waiting in the wings and may be tempted to imitate the\n       trade mark of others, in case those who are sued before the Courts are\n       not made to pay such damages as would really pinch them. Awarding\n       token damages may, therefore, not serve the desired purpose. Our\n       country is now almost in the league of advanced countries. More and\n       more foreign companies are entering our markets, with latest\n       products. They would be discouraged to enter our country to\n       introduce newer products and make substantial investments here, if\n       the Courts do not grant adequate protection to their intellectual\n       property rights such as patents, trademarks and copyright. Most of\n       the products sold by these companies are branded products, the marks\n       on them having trans-border reputation and enjoying tremendous\n       brand equity. It is, therefore, becoming increasingly necessary to curb\n       such trade mark piracies lest they drive away the huge foreign\n       investment our country is attracting. The Court should not give\n       premium to dishonesty and unfair practices by those who have no\n       compunctions in blatantly using the trademark of others for making\n       unearned profits.\n",

R.C. Chopra, J. has very\n       succinctly set out in Time Incorporated v. Lokesh Srivastava and\n       Anr. reported at 2005 (30) PTC 3 (Del) that punitive damages are\n       founded on the philosophy of corrective justice. A party who chooses\n       not to participate in court proceedings and stays away must, thus,\n       suffer the consequences of damages as stated and set out by the\n       plaintiff. There is a larger public purpose involved to discourage such\n       parties from indulging in such acts of deception and, thus, even if the\n       same has a punitive element, it must be granted.\n",

        "p_2": "1. The present suit has been instituted by the plaintiff against the defendants seeking for a decree of permanent injunction restraining the defendants, their partners, servants and agents from operating any business and/or selling, offering for sale, advertising and in any manner dealing in any services or goods on the Internet or otherwise under the trademark/domain name 'Yahooindia.Com' or any other mark/domain name which is identical with or deceptively similar to the plaintiff's trademark 'Yahoo!' and also for rendition of accounts and damages. The plaintiff has also filed an application under Order 39 Rules 1 & 2 CPC praying for an ad interim temporary injunction restraining the defendants from operating any business and/or selling, offering for sale, advertising and in any manner dealing in any services or goods on the Internet or otherwise under the trademark/domain name 'Yahooindia.Com' or any other mark/domain name which is identical with or deceptively similar to the plaintiff's trademark 'Yahoo!'. \n",
        "p_3": "2. Mr. Kapil Sibbal, counsel appearing for the plaintiff submitted that the plaintiff is the owner of the trademark 'Yahoo!' and domain name 'Yahoo.Com', which are very well-known and have acquired distinctive reputation and goodwill and the defendants by adopting the name 'Yahooindia' for similar services have been passing off the services and goods of the defendants as that of the plaintiff's trademark 'Yahoo!' which is identical to or deceptively similar to the plaintiff's trademark. It was submitted that a domain name/trademark adopted by the plaintiff is entitled to equal protection against passing off as in the case of a trademark. In support of his submission, the learned counsel heavily relied upon the ratio of the decisions in Marks & Spencer Vs. One-in-a-Million; reported in 1998 FSR 265. It was submitted that the trademarks and domain names are not mutually exclusive and there is an overlap between the trademarks and services rendered under domain names and thus by dopting a deceptively similar trademark 'Yahooindia', the defendants have verbatim copied the format, contents, lay out, colour scheme, source code of the plaintiff's prior created regional section on India at Yahoo.com.sg and thus passing off the services of the defendants as that of the plaintiff. He submitted that Internet users are familiar with the practice of companies to select domain names that incorporate their company name, well-known trademark, and/or product/service name and generally attempt to locate a particular company's Web site by simply typing in www.(company name).com or www.(product name).com when they are unsure of the Internet address of the Company. According to him, thus, it would not be unusual for someone looking for an authorised 'Yahoo!' site with India-specific content to type in 'Yahooindia.com',i.e., the defendants' domain name and thereby instead of reaching the Internet site of the plaintiff, the said person would reach the Internet site of the fendants'. He further submitted that the plaintiff in fact provides extensive content on India, both on its Yahoo! Asia site and at its main Yahoo.com site, under the categories \"Regional:Countries:India\". It was submitted that the defendants being in the same line of activity as that of the plaintiff, the defendants have tried to be 'cyber-squatters' and, thus, dishonesty is writ large as the defendants have adopted a rademark similar to that of the plaintiff which is 'Yahoo.com' which has acquired a distinctive name, goodwill and reputation. \n",
        "p_4": "3. Mr. Harish Malhotra, counsel appearing for the defendants, however, refuted the aforesaid allegations and submitted that the trademark laws in India relate to goods and, therefore, the provisions of Indian Trade Marks Act are not applicable to the facts and circumstances of the present case which deals only with goods. It was also submitted that the trademark/domain name 'Yahoo!' of the plaintiff is not registered in India and, therefore, there cannot be an action for infringement of the registered mark nor could there be any action of passing off as the services rendered both by the plaintiff and the defendants cannot be said to be goods within the meaning of the Indian Trade Marks Act which is concerned only with goods and not services and thus the decisions relied upon by the counsel appearing for the plaintiff are not relevant for the purpose of deciding the present case. He further submitted that the word \"Yahoo!\" is a general dictionary word and is not vented and, therefore, it could not have acquired any distinctiveness and since the defendants have been using disclaimer, there could be no chance of any deception and thus, no action of passing of is maintainable against the defendants. He also submitted that the persons using Internet and seeking to reach the Internet site are all technically educated and literate persons and, therefore, there is no possibility of any customer reaching the Internet site of the defendants with the intention of reaching the Internet site of the plaintiff and thus, it is not a case of unwary customer which is applicable in a case of infringement and passing off of the trademark. In the light of the aforesaid submissions, let me now consider as to whether the plaintiff has been able to make out a prima facie case for grant of temporary injunction as sought for in the application. \n",
        "p_5": "4. The domain name 'Yahoo.com' is registered in the plaintiff's favour with Network Solution Inc since 18th January, 1995. The trademark 'Yahoo!' and its variance are registered or pending registration in 69 countries of the world. As is disclosed from the records, an application for registration of the trademark of the plaintiff 'Yahoo!' is also pending in India. The plaintiff is a global Internet media rendering services under the domain name/trade name 'Yahoo!'. The Internet is a global collection of computer networks linking millions of public and private computers around the world. The Internet is now recognised as an international system, a communication medium that allows anyone from any part of the lobe with access to the Internet to freely exchange information and share data. The Internet provides information about various corporations, products as also on various subjects like educational, entertainment, commercial, government activities and services. A computer or evice that is attached to the Internet has an address which is known as Domain name. The same is established by using suffix 'com' and registering with Network Solutions Inc. A domain name identifies a computer or a Sub Network of computers in the Internet. One way oestablish a presence on the Internet is by placing a web page. The plaintiff, it is stated, was amongst the first in the field to have a domain name 'Yahoo' and also to start a Web directory and provide search services. In June, 1994, the said directory was named 'Yahoo!' which is a dictionary connotation which was adopted by the plaintiff and is providing the said service at the Internet under the domain name/trade name 'Yahoo!'. \n",
        "p_6": "5. The plaintiff is admittedly providing various services including services on the regional section also. In view of growing popularity of 'Yahoo!' of the plaintiff, it was submitted that many third parties started imitations by using sound-alike names in order to ppropriate the reputation and goodwill acquired by the plaintiff in respect of he trademark/name 'Yahoo!' in India and that the defendants is one of such parties who in order to appropriate the reputation and goodwill acquired by the plaintiff in respect of the said rademark 'Yahoo!' adopted the trademark/domain name 'Yahooindia.com' for their Internet site although their trading name is Net link Internet Solutions. \n",
        "p_7": "6. Let me, therefore, examine the rival contentions and defense raised by the defendants ne by one. \n",
        "p_8": "7. One of the submissions was that the domain name 'Yahoo!' of the plaintiff is not used n relations to goods, but, in relations to services and since services are not included within the ambit of section under Sections 27(2) and 29 of the Trade Mark Merchandise Act (referred to as the 'Act' in short) and, therefore, the plaintiff cannot plead for action of passing off in relation to such services. In support of his submission, the learned counsel drew my attention to the provisions of Section 2(5), Sections 27, 29 and Section 30 of the Act and contended that only goods are recognised for the purpose of preferring an action for infringement or passing off. Admittedly the present case is not for an action for infringement of a registered trademark, but, an action for passing off. The law relating to passing off is fairly well-settled. The principle underlying the action is that no man is entitled to carry on his business in such a way as to lead to the belief that he is carrying on the business of another man or to lead to believe that he is carrying on or has any connection with the business carried on by another man. It is also well-established that passing off action is a common law remedy. There are a plethora of cases wherein it has been held that the principles of common law govern actions of passing off and have been recognised by Section 27(2) and Section 106 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. In this commentary, reference may be made to the well-known reatise on the law of Trademarks and passing off, of P. Narayanan. In paragraph 25.102 of the fourth edition of the said treatise, it is stated thus:- \n",
        "p_9": "  \"The general principles of the law applicable to cases where a person uses a name or intends to use a name which is likely to deceive and divert the business of the laintiff to the defendant or cause confusion between the two businesses are analogous to he principles which are applicable to ordinary cases of passing off relating to sale of goods.\"\n",
        "p_10": "8. Reference may be made to the decision of this Court in Monetary Over seas Vs. Montari Industries Ltd.; reported in 1996 PTC 142, wherein it was found that the defendant adopted a trade name that was identical to that of the plaintiff and the court while injuncting the defendant held thus:- \n",
        "p_11": "\"When a defendant does business under a name which is sufficiently close to the name under which the plaintiff is trading and that name has acquired a reputation and the public at large is likely to be misled that the defendant's business is the business of the plaintiff, or is a branch or department of the plaintiff, the defendant is liable for an action in passing off.\" \n",
        "p_12": " Similarly, there are other cases wherein the services rendered by a person have been included within the scope of passing off. In this connection, reference may be made to the decisions in Neev Investments & Trading Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Sasia Express Couriers; reported in 1993 PTC 184. In Ellora Industries Vs. Banarsi Dass & Ors.; reported in 1981 PTC 46, it was held that the plaintiffs and the defendants are direct competitors and 'Ellora' as a business name suggests association with the plaintiffs' registered trade mark and, it is suggestive of the fact that the goods come from the same source and, therefore, is a misrepresentation for business purposes as to the origin of goods which the defendants manufacture in the course of their business. In paragraph 12 of the said judgment, it was held thus: \n",
        "p_13": " PASSING OFF: \n",
        "p_14": " \"12. The purpose of this tort is to protect commercial goodwill to ensure that peoples' business reputations are not exploited. Since business \"goodwill is an asset, and therefore species of property the law protects it against encroachment as such. The tort is based on economic policy, the need to encourage enterprise and to ensure commercial stability. It secures a reasonable area of monopoly to traders. It is thus complementary to trade mark law which is founded upon statute rather than common law. But there is a difference between statute law relating to trade marks and the passing off action; for, while registration of relevant mark itself gives title to the registered owner, the onus in a passing off action lies upon the plaintiff to establish the existence of the business reputation which he seeks to protect. The asset protected is the reputation the plaintiffs' business has in the relevant mark. This is a complex thing. It is manifested in the various indicia which lead the client or customer to associate the business with the plaintiff; such as the name of the business, whether real or adopted, the mark, design, make up or colour of the plaintiffs goods, the distinctive characteristics of services he supplies or the nature of his special processes. And it is around encroachments upon such indica that passing off actions arise. What is protected is an economic asset:\" (emphasis is mine) \n \n\n",
        "p_15": "9. Lord Halsbury defined the tort of passing off in Reddaway Vs. Banham; reported in 1696 A.C. 199. In paragraph 31 of the aforesaid decision of this Court in Ellora Industries (supra) it was said that it is not always necessary that there must be in existence goods of that other man with which the defendant seeks to confuse his own. Reference was also made to the observation of Lord Greene M.R., who observed that:- \n",
        "p_16": "  \"Passing off may occur in cases where the plaintiffs do not in fact deal with the offending goods\". \n",
        "p_17": "10. Therefore, it is obvious that where the parties are engaged in common or overlapping fields of activity, the competition would take place. If the two contesting parties are involved in the same line or similar line of business, there is grave and immense possibility for confusion and deception and, therefore, there is probability of sufferance of damage. In this case also both the plaintiff and the defendants have common field of activty. They are operating on the Web site and providing information almost similar in nature. In Card service International Inc. Vs. McGee; reported in 42 USPQ 2d 1850, it was held that the domain name serve same function as the trademark and is not a mere address or like finding number on the Internet and, therefore, it is entitled to equal protection as trademark. It was further held that a domain name is more than a mere Internet address for it also identifies the Internet site to those who reach it, much like a person's name identifies a particular person or more relevant to trade mark disputes, a company's name identifies a specific company. Accordingly, the Court granted the injunction upon consideration fo the relevant law namely, Section 32 of the Lanham Act. In the facts of the said case it was held that Cardservice International's customers who wish to take advantage of its Internet services, but do not know its domain name are likely to assume that \"cardservice.com\" belongs to ardservice International. It goes on to hold that these customers would instead reach McGee and see a home page for \"Card Service\" and thereby many would assume that they have reached Cardservice International. \n",
        "p_18": "11. In Marks & Spencer Vs. One-in-a-Million; reported in 1998 FSR 265, it was held that any person who deliberately registers a domain name on account of its similarity to the name, brand name or trademark of an unconnected commercial organisation must expect to find himself on the receiving end of an injunction to restrain the threat of passing off, and the njunction will be in terms which will make the name commercially useless to the dealer. It was held in the said decision that the name 'marksandspencer' could not have been chosen for any other reason than that it was associated with the well-known retailing group. The decision further goes on to say that where the value of a name consists solely in its resemblance to the name or trade mark of another enterprise, the Court will normally assume that the public is likely to be deceived, for why else would the defendants choose it? It was also said that someone seeking or coming upon a website called http:// marksandspencer.co.uk would naturally assume that it was that of the plaintiffs. Thus, it is seen that although the word 'services' may not find place in the expression used in Sections 27 and 29 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, services rendered have come to be recognised for an action of passing off. Thus law of passing off is an action under the common law which also is given a statutory recognition in the Trade Mark Act. Thus in the context and light of the aforesaid decisions and the development in the concept of law of passing off, it is too late in the day to submit that passing off action cannot be maintained as against services as it could be maintained for goods. \n",
        "p_19": "12. The services of the plaintiff under the trademark/domain name 'Yahoo!' have been widely publicised and written about globally. In an Internet service, a particular Internet site could be reached by anyone anywhere in the world who proposes to visit the said Internet site. With the advancement and progress in technology, services rendered in the Internet has also come to be recognised and accepted and are being given protection so as to protect such provider of service from passing off the services rendered by others as that of the laintiff. As a matter of fact in a matter where services rendered through the domain name in the Internet, a very alert vigil is necessary and a strict view is to be taken for its easy access and reach by anyone from any corner of the globe. There can be no two opinions that the two marks/domain names 'Yahoo!' of the plaintiff and 'Yahooindia' of the defendant are almost similar except for use of the suffix 'India' in the latter. The degree of the similarity of the marks usually is vitally important and significant in an action for passing off for in such a case there is every possibility and likelihood of confusion and deception being caused. When both the domain names are considered, it is crystal clear that the two names being almost identical or similar in nature, there is every possibility of an Internet user being confused and deceived in believing that both the domain names belong to one common source and connection, although the two belong to two different concerns. \n",
        "p_20": "13. Counsel for the defendant also argued that the Internet users are sophisticated users and only literate people who are able to ascertain can approach the actual Internet site that they intend to visit. The said submission does not appear to have force for even if an individual is a sophisticated user of the Internet, he may be an unsophisticated consumer of information and such a person may find his/her way to the defendant Internet site which provides almost similar type of information as that of the plaintiff and thereby confusion could be created in the mind of the said person who intends to visit the Internet site of the plaintiff, but, in fact reaches the Internet site of the defendant. \n",
        "p_21": "14. It is also submitted that the defendant has been issuing a disclaimer. The said disclaimer being used by the defendants cannot eliminate the problem , for it was observed in the case of Jews for Jesus Vs. Brodsky; reported in 46 USPQ 2d 1652 that due to the nature of Internet use, defendant's appropriation of plaintiff's mark as a domain name and home page address cannot adequately be remedied by a disclaimer. It was also observed that considering the vastness of the Internet and its relatively recent availability to the general public, many Internet users are not sophisticated enough to distinguish between the subtle difference in the domain names of the parties. The ratio and principle laid down in the aforesaid decision equally apply to the facts of the present case with full force. \n",
        "p_22": "15. Counsel for the defendants also submitted that there is sufficient added matter, namely, addition of the word 'India\" to distinguish its domain name from that of the plaintiff and in support of his submission, the learned counsel relied upon the decision in Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma Vs. Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories; . In Ruston and Hornby Ltd. Vs. Zamindara Engineering Co.; reported in 1970 S.C.1649, it was held that if there be close resemblance between the two marks and they are deceptively similar to each other, the word 'India' added to one mark is of no consequence. In that case the two marks were 'Ruston' and 'Ruston India'. Besides the plaintiff itself is using regional names after Yahoo! like Yahoo.CA (for Canada) and Yahoo.FR (for France). Thus, there is every possibility of the Internet users to believe that Yahoo india is another one in the series of Yahoo marks/names and thereby there is every possibility of confusion being created and thereby preventing these users from reaching the Internet site of the plaintiff. The decision in Vishnu das Trading Vs. Vizier Sultan; reported in 1996 PTC 152 at 535 relied upon by the defendant deals with the rectification of registration of a trademark and thus may not be an appropriate case for the present case. The decisions relied upon by the counsel for the defendant are not applicable to the facts of the present case and have no application in the facts and circumstances of the present case as the services offered in the present case by the plaintiff and the defendant are identical since both of them provide Internet programs and on line information to users regarding various categories of applications like arts, humanities, employment, entertainment, etc. \n \n\n",
        "p_23": "16. The contention of the learned counsel for the defendant that the word 'Yahoo!' is a dictionary word and, therefore, cannot be appropriated as a domain name/trademark is also misplaced as there are number of such words being used by various companies as their trademarks. The said words although are dictionary words have acquired uniqueness and distinctiveness and are associated with the business of the concerned company and such words have come to receive maximum degree of protection by courts as was done also in the case of 'WHIRLPOOL'. In the said decision namely N.R. Dongre Vs. Whirlpool Corp.; reported in 1996 PTC (16), a Division Bench of this Court recognised the distinctiveness and uniqueness of the word 'WHIRLPOOL' which was subsequently upheld by the Supreme Court in its decision reported in 1996 PTC 583. 'WHIRLPOOL' is otherwise a dictionary word and was not registered in India as a trademark. The court considering the entire gamut of the case held that the reputation of the trademark 'WHIRLPOOL' in respect of washing machines has travelled ansborder to India and, therefore, although the respondents are not the registered roprietor of the 'WHIRLPOOL' in India in respect of washing machines can maintain action of passing off against the appellants in respect of the use of the same which has been registered in their favour in respect of the same goods. In the said decision, it was also held that registration of a trademark under the Act would be irrelevant in an action of passing off. \n",
        "p_24": "17. The defense as raised in the present suit by the defendants is, therefore, prima facie found to be without any merit. The counsel for the defendants during the course of his ubmissions submitted that the defendants have not been using or copying the contents of the programmes of the plaintiff and have no objection even if such an injunction is granted estraining the defendants from using or copying the contents of the prgrammes of the plaintiff. In my considered opinion and as discussed above, the plaintiff has been able to make out a prima facie case for grant of ad interim injunction in its favour and, therefore, an ad interim injunction is passed in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendants restraining the defendants their partners, servants and agents from operating any business or selling, offering for sale, advertising and/or in any manner dealing in service or goods on the Internet or otherwise under the trademark/domain name 'Yahooindia.com' or any other trademark/domain name which is identical with or deceptively similar to the plaintiff trademark 'Yahoo!' till the disposal of the suit. The defendants and all others acting on their behalf are further restrained from using and/or copying the contents of the programmes of the plaintiff under the domain name 'Yahoo.com'. \n",
        "p_25": "18. In terms of the aforesaid order, the application filed by the plaintiff seeking for injunction stands disposed of. It is, however, made clear that all opinions and views expressed in this order are my tentative and prima facie view and shall not be treated as the final opinion on the merit of the case. \n"

On\n6.5.1986, Shri\tMohanlal Hinji Chawda, a partner of the firm\n(Sr. No.  6 above)  died and  in his  place, his  widow Smt.\nJijiben Mohanlal  Chawda was  admitted as  a partner  in the\nfir. After  the admission  of the said Smt. Jijiben Mohanlal\nChawda, another\t deed on  partnership was made consisting of\nthe old\t six partner  and the  newly admitted  partner\tSmt.\nJijiben Mohanlal Chawda. As a matter of fact,. the induction\nof the\tnew partner  was not  brought to  the notice  of the\nregistrar of  Firms by\tforwarding the required particulars.\nIt is  on record  that still  latter  on  3.11.1992  another\npartnership deed  was brought  into existence  consisting of\nthe same  partners. It\tis also\t on record  that yet another\npartner Smt.  Hemkuver\tB.  Kotak  (S.NO.4  above)  died  in\nSeptember, 1994.  The fact of death of this partner also was\nnot intimated  to the  Registrar of Firms. While, so the 1st\nrespondent gave\t a notice  of dissolution of the firm to the\nappellants and\talso filed a suit for the dissolution of the\npartnership firm  bearing Suit\tno., 5016/94  on 15.12.94 in\nthe High Court of Judicature at Bombay on the original side.\nInitially in  the  plant,  the\tconstitutional\tvalidity  of\nSection 69(2A)\tof the\tIndian Partnership  Act (hereinafter\ncalled the  \"Act\"), as\tamended by  Maharashtra Act, was not\nraised. The  1st respondent  moved  a  Chamber\tSummons\t No,\n301/97 seeking\tpermission of the Court to carry out certain\namendments to  the plaint.  Briefly, the  amendments  sought\nwere that  subsequent changes  and/or modifications  in\t the\npartnership deed  of M/s.  Paramount Builders under the deed\nof partnership\tdated 20.10.1986  and also  in the  deed  of\npartnership dated  3.11.1992 are  merely in  the  nature  of\nchanges\t  and/or   modifications   which   do\tnot   affect\nregistration of the said firm of M/s. Paramount Builders, as\nrequired  under\t the  Act  ,  for  entitling  a\t partner  to\ninstitute  a  suit  for\t reliefs  against  the\tpartners  on\ndissolution of\tfirms and alternatively, the other amendment\nsought was to challenges the vires of section 69 (2A) of the\nAct as in force in State of Maharashtra.\n",
        "p_10": "     The amendment  sought  was\t seriously  opposed  by\t the\nappellants inter alia, contending that the suit as filed was\nnot maintainable,  and, therefore,  the amendment  cannot be\nallowed, In other words, according  to the appellants on and\nfrom 20.10.1986\t when a\t new partnership  deed was made, the\nregistration already  given  to\t the  firm  ceased  to\thave\nvalidity and the partnership as at present must be deemed to\nbe an  unregistered one\t and, therefore, the suit was hit by\nSection 69 (2A) of the Act creates a bar on the threshold of\nthe filing  of the  suit for  the relief covered in the suit\nand the\t very suit  filed by  the plaintiff was incompetent.\nThat being the position, the application for amendment could\nnot  be\t  permitted.  Consequently,   the  application\t was\nrejected.\n",
        "p_11": "     Aggrieved\t by   the   rejection\tof   the   amendment\napplication, the first respondent preferred an appeal to the\nDivision Bench of the High Court in Appeal No. 509/97.\n",
        "p_12": "     The  appellate   court  was   of  the   view  that\t the\nregistration  of   the\tfirm   continues  to   be  in  force\nnotwithstanding any reconstitution of the firm and even whin\ndissolution  takes  place,  the\t registration  of  the\tfirm\ncontinues. The\tDivision Bench\tfurther\t held  that  Section\n69(2A) requires\t the registration  of a firm and it does not\nrequire a  fresh registration  each time a reconstitution or\ndissolution  of\t the  continuing  firm\ttakes  place.  After\nfinding that  the suit filed by the first respondent was not\nhit by Section 69(2A), the Division Bench held as follows:-\n",
        "p_13": "     Ultimately the  appellate court  allowed the appeal and\npermitted the  amendment only regarding the factual portions\nand not\t regarding the\tconstitutional validity\t of  Section\n69(2A).\n",

Therefore, the learned Single Judge was\nright in  holding that\tthe suit was not maintainable at the\nthreshold. According to the learned senior counsel, the mere\nfact that  the plaintiff's name find a place in the Register\nof Registrar of Firms is not sufficient to maintain the suit\nwhen  admittedly   one\tof   the  partners's   name  (second\nrespondent's  name)   was  not\tshown  in  the\tRegister  of\nRegistrar of  Firms. He\t also contended that a comparison of\nlanguage employed  in Sections\t31 and\t32 of  the Act. Will\nshow that  whenever a  partner is  inducted into an existing\nfirm, the  old firm  ceases to\texist and  an altogether new\nfirm comes  into existence from the date of induction of the\nnew partner  and that  new firm must ger fresh registration.\nIn support  of this proposition, he placed reliance on Madho\nPrasad and  Others vs. Gouri Dutt Ganesh Lal (AIR 1939 Patna\n",

        "p_121": "     Contending contrary  and supporting the judgment of the\nDivision Bench.\t Mr,.  Sole.  J.  Sorabjee,  learned  Senior\nCounsel,  submitted   that  there   is\t a   well-recognised\ndistinction between  the legal\tconcept of  dissolution\t and\nreconstitution of  a firm.  In the case of an incoming or an\noutgoing partner  in  a\t existing  firm,  there\t is  only  a\nreconstitution of  the firm  and in  all other respects, the\nexisting firm continues with old and new partners. A look at\nchapter V  of the  Act. according  to him,  will fortify the\nabove contention.  In other  words,  chapter  V\t deals\twith\n\"Income and  Outgoing partners\"\t while Chapter VI separately\ndeals with  \"Dissolution of  a Firm\".  The two\tare  totally\ndifferent concepts  and cannot\tin law\tbe equated with each\nother, According  to the  learned Senior  Counsel, the rules\nframed by  Maharashtra Government  in  1989  and  the  forms\nprescribed under  the rules  in particular Forms E. G. and H\nclearly support\t the  said  contention.\t   It  is  also\t his\ncontention that\t even when there is a dissolution of a firm.\nIt does not cease to be registered firm but for the purposes\nof Partnership\tAct it\tcontinues to be registered. In other\nwords,\taccording   to\tthe   learned  Senior  Counsel.\t the\nregistration of\t a firm\t is valid  till it is cancelled in a\nmanner know to law. Non-compliance of Sections 61,62 and 63.\nas amended  in Maharashtra,  if at  all,  will\tattract\t the\npenalties prescribed  under Section 69A and nothing more and\nit is  incorrect to  contend that non-compliance of the said\nprovisions will\t result in  deregistration is a drastic one,\nit  is\t impermissible\tto  hold  that\tnon-compliance\twith\nSections 63(1)\tand 63(1A) would lead to deregistration of a\nfirm  in  the  absence\tof  express  and  clear\t legislative\nprovisions to  that effect. He further contended that merely\nbecause another\t partnership deed was made on 20.1.01986, it\ncannot be  said that there was a dissolution of the old firm\nand consequential  formation of\t a new firm under the latter\ndead. According\t to the\t l earned  Senior Counsel, it is the\nsubstance of  the matter  that is relevant to be looked into\nand not\t the phraseology  employed by the parties. IN others\nwords, the  test is  whether after the execution of the deed\ndated 20.10.1986, for all intents and purposes,. the firm as\nreconstituted was a different unit or remained the same unit\nin spite  of change in its constitution. Looked at from this\nangle, the  unit remained  the same  as it originally was in\nspite of  change in  its constitution  and the contention to\nthe contrary,  according to  the learned Senior Counsel, was\nnot  correct.\tTo  support   this,  he\t  pointed  out\t the\nsimilarities   between\t  the\ttwo   deeds.   The   alleged\ndissimilarities as  found in Clauses 4 and 5 of the Document\ndated  20.1.1986   are\treally\t not   dissimilarities\t but\nconsequential and incidental changes.\n",

In  support of  this, he placed reliance on a judgment\nof the\tAndhra Pradesh\tHigh Court  in Maddi  Sudarsanam and\nOthers vs. Borogu Viswanadham Brothers (AIR 1955 Andhra 12).\n",
        "p_125": "     At the outset, we would like to deal with the substance\nof the\tPartnership deeds  in this case. As noticed earlier,\nthe first  Deed of  Partnership was entered into on 29.11.79\nand that partnership firm was requested on 15.12.80 . One of\nthe partners  (Shri Mohanlal  Hinji Chawda)  died mon 6.5.86\nand in his place, his widow was indicted. The second Deed of\nPartnership was\t drawn on  20.1.86. By\treason of the second\nDeed of\t Partnership, can  it be said that the existing firm\ndissolved or  ceased. It  is relevant  here to\tnote that in\nboth the  deeds\t it  was  expressly  made  that\t the  death,\ninsolvency or  retirement of  any partner shall not dissolve\nthe partnership\t firm. On  the other hand, the partner shall\nbe entitled  to carry  on the  partnership business  on\t the\nterms and  conditions  mutually\t agreed\t upon  bu  the\tsaid\npartners  (vide\t  Clause  11)  .  Therefore,  it  cannot  be\ncontended by  the appellants  that by reason of death of one\nof the\tpartners, the existing firm stands dissolved. Cam it\nthen be\t said that  by reason  of inducting the widow of the\ndeceased partner  the existing\tregistered firm\t ceased\t and\ntotally\t a   new  partnership\tfirm  came  into  existence.\nAccording to the appellants, by reason of Clauses 4 and 5 in\nthe second  Deed of  Partnership. It must be deemed that the\nold partnership\t ceased and  entirely a new partnership firm\nwas found under the second Deed. We are unable to agree with\nthe  contention\t of  the  learned  senior  counsel  for\t the\nappellants on  this  aspect.  Clauses  4  and  5  relate  to\ncommencement of\t the partnership  and accounting year. There\nare minimal  changes   introduced  in  the  second  Deed  of\nPartnership by\treason of  the introduction of a new partner\nin place  of Clauses  4 and  5 in the first Partnership Deep\nand in\tother respects,\t namely, the name of the partnership\nfirm, the  address and\tlocation of  the firm, the  business\ncarried on  and\t shares\t allotted  among  the  partners\t and\nduration of  the  partnership,\tare  identical.\t Moreover  a\ncareful reading of clauses 5 and 6 of the second partnership\ndeed will  give an  impression that the partners have agreed\nto continue the existing firm. The profits or losses for the\nperiod prior  to and  up to the death of deceased partner is\ndealt with and provided. There is no indication that the old\nfirm  was   dissolved.\tLikewise,  reliance  placed  on\t the\nrecitals in  the third\tDeed of Partnership drawn on 3.11.92\nwill not come to the help of the appellants. Learned counsel\nfor the\t appellants placed  reliance on the term used in the\nthird  Partnership   Deep  reconstituted   in  the  Preamble\nportion. We  are of  the opinion that this does not make any\nsubstantial difference\twhen we\t look into  the substance of\nthe three deeds. In this connection, the learned counsel for\nthe respondents has rightly placed reliance on the following\nobservation made in Tyresoles (India). Calcutta (supra):\n",

The\n     next Section  requiring  notice  is\n     S.69(2). That is in these terms:\n",
        "p_136": "     No suit  to enforce a right arising\n     from      a   contract   shall   be\n     instituted in  any Court  by or  on\n     behalf of\ta firm against any third\n     party unless the firm is registered\n     and the  person suing  are or  have\n     been shown in the register of firms\n     as partners in the firm.\n",

There is\n     no time  limit fixed  in any of the\n     S.60 to  63 as  to when  notice  of\n     alterations or  changes  should  be\n     given, Mr,\t Davar argued  that  the\n     word \"when with which each of those\n     Sections\tbegins\t  involves    an\n     obligation\t   upon\t   the\t  person\n     proposing to  give\t notice\t of  the\n     change to\tgive it immediately upon\n     the change\t occurring.

According to the learned\ncounsel, if  his contention is not accepted, the object with\nwhich Section  69(2A) was introduced will be lost. We do not\nthink so.  In this  context, we\t wish  top  point  out\tthat\nSection 69(3)(a)  of the Central Act enables the partners of\nboth registered\t and unregistered  firms to  file a suit for\ndissolution and\t /or accounts.\tThat being  the position  by\nintroducing sub-section\t (2A) in Section 69, the Maharashtra\nLegislature has\t placed certain\t restrictions to  the extent\nthat even  the\tsuit  for  dissolution\tof  a  firm  or\t for\naccounts, the  suit  can  be  filed  only  if  the  firm  is\nregistered and\tthe 'person'  suing as a partner is shown in\nthe Register  of Firms\tas a  partner in  the firm. In other\nwords, a  person, who  is not shown in the Register of Firms\nby induction  after registration  even though  the firms  is\nregistered, cannot  file a suit for dissolution or accounts.\nThis does not in any way mean that the registration given to\nthe firm  earlier will\tcease. In  this case,  the firm\t was\nregistered and there was only reconstitution of the firm and\nthe first  respondent, the  plaintiff in  this\tcase,  is  a\nperson\t   whose      name     is      shown\t in\t the\nRegister of Firms also with the names of the appellants and,\ntherefore, there  is compliance\t of  Section  69(2A).\t The\ncontention to  the contrary  by the  learned counsel for the\nappellants cannot be accepted.\n",
        "p_143": "     The decisions  cited by  the learned  counsel  for\t the\nappellants are\tdistinguishable. In  Madho Prasad and others\nvs. Gouri  Dutt Ganesh\tLal (supra),  the principal question\nthat arose for consideration was whether an incoming partner\ncan be made liable for debts contracted b y a firm before he\njoined it.  In Gouri  Sankar Sheroff  and others vs. Central\nHindusthan Bank\t Ltd and  others (supra), again a creditor's\nright to  proceed against assets of partnership firm and not\na suit\tby partners  for accounts.  In\tMeenakshi  Achi\t and\nAnother vs.  P.S.M.Subramanian Chettiar\t and Others (Supra),\nagain it  was a case concerning the liability of partner for\nobligations incurred  before his  introduction. M/s  Nandlal\nSohanlal. Jullundur  vs.  The  Commissioner  of\t Income-Tax.\nPatiala (AIR  1977 Punjab & Haryana 320) also is not helpful\nto the appellants.\n",
        "p_144": "     We are  also not  impressed by  the  arguments  of\t the\nlearned counsel for the appellants that if the definition of\nSection 4 is applied to Section 69(2A) then unless the names\nof all\tpartners find a place in the Register of Firms , the\nsuit filed  by the  Plaintiff cannot  be sustained. The fact\nthat the  firm was  registered and  Plaintiff's name finds a\nplace in the Register of Firms are not in dispute., The name\nof the\tnewly introduced partner, or cours,  does not find a\nplace in  the Register of Firms. That means the person whose\nname does  not find  a place  in the  Register of Firms many\nincur certain  disabilities and\t that will  not disable\t the\nplaintiff to  press the\t suit against  the firm,  which\t was\nregistered against  the persons\t whose names find a place in\nthe Register of Firms. We are not called upon to decide what\nare the disabilities of the person, whose name does not find\na place in the Register of firms. For the purpose of Section\n69(2A), the  partnership firm will mean the firm as found in\nthe certificate of registration and the partners as found in\nthe register  of firms\tmaintained as  per rule in Form 'G'.\nThe present  suit being\t one for dissolution and accounts by\none of\tthe partners,  whose name  admittedly finds place in\nthe Register  of  Firms\t alongwith  the\t names\tof  all\t the\nappellants,  the   requirements\t of   Section\t69(2A)\t are\nsatisfied. Section  4 of  the is also complied with for this\nlimited purpose.\n",
        "p_145": "     Our conclusion  is that  on the induction of the second\nrespondent, the\t existing firm was only reconstituted on the\nfacts of  this case and, therefore, there is no necessity to\nget a  fresh registration. If by virtue of non-compliance of\ncertain mandatory  provisions in  not informing\t  the  firm,\ncertain penalties  provided in\tthe Act\t alone are attracted\nand  that   will  not\tlead  to  the  conclusion  that\t the\nregistration of the firm ceased. This conclusion is based on\na conjoint reading of Sections 58_63 and the form prescribed\nthereunder. Further,  this conclusion  does not\t in any\t way\nmilitate the  object of the Maharashtra Amendment introduced\nby Act 29 of 84.\n",

V, Srinivasan, has filed the above suit for (1) a permanent injunction restraining the defendant V. A. Samy Chemical Works from manufacturing, selling and offering for sale \"Kajal\" with the offending trade mark Rani Eyevix; (2) accounting and for recovery of profits earned by the defendant by way of damages for the infringement; and (3) for directing the defendant to surrender all the cartons, labels and any other printed matters containing the offending Rani Eyevix trade mark together with the blocks.\n",
        "p_3": "2. The allegations in the plaint are briefly as follows:- The plaintiff and his predecessors in title have been dealers in cosmetics for about 50 years. Their main products are Kajal used for beautifying the eye and Kum Kum used by Indian ladies. In the year ending 31-3-1983 the Plaintiffs turnover amounted to Rs. 1,58,14,125/-. All their 24 different types of products arc known in the market by their trade mark \"EYETEX\" registered as early as 1946 under the Trade Marks Act 1940. The name Eyetex has 26 become the special distinctive trade mark identity for all their products. This is also reflected in the judgment of this Court reported in Aravind Laboratories v. Annamalai Chettiar, (1981) 1 Mad  LJ 75 : (AIR 1981 NOC 13).\n",
        "p_4": "3. Kajal (collyrium) produced by the plaintiff is marketed in a black circular plastic capsule, on the face of which is embossed the words EYETEX Registered. Along with the capsule an inch long plastic stick with handle is also supplied for applying the Kajal to the eye lashes so that the Kajal does not stain the fingers. The plastic capsule is wrapped by a sheet giving directions for use and along with the plastic stick it is packed in a square cardboard box.\n",
        "p_5": "4. The principal face of the square cardboard box contains the registered trade mark of the plaintiff bearing No. 124824 (Class 3) registered in the year 1946. It contains the profile of a face with prominent eye brow and eye lash. Words \"Eyetex\" written horizontally in bold, distinctively created letters and \"Regd\" are written at the bottom to indicate that the entire design and the legend are registered. The three colours, green, white and black are used in artistic combination to give an arresting effect even at the first glance. The reverse face of the carton contains a circle, in which the address of the plaintiff is printed. There is an artistic background with the design of several floating eyes in green. On top the weight of the contents viz. 1.5 grams and the price Rs. 1.25 are printed. On the remaining four rectangular sides, the address of the plaintiff, Eyetex Kanmai in Tamil, Kajal in Hindi, Katuka in Telugu are printed. In the background eye is printed in green. The picture of the eye is the dominating motif of the carton.\n",
        "p_6": "5. The Plaintiff and their predecessor in title have been using the above design and carton for about 40 years. The product of the plaintiff is associated in the minds of their consumers with the above distinctive design, get-up, colour combination and the style of writing. Along with the capsule the plaintiff keeps an instruction sheet which contains the details of the registration, direction for use and brief history of the product in six different languages, namely Tamil, Telugu, English, Malayalam, Kannada and Hindi.\n",
        "p_7": "6. In 1980 Kajal Collyrium with the address of the Defendant was found to be sold in a number of outlets in the city of Madras. It was filled in black plastic capsules exactly similar to that of the Plaintiff. The capsule was packed in a square cardboard box similar in design, colour combination, get up and size of the cardboard box of the plaintiff with the word EYEVIX in the place of EYETEX. The combination of the three colours, black, white and green are identical to that of the plaintiff. On the reverse the address, the price, weight, etc. and in the background the design of many eyes in green are printed.\n",
        "p_8": "7. The plaintiff issued a notice on 10-41980 to the defendant stating that the manner in which the defendant's product was packed amounted to infringement of the Plaintiffs' registered trade mark as well as passing off of the Plaintiff's product. The defendant sent a reply dated 17-4-1980 denying the allegations made. Thereafter plaintiff did not notice the defendant's product in the retail outlets anywhere in the city of Madras and other places. Hence no action was taken.\n",
        "p_9": "8.Two months prior to the filing of the suit the Plaintiff noticed that the defendant's Kajal is very much in evidence in a large number of retail outlets. But in the manner of packing the following differences have been introduced. Firstly the lid of the plastic capsule contains a crown and the legend Rani Eyevix embossed in gold colour. Secondly, there is a circular cut-out face above the word EYEVIX with the word \"Rani\" printed in small letters. In spite of these differences the defendant's product is so similar to the product of the plaintiff. The conduct of the defendant amounts to infringement of the plaintiff's trade mark as well as passing off.\n",
        "p_10": "9. In the defendant's cartons there is a false representation stating that the trade mark is registered and its registration number is 19631. There is no such registration in reality and the conduct of the defendant is an offence under S. 81 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 punishable with six months' imprisonment. As per Drug and Cosmetics Act the applicant for license has to give a declaration that the applicant will not contravene Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. Further the licence stipulated forfeiture in the event of contravention, and the defendant has violated the condition.\n",
        "p_11": "10. The introduction of the defendant's product with the offending trade mark carton has created confusion among the consumers as well as merchants and the defendant's products with the Trade name Rani Eyevix is easily taken to be the Plaintiffs product Eyetex in this connection. The Kajal manufactured and sold by the defendant under the Trade name 'Rani Eyevix' is inferior in quality and, lesser in price than the plaintiffs goods. The trade mark of the defendant is deceptively similar and has a colorable imitation of the Plaintiff. The cause of action arose at Madras within the jurisdiction of this Court. The Plaintiff, therefore, prays for a judgment and decree, for the reliefs mentioned above.\n",
        "p_12": "11. In answer to the plaintiffs claim the defendant filed a written statement raising the following contentions: The allegation that the Plaintiff is a registered firm of partnership is not admitted and the Plaintiff is bound to prove the same. The suit is barred under S. 69 of the Partnership Act since no suit could be instituted by a firm in the absence of a certificate of registration of the firm and disclosing the partners thereof. The suit is liable to be dismissed in the absence of the production of the valid certificate as contemplated under S. 69 of the Partnership Act.\n",
        "p_13": "12. Even according to the plaintiff's documents the registration of the trade mark Eyetex Was made only in October, 1946 in the name of one P. K. Vasudevan from whom the plaintiff was stated to have acquired the rights vested in the said trade mark along with other items under the document dated 6-3-1958 and the said document had riot been filed along with the Plaint. There is no document filed along with Plaint to show that there was a renewal of the trade mark under the provisions of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 - The Defendant does not admit the allegation that the Plaintiff registered the trade mark Eyetex in 1946.\n",
        "p_14": "13. The alleged assignment in favour of the plaintiff   will not in the eye of law constitute a valid assignment in favour of the Plaintiff The renewal of the licence had been done in the name of 8 individuals and the licence appears to be renewed till the end of December, 1984. The truth and genuineness of the document dated 11th September 1946, is not admitted. There is no document in favour of the plaintiff regarding the registration of the - trade mark or with reference to the transfer of the ownership of the trade mark Eyetex by Vasudevan in favour of the Plaintiff. No material had been placed before this Court along with the plaint to establish the ownership of Eyetex in favour of the plaintiff. None of the requirements as contemplated under S. 2(v) of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 defining the trade mark had been fulfilled or satisfied by the Plaintiff.\n",
        "p_15": "14. Shapes and patterns are not included in the definition of the word Mark. A perusal of paragraph 13 of the plaint would show that the plaintiff would admit the existence of the differences between the product stated to have been manufactured by the defendant and the product manufactured by the plaintiff. However, the plaintiff would urge that the product of the defendant was so similar to the product of the Plaintiffs so that it would be mistaken in the market as the product of the Plaintiff. The defendant set forth in the annexure the vital differences between the two products viz. Eyetex and Rani Eyevix. To a naked eye even the shape and pattern widely differ. The question of any infringement of the alleged plaintiff's trade mark as well as passing of the goods does not arise for consideration at all. There is no resemblance between the two products either phonetically or visually. There are no identical shapes of the products. There is no colorable imitation of the plaintiffs mark by the defendant. The get up, packing and other writings or marks on the goods or on the packets in which the defendants offer the goods for sale show marked differences, and indicate the fact that the defendant's trade mark is entirely different from that of the plantiff's mark. The unwary purchaser cannot be said to be in any way deceived by the product of the defendant. No question of deception or causing confusion in relation to the goods manufactured by the defendant will-arise.\n",
        "p_16": "15. The plaintiff was fully aware that ever since April, 1980 the defendant has been using the trade mark 'Rani Eyevix' and the plaintiff ,did not demur the defendant's dealings with the goods manufactured by the defendant as Eyevix or Rani Eyevix. By their conduct, the plaintiff is estopped on the principles of equitable and promissory estoppel from urging , that there had been an infringement of the trade mark in question. The suit is barred under S. 115 of the Evidence Act by estoppel and acquiescence on the part of the plaintiff. There is no legal injury caused to the plaintiff and the suit for damages is not maintainable.\n",
        "p_17": "16. There is no contravention of the provisions of Drugs and Cosmetics Act. The case of the defendant is that the defendant registered its name under the provisions of the Copyright Act with reference to the various products manufactured by the ,defendant. The trade mark Rani Eyevix will ,not in any way create confusion.\n",
        "p_18": "17. The plaintiff is not entitled to the damages in the absence of specific proof of the same. The defendant invested several lakhs of rupees for the manufacture of Rani Eyevix. The defendant has also entered into contracts with the dealers for the sale of its products. The defendant has also engaged workmen for the manufacture of the 'Eyevix'.  True and correct accounts were maintained with reference to the actual manufacture of Eyevix and the sale thereof to its constituents. No injunction can be granted to the plaintiff since if the plaintiff succeeds in the suit it can be adequately compensated monetarily. Even assuming without conceding that the plaintiff is a registered owner, the plaintiff must have obtained the registration fraudulently. The said registration of the trade mark is liable to be revoked under, S . 45 of the Trade and Merchandise, Marks Act, 1958. The plaintiff is not entitled to relief of injunction prayed for. Under the circumstances the defendant prays that the suit be dismissed with exemplary costs.\n",
        "p_19": "18. On these pleadings the following issues were framed :-\n",
        "p_20": " 1. Is the plaintiff a registered firm and whether the suit is barred under Section 69 of the Partnership Act?\n",

        "p_27": "19. In the plaint itis stated that the plaintiff Aravind Laboratories is a registered firm 'represented by its Senior partner A. V.  Srinivasan. In the written statement it is stated that the defendant does not admit that the plaintiff firm is a registered firm of partnership.  It is also contended that the suit is barred under S. 69 of the Partnership Actsince no suit could be instituted by a firm in the absence of a certificate of registration of the firm and disclosing the partners thereof. The plaintiff  was also called upon to disclose the names-of other partners of the firm. On behalf of the plaintiff P.W. 1 deposed that the plaintiff firm is a registered one and the same is registered with the Registrar of Firms. In cross examination P.W. 1 was asked as to who are the partners of the firm to which he replied that (1) A. V. Srinivasan, (2) Mrs. Booma Devanathan, (3) Mrs. Shanti Rajagopal are the partners of the firm. He also stated that the Partnership was reconstituted subsequently somewhere in the year 1966 and recently about two years back. Ex. P- 11, dated 29-4-1982, is the latest partnership deed.Ex. P-10 is the certificate of registration, dated 21-12-1965, issued by the Registrar of Firms, stating that Aravind Laboratories had been entered in the Register of Firms as No. 4114 of 1965. Ex. P-10 also contains the seal of the Registrar of Firms. P.W. 1 says that the registration-still continues. He also states that he applied for the copy of the latest registration certificate and the same has not been received. From Ex. P-10 it is seen that the plaintiff/firm had been registered by the Registrar of Finn.. By means of Ex. D-11, the partnership had been reconstituted. The details of the reconstituted partnership had also been filed before the Registrar of Firms on 4-5-1982 as per S. 63 of the Partnership Act and the change in the constitution of the firm had been duty notified and registered. A certified copy of form \"A\" filed regarding the reconstitution of the partnership had been filed. But by oversight the document had not been marked as an exhibit. Since the certified copy of a public document is admissible even without proof of the same is marked as Ex. P111 (a) D.W. 1 who was examined on behalf of the defendant/firm does not dispute the registration certificate Ex. P-11. There is no evidence contra to that of the plaintiff that the registration exists tiff now. Hence in view of  the above said documents  coupled  with  the   evidence of P.W. 1.  I conclude that the plaintiff/firm is a registered firm under the provisons of the Partnership Act. I found on Issue No. I that the plaintiff is registered firm and the suit is not barred under S. 69 of the Partnership Act.\n",

In para 4 of the plaint it is stated that all the 24 types of products of the plaintiff are known -in the market by their trade mark \"EYETEX\" registered as early as 1946 under the Trade Marks Act, 1940, renewed from time to time currently valid under the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. The name 'Eye Tex' has become their special distinctive trade mark identity for all their products. This is also reflected in the judgment of this Court reported in Aravind Laboratories v. Annamalai Chettlar, (1981) 1 Mad LJ 75 : (AIR 1981 NOC 13). The above said allegation is denied by the defendant in para 4 of the written statement. It is stated in the written statement that no matter has been placed to show that the plaintiff is currently holding the proprietorship of the trade mark EYETEX. P.W. 1 has spoken to the fact that the trade mark EYETEX has been registered. Ex. P- 1 is the original trade mark registration certificate issued in favour of P. K. Vasudevan, trading as Pushpavanam Stores, 580 Pycrofts Road, Triplicane, Madras, stating that the trade mark \"EYETEX\" had been registered in his name and the registration number is given as 124824. Ex. P 2 is the plaintiffs carton Eyetex, under which the plaintiff is trading. Ex. P-11 dated 294-1982, is the deed of partnership entered into between (1) A. V. Srinivasan,(2) Smt. Bhooma Devanathan,(3) Suit. Shanti Rajgopal and (4) Aravind Laboratories Private Limited, whereby all the above said persons have constituted themselves into a partnership to continue the business of the plaintif viz. to manufacture and sell the products such as \"Eyetex7, \"Bindi\" etc. Ex. P 11 is signed by all the partners. Ex. P-12 is the certificate from the Registrar of Trade Marks, dated 11-9-1982, mentioning the plaintiffs trade mark number as 124824 and the same had been renewed for a period of 7 years in favour of the plaintiff from 11-91982. In Ex. P-12 it is also mentioned that the renewal was advertised in the Trade Mark Journal No. 838. Ex. P-13 is the certificate of registration No. 303087, dated 28-10-1978, showing the registration of the trade mark Eyetex in the names of A. V. Srinivasan, Bhooma Devanathan and Shanti Rajgopal, trading as Aravind Laboratories at No. 3, Chakrapani Street, Madras 600033 in respect of perfumery; perfumery compounds; cosmetic preparations known as kajal or kanmai; bindi, bindi pencils; kumkum, etc. Ex. P-14, dated 19-2-1982, is the certificate issued by the Registrar of Trade Marks stating that the registration trade mark No. 303087 had been renewed for a period of 7 years from 19-2-1982, and the said renewal was advertised in the Trade Mark Journal No. 809. Ex. P-15, dated 26-3-1976 is the certificate issued by -the Registrar of Trade Mark in respect of the registration of the Trade Mark \"Eyetex\" in Tamil. Ex. P 16, dated 26-3-1976, is the certificate of registration issued by the Registrar of Trade Marks in respect of the trade mark Eyetex in Malayalam. Ex. P-17, is the certificate issued by the Registrar of Trade Marks showing Registration of Trade Mark No, 296915 of the plaintiff which has been renewed for a period of seven years from 14-6-4981 and the same was advertised in the trade Mark Journal No. 785. Ex. P-18 is the certificate issued' by the Registrar of Trade Marks showing the Registration of Trade Mark No. 296914 of the plaintiff has been renewed for a period of seven years from 146-1981 and the same was advertised in the Trade Mark Journal No. 785. Ex. P-19, dated 26-3-1976, is the certificate of registration issued by the Registrar of Trade Marks for Registration of trade marks Eyetex in Telugu under 296913. Ex. P-20 is the certificate issued by the Registrar of Trade Marks showing that the Registration of Trade Mark No. 296913 has been renewed for a period of seven years from 14-6-1981, and the same was advertised in the Trade Mark Journal No. 785. Ex. P-22, dated 26-3-1976, is the certificate of registration issued by the Registrar of Trade Marks for registration of the trade mark Eyetex in Hindi under No. 296910. Ex. P-21 is the certificate, issued by the Registrar of Trade Marks showing that the registration of trade mark No. 296910 has been renewed for a period of seven years from 14-6-1981 and the renewal was advertised in the Trade Mark Journal No. 785. Ex. P-23 is the certificate of registration issued by the Registrar of Trade Marks, dated 26-3-1976, showing the registration of trade mark Eyetex in Telugu as per registration No. 296909 Ex. P24 is the renewal of certificate of registration issued by the Registrar of Trade Marks showing that the Registration of Trade Mark No. 296909 has been renewed for a period of seven years from 14-6-1981 and the same was advertised in the Trade Mark Journal No. 785. The above said certificates of registration and the subsequent renewals in respect of the trade mark Eyetex are produced and spoken to by P.W. 1. No evidence contra has been let in by the defendant. Hence the case of the plaintiff that the plaintiff is the proprietor of the trade mark Eyetex in the above said languages and the carton marked as Ex. P-2 stands proved. Hence on Issue No. 2 1 find that the trade mark Eyetex has been registered in the name of the plaintiff under the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958.\n",
        "p_30": "Has the defendant infringed the Plaintiff's trade mark?\n",
        "p_31": "Is not the plaintiff entitled for the relief of injunction and accounting and other reliefs as prayed for in paragraph 19 of the plaint?\n",
        "p_32": "21. The case of the plaintiff in the plaint as well as the evidence of P.W. I is that the plaintiff and his predecessor in tide were the dealers in cosmetics under the trade name Eyetex for the past many years. Their main products are Kajal used for beautifying the eye and Kum Kum used by Indian ladies. All the 24 types of products of the plaintiff are known in the market by the trade mark \"Eyetex\" and the same are registered. The plaintiff has been marketing Kajal under the trade mark Eyetex. The carton used by the plaintiff is marked as Ex. P-2. According to P.W. 1 the defendant began to market the Kajal in the name of Eyevix in a carton which is deceptively similar to the carton used by, the plaintiff. Ex. P-3 is the black and white carton in which the defendant marketed his product of Kajal. Ex. P-4 is the coloured version of the carton used by the defendant. On coming to know of the infringement of the plaintiff's registered trade mark, the plaintiff issued a registered notice Ex. P-6, dated 10-4-1980 to the defendant. In Ex. P-6; it is stated that the trade mark of the defendant's carton \"Eyevix\" has a striking resemblance to the plaintiffs Eyetex trade ,mark and the carton also virtually copied including the distinctive get-up, lay-out and colour scheme. Ex. P-7, dated 17-4-1980, is the reply notice issued by the defendant to the plaintiff wherein it is stated that the plaintiff cannot claim any monopoly right over such common features of eye for KANMAI trade which are descriptive and there is no question of infringement and passing off in respect of the said trade mark of the plaintiff. It is also stated that the trade mark EYEVIX for Kanmai has been adopted by the defendant openly and continuously for number of years and as such there is no infringement, colourable imitation and passing Off under any sections of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. It is also stated that the plantiff has misled the Trade Marks Tribunal and the defendant will take steps for rectifying the same in due course. Ex. P8, dated 11-9-1982, is the licence issued by the State Drugs Controller to the plaintiff for production of kajal. Ex. P-9 is the renewal of the licence issued under Ex. P-8. In Ex. P-8 in para 6 it is stated that the plaintiff should ensure that their cosmetics do not in any way contravene the provisions of S. 17A of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and also the provisions of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, and the same is marked. as Ex. P 8(i). The case of the plaintiff is that after the issue of notice Ex. P-6 the defendant's product which was sold as Eyevix went Qut of the market for some time and subsequently the defendant began marketing Kajal under the name of RANI EYEVIX in the carton deceptively similar to that of the carton used by the plaintiff. The infringing carton of the defendant is marked as Ex. R-7. According to D.W. I Ex. R-3 is the certificate issued by the Registrar of Firms for the Registration of the defendant's firm. Ex. R-4 is the extracts from the Register of Copyrights. Ex. R-4 is, certified by the Deputy Registrar of Copyrights, New Delhi on 8-8-1980. In Ex. R 4 it is stated that the defendant is the registered proprieto7r of Rani Kumkum Powder (Packet Cover). Ex. P-5 is the letter addressed to the defendant by L. R. Swami Co., 222 South Masi Street, Madurai, dated 22-12-1983, asking for the block of label Rani Kumkum urgently. The defendant is not claiming to be the registered proprietor of the trade mark of Rani Eyevix. But his case is that the trade mark relating to Kajal refers to eye and the same is being adopted by all Kajal manufacturers and there cannot be any ,exclusive proprietorship in respect of the mark and that the plaintiff has misled the registering authority to register the trade mark Eyetex. 'The defendant has also produced Ex. R-1 the carton in which Kajal is marketed as EYERIS by some other firm. The defendant has also produced another carton under which another firm is marketing Kajal under the trade mark Eydas marked Ex. R-2. The case of the defendant is that the plaintiff cannot claim exclusive ownership of the trade mark since it refers to eye which all the manufacturers of Kajal are entitled to adopt.\n",
        "p_33": " 22. We are concerned with the effect of registration of the plaintiff's trade mark  EYETEX which has been amply proved by the documents filed by the plaintiff. Section 28 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 deals with the rights conferred by the registration and the same is as follows :-\n",
        "p_34": "  \"28. Rights conferred by registration.\n",
        "p_35": "  (1) Subject to the other provisions of this Act, the registration of a trade mark in Part A or Part B of the register shall, if valid, give to the registered proprietor of the trade mark the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation to the goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered and to obtain relief in respect of infringement of the trade mark in the manner provided by this Act.\n",
        "p_36": "(2) The exclusive right to the use of a trade mark given under sub-section (1) shall be subject to any conditions and limitations to which registration is subject.\n",
        "p_37": "(3) Where two or more persons are registered proprietors of trademarks, which are identical' with or nearly resemble each other, the exclusive right to the use of any of those trade marks shall not (except so far as their respective rights are subject to any conditions and limitations entered on the register) be deemed to 'have been acquired by any one of those persons as against any other of those persons merely by registration of the trade marks but each of those persons has otherwise the same rights as against other persons (not being registered users using by way of permitted use) as he would have if he were the sole registered proprietor.\"  \n",
        "p_38": "On behalf of the defendant it is contended that the rights conferred under S. 28 of the said Act accrues only when the registration is valid and in this case the registration of the plaintiffs trade mark is not valid. But as per S. 31 of the said Act the registration of a trade mark is prima facie evidence of validity and in all legal proceedings relating to a trade mark registered, under the Act, the original registration of the trade mark and of all subsequent assignment and transmissions of the trade mark shall be the prima facie evidence of the validity thereof. According to S. 32 the registration is to be conclusive as to validity after seven years. After\n\n \n\nseven years the registration can be questioned on the ground that the Original registration was obtained by\n\n \n\n fraud. Considering the, above provisions of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958, we have to take it \n\n \n\nthat the registration in favour of the plaintiff which is more than 7 years old is valid unless the defendant takes steps for rectification on the ground of fraud. Though in Ex. P-7 the notice the defendant has stated  that he is taking steps for rectification no such proceedings had been started so far. The defendant  having failed to institute rectification proceedings on the ground that the registration of the plaintiff's  trade mark is not valid cannot raise the plea in this suit that, the registration of the plaintiffs trade mark is  invalid. Under the circumstances, on the documentary evidence produced, I have to hold that the plaintiff is the registered proprietor of the trade mark Eyetex and the: design of the carton marked as Ex. P-2. The first contention of the defendant that the plaintiff is not entitled to the exclusive use of the trade mark Eyetex will  have to be negative since the plaintiff is entitled to market his product in the registered trade mark as long as he continues to be the registered proprietor of the said trade mark.\n",
        "p_39": "23. The second contention of the defendant is that in any event his trade mark Rani Eyevix and the carton in which it is marked has got several distinctive features and there is no possibility of anyone being misled to purchase the product of the plaintiff by the carton used by the defendant. The following differences between the plaintiffs trade mark and the defendant's trade mark are pointed out : - \n",

On behalf of the plaintiff it is contended that the similarity and dissimilarity are not to be decided from the deposition of   the case and the Court must come to its own conclusion whether one is liable to be misled by the marks adopted. It is for the Court to decide and no evidence of witness  will be admissible in this regard. The Court must look into both the trade marks and come to a conclusion. Further the Judge must look at the matter not with his own eyes but with the eyes of the public. In the case reported in Amritdhara Pharmacy v. Satya Deo,  the Supreme Court observed that what degree of resemblance is necessary to deceive or cause confusion must in the nature of things be incapable of definition a priori. For deceptive resemblance two important questions are (1) who are the persons whom the resemblance must be likely to deceive or confuse, and (2) what rules of comparison are to be adopted in judging whether such resemblance exists. As to confusion, it is perhaps an appropriate description of the state of mind of a customer who on seeing a mark thinks that it differs from the mark on goods which he has previously brought, but is doubtful whether that impression is not due to imperfect recollection. The Court held that the question will have to be considered from the point of view of a man of average intelligence and imperfect recollection. After laying down the above norms the Supreme Court held that in the two names Amritdhara and Lakshamandhara there is an overall similarity in respect of description of the goods which was likely to cause deception or confusion within the meaning of S. 10(l) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940. There are innumerable decisions as to the norms to be adopted in deciding the case of infringement. In the case reported in McCaw Stevenson and Orr Ltd. v. Lee Bros 23 PTM 91 it has been held that the trade mark \"Glazine\" was an infringement of the trade mark \"Glacier\". In the case reported in Bryant & May Ld. v. United Match Industries Ld., 50 RPC 12 it has been held that two labels having certain common features and certain other features which are differing, confusion is probable. In the case reported in Ravener Rutledge Ltd. v. Specters Ltd., 1959 RPC 83 the Chancery Division while considering the infringement in respect of two tins observed as follows : -\n",
        "p_70": "  \"If you take the two tins and put them side by side, you can of course at once see that they are not the same make of tin because the names are quite plain and it is quite simple to observe that one is \"Specters\" and one \"Traveners\", that one has a mauve or purple ground and the other a black ground and that the shape of the panels is somewhat different and that therefore they  are not exactly the same tin; but I do not think that is the right way in which to judge the matter. Nor again do I think, it is an answer to say that anybody who knows the name will know that the plaintiffs' name is different from that of the defendants' and that sweets are commonly ordered in the trade by name and in the case of retail customers are very often asked for by the name \"so and so's\" sweets. It seems to me that one has to take into consideration people who have what is called imperfect recollection, as was pointed out in the case of Saville Perfumery Ld. v. June Perfect Ld. (1941) 58 RPC 147 at 174-5, and one has to allow for cases where the person who has not get the two tins side by side perhaps does not remember the plaintiffs' name accurately, or does not know that there are two different traders in the same line of business, or many others for that matter, and takes a casual glance at the tin and imagines that it is the kind of fruit drops that he wants, not entirely casually, but looking at it in the ordinary way, that such a customer would go into a shop and see a pile of tins or something of that sort. Afterwards, of course, he may discover that they were not the ones he expected to get and he may raise objection, but it seems to me that it is a case of confusion if customers are induced to buy by a recollection of the general get-up of the 'plaintiffs' tin so that they purchase a tin of the defendants' sweets by mistake, and I am bound to say that I have come to the conclusion that such confusion is not only possible but is likely.\"\n",
        "p_71": "In the case reported in National Sewing Thread Company v. James Chadwick and Bros. ILR (1949) Mad 41 : (1948) 1 Mad LJ 303 : (AIR 1948 Mad 48 1) a Division Bench of this Court held that :-\n",
        "p_72": "  \"In a passing off action the plaintiff who alleges passing off must first establish that the public has grown accustomed to associate the particular name and label with him as the manufacturer or dealer in the articles. The resemblance between the articles complained of and his must be such as to induce an average man exercising ordinary caution to suppose that in buying the defendant's goods he is buying what has been manufactured by the plaintiff. In order to succeed in the action it is not enough for the plaintiff to show a mere possibility of deception. He must establish that there is a reasonable probability of purchasers being deceived. No general rule can be laid down as to what is or what is not a mere colourable variation. All that can be done is to ascertain in every case, as it occurs, whether there is such a resemblance as to induce an average man exercising ordinary caution to suppose that in buying the defendant's goods he is buying what has been manufactured by the plaintiff. While, on the one hand, it would be a mistake to suppose that the resemblance must be such as would deceive persons who could see the two marks side by side, it must, on the other hand, be remembered that the customer to whose views the Court will have regard must be one who, knowing what is fairly common to the trade, knows of the plaintiff's goods by reason of those distinguishing characteristics.\"\n",
        "p_73": "In the case reported in Corn Products Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food Products Ltd.  the Supreme Court held as follows : -\n",
        "p_74": "  The question whether two competing marks are sc similar as to be likely to deceive or cause, on fusion is one of the first impression and it is for the Court to decide it. The question has to be approached from the point of view of a man of average intelligence and .imperfect recollection. To such a man the overall structural and phonetic similarity of the two marks Gluvita and Gulcovita is likely to deceive or to cause confusion. Apart from the syllable \"co\" in the appellant company's mark, the two marks are identical, and that syllable is not such as would enable buyers in this country to distinguish between them.\"\n",
        "p_75": "25. As against these cases, defendant. relied upon the following decisions in support\n\n \n\nof his case : -\n",
        "p_76": "  In the case reported in Fitchetts Ld. v.  Loubet & Co. Ld. (1919) 36 RPC 296 the Chancery Division considered the marks \"Y-To\" and \"Lito\" and came to the conclusion that there is no probability of deception. In the case reported in Application by Thomas A. Smith Ltd. to register a trade mark 1913 RPC 363 the Chancery Division considered the trade marks \"Limit\" and \"Summit\" and held that the words are in common use, each conveying a perfectly definite idea and there is no possibility of anyone being deceived by the two marks. In the case reported in Off.  Cleaning Servs. v. Westminster Etc. Assoc.  (1944 (2) All ER 269) the Court of Appeal considered the names of \"Office Cleaning Service Ltd.\" and \"Westminster Office Cleaning Association\" and held that the differentiation between the words \"services\" and \"Association\" was sufficient to distinguish the defendants' business from that of the plaintiffs. In the case reported in Mount Mettur Pharmaceuticals (P) Ltd. v. Dr. S. A.  Wander  a Division Bench of this Court held that there was no similarity between the two trade marks'Asthmix' and 'Asmac' and that 'Asthmix' cannot be said to be an imitation of the trade mark 'Asmac'. In considering the above cases cited by the defendant it has to be noted that these cases arose at the time of registration of trade marks and objections were made by the interested parties at 'the time of registration of trade marks. Hence these cases cannot be applied to the present case because in the present case the plaintiff is the proprietor of the registered trade mark Eyetex when once registration had been effected the only remedy available to the defendant is to take proceeding,  for rectification under the provisions of the Act. The  registration in favour of plaintiff is prima facie valid till such proceedings are taken, and relief obtained Hence I have no hesitation in holding that the cases relied on by the defendant, which are the cases that arose at the time of registration of trade marks, cannot be applied to the present case, where already there is a registered trade mark and which mark is prima facie valid till it is set aside by appropriate' proceedings.\n",
        "p_77": "26. The principles to be applied to a case like this had been laid down by the Supreme Court in the case reported in F. Hoffamann La Roche & Co. Ltd. v. Geoffery Manners & Co. Pvt. Ltd., . The Supreme Court while considering the two trade marks \"Protovit\" and \"Dropovit\" observed as follows :-\n",
        "p_78": "  \"In order that a trade mark may be found deceptively similar to another it is not necessary that it should be intended to deceive or intended to cause confusion. It is its probable effect on the ordinary kind of customers that one has to consider. For this purpose it is necessary to apply both the visual and phonetic tests. It is also important that the marks should be compared as whole. It is not right to take a portion of the word and say that because that portion of the word differs from the corresponding portion of the word in the other case there is no sufficient similarity to cause confusion. The true test is whether the totality of the trade mark is such that it is likely to cause deception or confusion or mistake in the minds of the persons accustomed to the existing trade mark\".\n",
        "p_79": "In the case reported in Parle Products (P) Ltd. v. J. P. and Co., Mysore,  the Supreme Court observed as follows :\n",
        "p_80": "  \"In order to come to the conclusion whether one mark is deceptively similar to another the broad and essential features of the two are to be considered. They should not be placed side by side to find out if there are any differences in the design, and if so, whether they are of such character as to prevent one design from being mistaken for the other. It would be enough if the impugned mark bears such an overall similarity to the registered mark as would be likely to mislead a person, usually dealing with one to accept , the other if offered to him.\"\n",
        "p_81": "In the case reported in Lakshmi Narayan Karva v. Satyanarayan Khubchand \n\n \n\n a Division Bench of this Court observed as follows :-\n",
        "p_82": "  \"In judging whether a combination mark is distinctive or not it is wrong to dissect the mark and show that each of its component parts is not distinctive in itself and then as a, result of this process to conclude that the mark as a whole is not distinctive.\"\n",
        "p_83": "In view of the principles laid down in the' above decisions we cannot place the registered trade mark Eyetex along with the defendant's mark \"Rani Eyevix\" and the figures adopted in the carton side by side and then proceed to ascertain the difference in features and come to the conclusion as to whether there is a possibility of deception. The contention of the defendant that such a procedure should be adopted in this case will have to be negative in view of the principles laid down in the above decisions. What we have to consider is the overall aspects placing ourselves in the place of unwary purchaser. The prefix \"Rani\" to the defendant's mark is made in small letters which will not catch the eye of an unwary purchaser. So also the facial lines found in the defendant's mark on the carton will not readily catch the eye of an unwary purchaser. So far as the distinction in the cap by providing a crown will not attract the purchaser because it goes inside the carton. There is a phonetic similarity between \"Eyetex\" and \"Eyevix\". The design of the carton and the colours adopted also show that a deception is possible. No doubt there is difference in size of letters and the purchaser is not likely to remember the size of the letters. So far as the difference in the eye brows there is a difference in marks which~ cannot be remembered by the purchaser, If we consider the overall aspects, as pointed. out in the above decisions, it is clear that there is a phonetic similarity and other similarities which will likelv deceive an unwary purchaser. The dissimfliarity pointed out are not likely to be remembered by an unwary purchaser. Under the circumstances I have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the defendant's carton \"Rani 'Eyevix\" is an infringement of the plaintiff's registered trade mark Eyetex.\n",
        "p_84": "27. The next contention to be considered in this regard is the plea raised by the defendant that he had been adopting the trade mark ever since the year 1978 and the plaintiff who issued the notice Ex. P. 6 on 104-1980 had not taken any action to file a suit for a period of four years and as such the delay will amount to acquiescence and hence the plaintiff is not entitled to any relief. In support of this contention the following cases are relied upon : - In the case reported in B. M. Kharwar v. A. A. M. Motiwala Ltd., AIR 1939 Rangoon 98 it has been held that in a suit for infringement of trade mark if the defendants prove that the plaintiffs stood by knowingly and let them build up an important trade until it had become necessary to crush it, then the plaintiffs would be stopped by their acquiescence. The Court also observed, that acquiesence is one aspect of delay. Delay 1 will in itself, quite apart from acquiescence, be a bar to a suit, but only if such delay has, caused a change in the subject-matter of the action or brought about a state of things where justice cannot be done. In the case reported in Ciba Ltd. v. M. Ramalingam,  it has been held that the granting of relief under Section 46 of Trade Marks Act, 1940 is a discretionary relief and the Legislature has not laid down any period, of limitation for making an application under Section 46. The question of delay in (fie making of the application must be approached from this point of view whether the applicant stood by and thereby caused substantial injury to the respondent and the injury was so substantial that, that injury would outweigh the interest of the public which the Court must consider where a trade mark is likely to deceive. In the case reported in Lalsons Machines Pvt. Ltd. v. Sachar Electric and Machine Store, 1986 PTC 41 a single Judge of the Delhi High Court observed as follows : -\n",
        "p_85": "  \"Keeping in view the facts that there is a valid trade mark registered in the name of the plaintiff, its rights therefore, are to be protected during the pendency of the proceedings particularly when it is a case of triple identity where the mark used by the defendant is the same, the goods are the same and also the trade area. As regards the delay is concerned it is held that where the exclusive right is granted by registration to the holder of registered trade mark, the statutory right cannot be lost by delay.\"\n",
        "p_86": "The above principles can be applied to the facts of the present case since the notice Ex. P. 6 was issued in respect of the carton used by the defendant with the mark \"Eyevix\" only. According to P.W. I after the notice Ex. P. 6 the defendant stopped marketing the product in the carton with the mark \"Eyevix\" but prefixed the mark with the syllable \"Rani\" and began to market his products with the mark \"Rani Eyevix\". The case of P.W. 1 is that after the issue of Ex. P. 6 the defendant's product was not available in the market for some time and had reappearance only prior to the suit. Under the circumstances there is no proof adduced by the defendant that he had been adopting the marks for a considerable period. Further the defendant has not shown that by adopting the mark \"Rani Eyevix\" for considerable period he had made such progress in the business and that , if he is prevented from using such mark he will be put to irreparable loss. Hence the contention based upon the delay also will have to be negatived. On issue No. 3 1 hold that the defendant has infringed the plaintiff's trade mark and on issue No. 5, 1 hold that the plaintiff is entitled for the relief of injunction and accounting and other reliefs as prayed for in paragraph 19 of the plaint.\n",
        "p_87": "Issue No. 4 :\n",
        "p_88": "  Has the Defendant committed passing off by using Rani Eyevix?\n",
        "p_89": "28.  I have already concluded that the defendant had infringed the trade mark of the plaintiff \"Eyetex\". But the plaintiff has not let in any evidence regarding the extent of sales made by the defendant. Further the plaintiff has also not let in any evidence with reference to the damages though he prayed for such a relief in the plaint. In the absence of such evidence the plaintiff is not entitled to any relief in this regard. Hence I find Issue No. 4 against the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_90": "Issue No. 6 :\n",
        "p_91": "  To what relief, if any, is the plaintiff entitled?\n",
        "p_92": "29. In view of my findings on the above issues the plaintiff will be entitled to the injunction as prayed for.\n",
        "p_93": "30. In the result there will be an injunction restraining the defendant from marketing the product Kajal with the infringing trade mark \"Rani Eyevix\" in the carton marked as Ex.P.2. The defendant is also directed to surrender the cartons, labels and other printed materials containing the offending trade mark together with the blocks used for that purpose. The plaintiff is also entitled to the costs of the suit.\n",

Shri Ganga Bishan died in the year 1980 at the age of over 75 years. He must have been using this tradename for over 40 years before his death as claimed by the plaintiffs. \n",

Plaintiffs have placed on record copy of Certificate No. 137011 dated 27.1.1981 whereby this trademark \" Haldiram Bhujiawala\" (with the logo HRB in a particulars design) has been registered as No. 285062 w.e.f. 29.12.1972 in Class 30 for India except the State of West Bengal in the name of (1) Ganga Bishan @ Haldiram, (2) Mool Chand, (3) Shiv Krishan and (4) Kamla Devi trading under the name of \"Haldiram Bhujiawala\" and \"Chand Mal Ganga Bishan\", Bhujia Bazar, Bikaner.

The fact of their doing this business since 1983 at Delhi is not disputed by the defendants in their written statement. Plaintiff No. 2 is the fourth son of Mool Chand who has been registered as joint user with them. The Plaintiffs who are the successors in interest of late Ganga Bishan as well as of Mool Chand are thus the registered proprietors of this trademark having registration as from 29.12.1972. They are also prior user of the tradename and the trade mark in question in Territory other than Calcutta. Use or adoption of this trade mark by Rameshwar Lal as alleged even if it is from the year 1958 has been in Calcutta only as they have not been using the tradename or trademark in Delhi or rather beyond West Bengal. And by virtue of dissolution deed dated 16.11.1974, this trademark has been assigned exclusively to Shri Mool Chand for use in India except the State of West Bengal. Parties to this settlement and their successors in interest are bound by it. The defendant are thus bound by this settlement dated 16.11.1974 and as such they cannot claim any right contrary to its terms. The material placed on record also shows that the defendants have been using this trade mark in relation to their business primarily in Calcutta.

Prabhakar, Advocate, had also made the other Application (No. 330375) for registration of the trademark on behalf of Rameshwar Lal and Prabhu Shankar Aggarwal on 2.11.1977 it was within his knowledge about the respective rights of the parties in his trademark though in this application or even in reply dated 18.7.1978 he has not categorically disclosed and declared that the applicants were entitled to the use of the trademark and tradename in and not beyond the State of West Bengal, however , he intention obviously was to get the trademark registered for use in Calcutta only. Otherwise it would be a deliberate attempt on his part to have cancealed a material fact to obtain registration in the latter's name . The registrar has not appreciated it and has overlooked that Shri Rameshwar Lal and Prabhu Shankar had claimed registration for use in Calcutta only obviously ignored the application No. 285062 filed on 29.12.1972 for registration of this trade mark for India in names of four other persons already pending consideration and the trademark was registered (330375) vide certificate issued on 11.9.1980. Registration of trade mark on the basis of application (No. 285062) filed on 29.12.1972 is intriguing. There could not be two similar registered trademarks in respect of same goods operating simultaneously. Either the Registrar has been misled or the said Registration No. 330375 has been granted fraudulently and in collusion with the applicants. In respect of a registered trademark , the rights of the parties are to be determined as at the date of application. And Sec. 12(1) of the Act is bar against registered of an identical trademark which is already registered in the name of a different proprietor. Concurrent use by two or more persons of the same trademark for the same goods is completely contrary to the whole essence of trademark jurisprudence for a trademark is intended to denote that the goods come from one source and one source only. \n",

It appears that after the plaintiff came to know about the registration of this trademark in the name of the defendants/their predecessor, they lodged an opposition with the Registrar, Trade Mark.

The purpose behind Section 134(2) of Trademarks\n\nAct, 1999 is to ensure that the proprietor of a registered\n\ntrademark does not have to face the inconvenience and lost\n\nthat is involved in suing the infringers at the place of their\n\nresidence/business        when   he   happens   to   reside/carry\n\nbusiness at a place different from the place of the person\n\nwho owns the trademark.          It was realized that suing the\n\ninfringer at the place of his residence/business is likely to\n\ndiscourage legal action against infringement, particularly if\n\nthe infringers happen to be more than one and at different\n\nCS(OS)No.600/2007                                       Page 8 of 20\n places. I am in agreement with the learned counsel for the\n\nplaintiff that considering the purpose behind enactment of\n\nSection 134(2) of Trademarks Act, this provision needs to be\n\ngiven a liberal construction and, therefore, the expression\n\n\"carries on business\", used in the sub-Section needs to be\n\ngiven a wider amplitude as compared to the scope to be\n\ngiven to this expression in the context of Section 20 of the\n\nCode of Civil Procedure.     Moreover, if a company has an\n\noffice even if that to be a subordinate office within the\n\njurisdiction of a Court, it would be difficult to dispute that\n\nthe company carried on its business at that place as well. A\n\ncompany may carry on business at more than one places\n\nand one of those places may be where it has a subordinate\n\noffice.    Establishing and maintaining a subordinate office\n\nbeing a part of running the business of a corporation, it\n\nwould be difficult to say that a company does not carry out\n\na business at a place where it has a subordinate or a\n\nsubsidiary office.   The plaintiff company not only had an\n\noffice in Delhi at the time this suit was filed, issue of\n\ninvoices from Delhi office of its subsidiary clearly shows that\n\nit is actually carrying business from its Delhi office as well.

Referring to the decision of Supreme Court in\n\nDodha House vs. S.K.

The defendants in\n\nthat suit had applied for registration of the trade mark\n\n'Jawahar' in Delhi and the application was advertised in\n\nTrade Mark Journal. On evidence, it was found that there\n\nwas no sale of the products of the defendants in Delhi and\n\nthe defendants had not advertised their products in Delhi.\n\nThere was an advertisement of the products of the\n\ndefendant in Journal published in Ludhiana.

It was\n\nfurther held that since the plaintiffs had learnt that the\n\ndefendants had applied for registration of trade mark in\n\nDelhi, they could claim for injunction to prevent any sale of\n\nthe infringing products in Delhi and in that case, Delhi\n\nCourts would have jurisdiction, whether any sale in Delhi\n\nhas taken place or not.\n",

This Court was of the view that the decision in\n\nJawahar Engineering (supra), was not disapproved by\n\nSupreme Court in Dodha House (supra).         In taking this\n\nview, this Court took note of the fact that in the case of\n\nDodha House (supra), Supreme Court had noted that that\n\nno application had been filed for registration of the trade\n\nmark whereas in the case of P.M.Diesels, the parties were\n\nresidents of Rajkot and the application for registration had\n\nCS(OS)No.600/2007                                  Page 13 of 20\n been field in Bombay. This Court, therefore, concluded that\n\nthis was not the ratio of Supreme Court decision in Dhodha\n\nHouse (supra) that the filing of an application with the\n\nRegistrar of Trade Marks, at a particular place would not\n\nclothe the courts at that place with territorial jurisdiction to\n\nentertain the matter.         The ratio of the Supreme Court\n\ndecision in Dhodha House (supra), in the opinion of this\n\nCourt, was that an advertisement by itself in a Trade Mark\n\nJournal would not confer jurisdiction on a Court within\n\nwhose territorial limit the advertisement is published or is\n\nseen.     In the opinion of this Court, if an application for\n\nregistration of the impugned trade mark is made in the\n\nterritorial jurisdiction of a Court that Court would have\n\njurisdiction to try the suit relating to the particular trade\n\nmark. Since defendants applied for registration of the trade\n\nmark to the Registrar of Trade Marks at Delhi, as is evident\n\nfrom the advertisement, this Court would have jurisdiction\n\nto try the present suit.\n",

The similarity between the two marks can be\n\nphonetic, visual, structural or otherwise. In fact any clever\n\nperson seeking to encash upon the reputation and goodwill\n\nof an established brand would not adopt that mark in toto\n\nand would make some changes here and there so that in the\n\nevent of his mark being challenged in the Court, he may\n\ntake the plea that the mark adopted by him is not identical\n\nto the mark of the plaintiff. Hence, what the Court is called\n\nupon to examine is whether the trademark used or\n\nproposed       to   be   used   by    the   defendant   is    visually,\n\nphonetically, structurally or otherwise so similar to the\n\ntrademark of the plaintiff that it can be said to be\n\ndeceptively similar mark.            It is difficult to dispute that\n\nphonetically and structurally, the mark L'OREAL and\n\nTORREAL are similar. The first difference in the two marks\n\nare that the first letter in the mark of the defendant is \"T\" as\n\nagainst \"L\" in the mark of the plaintiff and the defendant\n\nCS(OS)No.600/2007                                            Page 18 of 20\n has used two \"R\" in the word TORREAL whereas the\n\nplaintiff has used only one \"R\" in L'OREAL.                       Another\n\ndissimilarity is that (') has been used by the plaintiff after\n\nthe letter \"L\" in the mark L'OREAL whereas the defendant\n\nhas used it after letter \"T\" in the mark TORREAL.                     These\n\ndissimilarities, to my mind, are rather insignificant and\n\ntrivial in nature, when weighed against the striking phonetic\n\nand structural similarities between the marks L'OREAL and\n\nTORREAL.               Therefore, in my view, use of the mark\n\nTORREAL by the defendant, for sale of the similar products\n\nwhich the plaintiff company is selling under the brand name\n\nL'OREAL would constitute infringement and, therefore, the\n\nplaintiff    is        entitled    to   an   injunction   restraining     the\n\ndefendant from using the aforesaid mark.\n",

The learned single Judge, while observing that the sales by the\n\nappellants / defendants of their product \"STRETCH NIL SKINCLINIQ\"\n\nsince 1999 could not be doubted, held against them and in favour of the\n\nrespondents / plaintiffs.

Initially, the entire order passed by the learned single Judge on\n\n09.04.2009 was the subject matter of challenge, including his decision on the\n\napplication under Section 124(1)(ii) of the said Act. It had been contended\n\nby Mr Sudhir Chandra, the learned senior counsel, appearing on behalf of\n\nthe appellants / defendants that Section 124 was not applicable inasmuch as\n\nthe appellants / defendants had not taken the defence available under Section\n\n30(2)(e) of the said Act nor had the appellants / defendants considered the\n\nrespondents\u201f / plaintiffs\u201f registration and the only plea taken was that the\n\ntrademarks were completely different. This contention was repelled by\n\nMr Sandeep Sethi, the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\n\nFAO (OS) 222/09                                                       Page 7 of 19\n respondents. However, in the course of the arguments, the said learned\n\ncounsel agreed that the Section 124 issue be not gone into in this appeal and\n\nthe same be considered only from the standpoint of injunction.              It is,\n\ntherefore, to be seen as to whether the respondents have been able to make\n\nout a prima facie case of injunction for an infringement action under Section\n\n29 of the said Act or not. It is obvious that if we are to examine the question\n\nof grant of injunction de hors the issue pertaining to Section 124 of the said\n\nAct, it will have to be presumed that the appellants\u201f / defendants\u201f mark\n\n\u201eSKINCLINIQ\u201f is unregistered.          Because if we do not so presume,\n\nconsiderations under Section 28(3) as also those arising under Section\n\n30(2)(e) of the said Act would have to be gone into. But, that cannot be\n\ndone because Mr Sudhir Chandra himself pointed out that the appellants /\n\ndefendants had not taken the defence of Section 30(2)(e). In any event, the\n\narguments have been addressed only on the question of deceptive similarity\n\nbetween the marks of the contesting parties in the context of section 29(1)\n\nwhich reads as under:-\n",

        "p_24": "12.          In this context, Mr Sudhir Chandra submitted that the marks\n\n\u201eSKINCLINIQ\u201f and \u201eCLINIQUE\u201f are neither identical, nor deceptively\n\nsimilar and that they are used in relation to different products.           The\n\nappellants / defendants use the said mark in respect of their Ayurvedic herbal\n\nproduct known as \u201eSKINCLINIQ STRECH NIL\u201f, which is used for\n\nremoving stretch marks acquired during pregnancy. \u201eCLINIQUE\u201f on the\n\nother hand, is not an Ayurvedic herbal product, though it is used for cosmetic\n\ncreams, lotions etc. Furthermore, Mr Sudhir Chandra pointed out that the\n\nprice differential between the products of the appellants / defendants and\n\nthose of the respondents / plaintiffs is so vast as to remove any possibility of\n\nconfusion between the customers. 100 ml. of the appellants\u201f / defendants\u201f\n\nproduct sells for Rs 245/-, whereas 15 ml and 75 ml of the respondents\u201f /\n\nplaintiffs\u201f products sell for Rs 1,200/- and Rs 1950 respectively.

Mr\n\nSudhir Chandra submitted that when the trademarks, which are to be\n\ncompared, are not identical, then the test of deceptive similarity that would\n\nhave to be employed in a case of infringement would be the same as that in a\n\ncase of passing off. He submitted that employing those tests, it cannot be\n\nsaid that the appellants\u201f / defendants\u201f trademark \u201eSKINCLINIQ\u201f is\n\ndeceptively similar to the respondents\u201f / plaintiffs\u201f trademarks \u201eCLINIQUE\u201f.\n\n\n",

But, the use of the words \u201eRUSTAM\n\nINDIA\u201f was not an infringement because the appellant\u201fs engines were\n\n\n\nFAO (OS) 222/09                                                     Page 11 of 19\n manufactured in England and the respondent\u201fs engines were manufactured\n\nin India and that the use of the suffix \u201eINDIA\u201f would be a sufficient warning\n\nthat the engine sold was not a \u201eRUSTON\u201f engine manufactured in England.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court held that the mark \u201eRUSTON\u201f had been\n\ninfringed not only by the use of \u201eRUSTAM\u201f, but also by the mark\n\n\u201eRUSTAM INDIA\u201f. The Supreme Court felt that the word \u201eRUSTAM\u201f was\n\ndeceptively similar to the word \u201eRUSTON\u201f and that the fact that the word\n\n\u201eINDIA\u201f was added to the respondent\u201fs trademark was of no consequence\n\nand the appellant was entitled to succeed in its action for infringement of the\n\ntrademark. While coming to this conclusion, the Supreme Court succinctly\n\nbrought out the distinction between an infringement action and a passing off\n\naction. It observed that in a passing off action, the issue is whether the\n\ndefendant is selling goods so marked as to be designed or calculated to lead\n\nthe purchasers to believe that they are the plaintiff\u201fs goods. However, in an\n\ninfringement action, the question is whether the defendant is using a mark\n\nwhich is the same as or which is a colourable imitation of the plaintiff\u201fs\n\nregistered trademark. The Supreme Court observed:-\n\n\n",

A Division Bench of this court held\n\nthat the essential feature of the registered trademark was the word\n\n\u201eQUILLA\u201f and, therefore, the mark \u201eHARA QUILLA\u201f was found to be\n\ndeceptively similar to the registered trademark \u201eLAL QUILLA\u201f.

        "p_39": "23.          It is in this backdrop that we have to compare the marks of the\n\nappellants and those of the respondents.         The respondents\u201f registered\n\ntrademark is \u201eCLINIQUE\u201f. It also has other registered trademarks which all\n\ninclude the word \u201eCLINIQUE\u201f. \u201eCLINIQUE\u201f is a French word for the\n\nEnglish word \u201eClinic\u201f.      Both are pronounced differently.    \u201eCLINIC\u201f is\n\npronounced as \u201eKLINIK\u201f and \u201eCLINIQUE\u201f is pronounced as \"KLINECK\".\n\n\"CLINIQUE\" is the most important constituent of the respondents\u201f family of\n\ntrademarks.       The question is, whether the mark of the appellants -\n\n\"SKINCLINIQ\" is deceptively similar to \u201eCLINIQUE\u201f or not?                It is\n\napparent, as already pointed out above, that \"CLINIQUE\" and\n\n\"SKINCLINIQ\" are not identical marks. The question, therefore, is to find\n\nout as to whether they are deceptively similar or not and this question has to\n\nbe approached from the point of view of a man with an average intelligence\n\nand an imperfect recollection.          In comparing \u201eCLINIQUE\u201f with\n\n\u201eSKINCLINIQ\u201f, what has to be borne in mind is the overall structural and\n\nphonetic similarity of the two marks and the marks cannot be separated into\n\ntheir components. Consequently, we have to take the mark \u201eSKINCLINIQ\u201f\n\nas a whole in comparison with the respondents\u201f registered mark\n\n\u201eCLINIQUE\u201f. When we do that, we do not find any overall structural or\n\nphonetic similarity. We cannot separate the mark \u201eSKINCLINIQ\u201f into its\n\ncomponent parts \u201eSKIN\u201f and \u201eCLINIQ\u201f and then compare the component\n\n\nFAO (OS) 222/09                                                    Page 17 of 19\n \u201eCLINIQ\u201f with the respondents mark \u201eCLINIQUE\u201f. If such a splitting up\n\ncannot be done, then we do not see any phonetic, visual or overall structural\n\nsimilarity in the two marks, \u201eCLINIQUE\u201f and \u201eSKINCLINIQ\u201f, so as to\n\nreach to the conclusion that \u201eSKINCLINIQ\u201f is deceptively similar to\n\n\u201eCLINIQUE\u201f. The word \u201eclinic\u201f by itself means a place where some kind of\n\ntreatment is provided.     So, perhaps, it could be said that the word\n\n\u201eCLINIQUE\u201f conveys the idea of some kind of treatment. To a certain\n\nextent, it may be said that the mark \u201eCLINIQUE\u201f and the mark\n\n\u201eSKINCLINIQ\u201f do convey a common idea of treatment.              However, as\n\npointed out above, while comparing the marks, we have to examine not only\n\nthe commonness of the idea between the two marks, but also the overall\n\nvisual, structural and phonetic similarity of the marks. Taking an overall\n\nview of the marks, we feel that a person of average intelligence and\n\nimperfect recollection would not be deceived by the mark \u201eSKINCLINIQ\u201f\n\ninto believing that it is, in fact, the mark \u201eCLINIQUE\u201f. We feel that the\n\nlearned single judge fell into error in splitting the appellants\u201f mark\n\n\"SKINCLINIQ\u201f into \u201eSKIN\u201f and \u201eCLINIQ\u201f and in then comparing the latter\n\ncomponent (CLINIQ) with the respondents\u201f mark \u201eCLINIQUE\u201f. Had the\n\nappellants\u201f mark been only \u201eCLINIQ\u201f then, perhaps, it could be said that it is\n\ndeceptively similar to the respondents\u201f mark \u201eCLINIQUE\u201f. However, the\n\nappellants\u201f mark is not just \u201eCLINIQ\u201f but \u201eSKINCLINIQ\u201f, which is one\n\nword and not two separate words as in Rustam\u201fs case and Cleanzo\u201fs case.\n\n\n\n\nFAO (OS) 222/09                                                    Page 18 of 19\n",

Another important circumstance is that the price differential\n\nbetween the two products is so vast that no consumer of products of either\n\nthe appellant or the respondent would confuse one for the other.             We,\n\ntherefore, do not agree with the conclusion arrived at by the learned single\n\nJudge that, prima facie, a case of infringement has been made out.

The defendants have not denied the fact\nthat the plaintiff is conducting the classes in the arena of scientific research\ntraining and knowledge and it is also providing education, consultancy\nservices and various educational programmes pertaining to aerospace\nindustry in the form of speeches, discussions, seminars, etc. However, the\nonly submission of the defendants is that the plaintiff is using the name\nBRAHMAND in relation to that educational purposes and not the trademark\nBRAHMOS.\n",

The plaintiff has also doubted the credibility of reporting of Wikipedia\nand states that the said document is not a reliable document and the\nstatement made therein seems to be incorrect. In any case, it is argued that\nBRAHMOS is a well-known mark within the meaning of Section 2(1)(zg) of\nthe Trade Marks Act, 1999 which has never been used by any person in\nIndia rather it has been protected by the Courts from time to time.\n",

In order to understand the arguments of the parties, one has to read the\ndefinition of the \"mark\" and the \"trademark\" under Sections 2(1)(m) and\n2(zb) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 together.          In Section 2(1)(m), the\nmeaning of the \"mark\" includes the name and word and/or any combination\nthereof. Similarly, as per Section 2(zb), the \"trademark\" means, if the same\nis used in relation to goods or services for the purposes of indicating or so as\nto indicate a connection in the course of trade between the goods or services,\nas the case may be, and some person having the right as proprietor to use the\nmark.\n",

Patel\nvs. Chetanbhat Shah And Another, a judgment delivered by the Supreme\nCourt, reported in (2002) 3 SCC 65, wherein the Apex Court while\nconsidering a plea of passing off and grant of ad interim injunction held in\nno uncertain terms that a person may sell his goods or deliver his services\nunder a trading name or style which, with the passage of time, may acquire a\nreputation or goodwill and may become a property to be protected by the\nCourts. It was held that a competitor initiating sale of goods or services in\nthe same name or by imitating that name causes injury to the business of one\nwho has the property in that name. It was held that honesty and fair play are\nand ought to be the basic policy in the world of business and when a person\nadopts or intends to adopt a name which already belongs to someone else, it\nresults in confusion, has the propensity of diverting the customers and\nclients of someone else to himself and thereby resulting in injury.

It is not the case of the defendants that even any caste or sect is not\nprotectable under the law of passing off and that is rightly so because under\nthe Scheme of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, the name, caste or any word or\nmark can be registered or protected under the law if a case of infringement\nof trademark and passing off is made out. In the present case, admittedly,\nthe plaintiff is the prior adopter and user of the trademark BRAHMOS\nwhich is not a dictionary word and the same is allegedly coined by the\nplaintiff itself.

It has acquired a\ngreat goodwill and reputation in India and abroad in respect of supersonic\nmissile in aerospace industry, coupled with the fact that the said trademark\nBRAHMOS is also a dominant part of the corporate name of the plaintiff\nand the educational programmes pertaining to aerospace industry being\nprovided by the plaintiff. It might be possible that the plaintiff has also\nobtained the domain name www.brahmand.com but it is also not denied that\nthe plaintiff has obtained the domain name www.brahmos.com.                   The\nplaintiff has rightly pointed out that in case the website www.brahmos.com\nis opened, the entire history of the plaintiff as well as the defendant can be\ngathered while opening the \"Google search page\".\n",

As far as the argument of the defendants is concerned that the\ndefendants' main trademark is FIIT JEE and they are using the name\nBRAHMOS in order to indicate the connection in the course of the trade, is\nconcerned, Mr.Chaudhary, learned counsel for the plaintiff has rightly\npointed out various pages of the document file of the plaintiff which show\nthe advertisement of the mark BRAHMOS by the defendant. The mark\nBRAHMOS has been used by the defendant in prominent manner, though it\ncannot be denied that the umbrella mark of the defendant is FIIT JEE.\n",

The similar situation in this regard came upon before a Division\nBench of this Court in the case of Jagan Nath Prem Nath vs. Bhartiya\nDhoop Karyalaya reported in AIR 1975 Delhi 149. The facts of this case\nare that the plaintiff filed a suit for permanent injunction against the\ndefendant for infringement and passing off of his registered trademark\ncontaining numeral '555' in respect of Agarbatis.           The defendant's\ntrademark was totally different, i.e. RAJKAMAL which was registered\n\n\n\nI.A.

However, the defendant started using the numeral '555' on its\nproduct.    Although, the numeral '555' did not appear in its registered\ntrademark RAJKAMAL, the case of the plaintiff was that numeral '555' was\nadded deliberately. The case of the defendant before the Court was that it\nhas added the numeral '555' bonafidely in order to denote superior quality\nof its products.      It was also stated that the defendant has applied for\ncancellation of the registered trademark of the plaintiff by deleting the\nnumeral '555' from the product of the plaintiff. The learned Single Judge in\nthis case did not grant the injunction order while accepting the plea of the\ndefendant. However, an appeal was filed before the Division Bench of this\nCourt which was allowed and the interim injunction was passed against the\ndefendant restraining it from using the numeral '555' on its carton in respect\nof agarbatis, mainly, on the reason that the plaintiff is holding the\nregistration of the trademark, numeral '555' along with their main mark and\nby adding of this numeral '555', the case of infringement under Sections\n28(1) & 29 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 is made out by the plaintiff. The\nDivision Bench has come to the conclusion that by the use of the numeral\n'555' by the defendant in order to denote its superior quality of goods, even\nthe two trademarks have become deceptively similar.\n",
        "p_30": "29.    In order to establish infringement, the main ingredients of Section 29\nare that the plaintiff's mark must be registered under the Act; the defendant's\nmark is identical with or deceptively similar to the registered trade mark; and\nthe defendant's use of the mark is in the course of trade in respect of the\ngoods covered by the registered trade mark.

In\nan infringement action, once a mark is used as indicating commercial origin\nby the defendant, no amount of added matter intended to show the true\norigin of the goods can effect the question. If Court finds that the\ndefendant's mark is closely, visually and phonetically similar, even then no\nfurther proof is necessary. It is not necessary for the plaintiff to adduce\nevidence of actual deception in order to prove the case of infringement. If\npackaging of two products is different in an action of infringement, the same\nis immaterial. Its validity cannot be challenged in the infringement\nproceedings under the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. (See Corn\nProducts Refining Co. vs. Shangrila Food Products Ltd.

        "p_31": "30.    Even if a word forming part of the mark has come in trade to be used\nto identify the goods of the owner of the trade mark, it is an infringement of\nthe mark itself to use that word as the mark or part of the mark of another\ntrader for which confusion is likely to result. The likelihood of confusion or\ndeception in such cases is not disproved by placing the two marks side by\nside and demonstrating how small is the chance of error in any customer\nwho places his order for goods with both the marks clearly before him, for\norders are placed, or are often not placed, under such conditions.

Despite of infringement of trademark and passing off in the present\nmatter, there is another aspect of the matter as to whether the trademark\nBRAHMOS of the plaintiff is well-known trademark as alleged in the plaint.\nIn this regard, it is necessary to examine the definition of Section 2(1)(zg) of\nthe Trade Marks Act, 1999 which reads as under:-\n",

        "p_35": "34.    Now, it is to be considered, as to whether the trademark BRAHMOS\ncomes within the meaning of \"well-known trademark\". It is an undisputed\nfact that the trademark BRAHMOS is a registered trademark which is\nassociated in the substantial segment of public as the same is being used for\nsupersonic missile in the aerospace industry. The said trademark is being\nused in relation to the goods and the same also come within the definition of\nSections 2(1)(m) and 2(1)(zg) being a registered trademark in the course of\ntrade and it has been protected by the Courts in earlier proceedings.

Assuming the submission of the defendants is accepted that the two\nset of activities are different, even then the case of infringement of\ntrademark is made out against the defendants.         The argument of the\ndefendants is also totally frivolous when it is argued that the defendants are\nnot using the mark BRAHMOS as a trademark and it is being used by the\ndefendants to indicate a connection in the course of trade with the\ndefendants. In case the advertisements of the defendants appearing in the\nnewspapers are seen, it appears that the mark BRAHMOS has been used\nprominently despite of the fact that FIIT JEE is an umbrella mark of the\ndefendants.

The trademark 'DAAWAT' is stated to be adopted by the predecessor-in-interest of the plaintiff but by virtue of an agreement dated 26.03.1999 the rights were taken by the plaintiff for valuable consideration. The business is stated to be carried to under the said trademark for the last 14 years and the sale is not only in India but even in abroad.\n",

The style of the writing of the word 'DAVAT' is stated to have been copied from the artistic work of thplaintiff bearing the trademark 'DAAWAT'. The defendant is alleged to have been a distributor/selling agent of the plaintiff and thus has full knowledge of goodwill and reputation of the trademark of the plaintiff. The product rice is also state do be such which is sold of the counter.\n",
        "p_6": "5. It is in view of the aforesaid circumstances, a decree of permanent injunction has been sought for restraining the defendants from using the trademark 'DAVAT' or any other trademark which may identical or deceptively similar to the trademark 'DAAAT' of the plaintiff. The plaintiff has also sought injunction against the defendants from infringing their copyright in the artistic work 'DAAWAT' and from passing off the product of the defendants as that of the plaintiff. The plaintiff has requested for an order of destruction of all the materials having the trademark 'DAVAT' and have sought rendition of accounts of the profits made by the defendants which have been estimated at Rs. 50 lakhs.\n",

Defendant No. 2, however, in its written statement have alleged that they have adopted the trademark 'DAVAT' in the year 1988 and the application for the registration of the trademark is pending before the Registrar of Trademarks, Mumbai. Defendant No. 2 claims prior user of trademark 'DAVAT'.\n",

The witness has confirmed the averments made in the plaint and has proved the various documents to show acquisition of rights by the plaintiff in the trademark 'DAAWAT' by proving the assignment deed dated 25.07.2003 which is exhibited as P-3. The sales have been proved through copies of invoices which are collectively exhibited as P-4 and the sample of the trademark 'DAAWAT' filed with the plaint has been proved as exhibit P-5.\n",

A consideration of the aforesaid facts show that there is phonetic similarity between 'DAAWAT' and 'DAVAT' in respect of the product rice which is traded of the counter. This phonetic similarity is of such a kind that a normal customer is likely to be deceived into purchasing the product of defendant on the assumption that it is of the plaintiff. The plaintiff has a proprietary right in the trademark 'DAAWAT' and the fact that defendant No. 1 was the agent of the plaintiff shows it is an obvious attempt on the part of the defendants, who have full knowledge of the goodwill of the plaintiff to utilise the name of the plaintiff in an illegal manner. The plaintiff has filed details showing sale running into crores apart from substantial expenses on advertisement.

The plaintiff does not have access to the books of accounts of the defendants but the fact that the defendants have sold the goods under the trademark 'DAVAT' is itself sufficient to establish that loss has been caused to the plaintiff. The defendants themselves states that they have been trading under the trademark 'DAVAT'. The plaintiff claims a token damages and compensation of Rs. 5 lakhs as it isot possible to determine the exact nature of damages. Learned counsel in this behalf has referred to the judgment of the learned Single Judge of this Court in Relaxo Rubber Limited and Anr. v. Selection Footwear and Anr. 1999 PTC (19) 578, dealing with suca situation. That was a case with a similar position where the defendant did not file the written statement after taking time for the same and a decree was being passed under Order 8 Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.

        "p_12": "(viii) That the defendants were aware of the plaintiffs' trademark and copyright and deliberately with a dishonest and mala fide intention adopted the plaintiffs' registered trademark only to trade upon the plaintiffs' hard-earned reputation and to earn profits in an illegal manner for which they are not entitled. That the confusion and deception is inevitable among public and trade due to close deceptive similarity of trademarks and the defendants are, therefore, guilty of passing of their inferior and sub-standard products for the quality products of the plaintiffs.\n",
        "p_13": "(ix) That on account of defendant's unlawful and unjust trade activities, the plaintiff has suffered damages to the well-known and well-established trade and further damage to the trade and reputation is inevitable unless the defendants are restrained by way of an injunction order from infringing the plaintiff's registered trademark and copyright.\n",
        "p_14": "(x) That the goods of the defendant are available for sale in Delhi and plaintiff has purchased one of the product of the defendant from the Delhi market. That the defendant-Company is carrying on their business of marketing and manufacturing the khaini/chewing tobacco under the trademark and label \"22\" in Delhi and, therefore, this Court has jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiffs suit. That since both the parties to the suit are working for gain at Delhi, the goods of the parties are available for sale in Delhi and the appropriate Trade Mark Registry is situated at Delhi, therefore, this Court has the jurisdiction to try the suit. That the jurisdiction of this Court is further attracted under Section 62(2) of the Indian Copyright Act, 1957.\n",
        "p_15": "4. The learned counsel for the plaintiff relies upon the judgments reported as  K. Krishna Chettiar Vs  Ambal & Co. ;  Ruston & Hornby Ltd. Vs  Zamindara Engineering Co. ;  Hitachi Ltd. Vs  Ajay Kr. Agarwal 1996 PTC 262 and  Corn Products Vs  Shangrila Food Products .\n",
        "p_16": "5. Accordingly the learned counsel for plaintiff-Company has submitted that the plaintiff has prima facie the strongest case for continuance of interim order in its favor and against the defendant-Company.\n",
        "p_17": "6. In reply the defendant-Company has set up the following case:-\n",
        "p_18": "(i) That the defendant is the proprietor of trade mark BANSAL KHAINI TOBACCO No.22 Label in relation to chewing tobacco on account of its prior honest adoption in the year 1974 and continuous user thereafter. Its items cannot be manufactured or sold without obtaining excise license which the defendant has duly obtained.\n",
        "p_19": "(ii) That the plaintiff has not filed any documentary evidence in support of its claims to have used the trade mark \"22\" in respect of chewing tobacco and smoking tobacco.\n",
        "p_20": "(iii) That moreover the plaintiff's registered mark \"22\" Label exists only in respect of Bidis and Safety Matches. In sum and substance the defendant states that the plaintiff has no user and registration of trade mark \"22\" in so far as chewing tobacco is concerned. And that to avail the remedy of infringement, the onus is on the plaintiff-Company to prove how and in what manner the defendant-Company is using the trademark in respect of the items for which the plaintiff holds registration. Moreover it is the defendant's contention that the right for trademark registration extends only to those items for which the mark is registered as is apparent from the definition of Section 28(1) of the Trademark & Merchandise Act which reads as follows:-\n",
        "p_21": " \"28. Rights conferred by registration.-(1) Subject to the other provisions of this Act, the registration of a trade mark in Part A or Part B of the register shall, if valid, give to the registered proprietor of the trade mark the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation to the goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered and to obtain relief in respect of infringement of the trade mark in the manner provided by this Act.\"\n",
        "p_22": "That the phraseology of the above Section gives support to the defendant's case that the exclusive rights for trademark is extended only to those items for which the trademark is registered.\n",
        "p_23": "(iv) That the plaintiff has no right to press for the infringement remedy against the defendant, who is using the trademark \"BANSAL KHAINI TOBACCO No.22 Label\" in relation to chewing tobacco in view of the fact that the plaintiff-Company holds the valid registration for the mark 22 only in relation to Bidis and Safety Matches.\n",
        "p_24": "(v) Reliance has been placed upon the various decisions in  Vishnu Das Vs  Vazir Sultan Tobacco Co., Ltd., reported as 1996 PTC 512;  Roshan Lal Oil Mills Ltd. Vs  Assam Company Ltd. reported as 1996 PTC 699 &  United Brothers Vs  United Traders reported as 1997 PTC 603 to contend that the plaintiff cannot hold any monopoly for trade mark \"22\" in relation to chewing tobacco.\n",
        "p_25": "(vi) That it is entitled to the benefit of honest concurrent user of mark \"BANSAL KHAINI TOBACCO No.22 Label\" in relation to chewing tobacco since 1974 onwards as it has placed on record cogent and sufficient documentary evidence in support of its claim.\n",
        "p_26": "(vii) Reliance has also been placed upon decisions reported as  Gopal Engineering Vs  POMX Laboratories AIR 1992 Delhi 302;  Amritdhara Pharmacy Vs  Saya Deo Gupta ;  Kores (India) Ltd.

Ltd. 1988 PTC 82 &  Hindustan Pencils Vs  Aptadet Industries 1991 PTC 204 to contend that the Courts in the above said decisions have recognised proprietory rights and right to use the mark in case the plea of honest concurrent user is established.\n",

        "p_28": "(ix) That the chewing tobacco of the defendant under the above said mark is distributed only in the State of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal and thus this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate the present suit.\n",
        "p_29": "(x) That the defendant-Company has been continuously using their mark/label \"22\" since 1974 in a distinctive get up and in an artistic way and if the same is compared as a whole it is absolutely different from that of the plaintiff and moreover use of the mark is confined to the States of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal resulting into negligible possibility of confusion and deception. No instance of any confusion or deception have ever been reported.\n",
        "p_30": "7. The counsel for the defendant in view of the above submissions has prayed for vacation of the interim order dated 18th March, 1998.\n",
        "p_31": "8. Upon going through the record and on the perusal of the plaint I find that the plaintiff has secured registration for the mark 'Bansal Khaini Tobacco No.22' for the State of U.P. since 1990. There is also no registration secured by the plaintiff for chewing tobacco. Significantly the product being made by the defendant, i.e., 'chewing tobacco' is different from the plaintiff's product, i.e., Bidis and Matches. The plaintiff is not producing this product nor has the plaintiff averred and demonstrated that it has intention to produce the same. The plaint is founded mainly on the plea that chewing tobacco belongs to the same class of goods, i.e., 34 of the 4th Schedule. 'Bansal Khaini' is written at the top of the defendant's mark whereas the plaintiff's mark stands out for the use of the numerals '22'. There is red background with gold border with a screen of dark blue in the plaintiff's mark. The defendant's mark is only in light shades of blue and white. Various judgments have been cited by the counsel for both the parties having a bearing on the issues raised as recapitulated in the later part of this judgment. However, in view of my findings on honest concurrent user, I am considering in this judgment the applicability of only those judgments which have a bearing on the issue of honest concurrent user by the defendant.\n",
        "p_32": "9. The cases relied upon by the plaintiff are as follows:\n",
        "p_33": "(i) K.Krishna Chettiar Vs Ambal & Co. \n",
        "p_34": "In the above case the common product of both the plaintiff and defendant was snuff and Andal was held to be phonetically similar to Ambal. Injunction was granted. This decision may have had some bearing on the present case but in view of my findings on honest concurrent user by the defendant it is not necessary to consider the effect of this decision at this stage.\n",
        "p_35": "(ii) Ruston & Hornby Ltd. Vs Zamindara Engineering Co.\n",
        "p_36": "The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the above judgment held that in an action for infringement if the trade mark is identical, there is no enquiry necessary to determine the possible confusion and injunction is to be granted. The Court also held that only if the mark is similar and not same, tests relating to passing off action have to be applied. In above case the plaintiff was a registered proprietor of 'Ruston' for internal combustion engines and the defendant who was selling and manufacturing diesel internal combustion engines by the name of Rustam India was injuncted because the Court held that the mark 'Rustam' was deceptively similar to the mark 'Ruston' and addition of the word 'India' was of no avail. This decision may be relevant for the other issues but in view of my findings on honest concurrent user by the defendant it is not necessary to consider at this stage the import of this decision.\n",
        "p_37": "(iii) Hitachi Ltd. Vs Ajay Kr. Agarwal 1996 PTC 262\n \n\nIn the above case, the Court held that there was a phonetic similarity between the word 'Hitachi' and the word 'Hitaishi'. This was the case of a registered proprietor and the case arose from manufacture of sound amplifiers systems which sound amplifiers were also being made by the defendant. In such a situation the injunction was granted. This decision may have had some relevance but in view of my findings on honest concurrent user by the defendant it is not necessary to consider at the interim stage, the applicability of this decision to the present case.\n",
        "p_38": "(iv) Corn Products Vs Shangrila Food Products \n \n\nIn the above decision, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that reputation is of the trade mark and not of the maker of goods and the presence of a trade mark in the Register does not ipso facto prove the user thereof and the Court further held that the similarity between the competing products has to be adjudged from the point of view of a man of average intelligence and imperfect recollection. In the aforesaid case the appellant was manufacturing glucose with vitamins and the product was called Glucovita. Plaintiff sought to manufacture biscuits by the name of Gluvita. The Court held that plaintiff was entitled to an injunction and it was held that there was trade connections between different goods likely to cause confusion between competing goods particularly when the competing goods closely resembled each other.\n",
        "p_39": "Para 20 of the said judgment reads as follows:-\n",
        "p_40": " \"It is true that in both the abovementioned cases the two competing trade marks were absolutely identical which is not the case here. But that in our opinion makes no difference. the absoute identity of the two competing marks or their close resemblance is only one of the tests for determining the question of likelihood of deception or confusion. Trade connection, between different goods is another such test. Ex hypothesi, this latter test applies only when the goods are different. These tests are independent tests. There is no reason why the test of trade connection between different goods should not apply where the competing goods closely resemble each other just as much as it applies, as held in the \"Black Magic\" and \"Panda\" cases, where the competing marks were identical. Whether by applying these tests in a particular case the conclusion that there is likelihood of deception or confusion should be arrived at would depend on all the facts of the case.\"\n",
        "p_41": "Even though the above judgment may otherwise have had bearing on the issue at hand, I am satisfied that on the view I am taking on the plea of the honest concurrent user by the defendant, the applicability or otherwise of this judgment may not be of relevance at the interim stage.\n",
        "p_42": "10. The Learned counsel for the defendant has in support of his plea for vacating the injunction relied upon the following judgments:\n",
        "p_43": "(i) Vishnudas Trading Vs V.S. Tobacco Co. Ltd.\n",
        "p_44": "1996 PTC 512\n \n\nIn the above judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the device of CHARMINAR used by the defendant is different from that of the plaintiff. The above case arose from the rectification proceedings. The defendant, Vazir Sultan Tobacco was manufacturing cigarettes and not quiwam & zarda. The plaintiff was also the manufacturer of quiwam and zarda. The Court held that there was no evidence by VST that it intended to manufacture any thing other than the cigarettes and it was further held that tobacco can either be chewed, smoked or inhaled & snuff and quiwam were products were different from cigarettes.\n",
        "p_45": "Para 45 of the said judgment reads as follows:-\n",
        "p_46": " \"In our view, if a trader or manufacturer actually trades in or manufactures only one or some of the articles coming under a broad classification and such trader or manufacturer has no bonafide intention to trade in or manufacture other goods or articles which also fall under the said broad classification, such trader or manufacturer should not be permitted to enjoy monopoly in respect of all the articles which may come under such broad classification and by that process preclude the other traders or manufacturers to get registration of separate and distinct goods which may also be grouped under the broad classification. If registration has been given generally in respect of all the articles coming under the broad classification and if it is established that the trader or manufacturer who got such registration had not intended to use any other article except and articles being used by such trader or manufacturer, the registration of such trader is liable to be rectified by limiting the ambit of registration and confining such registration to the specific article or articles which really concern the trader or manufacturer enjoying the registration made in his favor.\"\n",
        "p_47": "Thus applying the above principle of law it is clear that since the plaintiff did not trade in the manufacture of chewing tobacco nor did it evince or prove any intention to do so it cannot seek an injunction against the defendant for chewing tobacco in view of the above position of law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.\n",
        "p_48": "(ii) Roshan Lal Oil Mills Ltd. Vs Assam Co.Ltd. 1996 PTC 16\n \n\nIn the above case the plaintiff's product had the 'JUMBO LABEL' with device of Aeroplane in respect of edible oils and the defendant was using the label 'JUMBO' with device of elephant for manufacturing tea, the injunction was refused as the competing goods were different. The applicability of this judgment need not be considered at this stage due to my findings on honest concurrent user.\n",
        "p_49": "(iii) Amritdhara Pharmacy Vs Saya Deo Gupta \n \n\nIn the above case, Amritdhara Pharmacy was the registered proprietor who claimed injunction against the manufacturer of Laxmandhara. The Court held that two brand names were likely to confuse and deceive an average customer. The Court further held that the plaintiff had acquiesced by permitting the user and sale of Amritdhara and in this view of the matter, registration was granted to the manufacture of Laxmandhara but was confined to the state of U.P. I am of the view that this judgment has a direct bearing on the facts of the present case as the defendant by the documents produced on record has established the fact that it had been manufacturing chewing tobacco at least since 1975. Thus following the principle of localized permission granted in the above case the interest of justice would be fully protected if the defendant is permitted to use their trade name only for the States of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal and the defendants are restrained from using their trade name in any State other than UP, Bihar, & West Bengal during the pendency of the suit as an interim measure. This would balance the equities.\n",
        "p_50": "(iv) Gopal Engineering Vs POMX Labs. AIR 1992 Delhi 302\n \n\nIn the above decision, the Court held that the 14 months of delay in moving Court was sufficient for refusing injunction. This decision would also support the case of the defendant in view of its concurrent user since 1975.\n",
        "p_51": "(v) United Brothers Vs United Traders 1997 PTC (17) 603\n \n\nIn the above decision, the plaintiffs were the registered proprietors for pressure cookers, tiffin boxes, an injunction was refused against the manufacturers of spoons, knives and boxes, who were using the similar mark 'United'. This decision may have had some bearing on the present case but in view of my findings on honest concurrent user by the defendant it is not necessary to consider the applicability of this decision at this stage.\n",
        "p_52": "(vi) Durga Dutt Sharma Vs N.P. Laboratories \n \n\nIn the above case, it was held that while differences in get up, packing & other factors would be immaterial in an infringement action yet in a passing off action the defendant can escape liability by showing that the added matter is sufficient to distinguish its goods. This decision may have had some bearing on the present case but in view of my findings on honest concurrent user by the defendant it is not necessary to consider this decision at this interim stage.\n",
        "p_53": "(vii) Kores India Ltd. Vs Khoday Eshwarsa & Son ALR 1984 213\n \n\nIn the above case, the Court laid down in Para 11 the following tests for determining the honest concurrent user:-\n",
        "p_54": "\"(1) The honesty of the current use,\n \n\n(2) The quantum of concurrent use shown by the petitioners having regard to the duration, area and volume of trade and to goods concerned,\n \n\n(3) the degree of confusion likely to follow from the remblance of the applicants' mark and the opponents' marks.\n",
        "p_55": "(4) Whether any instance of confusion have in fact been proved, and\n \n\n(5) the relative inconvenience which would be caused to the parties and the amount of inconvenience which would result to the public if the applicants' mark is registered.\"\n",
        "p_56": "In my view, the above tests are applicable to the facts of the present case because the defendant has established bonafides of his concurrent user since 1975. There is little likelihood of confusion owing to the difference in the mark such as different user of colour red and gold by the plaintiff. There is only a solitary sale pleaded by the plaintiff without any conclusive instance of confusion. The localized use of the product by the defendant confined to 3 states would balance the convenience and inconvenience caused.\n",
        "p_57": "(viii) In  Johnson & Johnson Vs  Chritine Hoden India Pvt. Ltd. reported as 1988 PTC 39 no injunction was granted as sufficient differences were found between the competing products. This decision may have had some bearing on the issue at hand but in view of my findings on honest concurrent user by the defendant it is not necessary to consider this decision at this stage.\n",
        "p_58": "(ix) In  Jain Rubber Industries Vs  Crown Pvt. Ltd. 1988 PTC 82, an injunction was refused as there was honest concurrent user of product for 7 years prior to the filing of suit. In the present case since the defendant was manufacturing and selling the impugned goods since 1975 prior to the filing of the suit in 1998, injunction cannot be continued.\n",
        "p_59": "(x) In  Hindustan Pencils Vs  Aptadet Industries 1991 PTC 204 defendant's goods were different. The defendant's goods were manufactured prior to the obtaining of the registration by the plaintiff and there was an unexplained delay of 5 years. Interim order was vacated in such a situation but the defendants were directed to file quarterly statement of accounts showing sales of the products in question. In my view, the above judgment would directly have a bearing on the facts of the present case and it will be in the interest of justice to direct the defendant to file the quarterly statement of accounts and sales of the impugned products, i.e., khaini/chewing tobacco and further resricting the user of the defendant to U.P., Bihar and West Bengal.\n",
        "p_60": "11. It is not possible to accept prima facie the case of the plaintiff at this stage that it did not know of the defendant's user of the impugned mark for chewing tobacco till March, 1998 particularly in the light of the evidence produced by the defendant including the evidence of excise dues paid by it. The excise clearances showing duty paid have been filed by the defendants from 29.1.77 onwards. The excise declaration forms have been filed from 20.10.75 onwards. These contemporaneous documents are sufficient at this stage to show the manufacture of chewing tobacco by the defendant since at least 1975. Furthermore the averment of para 4 of the written statement giving yearwise sales of the defendant company from 1974-75 to 1997-98 has not been specifically denied by the plaintiff in the rejoinder and there is only a bare denial. At this stage I am inclined to accept prima facie the case set up by defendant of honest concurrent user since at least 1975. The damage if any to the plaintiff can be eliminated to a substantial degree by localizing the defendant's user to 3 States only and by further asking the defendant to file its quarterly statement of accounts showing the sale of chewing tobacco by it.\n",
        "p_61": "12. The defendant has averred that the distribution of its product is localized to Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Bihar whereas the plaintiff on its own showing has averred that its products are advertised even on Doordarshan and would thus have a nationwide reach. In my view it would be sufficient if the injunction as prayed for is not granted but a condition imposed on the defendant not to sell/market its goods in States other than Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal & Bihar. This, in my view, would sufficiently protect the interest of both the parties as well as would be in the interest of justice. In this view of the matter and considering the fact that the defendant is manufacturing, selling and marketing the product, i.e., chewing tobacco since 1975, I am satisfied that at this stage the continuation of an injunction is not warranted due to the prima facie view I am taking of the establishment of honest concurrent user by the defendant. The interim order dated 18th March, 1998 would, therefore, stand vacated with effect from 1st of February, 2001. However the defendant's user would be restricted to the States of Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal & Bihar. The defendant would also file on affidavit a quarterly statement of accounts of the sale of chewing tobacco by it.\n",

This application has been filed under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 read with Section 151 CPC for grant of ad interim injunction order restraining the defendant from manufacturing, selling and/or offering for sale, directly or indirectly dealing in stationery products including pens/ball pens/jotter pens or pens of any nature or any other stationery items/goods as may be cognate or allied to the plaintiff's goods or the goods of the same description and/or goods having similar trade channels and/or goods as a dealt with by similar class of traders and purchasers under the mark `SOLO' and/or any other mark which may be identical and/or deceptively similar to the plaintiff's trade mark `SOLO' and/or from doing any other act as is likely to cause confusion and or deception amounting to passing off defendant's goods and/or business as the goods and/or business of the plaintiff. \n",
        "p_3": "2. The case of the plaintiff is as follows. The plaintiff Company was incorporated in 28.5.1996 to carry on the business for the manufacture and sale of stationery products. It commenced its business activities in March, 1997. It is manufacturing and selling variety of stationery products including presentation holders and envelopes, presentation clear books, clip files, ring binders, report files and covers, business card holders, expansion cases, document cases, CM ROM holders and zipper wallets, conference holder, which includes writing pads and pens, office stationery, adhesives, packaging, paper and paper products etc. In September, 1996, the plaintiff adopted the trade mark SOLO in respect of stationery items of its manufacture and sale and has continuously and extensively used the same in the course of trade since March, 1997. The goods as are manufactured and marketed by the plaintiff are of high quality and are identified and recognized as a quality product originating from the plaintiffs source of manufacture. The trade mark SOLO has continuously and extensively been used in the course of trade by the plaintiff ever since 1997 so much so that the trade mark has come about to be exclusively identified and recognized by the purchasing public and the members of the trade with the products of the plaintiff. The plaintiff has acquired an exclusive right to the use of the said trade mark as a proprietor thereof in respect of the stationery products including presentation holders and envelopes, presentation clear books, clip files, ring binders, report files and covers, business card holders, expansion cases, document cases, CM ROM holders and zipper wallets, conference holder, which includes writing pads and pens, office stationery, adhesives, packaging, paper and paper products and printed publications and/or all other cognate or allied goods or goods of same description. The plaintiff has been marketing writing instruments including pens bearing the trade mark SOLO as a part of its presentation holders, conference holders etc. The plaintiff has filed an application for registration of the trade mark SOLO before the Registrar of Trade Marks, Mumbai on 23.9.1996, which is pending. The plaintiff had been spending substantial amount of money for advertising of the said trade mark and in the year 1997-98, he has spent an amount of Rs. 11.33 lacs, which has increased to Rs. 37.76 lacs during the year 2002-03. It has also sold its goods of the value of Rs. 14 crores since 1997 and has spent Rs. 90 lacs for promotion of its trade mark SOLO. The plaintiff has been participating in trade fairs/exhibitions since 1997 held in New Delhi, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Patna and Hyderabad.\n",
        "p_4": "3. The defendant, M/s. Rotomac Pens (Guj.) Private Limited is a Company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act and is engaged in manufacture and sale of inter-alia, stationery products including pens. Its house mark is Rotomac in respect of the goods of its manufacture and sale. With a view to trade upon the reputation of the plaintiff's trade mark SOLO, the defendant has dishonestly and malafide adopted an identical mark SOLO in respect of stationery goods like pens/ball point pens/jotter pens of its manufacture and sale with the sole purpose to cause confusion and deception in the minds of unwary class of purchasers and to earn profits by passing off and/or enabling others to pass off its inferior quality goods as and for the goods of the plaintiff. The mark SOLO adopted by the defendant is identical to the plaintiff's well established and reputed mark SOLO and is bound to cause confusion and deception in the normal course of trade. The use of ROTOMAC house mark in conjunction with the mark of SOLO on the part of the defendant is immaterial for determination of the question of likelihood of confusion and deception. The defendant had full knowledge about the prior adoption, use, reputation and extensive publicity given to the trade mark SOLO on the part of the plaintiff at the time of adoption of identical mark on their part. The products of the parties are the products as one used by all sections of the purchasers including school going children, clerical work work force etc. The probability of confusion and deception in the facts and circumstances of the case particularly keeping in view the class of purchasers is extremely high. The plaintiff's business is thus being diverted and is further likely to be diverted to the benefit of the defendant on account of defendant's unlawful activities causing pecuniary loss to the plaintiff's reputation and wrongful gain to itself. Actual amount of profit earned by the defendant after its account is rendered, will be at least Rs. 20 lacs. In the third week of April, 2003, the plaintiff sent a letter to the defendant ascertaining details of the period as to when the defendant commenced illegal trade activity and also the variety of goods for which the impugned trade mark was used and the quantum of its use. There was exchange of correspondence between the parties. The defendant is not desisting from continuing to use the trade mark SOLO and hence the suit. The plaintiff claimed the relief of decree of permanent injunction similar to the prayer made in the interlocutory application. The plaintiff has also prayed in the suit to direct the defendant to deliver the infringing material containing the impugned trade mark, catalogues, cartons, stencils, dies, blocks, films, plates and publicity material etc. for the purpose of destruction/erasers and for rendition of account earned by the defendant by use of the impugned mark and decree of the amount so found due.\n",
        "p_5": "4. The defendant contested the suit and the application. Its case is that the defendant carries on the business of manufacturing and marketing the pens. It is using the trade mark Rotomac. The word Rotomac forms prominent part of its name. Along with its main mark or house mark Rotomac, the defendant Company uses a sub-brand, so as to indicate the kind variety, type of pen having particular features, characteristics and functions. The defendant had been using the trade mark `Rotomac 07', `Rotoma Fighter', `Rotomac Glasse', `Rotomac Solo' and `Rotomac Selino'. The use of the house mark along with suffix sub-brand to indicate the particular kind of pen is the common practice of the pen trade followed by all the manufacturers of the pen. The defendant Company is the sister concern of Rotomac Pens Private Limited, Kanpur. Kanpur Company started manufacturing and selling various kinds of ball pens in 1992 under the trade mark `Rotomac'. With the passage of time and publicity and promotion, it has become its valuable house mark. The trade mark and house mark Rotomac formed the genus, i.e the main and distinguishing part of Kanpur Company's name `Rotomac Pens Pvt. Ltd.' and the defendant Company's name `Rotomac Pens (Guj.) Pvt. Ltd.'. Both Kanpur Company and the defendant Company used Rotomac house mark as genera on each of their pens. In addition, they used specific suffix as indicative mark which is described as a sub-brand in the trade of pens. More often then not, the prices of pens vary according to the features, kinds of pens and their sub-brands. Rotomac trade mark or the house mark has now acquired tremendous value, reputation and goodwill among the trade and public. The goods manufactured and marketed by the defendant Copany and the Kanpur Company under the trade mark Rotomac are associated with the defendant and the Kanpur Company. The sub-brand, however, is used for the sake of convenience of customers, i.e traders and sellers of these pens. Rotomac pen has acquired popularity, as would be clear from the fact that Kanpur Company has spent over Rs. 45 crores on advertisement in the electronic, movies, print and other promotions so as to popularize the trade mark Rotomac and its total sales of Rotomac pens are over Rs. 69 crores. As compared to the defendant, the total sales figures of the plaintiff and the money spent on advertisements by it are nowhere near the sales and advertisement figures of the Kanpur Company. \n",
        "p_6": "5. The defendant Company used `Rotomac Solo' as sub trade mark in respect of the jotter pen since 6.2.2003. In addition to the advertisement expenses incurred by the Kanpur Company, the defendant has also spent Rs. 89,942/- on publicity of Rotomac Solo jotter pens on 24.4.2003. During the period from 6.2.2003 to 31.7.2003, the defendant Company's sales of Rotomac Solo jotter pens were Rs. 1,04,42,678.23p. The allegation of the plaintiff that the defendant Company had selected `Solo' sub-brand to take advantage of the reputation of the plaintiff's `Solo' trade mark in respect of files, folders, data binders etc. The defendant's house mark `Rotomac' itself has its own independent reputation. Even otherwise, the word `Solo' is an ordinary well understood English word, having a definite dictionary meaning as `performance by a single person' or `unaccompanied' or alone. `Solo' is not a coined or an invented word whereby its selection/adoption/use as a sub-brand by the defendant can be suspected. The defendant has used this word as sub-brand to indicate a particular kind of pen. The plaintiff itself has referred to the defendant's sub-brand `Solo' as `a variety of Rotomac pen range'. Furthermore, the defendant's goods are pens whereas the plaintiff's goods are presentation and envelopes, presentation clear books, clip files, ring binders, report files and covers, business card holders, expansion cases, document cases, CDROM holders and zipper wallets, conference folders, book rack, paper and file tray file and magazine rack, desk organizer and multi pen holder. The plaintiff does not manufacture pens, but it purchases pens from eight pen manufactures, who use their own trade marks on those pens, which are Linc Starview, EN-A.ONE 07, Starview, Wright A-One Gel and A ONE O.B.G. The pens thus purchased by the plaintiff are merely inserted in the plaintiff's two items bearing Codes Nos. CC 101 and CC 103, which are described in its catalogue as `Conference Companion' and `Secure Companion[' and not as `Solo'. The unit price paid by the plaintiff for pen is Rs. 2.50p. The unit price of the defendant's pen is as high as Rs. 15/-. The plaintiff is not marketing any pen bearing `Solo' as the trade mark. The case of the parties are completely distinct and different. The class of purchasers is different. The plaintiff's goods are purchased not by individuals, but by corporates. The defendant's jotter pens being costly, are purchased by highly educated and discerning people. The defendant's name and fill address is duly printed prominently on all its packings. Other allegations have also been refuted and it is prayed that the suit may be dismissed. The application for interim injunction order is also resisted for the same reasons. \n",
        "p_7": "6. An action for passing off is a common law remedy being in substance an action for deceit, i.e, a passing off by a person of his own goods as those of another. The use by the defendant of the trade mark of the plaintiff is not essential in an action for passing off. But where the evidence in respect of passing off consists merely of the colourable use of a registered trade mark, the essential features of both the actions might coincide in the; sense that what would be a colourable imitation of a trade mark in a passing off action would also be such in an action for infringement of the same trade mark. Passing off one's own goods as that of another is a unfair competition and injures the goodwill and business of the person who had acquired propriety right in the exclusive use of a particular trademark. In a passing off action if the defendant shows that the getup, packing or other writing or marks on the goods or on the packets in which the goods are offered for sale are different or indicate clearly trade origin different from the opponent, the defendant may escape liability if he can show that the added matter is sufficient to distinguish his goods from those of the plaintiff (Durga Dutt Sharma v.

        "p_33": "15. The facts of the present case now may be considered in the backdrop of the principles of law laid down in the above-cited cases. The dispute is about the trade mark Solo for which the plaintiff claims propriety right by prior and exclusive use in respect of stationary item with which pen is also supplied. It is stated that on account of wide and extensive advertisements and publicity over a number of years starting from March, 1997 the word 'Solo' gets immediate association with the plaintiff and a person who happens to see the goods marketed under the trademark 'SOLO' recognizes it as a product of the plaintiff. The plaintiff's proprietary right to use the trade mark Solo in respect of the stationery items like presentation holders and envelopes, presentation clear books, clip files, ring binders, report files and covers, business card holders, expansion cases, document cases, CD ROM holders and zipper wallets, conference holder which includes writing pads and pens, office stationery, adhesives, packaging, paper and paper products and printed publications and/or all other cognate or allied goods or goods of same description, is not in dispute. The dispute is about the pen. The plaintiff is claiming exclusive rights to use the trade mark `Solo' in respect of the pens, which are sold as part of the above-mentioned stationery items with word `Solo' printed over them. The defendant prima facie has not disputed seriously that the plaintiff is in prior use of the trade mark Solo, but it has repudiated he claim of the plaintiff that it is marketing the pens under this trade mark. It is alleged that the plaintiff is not manufacturer of pens nor is it selling the pens under the trade mark Solo. Rather it is asserted that the pens are purchased by the plaintiff from eight other manufacturers and they are inserted by the plaintiff in file covers and they carry the trade mark or trade name of their own manufacturer. The defendant has further alleged that even otherwise it is manufacturing and selling it pens under the trade mark/house mark Rotomac, which on account of prior use and wide publicity has acquired the reputation of high quality product and that its pens are sold with sub brand names added to the word Rotomac in order to distinguish the different variety of pens and marketed by it to facilitate the customers to buy the pens of a particular sub brand of his choice. It is alleged that the trade mark/house mark Rotomac printed on the pens distinguishes it from other pens or products, which my carry the word Solo printed on them. According to the defendant, the customers buy the pens of the plaintiff with the trade mark/house mark Rotomac and it is only to choose a particular variety of pens that they ask for a sub-brand from the traders. \n",
        "p_34": "16. There is no likelihood for confusion or deception in the minds of consumers of the pens or its traders that the goods manufactured by the defendant are the products originated from the plaintiff. \n",
        "p_35": "17. As noticed above, the test in passing off action is not by comparison of the two products by placing them by side-by-side to ascertain similarities and dissimilarities in them but the test is whether an unwary buyer who wanted to buy a product of the plaintiff, would be confused or may be deceived on seeing the goods of the defendant and believe that goods is originated from the plaintiff and buys it. \n",
        "p_36": "18. Certain important features of the trade mark of the goods of the plaintiff and that of the defendant are worthwhile to note here. The plaintiff is selling the stationery and pens are also part of its stationery iteMs. The defendant, on the other hand, is exclusively dealing in pens. The pens are thus sold by both the parties. The plaintiff is selling these goods not as a separate item, but as a part of its stationery items, but the defendant is selling it individually. The right of the plaintiff over the use of trade mark `Solo' in respect of the stationery items is prima facie accepted by the defendant. The defendant, however, claims a superior right to use the word `Solo' as sub-brand of its own reputed trade mark/house mark `Rotomac'. The case of the plaintiff is that the pen is a cognate and allied good to the goods manufactured and sold by it under trademark SOLO. The defendant, on the contrary claims that suffixing its own trademark/house mark Rotomac to word SOLO is sufficient to distinguish it from the pens of plaintiff. Whether use of word SOLO with the trade mark/house mark Rotomac, prefixed or suffixed to the word Solo will infringe the trade mark of the plaintiff, is a crucial question to be decided. \n",
        "p_37": "19. The customers, consumers and traders of the goods of the plaintiff and the defendant are the same and user of the product/goods of the parties are office goers, school going children and students, who use pen in offices or schools or homes. The word `Solo' used by the defendant as sub-brand of its product of pen under the trade mark/house mark Rotomac is an exact imitation of the infringed trade mark Solo adopted by the plaintiff for its own goods. The class of purchasers who are likely to buy the gods bear the marks and their education, intelligence and the degree of care they are likely to exercise in purchasing the goods is at par. The mode of purchase of the goods from the traders is also the same. A buyer who is not so discerning and careful would prima facie be influenced in purchasing the pens bearing the word `Solo' believing it to be the goods which has originated from the plaintiff. \n",
        "p_38": "20. In B.K.Engineering Co. v. Ubhi Enterprises (Regd.) and Anr. 1985 PTC the plaintiff and defendant both were manufacturing and marketing cycle bells. The plaintiff house mark/trademark was 'B.K'. The defendant adopted 'BK-81' as its trademark. In a passing of action it was held that the infringing trademark is confusingly/deceptively similar. This court allowed the appeal and granted injunction against the defendant. In K.R.Chinnikrishna Chetty v. K.Venkatesa Mudaliar and another,  the dispute was about registration of trademark. Appellants applied for registration of trademark ''Radha's Sri Andal'' snuff manufactured by them. The respondent No. 1 opposed the application claiming it to be the registered proprietor of trademark ''Sri Andal'' sniff. The court held that there was tangible danger that a substantial number of persons will confuse the applicant's ''Radha's Sri Andal'' mark applied for with the opponents legend ''Sri Andal'' snuff. The matter was taken to Supreme Court in K.R.Chinnikrisna Chettiar v. Sri Ambal and Co.. The Supreme Court observed that the word ''Ambal'' is the distinctive and essential feature of the trademark and the word ''Andal'' has striking similarity and affinity between the words ''Ambal'' and ''Andal'' and it may lead to confusion in the mind of a majority of the customers. In Rupa and Co.Ltd v. Dawn Mills Co.Ltd. 1999 PTC (19) 334 it was observed comparison in the two trademarks has to be concerning essential features of the marks which an average person with imperfect recollection remembers. The plaintiff's trademark in this case was ''DAWN'' and ''DAWN HOSIERY''. The defendant adopted trademark ''DON'' for its hosiery articles. It was held to be phonetically deceptively and confusingly similar. \n",
        "p_39": "21. In Kamal Trading Co.Bombay and others v. Gillette U.K.Limited, Middle Sex, England, 1988 PTC 1 the plaintiff registered trademark was ''7 O'clock'' for safety blades, safety razor, shaving brushes etc. The defendant adopted same trademark for toothbrushes. Defendants contention that goods are different was rejected and the order of injunction was upheld in appeal. In Honda Motors Co. Ltd. v. Charanjit Singh and Ors,  in a passing off action it was held that two traders need not necessarily operate in same field so as to suffer injury on account of goods of one trader being passed off as those of other. Plaintiff's reputed trademark HONDA used in relation to automobiles was adopted by the defendant for goods like rubber goods, batteries, pesticides, door latches etc. The defendant was restrained from using the trademark by an injunction order. \n",
        "p_40": "22. Similar law was laid down in some other judgments like Super Seals India Pvt. Ltd v. Mantri Brothers, 1986 PTC 341, wherein the infringed trademark was ''SUPERSEAL''; M/s. Kumar Electric Works v. Anuj Electronics, 1990 PTC 26 wherein the trademark involved was ''OLYMPUS''; Creative Handicrafts v. Sedana Electric Co. and another, 1988 PTC 348 in which infringed trademark was ''CHOICE''; Ceat Tyres of India Ltd v. M/s. Jai Industrial Services, 1996 PTC (16)720 wherein the infringed trademark was ''CEAT'' and the plaintiff used it for tyres which defendant used it for marketing belts and fan belts. Judgments in Corn Products Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food Products Ltd, , Sham Lal v. Interads Advertising (P) Ltd and others, AIR 1978 Delhi 27 and Century Traders v. Roshan Lal Duggar and Co. may also be referred which lay down the same principle of law. \n",
        "p_41": "23. In United Brothers v. United Traders, 1997 PTC (17) 603 the plaintiff's registered trademark was ''United'' in relation to pressure cooker etc. The defendant used it for marketing table ware, forks, knives and spoons etc. it was held that defendant's goods cannot be said to be allied or cognate to the goods of the plaintiff. In a passing off action once the plaintiff has established its proprietary right over the trademark the protection is to be granted to him even though the infringing trademark is used for cognate and allied goods and sometime even if it is used for a totally different article. Each case has to be decided on its own merit. \n",
        "p_42": "24. A feign attempt was made at the hearing of the arguments that the plaintiff is not in prior use of the infringed trade mark `Solo' in respect of its stationery goods. Attention was also invited to various invoices, at pages 49 to 202 of document file. It was argued that the word used by the plaintiff in respect of its goods was filex and not the word `Solo'. It is also argued that the word ''SOLO'' printed on the invoices pertained to the year 2002 and 2003 (pages 203 to 226 and 230 to 258). It is also submitted that a rubber stamp with word ''SOLO'' has been affixed on some of them. The argument does not seem correct, as pointed out by learned counsel for the plaintiff. Rubber stamp of the word `Solo' has been affixed to attest true copy of invoices. Anyway, a careful scrutiny of the invoices and other documents placed on record will prima facie show that the plaintiff using the word `Solo' in respect of the stationery items much prior to the defendant starting its use as sub-brand in March, 2003 even as per the defendants own argument. In this connection documents at pages 271 to 444 may be perused which lead to same conclusion. \n",
        "p_43": "25. One of the contentions raised on behalf of the defendant was that the plaintiff was not manufacturing the pens, but was buying from other manufacturers and was inserting those pens in his stationery items sold by it under the trade mark `Solo'. However, it has not been argued that the plaintiff's claim of proprietary right over the trade mark Solo would be sustainable only when it is manufacturing the pens itself and not buying the products from the market. The argument, therefore, is not tenable. \n",
        "p_44": "26. The next argument of learned counsel for the defendant is that the stationery items manufactured/sold by the plaintiff under the trade mark are not allied or cognate to the goods sold by the defendant. It is further argued that the consumers of these goods are different. The argument is devoid of any force. The pens are undoubtedly allied and cognate to the stationery items which the plaintiff is selling. Case law in this regard has already been cited in forgoing paragraphs and need not be reproduced Pens and other stationary items sold by the plaintiff can by no stretch of reasoning could be said to be so different that there was no likelihood of any confusion to be caused to the consumers of these goods. \n",
        "p_45": "27. It is also argued on behalf of the defendant that the word `Solo' is not an invented word, but a common dictionary word and the plaintiff cannot claim proprietary right or exclusive right to the user of the word Solo. It is argued that the dictionary meaning of the word `Solo' is ''performance by a single person'' or ''unaccompanied'' or ''alone''. However, it cannot be denied that a common English word like `Solo' may also become a trade mark giving exclusive right to its adopter on account of long user and the extensive publicity and the reputation created among the consumers and the traders, who may buy the goods on mere look or hearing of the word will associate the product with a particular manufacturer or trader. \n",
        "p_46": "28. Lastly, it is submitted that the defendant is not using the word Solo as its trade mark for its pens, but it is using it as a sub-brand and the defendant's trade mark/house mark Rotomac is also printed on it, which makes it sufficiently distinct from other similar goods available in the market. A look at the pen which the plaintiff is selling as part of the stationery and the pen of the defendant sold in the market, which have been produced at the hearing, do not show that the word or trade mark Rotoma used as prefix or suffix to the word `Solo' will make it so different from the pen of the plaintiff that an ordinary consumer of the pen or trader cannot be deceived or is not likely to be deceived. The word `Solo' printed over the pens of the defendant is printed in bold letters with the house mark Rotomac printed in small size letters over the word ''SOLO''. The word ''SOLO'' being in bold letters is eye catching and one who sees the article will remember this word. When two marks are compared side by side the prefix or suffix word may not necessarily make vital difference because where imperfect collection is relevant it is to be considered as to whether addition word, prefix or suffix is sufficient to prevent the confusion in the two competing mark. \n",
        "p_47": "29. Having regard to the above discussion, prima facie, I have no hesitation in holding that use and adoption of the word `Solo' by the defendant in relation to its own goods, i.e., pen manufactured and sold by it in the market will infringe the proprietary rights of the plaintiff in its trade mark `Solo' and the defendant would be guilty of committing passing off its own goods as those of the plaintiff. It will be an unfair trade practice which cannot be allowed to be continued. \n",
        "p_48": "30. The principles governing grant of ad-interim injunction are now well settled. They are (i)whether the applicant has made out a prima facie case meaning thereby that there is a bonafide dispute and serious contentions which require interrogation and trial; (ii) whether balance of convenience is in favor of the applicant, that it to say, whether it would cause greater inconvenience to the applicant if interlocutory injunction is not granted than the inconvenience to which the affected party will be subjected if it is granted, and (iii) whether the applicant would suffer irreparable loss and injury if the prayer for grant of the interlocutory injunction is refused. All these considerations must be conjointly satisfied before the order of ad interim injunction is passed by the court. \n",
        "p_49": "31. Following the principles of law, as discussed above, the plaintiff has made out a good case for grant of ad-interim injunction, as prayed for in the application. Not only prima facie case for grant of ad-interim injunction in its favor has been established by the plaintiff, but refusal of ad-interim injunction at this stage would result in irreparable loss of money and reputation to the plaintiff and further the plaintiff would suffer greater inconvenience if the defendant is not restrained from continuing to infringe the trade mark of the plaintiff rather than the inconvenience which would be caused to the defendant if the ad-interim injunction is granted since according to the defendant's own case, it is using the mark `Solo' as sub-brand and not as a trade mark or house mark, which is quite different and distinguishable from the infringed trade mark. \n",
        "p_50": "32. Accordingly, the application is allowed and the defendant is restrained from manufacturing, selling and/or offering for sale, directly or indirectly dealing in stationery products including pens/ball pens/jotter pens or pens of any nature or any other stationery items/goods as may be cognate or allied to the plaintiff's goods or the goods of the same description and/or goods having similar trade channels and/or goods as are dealt with by similar class of traders and purchasers under the mark `SOLO' and or any other mark which may be identical and/or deceptively similar to the plaintiff's trade mark `SOLO' and/or from doing any other act as is likely to cause confusion and/or deception amounting to passing off defendant's goods and/or business as the goods and/or business of the plaintiff. \n",
        "p_51": "33. It is clarified that observation made in this order are for deciding interlocutory application and they shall not influence the decision on the questions involved on merit after trial. \n",

It has been filed with ulterior\n\npurpose to harm the appellant.      As a consequence of the interim\n\norder the appellant is suffering undue hardship, prejudice and loss.\n\nThe respondent had failed to make out a prima facie case in the\n\npetition for passing the orders dated May 4 and 6, 2009.            The\n\nrespondent has also failed to give any particulars with regard to any\n\ninfringement of its trade mark or passing-off. The respondent is\n\nseeking a monopoly on the colour red.          The registration of the\n\npetitioner is in the words \"Eveready\", \"Give me Red\" and \"Eveready\n\n100\". It is not registered in the colour combination red and silver and\n\nblue and silver.    As there is no registration of colour combination,\n\nthe right to exclusive user of the said colours cannot be availed by the\n\npetitioner.\n",

        "p_14": "     Learned senior counsel for the appellant further submit that a\n\nmanufacturer cannot be held responsible for any acts of the\n\nshopkeeper/distributor as the manufacturer in this case is not\n\ninvolved in direct sales to the retail customer.   Manufacturer cannot\n\nbe held responsible for any fraud committed by the shopkeeper upon\n\nits customers.     The sales are affected through distributors and a\n network of shopkeeper.       According to the learned counsel, the\n\nfindings of the Learned Single Judge are contrary to the well-settled\n\nlaw. In support of their submissions, learned counsel rely on a\n\njudgment of the House of Lords in the case of Payton & Co. Ltd. vs.\n\nSnelling, Lampard & Co. Ltd. (1901) AC 308.                It is further\n\nsubmitted that the Learned Single Judge has erred in law in granting\n\ninjunction on an apprehension of passing-off.       The Learned Single\n\nJudge also erred in forming a prima facie opinion that the use of the\n\nword \"Eurocell\" in a straight line and in bold letters is likely to cause\n\nconfusion among the unwary purchasers. The test of innocent and\n\nunwary purchaser has been held to be invalid since Payton's case\n\n(supra).   The Learned Single Judge also erred in holding that the\n\nsilver band on the two ends of the product is also deceptive and likely\n\nto confuse a purchaser. According to the learned counsel, an unwary\n\nperson would not notice any of the factors pointed out by the Trial\n\nCourt. In case a purchaser notices any of the similarities pointed out\n\nby the Learned Single Judge, he or she would have to be a very alert\n\nperson. In such circumstances, the approach of the Learned Single\n\nJudge is wrong and inconsistent.       It is submitted that almost all\n\nbranded batteries in the market employ similar 'get-up' and 'trade\n dress'. The learned counsel have referred to the packaging and the\n\nbatteries sold by manufacturers viz., \"Shakti\", \"Geep\", \"Nippo\",\n\n\"Maxwell\", \"Panasonic\", \"Powercell\" and \"Novino\". According to the\n\nlearned counsel the primary colours used in the 'get-up' of such\n\nbatteries are red, blue, black and gold along with combination of\n\nsilver. The respondent itself has, apart from red and blue colours,\n\nwhich are subject matter of the suit, black and gold colour\n\ncombinations for the dry cell \"AA\" batteries. In other words, theses\n\nare common colours for pencil batteries. According to the learned\n\ncounsel, the Learned Single Judge has erred in law in granting an\n\ninjunction only on an apprehension of passing-off. In support of the\n\nsubmission, the learned counsel relied on the following commentaries\n\nand judgments:\n",
        "p_15": "\n",
        "p_16": "     Relying on the aforesaid commentaries and judgments, the\n\nlearned counsel submitted that similarity in 'get-up' will seldom give\n\na cause of action for passing-off, when trade names are given with a\n\nreasonable prominence on the goods as in this case.      The learned\n\ncounsel submitted that the customers in normal course would ask for\n\nthe batteries by name and not by the colour scheme. Since the name\n\nof the batteries of the respondent is prominently displayed, there is\n\nhardly any likelihood of any confusion. In any event, the respondent\n\nhas not made any statement in the petition, true to knowledge, that\n\nthere is likelihood of confusion or actual confusion. Statements in\n\nthe petition have been affirmed as received from records which are\n\nbelieved to be true. The learned counsel further submitted that it is\n\nnot understandable as to how there can be any record of the sales of\n\nthe appellant in the records of the respondent.     Summing up his\n\nsubmissions, the learned counsel have submitted i) both the products\n are sold by brand name; ii) there is no instance of any actual\n\ndeception or passing-off; iii) there is no likelihood of deception. In any\n\neven ad interim order ought not to be passed unless some actual\n\nincident is cited; iv) it is not the respondent's case that Eurocell has\n\naffected the turn over or sales of Eveready. In fact, the sales figures\n\nindicate a steady increase in the market of Eveready; v) balance of\n\nconvenience is apparently in favour of the appellant as it had suffered\n\nhuge losses by the grant of interim injunction. At the time of the\n\ngrant of injunction, the appellant had stocks ready for sale worth Rs.\n\n4 crores. The entire stock will be rendered useless unless the interim\n\norder is vacated. vi) the respondent had failed to make out a prima\n\nfacie case; vii) the petition on which the injunction is granted has\n\nbeen verified on the basis of information contained in the record.\n\nDeception cannot be seen from the records; viii) in order to succeed\n\nthe respondent had to satisfy the test as laid down in the case of\n\nImperial Group PLC (supra). The verification of the affidavit being\n\ndefective, the same cannot be relied on. The learned counsel further\n\nrelied on the judgments of the Supreme Court in the cases of A.K.K.\n\nNambiar v. Union of India & Anr. [AIR 1970 SC 652 and Virendra\n\nKumar Saklecha vs. Jagjiwan & Ors. [AIR 1974 SC 1957] in\n support of his submission. On the basis of the above, the learned\n\ncounsel have submitted that the injunction granted by the Learned\n\nSingle Judge deserves to be vacated.\n",
        "p_17": "\n",
        "p_18": "     On the other hand, Mr. Pratap Chatterjee, learned counsel for\n\nthe respondent, submitted that the order passed by the Learned\n\nSingle Judge is purely discretionary in nature. The Appellate Court\n\nought not to interfere with same unless it is an open and shut case in\n\nfavour of the appellant. In the facts and circumstances of this case,\n\nthe appellant cannot possibly argue that there is no case to be tried.\n\nThe Learned Single Judge has merely given directions for affidavits.\n\nThe appellant has still not filed the affidavits. The learned counsel\n\nfurther submits that in cases of this kind, normal practice is to grant\n\na prompt ex parte injunction. The Learned Single Judge upon\n\nconsideration of the entire matter has come to the conclusion that the\n\nrespondent has made out a prima facie case of passing-off.\n\nTherefore, the appellate court would only interfere in case it is\n\nconcluded that the grant of injunction has resulted in failure of\n\njustice. In support of this submission, learned counsel relied on the\n\ncase of Laxmikant V. Patel vs. Chetanbhai Shah [(2002) 3 SCC\n 65]. It is reiterated by the learned counsel that injunction in these\n\nmatters is the rule. The learned counsel further submitted that the\n\njudgment in Imperial Group PLC (supra) does not lay down what has\n\nbeen argued by the counsel for the appellant.          The aforesaid\n\njudgment was considered by the Supreme Court in the case of Cadila\n\nHealth Care Ltd. vs. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd. [(2001) 5 SCC\n\n73]. It was held that the principles applicable in England would not\n\nalways be applicable in India.    The Supreme Court had made a\n\nreference to the tests laid down in the case of S. M. Dyechem Ltd.\n\nvs. Cadbury (India) Ltd. [(2000) 5 SCC 573] and distinguished the\n\nsame. The Supreme Court has clearly laid down that what is to be\n\nseen in the case of passing-off action is the similarity between\n\ncompeting marks and to determine whether there is likelihood of\n\ndeception or causing confusion.    At the interim stage, there is no\n\nnecessity for a critical examination of the 'get-up' and the 'trade\n\ndress' to discover any dissimilarities. The Court has to examine the\n\ntwo products for broad similarities. The learned counsel further\n\nsubmitted that the tests as laid down by the House of Lords in the\n\ncase of Payton & Co. Ltd. (supra) do not reflect the law in India. The\n\nsimilarity between two competing marks has to be considered as a\n whole. The word 'similar' is not to be equated with identical. It is\n\nsufficient if the customer is left wondering as to which product is to\n\nbe purchased. The learned counsel thereafter submitted that the use\n\nof the red colour by the appellant is dishonest. Earlier the appellant\n\nwas using pre-dominantly black colour which has now been changed\n\nto red and silver. This, according to the learned counsel, is only to\n\ntake advantage of the 'trade dress' and 'get-up' of the appellant. With\n\nregard to the defective verification, the learned counsel submits that\n\nthe same is curable.     In support of his submission, the learned\n\ncounsel relied on the judgments in the cases of State (Delhi\n\nAdministration) vs. Sanjay Gandhi [(1978) 2 SCC 411] and\n\nVidyawati Gupta vs. Bhakti Hari Nayak [(2006) 2 SCC 777].\n\n\n\n",
        "p_19": "     In reply, Mr. Mukherjee has submitted that the judgment in the\n\ncase of Cadila Health Care (supra) is distinguishable and as it\n\nrelated to a medical product, where a more stringent test is applied.\n\nFurther, it related to a trade mark and not a 'trade dress'. It was a\n\ncase of phonetic similarity. In the present case, the mark of the\n\nappellant is registered which was absent in that case. In fact, in that\n\ncase, no injunction was granted either by the Trial Court or by the\n High Court.    Supreme Court in appeal also did not interfere. The\n\njudgment in the case of Laxmikant V. Patel (supra) also relates to a\n\ntrade name. In that case a strong prima facie case had been made\n\nout by the plaintiff. Finally, it is submitted that the Learned Single\n\nJudge erred in law in being influenced by the old website of the\n\nappellant as it was no longer in use.\n",

The matter is still to be\n\ndecided by the Trial Court upon affidavits being completed. We may,\n\nhowever, briefly notice that the Learned Single Judge has prima facie\n\ncome to a conclusion that on a casual inspection by an unwary\n\npurchaser of average intelligence and imperfect recollection, the\n\npackaging and the batteries of the respondent is likely to cause\n\nconfusion.    The Learned Single Judge has also observed that the\n\nword 'Eurocell' used by the respondent is very much in the same way\n\nas 'Eveready' is used. Both are in a straight line and in bold letters.\n The silver band on the two ends of the product is also deceptive and\n\nlikely to confuse the purchaser.

The\nkind of customer that the courts ought to think of in these\ncases    is   the   customer    who   knows   the   distinguishing\ncharacteristics of the plaintiff's goods, those characteristics\nwhich distinguish his goods from other goods in the market so\nfar as relates to general characteristics. If he does not know\nthat, he is not a customer whose views can properly be\nregarded by the Court.         (See the cases quoted in National\nSewing Thread & Co. Ltd. vs. James Chadwick & Bros. Ltd.\nwhich was a passing-off action).        In Schweppes case Lord\nHalsbury said if a person is so careless that he does not look\nand does not treat the label fairly but takes the bottle without\nsufficient consideration and without reading what is written\nvery plainly indeed up the face of the label, you cannot say he\nis deceived.'\n\n        These observations appear to us to be contrary to the\ndecision of this Court in Amritdhara case where it was\nobserved that the products will be purchased by thoth villagers\nand townsfolk, literate as well as illiterate and the question\nhas to be approached from the point of view of a man of\naverage intelligence and imperfect recollection. A trade may\n      relate to goods largely sold to illiterate or badly educated\n     persons. The purchaser in India cannot be equated with a\n     purchaser of goods in England. While we agree that in trade\n     mark matters, it is necessary to go into the question of\n     comparable strength, the decision on merits in Dyechem case\n     does not, in our opinion, lay down correct law and we hold\n     accordingly.\"\n",

This form of injury is\n commonly, though awkwardly, termed that of passing-off\n one's goods or business as the goods or business of another\n and is the most important example of the wrong of injurious\n falsehood. The gist of the conception of passing-off is that\n the goods are in effect telling a falsehood about themselves,\n are saying something about themselves which is calculated\n to mislead.

        "p_45": "      12. In Oertli v. Bowman (at p. 397) the gist of passing-off\naction was defined by stating that it was essential to the success\nof any claim to passing-off based on the use of given mark or get-\nup that the plaintiff should be able to show that the disputed\nmark or get-up has become by user in the country distinctive of\nthe plaintiff's goods so that the use in relation to any goods of the\nkind dealt in by the plaintiff of that mark or get-up will be\nunderstood by the trade and the public in that country as\nmeaning that the goods are the plaintiff's goods.       It is in the\nnature of acquisition of a quasi-proprietary right to the exclusive\nuse of the mark or get-up in relation to goods of that kind because\nof the plaintiff having used or made it known that the mark or get-\nup has relation to his goods. Such right is invaded by anyone\nusing the same or some deceptively similar mark, get-up or name\nin relation to goods not of plaintiff. The three elements of passing-\noff action are the reputation of goods, possibility of deception and\nlikelihood of damages to the plaintiff. In our opinion, the same\nprinciple, which applies to trade mark, is applicable to trade\nname.\n",
        "p_46": "\n",
        "p_47": "     13.     In an action for passing-off it is usual, rather\nessential, to seek an injunction, temporary or ad interim. The\nprinciples for the grant of such injunction are the same as in the\ncase of any other action against injury complained of.         The\nplaintiff must prove a prima facie case, availability of balance of\nconvenience in his favour and his suffering an irreparable injury\n   in the absence of grant of injunction. According to Kerly (ibid,\n  para 16.16) passing-off cases are often cases of deliberate and\n  intentional misrepresentation, but it is well settled that fraud is\n  not a necessary element of the right of action, and the absence\n  of an intention to deceive is not a defence, though proof of\n  fraudulent intention may materially assist a plaintiff in\n  establishing probability of deception.    Christopher Wadlow in\n  Law of Passing-Off (1995 Edn., at p. 3.06) states that the\n  plaintiff does not have to prove actual damage in order to\n  succeed in an action for passing-off. Likelihood of damage is\n  sufficient. The same learned author states that the defendant's\n  state of mind is wholly irrelevant to the existence of the cause of\n  action for passing-off (ibid, paras 4.20 and 7.15). As to how the\n  injunction granted by the court would shape depends on the\n  facts and circumstances of each case. Where a defendant has\n  imitated or adopted the plaintiff's distinctive trade mark or\n  business name, the order may be an absolute injunction that he\n  would not use or carry on business under that name (Kerly, ibid,\n  para 16.97).\"\n",

He also drew \n     our attention to the report of  Justice  Rajgopal Ayyangar Committee \n                       \n     which opined that the defence of the invalidity should be available \n     to   the   defendant,   but   recommended   that   the   issue   of   invalidity \n      \n\n     should not be decided by the Court but should be decided in the \n     rectification   application.     This   may   have   been   the   view   of   the \n   \n\n\n\n     Committee constituted to recommend changes in the enactment, but \n     at the highest, it was only a material placed before the legislature at \n\n\n\n\n\n     the  time  of  enactment  of this statute.   The fact remains  that  the \n     words \"if valid\" and \"prima facie evidence\" were incorporated in the \n     statute.     Furthermore,   the   question   of   referring   to   any   external \n\n\n\n\n\n     material would arise if the language of the statute was ambiguous. \n     As we have already held that the words \"if valid\" and \"prima facie \n     evidence\" are clear enough upon plain reading of them and it is not \n     necessary  to   adopt  any other rule  of interpretation, except  literal \n     interpretation.\n",

The Apex Court disposed of the appeal by considering \n\n\n\n\n\n     whether there was any prima facie case of infringement and whether \n     there was any passing off.

It is true that  Section  \n                        \n            28(1) confers the right on the registered proprietor if the  \n            registration is valid.

A suit was filed by the respondents against the appellant herein for permanent injunction and recovery of damages under sections 105 and 106 of the Trade and merchandise Marks Act, 1958 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) read with section 1962 of the Copyright Act, 1957. The suit is in respect of Snap Fasteners and the respondents claimed relief against packaging with the colour scheme orange and grey and a lay out and get up identical or deceptively similar being used by the appellant to that of the respondents under the copyright of 'Pony Card' and/or use of the trademark '555' and/or impugned cards bearing the trademark '555' apart from claiming a money decree for damages. Respondent no.1 stated in the plaint that they were a subsidiary of a British manufacturer of hand sewing needles, kitting pins and other similar products and during its growth benefited from the technology and skilled personnel from respondent no.2. There was a license agreement between the two respondents during the period 1963 to 1981 to manufacture press studs. Respondent no.1 further claimed that it had sold products bearing trademark '555' during the period from 1963 to 1981. it was further alleged in the plaint that though the license agreement between the two respondents came to an end in 1981 the trademark '555' had till the date of the suit been retained on the trademark registered and continues to retain much residual goodwill and reputation in the Indian market and the same was further supplemented and enriched by respondent no.2's sales and publicity of the product bearing the said trademark in a large number of countries throughout the world. A claim was also made in respect of the product of respondent no.1. bearing 'Pony Card' which is stated to have been regularly advertised in major journals all over the world. Details of sales were given for the period 1979 to 1993-94. It was further alleged in the plaint that respondent no.1 came to know of the appellant marketing the product and infringing the rights of the respondents in around June, 1993 and consequently sent a legal notice dated 23rd June, 1993. Certain communications ensued between the appellant and respondent no.1 in respect of the claim of respondent no.1 but no settlement was arrived at the and consequently the suit was filed. \n",
        "p_3": " 2. The appellant resisted the suit of the respondents. Plea of undue delay and latches was raised as the appellant claimed that they had been using the trademark and label entitled \"V.R.\" with the device of SWAN and numerals 555 since the year 1989 for Spring Snab Fasteners. The plea was raised int he written statement that assuming the existence of license agreement alleged by the respondents, the admitted position was that the agreement had expired in 1981 and the trademark 555 had never been used in India either in respect of Spring Snab Fasteners or any such allied product at any time by the respondents. Thus it was claimed that since no goods were sold under the alleged registered trademark '555' in the Indian market , there was not question of effecting any sales. \n",

This application was disposed of by the impugned order dated 28th March, 2000. In terms of this order the learned Single Judge was of the view that there cold not be any confusion in the mind of the customer while purchasing the same type of goods as the features of the two cards were distinctive and the plaintiff was not entitled to injunction in respect of the card with which the fasteners were begin displayed and sold to the customers. However, insofar as the question of use of the figure '555' as trademark was concerned, the learned Single Judge came to the conclusion that the registration of the mark in favor of the respondents coupled with the adoption of the mark by the appellant not being honest the respondents were entitled to a restraint order against the appellant from using the said trademark '555' or any other mark deceptively similar to the same. \n",
        "p_5": " 4. The appellant aggrieved by the said restraint order preferred the present appeal. The appeal was admitted on 4th May, 2000 and the operation of the impugned order was stayed.

        "p_6": " 5. Mr. R.K. Aggarwal, learned counsel for the appellant, drew our attention to the fact that the learned Single Judge had found that the impugned labels/cards of both the parties were entirely different yet proceeded to injunct the appellant from the use of the trademark '555'. The learned counsel contended that the respondents had never used the trademark for the last 40 years in India except for the period 1977 to 1979. The learned counsel referred to the fact that admittedly the license agreement between the two respondents did not survive after 1981 and there had been no user for the trademark in India at least since that date. Mr. Aggarwal, further contended that the respondents had failed to substantiate their claim of global reputation or any advertisement in India since no document for the same was filed on record. \n",
        "p_7": " 6. The suit is also claimed to have been filed belatedly and thus suffered on grounds of delays and latches as admittedly the cause of action in para 36 of the plaint was stated to have arisen in June, 1993 while the suit was filed in 1995. Further submission was made by learned counsel for the appellant that respondents were not granted any interim injunction till the date of the impugned order on 29th March, 2000 which order was also stayed by the Division Bench on 4th May, 2000. \n",
        "p_8": " 7. Mr. R.K. Aggarwal, learned counsel for the appellant, submitted that the findings of the learned Single Judge to the effect that plea of non-user had not been taken in the written statement by the appellant was not borne out of the record because the appellant throughout the written statement had contended that the respondents were not using the trademark in India. Learned counsel has also impugned the finding of learned Single Judge to effect that the respondents had placed on record invoices to show that at least till 1981 the goods with the trademark '555' were begin exclusively sold in India. Learned counsel drew our attention to the invoices filed on record to show that the same related only for a brief period of about a year and a half between 1977 and 1979. Similarly the finding of the learned Single Judge in respect of the reputation of the goods of the respondents in India in 1960's and 1970's was stated to be not borne from the record as there was nothing placed on record to substantiate the same. It was thus the submission of learned counsel for the appellant that the non-user of the trademark over a long period of time is fatal for the owner of the trademark when it approaches the court of law for its protection since the trademark cannot exist in vacuum. The claim of global reputation has to be substantiated by documentary evidence and in the absence of the same it was contended that the respondent had made out no case for the same. \n",
        "p_9": " 8. Mr. Aggarwal further contended that the use of mark has to be continuous, open, regular and uninterrupted and very registration of the mark would not given any right or entitlement to the owner of the mark to claim monopoly over the same until and unless it was in use. The use of the trademark was claimed by the counsel for the appellant to be superior to the registration of the mark. The equities were claimed to be in favor of the appellant as also the balance of convenience because the appellant had been using the impugned label for more than last 11 years while the respondents had not been using the trademark at least since 1981. The last submission advanced on behalf of the appellant by Mr. Aggarwal is that the label has to be compared as a whole and not in insolation. It was contended that the composite mark/label has to be compared without the same being dissected. \n",
        "p_10": " 9. Mr. R.K. Aggarwal, learned counsel for the appellant, referred to the documents filed on behalf of the respondents to substantiate its claim of sales and submitted that they were for sales in 1979 in India and the remaining were for the sales in Hongkong and not in India or anywhere else. Thus it was contended that the respondents had failed to establish any worthwhile reputation in the world for the sale of the product of entitle them to any protection in terms of the judgment in  N.R. Gongre & Ors. vs. Whirlpool Corporation & Anr. . \n",
        "p_11": " 10. Learned counsel referred to various judgments to substantiate his contentions. Mr. Aggarwal referred to the judgment of the Supreme Court in  Corn Products Refining Co., vs. Shangrila Food Products Ltd. . The Supreme Court observed in para 15 as under:- \n",
        "p_12": "  \"Now of course, the presence of a mark in the register does not prove its user at all. It is possible that the mark may have been registered but not used. It is not permissible to draw any inference as to their user from the presence of the marks on the register.\" \n",
        "p_13": " 11. The learned counsel next referred to the judgment of the court of appeal in  Imperial Group Ltd. vs. Philip Morris & Co. Ltd. 1982 FSR 72 and drew our attention to certain observation in the judgment which are as under:- \n",
        "p_14": " \"Unlike a copyright, a trademark does not arise from the mere use of a word or words or a formula or a mark; it derives from the use of words or marks in relation to a course of trade in gods giving rise to a goodwill connecting the trader with the goods by reason of the trade mark under which the goods are marketed. It follows that where, in relation to particular goods, there is no such course of trading as to give rise to a goodwill, there is no interest to be protected by a trademark and no such mark can subsist in vacuo.\" \n",
        "p_15": " \"...In my judgment \"a bona fide course of trading\" involves a trading activity pursued with the primary intention of deriving from it a trading profit coupled with a trading goodwill, these begin the ultimate and legitimate objectives of trade.\"  \n",
        "p_16": " 12. The learned counsel for the appellant relied on  Cluett Peabody & Co. Inc. vs. Arrow Apparels 1998 PTC (18) 156. The Bombay High Court considered the issue of delay as a defense when the mark had been copied and agreed with the submissions of learned counsel for the defendants that in a suit for infringement of trademark priority in use could not be dishonest. The High Court observed that the right of exclusive use is acquired by user or by registration or by assignment but the essential feature for constituting the proprietary in trademark is that it should be used by the proprietor in his business or in connection with his vendible commodity. The court was of the view that though the delay by itself was not a defense but non-user of the mark loses its distinctiveness. A trademark which drops out of the use dies for non-user. Where there are no goods offered for sale, there is no use of trademark. \n",
        "p_17": " 13. The learned counsel for the appellant, to substantiate his contention that the label has to be read as a whole and could not be dissected, referred to the Division Bench judgment of this court in  Kellog Company vs. Pravin Kumar Bhadabhai 1996 PTC (16) 187. The Division Bench was of the view that the trade dress or rather the whole thing must be seen in its entirety and not parts in isolation. The case of  Schewappers Ltd. vs. Gibbens (1905) 22 RPC was referred to where it was held that the fraudulent intention could not be presumed in respect of the similarities in the bottle of Sodawater labels and colours because the distinguishing feature of the name adopted show that it had not intention of deceiving the purchasers. Observation in this case were quoted with approval to the effect that  \n\n  \"and if a person is no careless that he does not look and doe not,... treats the label fairly but takes the bottle without sufficient consideration and without reading what is written very plainly indeed up - the face of the label on which the trader has placed his own name, then you certainly cannot say he is deceived - in fact, he does not care which it is. That would be the true interference which I think a person would draw from conduct so described.\" \n",
        "p_18": " 14. Lastly the learned counsel in support of his plea of equity and balance of convenience referred to the judgment of  Synthetic Moulders vs. Samperit Samperit Aktieregeselshaft 1980 RLR 263 to contend that interim injunction should be granted against the alleged infringer only if the equities are in his favor and he moves the court without delay. The Division Bench of this court in  Synthetic Moulders case (supra) was of the view that mere registration of the trademark would not establish rights under section 28 of the Act to grant temporary injunction and that the balance of convenience in granting temporary injunction has to be determined by relative amount of damage which is likely to result after the injunction is granted and the plaintiff ultimately fails. (Stated to be as per Kerly Trademarks and Tradenames, 10th Edition paragraph 15.65). \n",
        "p_19": " 15. Mr. Naveen Chawla, learned counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, contended that the design of the label and the use of trademark '555' was to give a distinct impression to the public that the appellant was a successor to the product of respondent no.1 Mr. Chawla, strongly relied on the failure of the appellant to even seek the cancellation of the registered trademark of the respondents '555' which was so registered in 1951. \n",
        "p_20": " 16. Mr. Chawla while referring to the various provisions of the Act submitted that there were rights conferred under section 28 of the Act and the registered proprietor of the trademark had the exclusive right to use the trademark in relation to the goods in respect of which the trademark was registered. Section 29 refers to the infringement of the trademarks. We may clarify here that section 29(2) provides that in an action for infringement of a trademark registered in Part B of the registered an injunction or other relief was not liable to be granted to the plaintiff if it was established to the satisfaction of the court that the mark was not likely to deceive or cause confusion  between the goods of the parties. Section 31 provides registration to be prima facie evidence of validity and section 46 provides for the removal from the register and imposition of limitation on ground of non-use. In terms of section 46(1)(b) a trademark may be taken off the register in respect of any goods of which it is registered on an application begin made in the prescribed manner on the ground that up to a date one month before the date of application, a continuous period of 5 years or longer had elapsed during which the trademark was registered and during which there was no bonafide use thereof in relation to those goods by any proprietor for the time being. \n",
        "p_21": " 17. Thus Mr. Chawla contended that the appellant if so aggrieved by the non-user by the respondents, was entitled in law to seek cancellation under section 26(1)(b) of the Act which admittedly the appellant had not done. It was thus contended that in an infringement action the registered user was entitle to an injunction if the mark was being used by another party. it was further contended that no plea was raised in the written statement by the appellant as to why the figure '555' was being used by him and thus the balance of convenience was in favor of dropping the said mark. It was further contended that no issue in the suit had been framed on account of non-user by the respondents. It was also contended that admittedly, there was prior to adoption of the mark by the respondents apparent from sales figures having been given since at least 1979. Mr. Chawla referred to the judgment of Supreme Court in  Ruston &Hornsby Ltd. vs. The Zamindara Engineer Co.  to point out the distinction between an infringement action and a passing of action. It would be useful to reproduce the relevant passages of the judgment which are as under:- \n",
        "p_22": " \"3. The distinction between an infringement action and a passing off action is important. Apart from the question as to the nature of trademark the issue in an infringement action is quite different from the issue in a passing off action. In a passing off action the issue is as follows:- \n",
        "p_23": " \"Is the defendant selling goods so marked as to be designed or calculated to lead purchasers to believe that they are the plaintiff's goods? \n",
        "p_24": " But in an infringement action the issue is as follows:- \n",
        "p_25": " \"Is the defendant using a mark which is the same as or which is a colourable imitation of the plaintiff's registered trademark.\" \n",
        "p_26": " 4. It very often happens that although the defendant is not using the trademark of the plaintiff, the get up of the defendant's goods may be so much like the plaintiff's that a clear case of passing off would be proved. it is on the contrary conceivable that although the defendant may be using the plaintiff's mark the get up of the defendant's goods may be so different from the get up of the plaintiff's goods and the prices also may by so different that there would be no probability of deception of the public. Nevertheless, in an action on the trade mark, that is to say in a infringement action, an injunction would issue as soon as it is proved that the defendant is improperly using the plaintiff's mark. \n",
        "p_27": " 5. The action for infringement is a statutory right. It is dependent upon the validity of the registration and subject to other restrictions laid down in sections 30, 34 and 35 of the Act. On the other hand the gist of a passing off action is that A is not entitled to represent his goods as the goods of B but it is not necessary for B to prove that A did this knowingly or with any intent to deceive. \n",
        "p_28": " 6. xxxx  \n\n \n\n",
        "p_29": " 7. In an action for infringement where the defendant's trademark is identical with the plaintiff's mark, the Court will not enquire whether the infringement is such as is likely to deceive or cause confusion. But where the alleged infringement consists of using nor the exact mark on the register, but something similar to it, the test of infringement is the same in an action for passing off. In other words, the test as to likelihood of confusion or deception arising from similarity of marks is the same both in infringement and passing off actions. \n",
        "p_30": " 18. The learned counsel then referred to the judgment of  Kaviraj Pandi Durga Dutt Sharma vs. Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories  where the Supreme Court was of the view that if the essential features of the trade mark had been adopted the effect that the get up, packing and other written on the packets or the goods or on the packets in which the goods were offered for sale show mark differences or indicate clearly a trade origin different from that of the registered proprietor of the mark would be immaterial whereas in the case of passing of a party may escape liability if it can show that the added matter is sufficient to distinguish the goods of the parties. A reference was then made to a full bench judgment of this court in  Metro Plastic Industries (Regd) vs. M.S. Galaxy Footwear New Delhi 200 PTC 1 (FB). The Full Bench while dealing with the provisions under the Designs Act, 1911 observed that any application under section 51A of the Designs Act brings into could the registration of the design and in the absence of an application for cancellation of the design such a right can be enforced and no defense can be taken based on a ground of cancellation. This was to harmoniously construe the provisions of section 51A and section 53 of the Designs Act, 1911. A reference was also made to the judgment in  Phillip Morris Belgium S.A. vs. Golden Tobacco Co. Ltd. AIR 1986 Delhi 145 where learned Judge relied on the observation in the  Atlas Cycle Industries Ltd. vs. Hind Cycles Ltd. 2nd (1973) 1 Delhi 393 to observe: \n",
        "p_31": "  \"In an action for an alleged infringement of a registered trademark, it has first to be seen whether the impugned mark of the defendant is identical with the registered trademark of the plaintiff. If the mark is found to be identical no further question arises and it has to be held that there was infringement.\" \n",
        "p_32": " 19. Referring to the judgment in  Wearwell Cycle Co. (India) Ltd. vs. Wearwell Industries, Ludhiana  it was observed that the question of balance of convenience while dealing with the order 39 rules 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in case of a passing of action was relevant when prima facie the two parties were on the same level and their rights were about equal. This was stated to be not so where a defendant has adopted in toto the registered trademark of the plaintiff which made it a clear case of infringement casting away the consideration of any balance of convenience. \n",
        "p_33": " 20. Mr. Aggarwal, learned counsel for the appellant in his rejoinder referred to the judgment of Bombay High Court in  Consolidated Foods Corporation vs. Brandon and Co., Private Ltd.  to rebut the contentions advanced on behalf of the respondent and to advance his submission that mere registration without user would not give rights in law. \n",
        "p_34": " 21. We have considered the submissions advanced on behalf of he appellant by Mr. R.K. Aggarwal and on behalf of the respondents by Mr. Naveen Chawla. At the inception it may be stated that though the respondents have filed cross-objection but the same were not seriously pressed. Further, the learned Single Judge has eloquently dealt with the points raised in the cross-objections and had come to the conclusion that there cannot be any deception or confusion in the mind of the customer who wishes to purchase similar goods in the market. The appellant has the description of V.R. at the tope of the label with a device of Swan while in the case of the respondents the device of Pony is printed. Further the name of the manufacturer is displayed in case of the product both the appellant and the respondents prominently and thus the features of the two cards can be immediately noticed by customer. We are thus in full agreement with the conclusion of the learned Single Judge. \n",
        "p_35": " 22. In view of the aforesaid, the question which needs examination is the rights agitated by the respondents in respect of the registered trademark \"555\". Taking into consideration the submissions advanced on behalf of the appellant and the respondents the following aspects would require adjudication in the present appeal. \n",
        "p_36": " 1) The effect of the respondents being the registered owner of the trademark '555', taking into consideration the allegations of non-use by the appellant. \n",
        "p_37": " 2) Whether the respondents were able to establish prima facie any world-wide reputation and sales under the trademark. \n",
        "p_38": " 3) The effect of the composite label as a whole including the use of the word '555' and  \n\n \n\n",
        "p_39": " 4) The allegation of delay and lapse of time in filing of the suit from the stated date of cause of action in the plaint.  \n",
        "p_40": " 23. The primary aspect in our considered view which need sot be examined is the issue relating to the respondents being the registered user of the trademark and whether the allegations of non-use has any effect of the same. The counsel for the parties have taken use though the documents to show their sales. These are in the form of invoices and other materials. We find force in the submission of learned counsel for the appellant that the material placed on record shows sales only for a short period of time from 1977 to 1979. It is an admitted position that the inter - se license agreement between the two respondents did not survive after 1981, which prima facie show that there has been no sales by the respondent after 1981. Though the aspect of global reputation has been mentioned above, as the second issue, it would be pertinent to state at this stage that no material has been placed on record to substantiate this claim of global reputation. The invoices are fora limited period of time and some of the invoices relate to Hong Kong. There is also nothing on record to show any reputation of the goods of the respondents in India in 1960s and 1970s, as observed by the learned Single Judge. Thus we are also unable to agree with the factual finding of the learned Single Judge that there is material on record to show that there were sales by the respondents in India prior to 1981 other than for the period 1977 to 1979.  \n",
        "p_41": " 24. In view of the aforesaid factual position what has to be considered is whether the factum of the registration of the trademark in the name of appellant is sufficient to grant relief in favor of the respondents or whether something more is required. This has to be considered in view of the submission of learned counsel for the appellant that the trademark cannot exist in vacuum and in view of their being a non-user of trademark since 1981, the respondents are not entitled to any protection. \n",
        "p_42": " 25. The Bombay High Court has considered in depth a similar situation, though not identical, in the case of  Cluett Peabody's case (supra). It would be useful to refer to the said judgment while examining the said aspect. Similar pleas had been advanced in the said case by the registered owner of the trademark to the effect that the mark being registered is conclusive as to its validity and till and rectification is carried out, the registered owner is entitled to its exclusive use. It may, however, be stated that in  Cluett Peabody's case (supra) the opposite party had applied for rectification and removal of the plaintiff's name from the register while in the present case no such action has been taken by the appellant. It was the further contention by the registered owner that the non use of the mark in India was no defense to the infringement to the registered mark. The learned Single Judge of the Bombay High Court was of the view that the essential feature for constituting the proprietary right in trademark is that it should be used by the proprietor in his business or in connection with vendible commodity. \n",
        "p_43": " 26. Though delay be itself would not be a defense but if there was a non-user for a long period of time the mark would lose its distinctiveness or the mark is then permitted to die for non-user. The Bombay High Court observed \"It is well settled that lapse of time may bring about a change in the state of things in such a manner that to grant injunction in favor of the plaintiff's would be harsh and it may cause irreparable damage or harm to the rights of the defendants.\" Thus the Bombay High Court was of the view that non-use of trademark does have a bearing in action for infringement specially at the interlocutory stage and equities would have to be balanced in such a situation. The Bombay High Court had further laid down certain principles in this behalf which have been reproduced in the impugned judgment. In point (f) of the order dated 28th March, 2000 it is stated that the object of the Act is to protect the right and not be a source of monopoly. In point (j) it has been observed that a mark can lose its distinctiveness by non-user. Thus the enforcement of the right of exclusive use of a trade mark will depend on continuous use of the mark by the proprietor. In point (k) it has been observed that the court shall not protect the right of proprietor unless there is sale of the articles to which trade mark is attached or related. \n",
        "p_44": " 27. The learned Single Judge though has considered the observations in the  Cluett Peadbody's case (supra) was of the view that the said judgment would have no application to the facts of the present case as in view of learned Single Judge the plea about the non-user had not been taken in the written statement and further registration of the trademark gives to the registered proprietor the exclusive right to use the same in relation to the goods in respect of which the mark is registered. The first reason which weighted with the learned Single Judge, in our considered view, is not borne out of the records because in the written statement plea has specifically been taken of non-user by the respondents. Reference in this behalf may be made to para 7 and para 8 of the written statement. In para 8 the appellant specifically states \"since no gods under the alleged trademark '555' have ever been sold in the Indian markets there is no question of effecting any sales thereof to the tune of a single penny what to talk of the figures of the lakhs of rupees as alleged in para under reply of the plaint\". \n",
        "p_45": " 28. Thus we find that a specific plea has been raised about non-user and in view of the termination of the inter se agreement between the respondents in 1981 there is nothing to show any sales thereafter. Even prior to that date sales have been shown only for a short period of 1-1/2 years from 1977 to 1979. No material has been placed to show transborder sales or reputation in the product. \n",
        "p_46": " 29. We are in agreement with the view of the learned Single Judge of the Bombay High Court that if there is non-user for a long period of time then by mere registration of the mark continuing the respondents would not be entitled to any injunction. this view is further reinforced by the judgment in  Imperial Group's case (supra) wherein it was held that where there is no trading to give rise to a goodwill there is no interest to be protected by a trademark and such a trademark cannot exist in vacuum. \n",
        "p_47": " 30. Another aspect which is required to be considered is the contention of the appellant that for grounds of delays and latches the respondents is not entitled to any relief. There is no doubt about the proposition that mere delays and latches would not suffice if the rights were in respect of a registered trademark though it may have some bearing for consideration of injunction at the inter locutory state in weighing the balance of convenience. In terms of the cause of action paragraph 36 of the plaint, cause of action is stated to have arisen in June, 1993. Suit was filed in 1995. This fact has to be read along with the fact that the appellant had been using the card and the label with '555' mark at least since 1991. At the same time respondent no.1 has admittedly no production or sale in India since 1981. It is not even a case of production in India meant for exports. The trademark of '555' was registered in 1951. The only sales in India as per record are for a short period in 1977 to 1979 for a period of 1-1/2 years. All these factors taken together persuade us against granting any interim relief to the respondents. It may be relevant to add that there was no interim order granted in favor of the respondents when the suit was filed and the interim order was granted for the first time vide impugned order dated 28th March, 2000 which was also stayed by the Division Bench soon thereafter on 4th May, 2000. Thus the appellant has been carrying on the business with his label and card for the last more than 10 years. There has also not been any material placed on record to show that respondent no.1 has come back into business in India at any subsequent stage of time. We also draw strength from the Division Bench's judgment of this court in Synthetic  Moulders' case (supra) that while considering granting temporary injunction, the relevant amount of damage which is likely to result in case the plaintiff ultimately fails is also a factor to be considered. \n",
        "p_48": " 31. It is no doubt true that the appellant has failed to avail of the remedy under section 26(1)(b) of the Act for seeking cancellation of the mark but that would not be fatal for the appellant in the facts and circumstances of the case. \n",
        "p_49": " 32. There can be no doubt about the proposition that the considerations in an actin for infringement of a mark and in passing of action is different as set out by the Supreme Court in  Ruston & Hornsby's case (supra). However, in the present case the learned Single Judge himself found that there was distinctiveness between the two cards and labels and we have agreed with the said conclusion. The mere mention of the trademark '555' along with the other features prima facie, does not give any rights to respondent no.1, taking into consideration the non-user of the registered mark for over a long period of 40 years (except in a short intervening period of about 1-1/2 years from 1977 to 1979). \n",
        "p_50": " 33. On appreciation of the facts of the case we are unable to agree with conclusion of the learned Single Judge that the adoption of the trademark '555' is dishonest. Delay simpliciter may not be a defense in a suit for infringement of trademark but where a trader allows a rival trader to expend money over a considerable period in building up a business with the aid of a mark similar to his own he will not be allowed to stop his rivals' business. If he were permitted to do so great loss would be caused not only to the rival trader but to those who depend on his business for their livelihood. (Reference to Law of Trade Marks and Passing Off by P Narayanan, 5th Edition, page 441). \n",
        "p_51": " 34. It may, however, be pointed out that there can not be any hard and fast rule in determining the cut-off point when non-use of the registered mark would disentitle the trader to any protection. It would depends upon facts and circumstances of each case. \n",
        "p_52": " 35. There is another aspect to this matter. We are dealing with the matter at the interlocutory stage. The rights have yet to be finally decided in the suit. There can be protective mechanism when rights of two parties are balanced in appropriate manner. The alternative to the interim injunction can be to direct the appellant to maintain an account of profits every year and file the same in the court. We are persuaded to take this direction as the object of the Trade Mark Act is to protect the proprietary right of a registered trademark holder but not to be a source of monopoly where the holder of the trademark does not, prima facie, carry on business of over a long period of time, as in the present case. \n",
        "p_53": " 36. The result is that the appeal of the appellant the part of the judgment dated 23rd February, 2000 restricting the use of the trademark '555' is allowed and the impugned part of the judgment is set aside. The cross-objections filed by the respondents are dismissed. The appellant's application for interim relief is dismissed but subject to the condition of the appellant to maintain an audited account of profits every year, a copy of which shall be filed in the suit with an advance copy to the respondents on or before the 30th June. For the previous financial year the appellant shall file such accounts of the profit for the period commencing from 1st January, 1996 till date within a period of six weeks from the date of the present order. \n",
        "p_54": " 37. In the facts and circumstances of the case, the parties are left to bear their own costs. \n"

He has further stated that the learned Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks has failed to consider the application even in Section 12(3) of the Act. He has further stated that the learned Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks has completely misdirected himself in passing the order under Section 11(a) of the Act against the appellants. He has submitted that the learned Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks has failed to consider the fact that the prefix of a mark or a first syllabi is important while considering the rival marks as to whether they are identical or deceptively similar to each other. He has further stated that the learned Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks has erred in appreciating the fact that the appellants\" trade mark applied for is to be used in respect of schedule \"H\" drug. That the learned Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks has failed to consider that the mark applied for is an invented one and does not conflict with the trade mark ZOVIRAX of the respondent No. 1. The learned Assistant Registrar also failed to appreciate consider that the respondent No. 1 has not filed any evidence of user of the trade mark ZOVIREX in India.\n",
        "p_31": "4.2 The learned counsel has relied on the judgment of the Division Bench of this  court (Coram : R. Balia & A.R. Dave, JJ.) decided in OJ Appeal No. 11/93 decided on 8.12.1998. In that case the question before the Division Bench was as to whether the registration of trade mark \"Ulciban\" was deceptively similar to the trade mark \"CIBA\" of the opponent or not. The Division Bench was pleased to make following observations:\n",
        "p_32": "\"In comparing two work marks to find out what is the essential feature of the mark in use and the mark proposed to be used, the first syllable provides an important guideline which is of utmost importance in the word mark.\n",
        "p_33": "The test of relative resemblance between comparative marks must depend upon whether the proposed mark contains element of earlier mark in its essential character in prominent way. If the same is used with its projection in any manner prominently, so as to create an impression that addendums are superfluous, the same may be ignored and the substance of the matter may be seen, but at the same time, merely because those very letters in the same order are part of a different word, which is independent of other, the latter can not be denounced by straining to find out similarity. The likelihood of deception must be in ordinary and spontaneous reaction to the marks and not through a strained of an expert.\n",
        "p_34": "In this connection, it is very relevant that somebody buying a prescribed drug is not really concerned with trade origin of the drug. He is most concerned with what has been prescribed by the doctor. Moreover, as we have noticed above, confusion can be caused in three ways, confusion as to goods, confusion as to trade origin and confusion as to trade connection. In the matter of dispensation of medicinal preparation, test relates to trade origin or trade connection is not of much importance inasmuch as average man of common intelligence who has to purchase drugs on doctor's prescription is not concerned either with trade origin or trade connection, but with the goods itself. This confusion which is likely to be caused in that field attracts more importance than other factors.\n",
        "p_35": "What is to be considered in the context of inhibition under Section 11 is the probable effect of normal and fair use of applicant's mark and not by assuming strained and unfair abnormal use by any unscrupulous men and public. In other words, the test is by assuming that mark sought to be registered is to be used in fair and normal way and by user in such way, what is its probable effect vis-a-vis impression of actual user of the opponent's mark. \n",

However, in the present case, this case is of the opinion that the defendants have made out a strong prima facie case that they have used the mark right from 1985 to the knowledge of the World at oarge and without any interruption.\" The court on page 180 observed as under:\n",

All the advertisements are post 1991. I am not inclined to rely upon the advertisements of 1980 in TIME magazine. There is nothing to indicate that TIME magazine in 1980 was available on the counter in India. In fact, it is contended by the defendants that TIME magazine was not available to the public in India during the relevant period. There is no evidence of the reputation of the plaintiffs coming to India before 1985. Therefore, taking into the above facts, there is a strong effect of delay on the nature of the relief and I am not inclined to grant injunction in favour of the plaintiffs.\"  \n",

        "p_50": "5.1 The proposed trade mark of the appellant TROVIREX can not be registered as the use of which would be likely to deceive or cause confusion and which is identical with or deceptively similar to the already existing registered trade mark of the respondent ZOVIREX under Section 11(a) and Section 12(1) of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958.\n",
        "p_51": "5.2 The test to be applied in determining whether two marks are identical with or too nearly resembles each other or is likely to deceive or cause confusion or deceptively similar is in nutshell the test of an average person with imperfect recollection. The court has to visualise a customer or a tradesman or a citizen who may happen to have dealings with the company complaining or who may happen to want to purchase the goods manufactured such company and decide whether such a customer or tradesman or citizen would get confused and whether an ordinary citizen who may have occasion to deal with the company in the course of business dealings would mistake one for the other.\n",
        "p_52": "5.3 On perusal of the record he does not find any evidence that the mark applied for is in respect of schedule \"H\" drug and the goods, as revealed by the applicants (i.e. appellants) in their application are medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations but all medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations are not schedule H drugs as per the drugs and cosmetic rules. Since there is no mention of any specific drug in respect of which the mark applied for is proposed to be used, it can not be taken that the mark applied for is in respect of schedule H drugs.\n",
        "p_53": "5.4 That though such medicines like that of an appellant may be sold on doctor's prescription, but it is not unknown that the same are also available across the counter in shops of various chemists. It is also not unknown that the chemists who may not have TROVIREX may give ZOVIREX to an unwary purchaser with imperfect recollections. In the present circumstances Doctor's prescription factor has lost is importance since the reality of the situation can not be ignored. In India scheduled drugs\nwhich are to be sold under doctor's prescription are even sold without production of\ndoctor's prescription and as such reduces the weightage that can be given to this\naspect of the matter while considering the question deceptive similarity. The marks\nTROVIREX and ZOVIREX are so identical and deceptively similar to each other\nthat it outweighs the weightage to be given to the factor that the goods are scheduled\ndrugs.\n",
        "p_54": "5.5. The respondent's trade mark is international trade mark has acquired an international reputation and good will and is registered in almost all the countries across the globe including India.

Thus, the respondent is not required to show the actual performance or volume of sales in India. A company with a reputation which is established internationally can sue to protect it in this country even if it does not have any business activity here.\n",
        "p_55": "5.6 In other words, reputation of a product may precede its introduction and may exist without trade in such product in the country. Where the two products in question were pharmaceutical preparations with deceptive similarity and the foreign manufacturer company choose the name first and use it on its product in several countries around the world excluding India whereafter the Indian company entered the market with their product and the foreign company together with certain Indian pharmaceutical companies set up a joint venture company for sale of its products in India and had applied for registration of the disputed trade mark before the Registrar of Trade Marks. Indian company can be restrained from using the trade mark. Moreover, if it is possible for a purchaser of the Indian Company's product in India to do so under the impression that he is buying the foreign company's product, the Indian company as the subsequent adopter of the mark must be restrained from doing so. Further, once the foreign product is released in the Indian market, the consequences may well prove disastrous given the fact that in India drugs are available without prescription.\n",
        "p_56": "5.7 Even if the appellant confines its mark to antiviral drug scheduled H or confines its sale within the territory of India. The possibility of likelihood of the confusion or deceptive similarity between the two marks can not be eliminated as the respondent is already treading with the goods under the trade mark ZOVIREX in India. Even if it is assumed that the respondent is not trading in India, by confining the trading within the territory of India by the appellant would not eliminate the chances of likelihood of confusion and deceptive similarity.\n",

The drug only to be sold to hospitals and institutions for treatment of the same disease. The Trial Court did not grant injunction and also the High Court did not grant injunction. Thereafter, the matter went to the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The Hon'ble Supreme Court after considering its earlier decisions including judgment in the case of F. Hoffmann-la Roche & Co. Ltd. v. Geoffrey Manner & Co. Pvt. Ltd., 1969(2) SCC 716 on page 760 at para 31 has observed as under :\n",

It attempts to portray the nature and, if possible, the quality of the product and over a period of time the mark may become popular. It is usually at that stage that other people are tempted to pass off their products as that of the original owner of the mark. That is why it is said that in a passing off action, the plaintiffs right is \"against the conduct of the defendant which leads to or is intended or calculated to lead to deception. Passing off is said to be a species of unfair trade competition or of actionable unfair trading by which one person, through deception, attempts to obtain an economic benefit of the reputation which other has established for himself in a particular trade or business. The action is regarded as an action for deceit\" (See Wander Ltd. v. Antox India Pvt. Ltd., (1990 Suppl SCC 727)\"  \n",

        "p_62": " \"Public interest would support lesser degree of proof showing confusing similarity n the case of trademark in respect of medicinal product as against other non-medicinal products. Drugs are poisons, not sweets. Confusion between medicinal products may, therefore, be life threatening, not merely inconvenient. Nothing the frailty of human nature and the pressures placed by society on doctors, there should be as many clear indicators as possible to distinguish two medicinal products from each other. It is not uncommon that in hospitals, drugs can be requested verbally and/or under critical pressure situations. Many patients may be elderly, infirm or illiterate. They may not be in a position to differentiate between the medicine prescribed and bought which is ultimately handed over to them. This view finds support from McCarthy on Trademarks, 3rd Edition, para 23.12 of which reads as under:\n",
        "p_63": "\"The tests of confusing similarity are modified when the goods involved are medicinal products. Confusion of source or product between medicinal products may produce physically harmful results to purchasers and greater protection is required than in the ordinary case. If the goods involved are medicinal products each with different effects and designed for even subtly different uses, confusion among the products caused by similar marks could have disastrous effects. For these reasons, it is proper to require a lesser quantum of proof of confusing similarity for drugs and medicinal preparations. The same standard has been applied to medicinal products such as surgical sutures and clavicle splints.\" On page 262 at para 35 it is held as under:\n",
        "p_64": "\"Broadly stated in an action for passing off on the basis of unregistered trademark generally for deciding the question of deceptive similarity the following factors to be considered :\n",
        "p_65": "5.11 As regards earlier judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of S.M. Dyechem Ltd. v. Cadbury (India) Ltd. (supra), a three Judge Bench of the Supreme Court has partly dissented from ratio of the said judgment in the case of Cadila Health Care Ltd. (supra). The Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed in paragraph Nos. 18,19,20 thus :-\n",
        "p_66": "\"Para 18 - We are unable to agree with the aforesaid observations in Dyechem's case (supra). As far as this Court is concerned, the decisions in the last four decades have clearly laid down that what has to be seen in the case of a passing off action is the similarity between the competing marks and to determine whether there is likelihood of deception or causing confusion. This is evident from the decisions of this Court in National Sewing Thread Co, Ltd's case, (AIR 1953 SC 357), Com. Products Refining Company's case, (1960 (1) SCR 968), Amritdhara Pharmacy's case, (AIR 1963 SC 449), Durga Dutt Sharma 's case, (AIR 1965 SC 9'30\\ Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. Ltd's case (supra). Having come to the confusion, in our opinion incorrectly, that the difference in essential features is relevant, this Court in Dyechem's case (supra) sought to examine the difference in the two marks \"Piknic\" and \"Picnic\". It applied three tests, they being (1) is there any special aspect of the common feature which has been copied ? (2) mode in which the parts are put together differently i.e. whether dissimilarity of the part or parts is enough to make the whole thing dissimilar and (3) whether when there are common elements, should one not pay more regard to the parts which are not common while at the same time not disregarding the common parts ? In examining the marks, keeping the aforesaid three tests in mind, it came to the conclusion, seeing the manner in which the two words were written and the peculiarity of the script and concluded that \"the above three dissimilarities have to be given more importance than the phonetic similarity or the similarity in the use of the word PICNIC for PIKNIK.\n",
        "p_67": "Para 19 - With respect, we are unable to agree that the principle of phonetic similarity has to be jettisoned when the manner in which the competing words are written is different and the conclusion so arrived at is clearly contrary to the binding precedent of this Court in Amritdhani's case (supra) where the phonetic similarity was applied by judging the two competing marks. Similarly, in Durga Dutt Shanna's case (supra), it was observed that \"in an action for infringement, the plaintiff must, no doubt, make out that the use of the defendant's mark is likely to deceive, but where the similarity between the plaintiffs and the defendant mark is so close either visually, phonetically or otherwise and the court reaches the conclusion that there is  an imitation, no further evidence is required to establish that the plaintiffs rights are violated.\"\n",
        "p_68": "Para 20 - Lastly, in Dyechem's case (supra) it was observed in para 54 as under:\n",
        "p_69": " \"As to scope of a buyer being deceived, in a passing off action, the following principles have to be borne in mind. Lord Romer LJ. has said in Payton & Co. v. Snelling Lampard & Co., (1900) 17 RPC 48 that it is a misconception to refer to the confusion that can be created upon an ignorant customer that the courts ought to think of in these cases is the customer who knows the distinguishing characteristics of the plaintiffs goods, those characteristics which distinguish his goods from other goods in the market so far as relates to general characteristics. If he does not know that, he is not a customer whose views can properly be regarded by the Court. (See : the cases quoted in N.S. Thread & Co. v. Chadwick & Bros., AIR 1948 Mad. 481 which was a passing off action). In Schweppes' case, (1905) 22 RPC 601 (EL) Lord Halsbury said, if a person is so careless that he does not look and does not treat the label fairly but takes the bottle without sufficient consideration and without reading what is written very plainly indeed up the face of the label, you cannot say he is deceived.\" \n",
        "p_70": "These observations appear to us to be contrary to the decision of this Court in Amritdhara's case (supra) where it was observed that the products will be purchased by both villagers and townfolk, literate as well as illiterate and the question has to be approached from the point of view of a man of average intelligence and imperfect recollection. A trade may relate to goods largely sold to illiterate or badly educated persons. The purchaser in India cannot be equated with a purchaser of goods in England. While we agree that in trade mark matters, it is necessary to go into the question of comparable strength, the decision on merit in Dyechem's case (supra) does not, in our opinion, lay down correct law and we hold accordingly\". \n",

        "p_72": "\"Para\" 26 - It was further submitted on behalf of the appellant that although the possibility of confusion in a drug being sold across the counter may be higher, the fact that a drug is sold under prescription or only to physicians cannot by itself be considered a sufficient protection against confusion. The physicians and pharmacists are trained people yet they are not infallible and in medicines, there can be no provisions for mistake since even a possibility of a mistake may prove to be fatal.\n",
        "p_73": "Para 27 - As far as present case is concerned, although both the drugs- are sold under prescription but this tact alone is not sufficient to prevent contusion which is otherwise likely to occur. In view of the varying infrastructure for supervision of physicians and pharmacists of medical profession in our country due to linguistic, urban, semi-urban and rural divide across the country and with high degree of possibility of even accidental negligence, strict measures to prevent any confusion arising from similarity of marks among medicines are required to be taken.\" \n",

A mark shall not be registered as trade mark provided the use of which would be likely to deceive or cause confusion. Section 12 of the Act also provides prohibition of registration of identical or deceptively similar trade marks. However, Section 12(3) of the Act provides for an exception to the Trade Mark Act. In view of the same, the learned counsel for the respondent stated that therefore, the meaning of likelihood of confusion and deception is an important aspect. For that purpose the learned counsel for the respondent has relied on Halsbury's Laws of Bngland, 4lh Edition, Volume 48, para 163 on page 114-Para 163 reads that :-\n",
        "p_85": " \"Establishing deception or confusion - To establish a likelihood of deception or confusion in an action for passing off where there has been no direct misrepresentation generally requires the presence of two factual elements ; (1 that a name, mark or other distinctive feature used by the plaintiff has acquired a reputation among a relevant class of persons; and (2) that members of that class will mistakenly infer from the defendant's use of a name, mark or other feature which is the same or sufficiently similar that the defendant's goods or business are from the same source or are connected. While it is helpful to think of these two factual elements as two successive hurdles which the plaintiff must surmount, consideration of these two aspects cannot be completely separated from each other, as whether deception or confusion is likely is ultimately a single question of fact. \n",

The perception of marks in the mind of the average consumer of the category of goods or services in question plays a decisive role in the global appreciation of the likelihood of confusion. The average consumer normally perceives a mark as a whole and does not proceed to analyse its various details.\" \n",

        "p_94": "  \"The sort of confusion required to satisfy this provision is confusion as to origin. It is not enough that on seeing the mark the subject of the application, the earlier mark is \"called to mind\" if there is no possibility of the customer being under any misapprehension as to the origin of the goods or services. The mere association which the public might make between two trade marks as a result of their analogous semantic content is not in itself a sufficient ground for concluding that there is a likelihood of confusion within the meaning of the provision.\" \n",

While it is helpful to think of these two factual elements as two successive hurdles which the plaintiff must surmount consideration of these two aspects, cannot be completely separated from each other, as whether deception or confusion is likely is ultimately a single question of fact.\n",

        "p_106": "7. The learned counsel for the respondent stated that in view of the above submission and the authorities cited, particularly, judgment in the case of Cadila (supra) the respondent is able to prove that the trade mark of respondent 'Zovirex' and another trade mark 'Zovirax' is likely to cause confusion and deceptively similar to the applicant's proposed trade mark namely, Trovirex'.\n",
        "p_107": "  7.1 In my view the function of trade mark is to give an indication to the purchaser or possible purchaser as to the manufacture of quality of the goods to give an indication to his eye of the trade source from which the goods come, or the trade hands through which they pass on their way to the market. It tells the person who is going to buy, that the product presented to him is either what is known to him under the similar name as coming from a source with which he is familiar or that it is what he has heard of before as coming from that source. It gives the purchaser a satisfactory assurance of the mark and quality of the article he is buying, particular quality being not discernible by the naked eye. It is on the faith of the mark being genuine and representing a quality equal to that which he has previously found a similar mark to indicate, that the purchaser makes his purchase. \n",
        "p_108": "8. In my view the finding of the Registrar of Trade Marks that both the marks have the highest degree of resemblance visually as well as phonetically and the word Trovirex' is deceptively similar to the opponent's registered trade marks 'Zovirax' and 'Zovirex' is correct. The word 'Trovirex' is so nearly resembling to opponent's registered trade mark 'Zovirex' so as to cause confusion amongst general public i.e. an average man with imperfect recollection. In my view both the conditions specified under Sections 11 and 12(1) of the Act are satisfied and therefore the objection raised by the opponent in his opposition should be considered as well founded and the application of the applicant for registering the trade mark 'Trovirex' should be rejected. This court therefore confirms the order and finding of the Registrar in this behalf. In my view the opinion of the Registrar should not be lightly disturbed because he has an expert knowledge in the matter.\n",
        "p_109": "9. I have considered the submissions of Mr. R.R. Shah, learned advocate for appellant. The proposed trade marks are of such a nature as to deceive the public as to quality and origin of goods and therefore the said trade marks must be refused registration by the Registrar in this behalf.\n",
        "p_110": "9.1 I have considered the submissions of the counsel for the respondent Company Mr. Vyas which I set out in paragraph Nos. 5.1 to 5.9. In my view when the Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks having held that use of 'TROVIREX' (petitioner's application) would likely to deceive or cause confusion within the meaning of Section 11(a) and having held that the petitioner's trade mark TROVIREX' is identical with and deceptively similar to the trade mark of the respondent 'ZOVIREX' and 'ZOVIRAX' has rightly not exercised the discretion in favour of the petitioner by allowing the petitioner to have its trade mark registered under Section 12(3) of the Trade Mark Act as Section 12(3) empowers the Registrar to permit registration only under Section 12 of the Trade Marks Act but the said discretionary power cannot be extended beyond Section 12 especially when the trade mark in the present case is not only found likely to deceive or cause confusion under Section 12(a) but also found identical with or deceptively similar to the respondent's trade mark under Section 11 of the Act. In my view the Registrar of Trade Mark was right in not exercising the discretionary power under Section 12(3) as the same requires as a condition precedent of the honest concurrent use which is lacking in the present facts of the case.\n",
        "p_111": "9.2 In my view, the respondent has successfully proved that the petitioner's proposed mark is of such a nature as to deceive the public or cause confusion. The respondent is able to establish that if the petitioner's trade mark application is allowed then the said trade mark by virtue of:\n",
        "p_112": "10. As pointed out by this court in the case of Simatul Chemical Industries Pvt. Ltd. v. Cibatul Limited, 19 GLR 315 deception between two trade marks is not only concerned with two persons but is concerned with the consumers and interest of general public will have to be seen and therefore in any view of the matter the registration asked for by the petitioner should not be considered in this behalf. The learned counsel has relied on para 9 on 327 which reads thus :\n",
        "p_113": "  \"In our opinion, in view of the law on the subject which appears to be firmly settled, it is futile to contend that the plaintiff Company cannot claim an injunction restraining the defendant-Company from carrying on its business in a name so deceptively similar as to cause confusion amongst those who may be concerned in dealings with it. Just as a citizen is entitled to protection in respect of his movable and immovable properties, he is also entitled to seek protection in respect of his proprietary rights in goodwill. As the Court will not permit theft of the property of a citizen, it will not permit the theft of the goodwill earned by a citizen. There is also another dimension of the matter. The consumers require to be protected if there is any danger of confusion being caused in their mind and there is likelihood of their being led into believing that the product in reality manufactured by X is manufactured by Y or by someone connected with Y. When a consumer or customer effects a purchase, he is entitled to be assured of the fact that he is purchasing the very goods that he wants and the goods manufactured by a concern in which he has confidence and not goods manufactured by another concern whom the consumer or the customer does not know and that too by reason of the fact that he is deceived into believing that the product is manufactured by the former though it is in fact manufactured by the latter.\" \n",
        "p_114": "11. In my view the probability of confusion and deception is more because the trade marks are used in relation to the pharmaceutical products i.e. similar goods. In my view in this case the deception and confusion of goods clearly established.\n",
        "p_115": "12. In view of the same I confirm the order of the Registrar and dismiss the appeal filed by the appellant in this behalf with no order as to costs.\n"

        "p_2": " (1) The plaintiff has filed the suit claiming the propriety right in trade mark Vijayan for selling locks and handles. The defendant is also using the same trade mark Vijayan for selling the same product. Therefore, the plaintiff claiming to be the proprietor of trade mark Vijayan in relation to the manufacturing and marketing of locks and handles has come forward with the suit for injunction on the ground of passing off. At this interlocutory stage having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, I do not want to enter into the discussion at length because we can have the hang of the matter by recounting a few facts which will demonstrate the case of the plaintiff to be absolutely not true.   \n",
        "p_3": "(2) In para 5 of the plaint the plaintiff states: That the trade mark Vijayan Label of the plaintiff is duly registered under No. 532484 in respect of All types of locks & handles in Class 6 of the Fourth Schedule of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. He further stated that the said trade mark was advertised in trade marks Journal No. 1099 dated 16.03.,1995. The said trade mark is registered as from 2nd day of July 1990. By virtue of the said registration, the plaintiff has acquired exclusive rights to use the said trade mark in relation to the goods for which it is registered within the meaning of Section 28 of the Act and it is, therefore, not possible for any one else to make use of the same trade mark in respect of the same or same description of goods without the leave and license of the plaintiff.   \n",
        "p_4": "(3) Mr. Parveen Anand, learned counsel for the defendant submitted that the suit is founded on fraud; two registrations are claimed by the plaintiff, one is cancelled and other is on the way of being cancelled and for the purpose of establishing a case of passing off, the plaintiff has not produced sufficient materials. In the Trade Marks Journal appearing the June 16, 1996 at page 522 the following advertisement is made: Re-advertisement under Section 20(2) previous advertisement as 536465 (1099) Vi and mark is cancelled. Advertised before acceptance under Section 20(1) proviso 536465 - September 6, 1990, Rakesh Kumar Aggarwal trading as R.M.V Hardware & Electricals, 13/303, Mamun Bhanja Street, Aligarh 202001. (U.P) Manufacturers and Merchants, User claimed since the year 1981. To be associated with No. 532484 (1099) Vi (BOMBAY). All types of locks and handles in class 6. Registration of this trade mark shall give to right to the exclusive use of the word Real appearing on the label. It may be noticed that the trade mark is associated with No. 532484. The learned counsel for the defendant produced a letter dated 03.10.1996 from the Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks, Government of India, Trade Marks Registry, Central Building, M.K. Road, Mumbai - 400 020 in the following terms: Sub : Registered Trade Mark No. 532484 in Class 6. With reference to the above Registered Trade Mark, the Registrar of Trade Marks proposes to rectify the Register under Section 56(4) of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 by removing the mark now on the Register in respect of the above trade mark on the following grounds:- 1. The Trade Mark under No. 532484 in Class 6 was not distinguishly advertised in Trade Marks Journal No. 1099 at page 1648 dated 16.03.1995. 2. In view of this, the aforesaid mark would not proceed to registration in terms of Section 23 of the Act and therefore the entry made in the Register in respect of the above mark is without sufficient cause and wrongly remaining in the Register by an error. Notice is accordingly hereby given to you under Section 56(4) of the Act as to why the impugned Trade Mark should not be removed from the Register forthwith. You should submit your reply to the aforesaid notice to the under signed in the form of a statement within one month from the date of this notice, setting out fully the facts upon with you rely to meet the grounds stated in the notice or alternatively file request for a hearing in respect of these proceedings, if no reply of this notice is received within time the application to be proceed as per the provisions of the Act and Rules. This clearly shows the trade mark 532484 is on the way of being cancelled.   \n",
        "p_5": "(4) Learned counsel for the plaintiff Mr. K.G. Bansal, stated that no doubt that such letter has been received and that cannot be taken into account for the purpose of considering the interlocutory application because the plaintiff will give explanation to the show cause notice and it has to be considered on its merits by the Registrar therefore, the claim of the plaintiff on the ground of registration prima facie is not sustainable.   \n",
        "p_6": "(5) Then comes to the question of passing of. Though in the advertisement which I have referred to, reference is made to the user of the plaintiff from 1981. No such claim is made in the plaint and reference is made to the user in the year 1946 which has not been substantiated by producing any material. In Para 4 of the plaint it is stated that the plaintiff adopted the trade mark Vijayan from 1946 but it is not explained as to why before the user the plaintiff represented the user to be from the year 1981.   \n",
        "p_7": "(6) The defendant filed Ia No.6010/96 under Order 39 Rule 4 CPC. It is stated in the petition that the defendant is a prior user and prior applicant for registration and, therefore, a genuine proprietor of the trade mark VIJAYAN. The defendant had applied for registration in the year 1984 and the same was numbered as 424147 in class 6 as of 10th July 1984. The plaintiff's documents show that he filed an application for the identical mark which was numbered as 532484 in class 6 as from 2nd July 1990. It is no doubt true that the plaintiff's application was considered and the mark was registered subsequently. The defendant also pointed out that the defendant's application was advertised in the Trade Mark Journal 1002 dated 01.03.1991 whereas the application of the plaintiff was advertised in the Trade Marks Journal No 1099 dated 16th March 1995.   \n",
        "p_8": "(7) In para D of the main para (2), the defendant had stated thus: The fraud played by the plaintiff on the public and members of the trade is apparent from the manner in which its impugned mark under No. 532484 in class 6 was advertised in Trade Marks Journal No. 1099 dated 16th March, 1995, an extract whereof is filed herein. The advertisement of the plaintiff's said application appeared without any sign or trace of the word Vijayan, simply as a black coloured rhombus. In the manner in which the mark was advertised, the defendant did not have an opportunity to oppose the trademark Vijayan since that was not the mark of the plaintiff nor the mark advertised in Trade Mark Journal No. 1099 in class 6 as application No. 532484. The mark as advertised was unknown, and bears no resemblance, except in outline, to trademark registration No. 532,484 in class 6. As a result, the defendant has come to know of the false claims staked by the plaintiff to the impugned mark through these proceedings wherein the plaintiff has disclosed its socalled trademark registration number. The attention of this Hon'ble Court is invited to the fact that the very purpose of advertisement of an application in the Trade Mark Journal, is to give an opportunity to parties who may be potentially aggrieved by the registration of the mark in the applicant's favour to file their objections thereto in the form of an opposition.   \n",
        "p_9": "(8) In para E, the defendant has stated as to how the plaintiff had acted in trying to get the registration of the mark. In para E it is stated thus: In consequence of the above disclosed facts, the defendant submits that the plaintiff can claim to have used either of two marks, namely: a) the one advertised in Trade Mark Journal No. 1099 dated 16th March, 1995 at page 1648: or b) the one shown in the photocopy of the certificate for use in legal proceedings under No. 532,484 at page 28 of its documents. In the first case, the plaintiff's application, as advertised, is a blank rhombus devoid of any word mark which would not confer any right at the registration stage in respect of the word VIJAYAN. Hence, assuming without admitting that the said mark was registered, it would not entitle the plaintiff to restrain use of the trademark Vijayan by the defendant. If the plaintiff's case is the second one,d the registration - as obtained by the plaintiff pertains to a trademark which has not been advertised as per the requirements of Section 20 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958, read with Rule 46 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Rules, 1959. Hence, again, the mark is not validly registered. Even otherwise, the Trade Marks Registry was dutibound not to process the advertised mark. There has, therefore, been an inexplicable lapse on the part of the Registry due to which the certificate of registration granted in the plaintiff's favour cannot be deemed to be even prima facie proof of the validity of the impugned mark. The inescapable consequence of the manner in which the pdlaintiff's mark was advertised is that the registration granted to the plaintiff thereupon is void ab initio and a nullity, and the registration cannot withstand the test of validity for even a minute because there is an irreconcilable difference between the trademark of the plaintiff which was advertised in the Trade Mark Journal and that which is shown in its certificate for legal proceedings filed at page 28 of its documents. The defendant submits that this reason alone is sufficient to justify an immediate suspension and/or vacation of the injunction order dated 7th May 1996 granted against the defendant. The defendant had stated that it has been using the trade mark Vijayan in respect of locks and locking devices ever since the year 1960. The defendant has also given the sales figures. The defendant has also stated that the plaintiff has no figure relating to the advertisement made by the plaintiff. It is also stated by the defendant that it issued a notice dated 07.05.1996 to the plaintiff to suspend the business.   \n",
        "p_10": "(9) The plaintiff has filed the reply to the application under Order 39 Rule 4 Civil Procedure Code by the defendant and has filed certain annexures. Annexure A relates to the Sales Tax Registration of the defendant, and according to the plaintiff, as per this document the defendant has started the business only in 1993. Annexure B is the Carton wherein the trade mark is printed. Annexure C is application on Form TM-16 alleged to have been submitted by the plaintiff to the Registrar wherein the date of user should read as since 1946 and as per the assessment made in 1988. Annexure -D is again a communication from the Registrar of trade mark to the plaintiff about the advertisement to be made in the Journal. Annexure E is stated to be a deed of assignment of trade mark made on 02.11.1985 by one Babu Lal Agarwal, Proprietor M/s Agarwal Metal Foundry. It is not stated as to why this document was not filed alongwith the plaint. The fact whether there was any assignment or not now claimed in reply can be taken in to account only at the time of trial of the case.   \n",
        "p_11": "(10) The principle of law relating to passing off is well settled and there are in numberable decisions expounding the law on the point. Number of authorities were cited by the learned counsel for the parties and I do not want to deal with them because it will be only a unnecessary exercise when I had to consider the facts of this case in the light of the principles, as I said, which are very clear.   \n",
        "p_12": "(11) The plaintiff has not at all on the facts of this case, established his prior user and there has been an attempt on the part of the plaintiff to suppress the facts and project the facts which are not true. For the purpose of the application for injunction, prima facie the documents filed by the plaintiff do not establish the case of the plaintiff for the grant of injunction. Therefore, I need not dwell at length on the balance of convience. The litigant who has come forward with a false case is not entitled to any consideration. Accordingly, the Ia No. 4167/96 under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 filed by the plaintiff for injunction is dismissed. Ia No. 6010/96 under Order 39 Rule 4 filed by the defendant for vacation of stay is allowed. Post the matter for further proceedings on 17.12.1996.\n"

It was held by the court that the defendant herein has no prima facie case and balance of convenience was in favor of the present plaintiff. The court also held that if the plaintiff succeeded in the suit ultimately, he could claim refund of the amount, if paid by him towards the license fee. The court in its order had noticed that it was not the case of the plaintiff that he is not playing music by way of mechanical devices such as radio, cable T.V. etc. and that the defendant nos. 1 and 2 were authorized under the provisions of the Copyright Act, 1957 to collect the license fee.\n",
        "p_18": "9. The plaintiff has also proved before this Court a letter dated 15th December, 2003 received from the defendant herein whereby the defendant No. 2 requested the plaintiff to supply the copy of a license agreement to explore the possibility of an out of court settlement in C.S No. 14/2003 pending before the District Judge, Khurda, Bhubaneswar. As the defendants were not desisting from their illegal action, the plaintiff was constrained to file the present suit on or about the 19th August, 2005. The plaint was signed and verified by Mr. Hasan Kamal in his capacity as Chairman of the plaintiff. He has deposed an affidavit proving before this Court, the resolution dated 21st October, 2004 whereby he was authorized inter alia to sign and verify pleadings and to institute the legal proceedings. The resolution has been marked as Exhibit P-1.\n",
        "p_19": "10. Summons were issued by this Court to the defendants on 29th August, 2005. However, the defendants despite service by ordinary process as well as by registered post opted not to appear or contest the present case before Page 0681 this Court. In these circumstances, by an order passed on 23rd January, 2006 the defendants were directed to be proceeded against ex parte and the plaintiff was directed to lead ex parte evidence. Accordingly, the plaintiff has filed affidavits by way of evidence of its witnesses in support of the averments in the plaint.\n",
        "p_20": "11. When the suit was taken up on 29th August, 2005, the court had also granted an ad interim injunction in I.A. 6501/2005 which was in the following terms:\n",
        "p_21": " ...Accordingly, till the next date of hearing, the defendants, its agents, employees and all others acting on its behalf are restrained from playing of music by live of any other means, or by way of mechanical devices at the hotel operated by the defendants and/or channeling musical and or literary works of the plaintiff or those of its sister copyright societies, by way of mechanical devices such as Radio, Cable TV and / or P.A systems within the defendants' premises without paying a sum of Rs. 22,800/- and without obtaining a license from the plaintiff society and without paying the requisite royalties to the plaintiff in respect of the work.\n",
        "p_22": "12. Upon the failure of the defendants to appear and contest the application, the above injunction order was also confirmed by the court on the 23rd January, 2006.\n",
        "p_23": "13. The plaintiff has established that the defendant No. 2 continued with its illegal activities of playing music at its hotel premises in violation of the copyright possessed by the plaintiff therein without a license from the plaintiff and without making payment of the license fee. Consequently, the plaintiff raised a second invoice dated 17th of November, 2005 bearing invoice No. 2005-2006/3320 purporting to be on account of the license fee which would be due from the defendants for the period 1st of December, 2002 to 30th November, 2006. By this invoice, the plaintiff demanded a sum of Rs. 1,41,788.57/- from the defendant which demand has been exhibited as Exhibit P-40 before this Court. The plaintiff has contended that this amount is inclusive of the amount of Rs. 22,886/- demanded earlier by Exhibit P-37.\n",
        "p_24": "14. The further contention of the plaintiff is that the defendants have chosen to ignore the court process despite issuance of the injunction order and they continued to persist with their illegal activities. For this reason, the plaintiff is entitled to recover the amount of Rs. 1,41,788.57/- as actual compensatory damages from the defendants. On account of their continued illegal action, the plaintiff has claimed that it is further entitled to the sum of Rs. 18,58,211.42/- as punitive damages apart from the relief of permanent prohibitory injunction which has been noticed hereinabove. The statements made in the plaint and in the evidence on behalf of the plaintiff stand uncontroverter.\n",
        "p_25": "15. I find that there is no dispute to the averments in the plaint and the plaintiff has conclusively established its copyright in the musical and literary works which have been assigned in its favor by its members. Thus, it would appear that no person would have any right to undertake a public performance or communication to the public of such literary and musical work, exclusive rights in respect of which vest with the plaintiff as established from the assignment deeds proved as Exhibit P-4 to P-35 before this Court.\n",
        "p_26": "Page 0682\n \n\n",
        "p_27": "16. The defendant No. 2 had filed C.S No. 14/2003 in the court of the district Judge, Khurda at Bhubaneswar wherein he has admitted that such musical works are being played at the hotel and that it was unaware as to who was the real licensee to collect the fees under the statutory provisions. This fact was even noticed by the District Judge in the judgment dated 4th February, 2006 dismissing the injunction application filed by the defendant No. 2.\n",
        "p_28": "17. In the instant case, a further submission has been made that the defendants knowingly have opted not to appear before this Court. By this refusal, the defendants have adequately established their defiance and have refused to accede to the summons issued by the court. Placing reliance on the pronouncement of the Division Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court reported at  Bhagwandas Ramji Lal v. Watkins Mayer and Co., Jalandhar and Ors., it has been urged by Mr. Praveen Anand, learned Counsel for the plaintiff that such refusal amounts to a refusal to divulge details relating to the wrongful acts of the defendants before this Court and that in the face of such defiance and absence of details relating to the defendants' acts, this Court would be justified in raising all presumptions against the defendants.\n",
        "p_29": "18. Perusal of this judgment shows that it related to passing of an action wherein the court held that the plaintiffs were entitled to recoup the loss that they incurred as a direct and natural consequence of the defendants' wrongful action. In such a case, if the defendants refuse to produce their books of account showing the quantity of goods manufactured or sold by them during the period of infringement and profits earned thereon, the court would be justified in raising every presumption against them. It is their duty to produce their account books as the issue is within their special and exclusive knowledge.\n",
        "p_30": "19. The plaintiff has established before this Court that the defendants have knowledge of the illegality in their action. The plaintiff has also asserted that the defendants' illegal activities would have a cascading effect. The assignment of the copyright is effected in the favor of the plaintiff for the reason that the original owners of the copyrights who are lyricists, producers of music recording companies etc. are unable to enforce their rights or to effect recoveries. There can be no manner of doubt that the action of the defendants is blatant, deliberate and mala fide. Despite dismissal of the injunction application and the observations made by the District Judge, the defendants are persisting with their illegal action and have not made payment of the license fee demanded by the plaintiff. The plaintiff has consequently prayed for injunction and damages.\n",
        "p_31": "20. Apart from the factual matrix noticed above, I find that the plaintiff has laid a claim of compensatory and punitive damages. Several pronouncements have been cited at the Bar in support of the suit prayers. It therefore becomes necessary to examine the principles which govern award of such damages.\n",
        "p_32": "21. Damages have been traditionally defined as 'pecuniary compensation, obtainable by success in an action, for a wrong which is either a tort or a Page 0683 breach of contract' (Re: Broome v. Cassel & Co. 1972 AC 1027). Thus the traditional concept of damages is to compensate a claimant for loss and damage and can also be referred to as compensatory damages which are awarded to compensate a plaintiff for damages which he has suffered or is expected to suffer and to replace something that the plaintiff has lost or is expected to lose because of the wrongful act of the defendant. The primary purpose of the damages is to restore those losses to the plaintiff. However as tort litigation has evolved, we find that the concept of damages is not limited to compensation for loss and damages alone. Three kinds of damages are being awarded by courts which include nominal damages, exemplary damages and compensatory damages.\n",
        "p_33": "22. Nominal damages are usually awarded where a legal right of the plaintiff is found to be infringed and there is, however, no proof of actual loss. There may be another situation where nominal damages may be awarded which is a case where loss is shown, but there is no evidence as to its exact quantum.\n",
        "p_34": "The purpose of the award of nominal damages thus is vindicatory i.e. to mark the existence of the right in question as well as the fact of violation of such right of the plaintiff by the wrong doer who is the defendant.\n",
        "p_35": "Thus a notional amount may be awarded as such damages so as to vindicate the stand of the plaintiff and the claim lodged by him.\n",
        "p_36": "23. The next kind of damages are in the nature of compensatory damages which are awarded to compensate a plaintiff for the loss suffered by him and to put him in the same position as if the tort has not been committed. Such a loss may be a pecuniary loss or an intangible loss which would be non-pecuniary. The intangible loss would include mental and emotional distress apart from other incidents where the award of damages is intended to compensate for such distress.\n",
        "p_37": "24. So far as damages due to infringement of trademark are concerned, the traditional English approach has been to assess the same according to the extent of the plaintiff's or the claimant's loss. The established rule was that in the event of no loss being shown or no evidence with regard to the damages being led, no damages could be awarded or recovered.\n",
        "p_38": "25. In the United States the approach has been to assess damages for trademark infringement according to the extent of the plaintiff's loss and thereby, compensatory damages must be equal to the loss suffered by the individual victim. [Ref: Simon Greenleaf, A Treatise On The Law of Evidence see 253 at 242-43 (2d ed.1972)].\n",
        "p_39": "26. In India in a case reported at 481 IC 450 at p. 465 Lakpat Rai v. Sri Krishna Das, the Court held that where there is no evidence to calculate actual damages, it is not worthwhile to give damages other than nominal damages.\n",
        "p_40": "In AIR 1932 Rangoon 56 entitled Sally Mahomed Sulaiman v. Neogi & Co., the Court has held that the best evidence of such loss and damage is the loss of trade that the plaintiff has suffered during the period in which the defendant is importing the offending goods.\n",
        "p_41": "Page 0684\n \n\nThus so far as awarding compensatory damages is concerned, there has to be evidence of the plaintiff's loss.\n",
        "p_42": "It is also necessary to bear in mind that the basis of calculation of damages is entirely different from an account of profits of the defendant and the two remedies stand on the alternative footings.\n",
        "p_43": "27. The third kind of damages which are being considered more and more while considering cases of trademark infringement and passing of actions relates to award of exemplary damages, which are commonly known as punitive damages. Such damages can commonly be given in addition to compensatory damages. The expression 'punitive' masks a variety of specific purposes that such damages are intended to actually serve apart from the punishing element and the deterrent cause of award of such damages. Such damages have various other useful purposes which include, inter alia, retribution, deterrence, compensation, education and law enforcement. Some authors have suggested that such damages have the effect of deterring not only the defendant from repeating the offence, but also deter others from committing the same; preserving peace; inducing private law enforcement; compensating victims for otherwise uncompensable loss and the payments of the plaintiff's attorney's fees.\n",
        "p_44": "28. It would be topical and instructive to examine the principles laid down by the Supreme Court of the United States of America in a decision rendered on May 20, 1996 in BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore reported in 517 US 559. In this case the following guide posts were given as to the method of calculation of punitive damages:\n",
        "p_45": "(i) Reprehensibility: The Supreme Court held that 'perhaps the most important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitive damage award is a degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct.' In the case in hand, the Court noted that reprehensibility included economic torts which were present in the BMW case. It is also noted that conduct involving a substantial risk of bodily injury would be deemed more serious and more deserving of a sanction than pure economic torts.\n",
        "p_46": "(ii) Rationality in the award of damages: While emphasising that the primary goal in awarding punitive damages is to punish present conduct with the further objective of deterring future egregious conduct, the court, however, drew a note of caution emphasising that the punitive damages must rationally relate to the award of compensatory damages.\n",
        "p_47": "(iii) Imperative Criminal Penalty - the third guide post as indicated in the BMW case requires the Court to compare 'the punitive damages award' and the civil or criminal penalties that could be imposed for comparable misconduct.\n",
        "p_48": "29. In a later case decided on 7th April, 2003 entitled State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Campbell Et. Al reported at 538 U.S. 408, 2003, the Supreme Court provided a further useful guideline while considering rationality of the punitive damages award, where it stated that single digit multipliers are more likely to comport with due process, while still achieving the state goals of deterrence and detribution, than awards in the range of 500:1 or in this case 145:1.\n",
        "p_49": "Page 0685\n \n\nIn the State Farm case, the Supreme Court further emphasised that the application of punitive damages must be limited to harm related to the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_50": "30. In the United Kingdom, three common law categories have been identified where exemplary damages can be imposed.\n",
        "p_51": "One of such categories is where the defendant's conduct is calculated to make profits for himself which may exceed compensation payable to the plaintiff. Thus exemplary damages are imposed to prevent unjust enrichment (Reference - 1964 AC 1129 at 1226). The criterion which are utilised for calculation of punitive damages include conduct of the defendant, relevance of the compensation amount, relevance of criminal liability, means of the parties and moderation of the award. (Mc Gregor on Damages, 16th Edition at page nos. 461-470 ).\n",
        "p_52": "31. From the consideration of the foregoing, it would appear that law as applied and as has been evolved in the United States of America and United Kingdom, suggest that punitive damages would not be possible in isolation of compensatory damages. Where no compensatory damages are awarded, the implication would appear to be that the plaintiff has suffered no compensable injury. Receipt of exemplary damages, therefore, would be in the nature of a 'windfall award', which is imposed to serve a public law function.\n",
        "p_53": "32. In Toler v. Cassinelli 129 W.Va 591 : 41 S.E. 2d 672 (1946), it was held that 'finding of compensatory damages by a jury is an indispensable predicate to a finding of exemplary or punitive damages, and damages awarded by way of punishment must bear a reasonable proportion to compensatory damages so found.'\n \n\n",
        "p_54": "33. A case in which the question as to whether exemplary damages can be given without award of any compensatory damages, fell for consideration before the Supreme Court in  Common Cause v. UOI. Though the question was not directly answered, however, the Court held that in public law, it can be done. The Court also stated that in the case of punitive damages, it should be moderate and also keep in mind the means of the parties.\n",
        "p_55": "34. There have been several cases where the Court had awarded punitive damages in addition to compensatory damages. In this behalf, in 2005 (30) PTC 3 (Del), Time Incorporated v. Lokesh Srivastava and Anr., apart from compensatory damages of Rs. 5 lakhs, the Court also awarded punitive damages, emphasising that the award of compensatory damages to a plaintiff is aimed at compensating the plaintiff for the loss suffered by him, whereas the punitive damages are aimed at deterring a wrong doer and the like minded from indulging in such unlawful activities. Whenever an action has criminal propensity also, the punitive damages are clearly called for so that the tendency to violate the laws and infringe the rights of others with a view to make money is curbed. The punitive damages are founded on the philosophy of corrective justice and as such, in appropriate cases, these must be awarded to give a signal to the wrong doers that law does not take a breach merely as a matter between rival parties but feels concerned about those also who are not a party to the lis but suffered on account of the breach. The Court Page 0686 emphasised the distinction between compensatory damages and punitive damages which are noticed above and held thus:\n",
        "p_56": "7. ...Whenever an action has criminal propensity also the punitive damages are clearly called for so that the tendency to violate the laws and infringe the rights of others with a view to make money is curbed. The punitive damages are founded on the philosophy of corrective justice and, as such, in appropriate cases these must be awarded to give a signal to the wrong-doers that law does not take a breach merely as a matter between rival parties but feels concerned about those also who are not party to the lis but suffer on account of the breach. In the case in hand itself, it is not only the plaintiff, who has suffered on account of the infringement of its trademark and Magazine design but a large number of readers of the defendants' Magazine 'TIME ASIA SANSKARAN' also have suffered by purchasing the defendants' Magazines under an impression that the same are from the reputed publishing house of the plaintiff company.\n",
        "p_57": "8. This Court has no hesitation in saying that the time has come when the Courts dealing actions for infringement of trademarks, copyrights, patents etc. should not only grant compensatory damages but award punitive damages also with a view to discourage and dishearten law breakers who indulge in violations with impunity out of lust for money so that they realize that in case they are caught, they would be liable not only to reimburse the aggrieved party but would be liable to pay punitive damages also, which may spell financial disaster for them. In Mathias v. Accor Economi Lodging, Inc. 347 F.3d 672 (7th Cir. 2003) the factors underlying the grant of punitive damages were discussed and it was observed that one function of punitive damages is to relieve the pressure on an overloaded system of criminal justice by providing a civil alternative to criminal prosecution of minor crimes. It was further observed that the award of punitive damages serves the additional purpose of limiting the defendant's ability to profit from its fraud by escaping detection and prosecution. If a tortfeasor is caught only half the time he commits torts, then when he is caught he should be punished twice as heavily in order to make up for the reason that it is very difficult for a plaintiff to give proof of actual damages suffered by him as the defendants who indulge in such activities never maintain proper accounts of their transactions who they know that the same are objectionable and unlawful. In the present case, the claim of punitive damages is of Rs. 5 lacs only which can be safely awarded. Had it been higher even this Court would not have hesitated in awarding the same. The Court is of the view that the punitive damages should be really punitive and not flee bite and quantum thereof should depend upon the flagrancy of infringement.\n",
        "p_58": "In this case, the Court thus emphasised the intent of exemplary damages to punish the wrong doer and also emphasised the deterrent effect of the damages.\n",
        "p_59": "35. Another aspect of damages in cases relating to infringement of trademark and passing off action arose for consideration before this Court in the judgment Page 0687 reported at  Hero Honda Motors Ltd. v. Shree Assuramjit Scooters, wherein Court noticed that the plaintiff had claimed token damages and compensation of Rs. 5 lacs as it was not possible to determine the exact nature of damages at the time of filing of the suit. The punitive damages were not specifically claimed. Defendant had further opted to not appear before the Court and had stayed away from the proceedings. Consequently, it was successfully able to prevent the Court from having before it any evidence which would have been available, had its accounts been produced before the Court. In this case, the Court held that the plaintiff could not be prejudiced by the act of the defendant in staying away from the court proceedings. In this background the Court held that such defendant must suffer the consequences of damages, which would be awarded as stated and set out by the plaintiff. However, the Court issued a note of caution that the plaintiff could not be granted any irrational figure which may be claimed but while making the award of damages, it would be necessary to keep in mind the nature of deception alleged by the plaintiff which not only causes direct loss to the plaintiff, but also effects the reputation of the plaintiff by selling sub-standard goods and services in the market where the public may be deceived in buying the goods thinking the same to be that of the plaintiff. There is a larger public interest and purpose involved to discourage such parties from indulging in such acts of infringement and deception and , thus, even if the same has a punitive element, it must be granted. Placing reliance on the principles laid down in the Time Incorporated case (supra), it was further stated that punitive damages should be really punitive and should not merely flee bite. The quantum thereof should depend upon the flagrancy of the infringement. The courts also recognize the effort which the plaintiff has to put in contesting the offending traders in the market who continue with their illegal conduct with impunity and without any remorse. Thereby the plaintiff is compelled to utilize energy, funds and resources for contesting such litigation which could have been otherwise utilized in business promotion and expansion activities.\n",
        "p_60": "36. In CS (OS) No. 1385/2005 entitled The Heels v. V.K. Abrol and Anr., the plaintiff had claimed damages for a sum of Rs. 21 lacs on grounds of infringement of trade mark by the defendant. The defendant opted to stay away from the proceedings. In these circumstances, the Court noticed thus:\n",
        "p_61": "11. This court has taken a view that where a defendant deliberately stays away from the proceedings with the result that an enquiry into the accounts of the defendant for determination of damages cannot take place, the plaintiff cannot be deprived of the claim for damages as that would amount to a premium on the conduct of such defendant. The result would be that parties who appear before the court and contest the matter would be liable to damages while the parties who choose to stay away from the court after having infringed the right of the plaintiff, would go scotfree. This position cannot be acceptable.\n",
        "p_62": "12. No doubt it is not possible to give an exact figure of damages on the basis of actual loss, but certain token amounts on the basis of the sales Page 0688 of the plaintiff can certainly be made. The plaintiff is unnecessarily dragged into litigation and the defendants must bear consequences thereof. In fact in such a case both compensatory and punitive damages ought to be granted apart from the costs incurred by the plaintiff on such litigation. In view of the given sales figure of the plaintiff, I consider it appropriate to grant a decree of damages in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants for a sum of Rs 3 lakh apart from costs of the suit.\n",
        "p_63": "Thus the Court has awarded damages in favor of the plaintiff based on the sales of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_64": "37. In a judgment of this Court dated 24th April, 2006, rendered in CS(OS) 1333/2005 entitled Intel Corporation v. Dina Karan Nayar, again the defendant had failed to appear. The Court decreed the suit for permanent injunction and delivery up of the offending material placing reliance on the pronouncements on the Hero Honda Case and Time Incorporated case (supra), the Court awarded damages of Rs. 3 lacs as opposed to the amount of Rs. 20 lacs which had been prayed for by the plaintiff. In this case, the Court had noticed yet another reason for awarding punitive damages in this behalf in the Time Incorporated case (supra) the Court held thus:\n",
        "p_65": "6. The plaintiff has claimed a decree of Rs. 12.5 lacs on account of damages suffered by the plaintiff or an order of rendition of accounts of the profits illegally earned by the defendants by use of the impugned trademark. In view of the fact that the defendants have not chosen to turn up and face these proceedings, this Court is of the considered view that an order of rendition of accounts is fully warranted and called for. Damages in the sum of Rs. 12.5 lacs as claimed cannot be awarded on account of the fact that the plaintiff has not succeeded in proving on record as to how and on what basis these damages have been calculated. Damages of Rs. 5 lacs are claimed on account of loss of reputation of the plaintiff. These can be awarded inasmuch as the readers who might have read the defendants' 'TIME ASIA SANSKARAN' must have formed a very poor opinion about the plaintiff's Magazine and, as such, the reputation and goodwill of the plaintiff has suffered.\n",
        "p_66": "7. Coming to the claim of Rs. 5 lakh as punitive and exemplary damages for the flagrant infringement of the plaintiff's trademark, this Court is of the considered view that a distinction has to be drawn between compensatory damages and punitive damages. The award of compensatory damages to a plaintiff is aimed at compensating him for the loss suffered by him whereas punitive damages are aimed at deterring a wrong doer and the like minded from indulging in such unlawful activities. Whenever an action has criminal propensity also the punitive damages are clearly called for so that the tendency to violate the laws and infringe the rights of others with a view to make money is curbed. The punitive damages are founded on the philosophy of corrective justice and, as such, in appropriate cases these must be awarded to give a signal to the wrong-doers that law does not take a breach merely as a matter between rival parties but feels concerned about those also who are not party to the lis but suffer on account of the breach. In the case Page 0689 in hand itself, it is not only the plaintiff, who has suffered on account of the infringement of its trademark and Magazine design but a large number of readers of the defendants' Magazine 'TIME ASIA SANSKARAN' also have suffered by purchasing the defendants' Magazines under an impression that the same are from the reputed publishing house of the plaintiff company.\n",
        "p_67": "8. This Court has no hesitation in saying that the time has come when the Courts dealing actions for infringement of trademarks, copyrights, patents etc. should not only grant compensatory damages but award punitive damages also with a view to discourage and dishearten law breakers who indulge in violations with impunity out of lust for money so that they realize that in case they are caught, they would be liable not only to reimburse the aggrieved party but would be liable to pay punitive damages also, which may spell financial disaster for them.

The Court is of the view that the punitive damages should be really punitive and not flee bite and quantum thereof should depend upon the flagrancy of infringement.\n",
        "p_68": "38. It would be also instructive to consider the principles on which damages was awarded in the judgment dated 8th May, 2006 rendered in CS(OS) 1528/2003 entitled Hindustan Pencils Ltd. v. Aparna Enamel Industries reported at 2006 (131) DLT 65. In this case, the plaintiff had filed a suit for permanent injunction as well as damages against the defendant on allegations of infringement of its trade mark and copyright as well as deceptive passing off by the defendant in respect of the plaintiff's trademarks `Nataraj' and `Apsara'. Defendants were only seeking to make a difference by spelling `Nataraj' as spelt by the plaintiff, as `Natraj'. The Court on consideration of the matter passed a decree of permanent injunction offending the trademarks `Natraj' and `Apsara'.\n",
        "p_69": "So far as damages are concerned, the defendant had stayed away from the judicial proceedings and consequently enquiry into the accounts of the Page 0690 defendant for determination of damages could not take place. The Court held that if this was to flow as a result of the defendants remaining ex-parte, it would amount to \"a premium on the conduct of such defendant\". The observation of the Court on the aspect of damages is pertinent and reads thus:\n",
        "p_70": " 11. The last aspect to be considered is the question of damages. This Court has already taken a view in Hero Honda Motors Ltd. v. Shree Assuramji Scooters, , that even if the defendant stays away from the judicial proceedings, the plaintiff cannot be deprived of the claim for damages. This is so since the result of the defendant staying away from the judicial proceedings is that any inquiry into the accounts of the defendant for determination of damages cannot take place and a view to the contrary would amount to a premium on the conduct of such defendant. The result would be that parties who appear before the Court and contest the matter would be liable to damages while parties who choose to stay away from the Court after having infringed the right of the plaintiff would go scot-free. This position cannot be acceptable. No doubt it is not possible to give an exact figure of damages on the basis of actual loss, but certain token amounts on the basis of sales of the plaintiff can certainly be assessed. The plaintiff has unnecessarily been dragged into litigation and the defendant must bear the consequences thereof. I am of the considered view that taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case, the plaintiff is also entitled for a decree of damages against the defendants for a sum of Rs. 1 lakh apart from the cots of the suit. Decree sheet be drawn up accordingly.\n",
        "p_71": "In this case, the plaintiff had proved sales for the year 2000-01 as Rs. 95 crores and its expenses on advertisement to be in the range of Rs. 3 crores.\n",
        "p_72": "The defendants had herein also failed to enter into appearance in this case.\n",
        "p_73": "The Court granted a decree of permanent injunction and also awarded damages of Rs. 1 lakh. In this case also the Court had stated that it was not possible to give an exact figure of damages on the basis of actual loss but certain token amounts on the basis of sales of the plaintiff could be assessed.\n",
        "p_74": "39. Again in CS (OS) No. 2039/2003 entitled Mahendra & Mahendra Ltd. v. Ashwani Kumar, the plaintiff sought a permanent injunction restraining infringement of the plaintiff's copyright and trademark \"Mahindra\" including Mahendra and Mahendra coloured Wheel logo. The plaintiff had indicated that it had suffered tremendous losses which were well over Rs. 20 lacs. However, no evidence had been led by the plaintiff to indicate the amount of the loss or the extent of actual damages resulting to it. The Court was of the view that it would be sufficient if damages to the extent of Rs. 1 lakh were awarded in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant.\n",
        "p_75": "40. From the above discussion, it is evident that undoubtedly, assessment of damages has to be based on cogent evidence which is placed on record. The burden of proving damages as well as the facts which caused the damages is upon the plaintiff who has to adduce the best evidence in support of his case. The onus on the plaintiff to prove damages is not rendered lighter because the defendant does not appear and is ex parte or does not contest Page 0691 the case. So far as facts which are relevant are concerned, Section 12 of the Indian Evidence Act set out that any fact which enables the court to determine the amount of damages which ought to be awarded is relevant.\n",
        "p_76": "The most material evidence which would enable a court to arrive at a fair assessment of the gains which have accrued to a defendant by the acts complained of, would be a true and fair rendition of accounts by a defendant who is engaged in the acts of infringement. However, a defendant who is indulging in such illegal activity would obviously not maintain correct accounts and in any case would not place the material in respect thereof before the court. Therefore, it is left to the court to ascertain the probable level of sales of the defendant by other modes.\n",
        "p_77": "41. In an action for infringement of trademark, the profits made by the defendant also cannot always be the true criterion of the damages awardable to the plaintiff as the defendant's gain may not always be proportionate to the plaintiff's loss. However, it is trite that the plaintiff's loss or the defendant's gain will not be assumed in the absence of proof. The plaintiff is required to prove some distinct damage from the infringement of his trademark by defendant. The effect of the infringing acts of the defendant may be evidenced by the diminishing quantum of goods sold by the plaintiff for the reason that the defendant took away the plaintiff's customers. The defendant may also impact the plaintiff's customers. The defendant may also impact the plaintiff's business by causing him to sell its products at a lower price. In either event, there would be a reduction in either the total volume of the plaintiff's business or lowering in the percentage increase of business as compared to the previous years. Thus the measure of damage suffered by the plaintiff is to be found by an assessment of the profits the plaintiff would have made if the offending article had not been introduced by the defendant in the market or if the defendant had not undertaken the illegal activities complained of by the plaintiff. These facts have to be proved by the evidence on record either relating to the business of the defendants or which could be assessed from a decline in the business of the plaintiff on account of the activities of the defendant which could be gathered from the figures of sales over the period of time during which the defendant has continued with the activities complained of and an assertion of such loss by the plaintiff in its evidence.\n",
        "p_78": "42. Reference can usefully be made to the method for computation and award of damages in another pronouncement of this Court in  entitled Microsoft Corporation v. Yogesh Popat and Anr. In a suit by the plaintiff praying for a decree of prohibitory injunction, an order for delivery up to the plaintiff of the counterfeit/unlicensed copies of the plaintiff's software and other infringing material and for an order for rendition of accounts of profits illegally earned by the defendant by reasons of infringement of plaintiff's copyright including compensatory damages and a decree in the sum of the amount so ascertained, the Court has to consider the evidence led by the plaintiff. The defendant had opted to remain ex-parte and did not contest the suit. The Court noticed that the evidence on record established hard disc piracy by the defendants who were pirating software of the plaintiff and Page 0692 loading the same on the hard disc of computers sold by them without permission from the plaintiffs. Based on the popularity of the computer software of the plaintiff, the Court adopted an assumptive process whereby it based financial loss to the plaintiff on assumption of sale of 100 computers each year, which were loaded with pirated software. On such assumption, the Court arrived at a computation of loss of profits in the sum of Rs. 19.75 lacs. In this background, the Court decreed the suit in terms of the prayers in the plaint and awarded compensation/damages against the defendants in the sum of Rs. 19.75 lacs with interest @ 9% per annum from the date of decree till payment.\n",
        "p_79": "43. From the principles laid down in the afore-noticed judicial pronouncements, it is apparent that the punitive damages would necessarily follow an award of compensatory damages in favor of the plaintiff. The punitive damages also have to bear a fair ratio to the compensatory damages awarded to the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_80": "44. In the light of the foregoing discussion, I have no manner of doubt that the defendants have no right whatsoever of playing such music by any means within their premises, copyright whereof stands assigned to the plaintiff without obtaining the license from the plaintiff and without paying the requisite royalties thereby. The defendants have not been licensed by the plaintiff to do so.\n",
        "p_81": "45. The defendants have deliberately, knowingly and mala fide have admittedly played such music and thereby breached the copyrights of the plaintiff. They have persisted with their illegal actions despite objections of the plaintiff, and have effected public performances of the music which they could not do so without obtaining the license from the plaintiff and without paying the requisite royalties. The defendants deserve to be discouraged from their illegal actions by imposition of most stringent terms from playing music by any means at their premises in which the copyright vests with the plaintiff. Undoubtedly, the plaintiff is entitled to the amount of license fee for such action from the defendants.\n",
        "p_82": "46. The plaintiff has pointed out that the license fee due to it for the period from 1st December, 2002 to 30th November, 2006 is Rs. 1,41,788.57/-. There is no contest to the assertions of the plaintiff. The defendant has no right whatsoever for playing the music without obtaining the license from the plaintiff and without paying the royalties to the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_83": "47. The matter however does not rest here. As the defendants are persisting in their illegal and mala fide conduct and the plaintiff would be entitled to the injunction prayed for and the license fee for the period it continues to so act without license from the plaintiff and without payment of royalties. Apart from that, the defendant has with malafide intent caused the plaintiff to persist with the present suit.\n",
        "p_84": "48. The claim of the plaintiff that it is entitled to a sum of Rs. 18,58,211.42/- as punitive damages has gone unrebutted. However, in the light of the legal principles which guide award of punitive damages noticed above, award of the claimed amount would be grossly disproportionate to the claim of Page 0693 compensatory damages and highly excessive. An award of Rs. 3,00,000.00/- as punitive damages to the plaintiff would be fair and justified. The same is in the proximity of double the amount of compensatory damages and is being awarded having regard to the mandate in several judicial pronouncements that damages should not merely flee bite the defendant.\n",
        "p_85": "In these circumstances, I have no hesitation in decreeing the claim of the plaintiff and hereby pass a decree in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants for the sum of Rs. 1,41,788.57/- towards the actual and compensatory damages suffered by the plaintiff and the sum of Rs. 3,00,000.00/- as punitive damages. The plaintiff shall be entitled to interest at the rate of 10% per annum on these amounts from the date of decree till payment.\n",
        "p_86": "49. I hereby also pass decree of permanent prohibitory injunction restraining the defendants, its agents, employees and all others acting on its behalf from playing of music by live or any other means, or by way of mechanical devices at the hotel operated by the Defendants and /or channeling musical and/or literary works of the plaintiff or those of its sister copyright societies, by way of mechanical devices such as Radio, Cable TV and /or RA. systems within the defendants' premises without obtaining a license from the plaintiff Society and without paying the requisite royalties, thereby amounting to infringement of the plaintiff society's copyrights in the same.\n",
        "p_87": "50. The plaintiff would be entitled to cost of proceedings which are quantified at Rs. 50,000/-.\n",
        "p_88": "51. The suit is accordingly decreed in the above terms.\n"

        "p_53": "       19.     Mr. Bookwala contended that the Plaintiff\n               had abandoned the registered label mark.\n               Relying upon paragraph 8 of the plaint read\n               with Exhibit \"E\" thereto he submitted that\n\n\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013   Page 27 of 75\n                the mark actually used by the Plaintiff was\n               entirely different from the registered mark.\n               The registered mark he submitted had never\n               been used and must therefore be deemed to\n               have been abandoned. Exhibit \"E\" to the\n               plaint is a photograph of a bottle with the\n               label    affixed     thereon.   The    words\n               \"HAYWARDS 5000\" form not only an\n               important but a predominant part of the\n               label. These letters and numerals are in the\n               centre of the label and are about four times\n               the size of the letters and numerals of the\n               other material on the label. Reliance\n               however is placed on the fact that the label\n               in addition thereto contains considerable\n               other material. Firstly the word PREMIUM\n               is added to the registered mark. Below the\n               mark \"HAYWARDS 5000\" are the words\n               \"PREMIU M SUPER STRONG BEER\".\n",
        "p_54": "               Below these words is the device of a star\n               within a circle and below the same the\n               quantity is mentioned as 650 ml. Above the\n               mark are the words \"THE ORIGINAL\". The\n               use     of     this    additional    material,\n               Mr.Bookwalla contended, established that it\n               is not the registered trademark that has been\n               used by the Plaintiff but another trademark\n               altogether.\n",
        "p_55": "       20.     The added material in the present case does\n               not indicate that the Plaintiff has abandoned\n               the registered mark or the word mark\n               \"HAYWARDS 5000\". Nor does it indicate\n               that the label on the bottle containing the\n               Plaintiffs product does not constitute the use\n\n\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013   Page 28 of 75\n                of the registered label mark. The submission\n               that any variation or deviation from the\n               registered mark does not constitute use of\n               the registered mark is not well founded.\n               Indeed in most cases the label affixed on the\n               products or packages containing the\n               products would contain in addition to the\n               trademark, registered or unregistered, other\n               material. The added material may be of the\n               proprietors volition as well as on account of\n               statutory compulsion. For instance the\n               labels may contain the name of the entity\n               packing/bottling the goods, the name and\n               address of the manufacturer and the quantity\n               of the contents of the package upon which\n               the label is affixed. The label may also\n               contain certification obtained by the\n               manufacturer       and     the     proprietors\n               compliance with statutory requirements\n               whether compulsorily required to be stated\n               or not. If Mr. Bookwalla's submission is\n               accepted it would lead to the absurd result\n               that the mere introduction/mention of such\n               material would lead to the conclusion that\n               the registered mark has not been used and\n               consequently must be deemed to have been\n               abandoned by the proprietor thereof. So\n               long as the registered mark is used in\n               substantially the same manner in w hich it is\n               registered it must be deemed/considered to\n               constitute the use of the registered mark\n               itself. Where the use of a mark, registered or\n               unregistered, is apparent the mere addition\n               of material on the label or other material on\n               which it appears would not lead to the\n\n\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013   Page 29 of 75\n                conclusion that the mark has not thereby\n               been used. In either case the use of the mark\n               must be apparent to wit, the Court must be\n               satisfied that despite the added material the\n               trademark has been used. The use of the\n               mark must be as a trademark and must be\n               obvious/perceptible. The mark must not be\n               lost as a result of the added material for then\n               it is not to the use of the mark for the\n               purpose of an infringement or a passing of\n               action.\n",

Further, it is contended that the\n       adoption of the similar mark by B MSS was itself\n       dishonest and the alleged subsequent assignment to the\n       Defendant in 2010 was also malafide. In the facts of the\n       present case, BMSS being the assignors of the mark to\n       the Plaintiff in 2005 cannot claim that the alleged\n       adoption of identical or deceptively similar marks in\n\n\n\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013            Page 51 of 75\n        2008 was honest and as such cannot be permitted to set\n       up the defence of honest and concurrent user.

Thereafter , it\n       is contended that the products were not visible in the\n       market and therefore the Plaintiff did not take any\n       action. Plaintiff again came across the infringing\n       products in July 2013 when the second cease and desist\n       notice was issued and the present suit was filed.

The fact that BMSS under\n       whom the Defendant is claimed to have acquired rights\n       had entered into negotiations with the Plaintiff prima\n       facie establishes that even BMSS was aware that the\n       rival Marks were deceptively similar and it could not\n       use the said Marks without the permission of the\n       Plaintiff.\n",

Further, the Bombay High Court in the case of SKOL\n       B REWERIES (SUPRA ) laid down that so long as the\n       registered mark is used in substantially the same\n       manner        in    which        it    is   registered      it    must     be\n       deemed/considered              to     constitute      the   use    of    the\n       registered mark itself. Where the use of a mark,\n       registered or unregistered, is appa rent the mere addition\n       of material on the label or other material on which it\n       appears would not lead to the conclusion that the mark\n       has not thereby been used. In either case, the use of the\n       mark must be apparent to wit, the Court must be\n       satisfied that despite the added material the trademark\n       has been used. The use of the mark must be as a\n       trademark          and    must        be    obvious/perceptible.         The\n       mark must not be lost as a result of the added material\n       for then it is not to the use of the mark for the purpose\n       of an infringement or a passing of action.\n",

The plea of the Defendant that sale of liquor is licensed\n       and it can be marketed only if there is a license granted\n       and that it has a license duly approved by the excise\n       authorities and as such it is entitled to use the\n       impugned marks is also not sustainable. The mere fact\n       that the excise authorities have granted license to the\n       Defendant to market its product under a mark which is\n       similar to that of the Plaintiff would not in any manner\n       impinge upon the rights of the Plaintiff or dilute the\n       mark of the Plaintiff. The use of a trademark is\n       governed by the Trademarks Act, 1999 as also under\n       the common law. The excise authorities are not\n       authorities appointed under the Trademarks Act or\n       vested with the powers under the Trademarks Act. The\n       examination of a label by the authorities under the\n       Excise       Act    is    for a purpose            different than that\n       prescribed under the Trademarks Act for the Registrar\n       of Trademarks. The mere fact that the label of the\n       Defendant is approved by the excise authorities would\n       not permit or entitle the Defendant to use a mark which\n       is deceptively similar to the mark adopted by the\n       Plaintiff.\n",

Another relevant factor is that the 2005 Assignment\n       Deed is         an assignment            of    39    trademarks   for a\n       consideration of Rs. 17.50 Crores whereas the 2010\n       Assignment Deed is an assignment of 74 trademarks\n       and that also for a meager consideration of only\n       Rs.1000/-. It is though contended by the Defendant that\n       the 2010 Assignment Deed is part of a Business\n       Transfer Agreement. The said contention would not\n       prima facie make any difference as the said Assignment\n       Deed does not mention that there was any other sale\n       consideration coupled with the Rs. 1,000/- mentioned\n       therein.\n",
        "p_162": "119. Further contention of the Defendant that Annexure C is\n       blank is also of no consequence as the Defendant in its\n       written statement has itself contended that the Plaintiff\n       was using the logo or label different from the one that\n       was assigned implying thereby that it admits that\n       logos/labels were assigned even though they were not\n       enumerated in the agreement in annexure C.

(Company for short) is a \nPublic Limited Company incorporated under the \nCompanies Act, 1956 having its business at \nMumbai and Aurangabad in the State of \nMaharashtra. On October 13, 1989, the Company \nentered into an agreement with Radio Export \n(Moscow) for the supply of colour tubes, \nelectrolytic capacitors, transformers, etc., \nfor Rs.44,04,00,000/-. The payment was made by \nrespondent No.1 Company to Japanese and Korean \nsuppliers. But before any payment could be \nreceived by respondent No.1 from the USSR \nCompany, there was political turmoil in the \nUSSR and payment to foreign suppliers was \ndisrupted. On January 5, 1993, Additional \nDirector General, Directorate of Revenue \nIntelligence, Mumbai addressed a letter to the \nappellant alerting him about the activities of \nthe Company in connection with the agreement to \nsupply television sets to Radio Export, Moscow. \nBased on the information forwarded by the \nDirectorate of Revenue Intelligence, Bombay, \nthe appellant addressed two letters to the \nChief Manager of Indian Bank, Nariman Point, \nBombay requesting the Bank to supply details of \nthe export outstanding of the Company. Indian \nBank supplied necessary information and \nindicated that the export outstanding of the \nCompany was Rs.16,60,00,000/-. The Reserve Bank \nof India turned down the request of the Company \nfor reimbursement of differential amount \nremaining unpaid on the ground that the exports \nwere effected from Korea and Japan and not from \nIndia and the Company was not entitled to \nreimbursement. In pursuance of the summons \nissued under Section 40 of the Foreign Exchange \nRegulation Act, 1973 (hereinafter referred to \nas FERA), Raj Kumar Dhoot, Director of the \nCompany appeared before the Department on April \n25, 1999 and made a statement that there was an \nagreement between the Company and M/s Radio \nExport, Moscow for supply of two lakh \ntelevision sets and other equipments for \nRs.44,04,00,000/-. The amount was received by \nthe Company through State Bank of India, \nOverseas Branch, Bombay. He further stated that \nthe television sets had been procured from \nKorea and Japan who had been paid equivalent to \nRs.19,00,00,000/- in foreign exchange. Export \nbills raised from the sale to M/s Radio Export, \nMoscow were equivalent to Rs.16,00,00,000/-. \nWhereas the contract with the suppliers in \nKorea and Japan stipulated payment in US \nDollars, the contract with the USSR Company \nrequired payment in Indian Rupees. Since the \nvalue of Rupee against the US Dollar fell down, \nthe Company had to pay more Rupees to their \nforeign suppliers.

The High Court, by the \nimpugned order dated April 26, 2006, quashed \nthe proceedings initiated against the \nrespondents on the ground that cognizance could \nbe said to have been taken when process was \nissued and since process was issued in \nFebruary, 2003, the proceedings were time-\nbarred. The complaint was, therefore, quashed \nby the High Court. The said order is challenged \nby the appellant in the present appeal.\n",

        "p_9": "8.\t\tWe have heard the learned counsel for \nthe parties.\n",
        "p_10": "9.\t\tThe learned counsel for the appellant \ncontended that the High Court was in clear \nerror in equating taking cognizance of an \noffence with issuance of process and in holding \nthat the cognizance was taken after the period \nof limitation and hence the proceedings were \ntime-barred and liable to be quashed. It was \nsubmitted that FEMA came into force from June \n1, 2000 and under sub-section (3) of Section 49 \nof FEMA, cognizance of an offence under FERA \ncould have been taken within a period of two \nyears from the date of commencement of the new \nAct. It was submitted that cognizance was taken \nby the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Mumbai on \nMay 24, 2002, i.e. the day when complaint was \nfiled which was well within the period of \nlimitation provided by Section 49(3) of FEMA \nand as such the Criminal Court was within its \npower in issuing process and in proceeding with \nthe matter and the High Court was not justified \nin quashing the proceedings on the ground that \ncognizance was taken by the Court on February \n3, 2003 when process was issued by the Chief \nMetropolitan Magistrate, Mumbai. It was \nalternatively submitted by the learned counsel \nthat the relevant date for counting the period \nof limitation is not the date of taking \ncognizance or issuance of process by the Court \nbut the date of filing complaint. It was stated \nthat the point has been concluded by various \ndecisions of this Court. Since the complaint \nwas filed on May 24, 2002, which was within the \nperiod of limitation, the High Court was wrong \nin treating the criminal complaint as barred by \nlimitation and in quashing it. The order passed \nby the High Court, thus, deserves to be set \naside by directing the Chief Metropolitan \nMagistrate, Mumbai to proceed with the case and \ndecide it in accordance with law.\n",
        "p_11": "10.\t\tThe learned counsel for the \nrespondents, on the other hand, supported the \norder passed by the High Court. It was \nsubmitted that the High Court was wholly right \nin quashing the proceedings. Admittedly, \nprocess was issued in February, 2003 while \nunder Section 49(3) of FEMA, proceedings under \nthe old Act (FERA) could not have been \ninitiated after the expiry of two years from \nthe commencement of the new Act (FEMA). FEMA \ncame into force on June 1, 2000 and hence \ncognizance of an offence under FERA could have \nbeen taken under FEMA latest by June 1, 2002. \nIssuance of process in February, 2003, \ntherefore, was clearly time-barred and the High \nCourt was right in quashing the proceedings. It \nwas also submitted that the appellant was not \nright in submitting that the relevant date for \ncomputing the period of limitation is date of \nfiling of complaint. The material date is the \ndate of taking cognizance by a competent \nCriminal Court. Sub-section (3) of Section 49 \nof FEMA is a special provision, which must be \ngiven effect to and even on that ground, the \ncomplaint was barred by time. Finally, it was \nsubmitted that though the High Court had not \nconsidered the merits of the matter, the \nprovisions of FERA had no application to the \nfacts of the case as it cannot be said that the \naccused had committed any offence under FERA. \nConsidering the said fact also, this Court may \nnot interfere with the order passed by the High \nCourt in exercise of discretionary jurisdiction \nunder Article 136 of the Constitution. It was, \ntherefore, submitted that the appeal may be \ndismissed.\n",
        "p_12": "11.\t\tHaving heard learned counsel for the \nparties and having perused the relevant \nprovisions of law as also various judicial \npronouncements, we are of the view that the \nHigh Court was in error in equating issuance of \nprocess with taking cognizance by a Criminal \nCourt and in quashing the proceedings treating \nthem as time-barred.\n",
        "p_13": "12.\t\tThe expression cognizance has not \nbeen defined in the Code. But the word \n(cognizance) is of indefinite import. It has no \nesoteric or mystic significance in criminal \nlaw. It merely meansbecome aware of and when \nused with reference to a Court or a Judge, it \nconnotes to take notice ofjudicially. It \nindicates the point when a Court or a \nMagistrate takes judicial notice of an offence \nwith a view to initiating proceedings in \nrespect of such offence said to have been \ncommitted by someone. Taking cognizance does \nnot involve any formal action of any kind. It \noccurs as soon as a Magistrate applies his mind \nto the suspected commission of an offence. \nCognizance is taken prior to commencement of \ncriminal proceedings. Taking of cognizance is \nthus a sine qua non or condition precedent for \nholding a valid trial. Cognizance is taken of \nan offence and not of an offender. Whether or \nnot a Magistrate has taken cognizance of an \noffence depends on the facts and circumstances \nof each case and no rule of universal \napplication can be laid down as to when a \nMagistrate can be said to have taken \ncognizance. Chapter XIV (Sections 190-199) of \nthe Code deals with Conditions requisite for \ninitiation of proceedings. Section 190 \nempowers a Magistrate to take cognizance of an \noffence in certain circumstances. Sub-section \n(1) thereof is material and may be quoted in \nextenso.\n",

        "p_18": "13.\t\tChapter XV (Sections 200-203) relates \nto Complaints to Magistrates and covers cases \nbefore actual commencement of proceedings in a \nCourt or before a Magistrate. Section 200 of \nthe Code requires a Magistrate taking \ncognizance of an offence to examine the \ncomplainant and his witnesses on oath. Section \n202, however, enacts that a Magistrate is not \nbound to issue process against the accused as a \nmatter of course. It enables him before the \nissue of process either to inquire into the \ncase himself or direct an investigation to be \nmade by a Police Officer or by such other \nperson as he thinks fit for the purpose of \ndeciding whether there is sufficient ground for \nproceeding further. The underlying object of \nthe inquiry under Section 202 is to ascertain \nwhether there is prima facie case against the \naccused. It thus allows a Magistrate to form an \nopinion whether the process should or should \nnot be issued. The scope of inquiry under \nSection 202 is, no doubt, extremely limited. At \nthat stage, what a Magistrate is called upon to \nsee is whether there is sufficient ground for \nproceeding with the matter and not whether \nthere is sufficient ground for conviction of \nthe accused.\n",

        "p_27": "15.\t\tFrom the above scheme of the Code, in \nour judgment, it is clear that Initiation of \nProceedings, dealt with in Chapter XIV, is \ndifferent from Commencement of Proceedings \ncovered by Chapter XVI. For commencement of \nproceedings, there must be initiation of \nproceedings. In other words, initiation of \nproceedings must precede commencement of \nproceedings. Without initiation of proceedings \nunder Chapter XIV, there cannot be commencement \nof proceedings before a Magistrate under \nChapter XVI. The High Court, in our considered \nview, was not right in equating initiation of \nproceedings under Chapter XIV with commencement \nof proceedings under Chapter XVI.\n",

Abani Kumar Banerjee, AIR \n1950 Calcutta 437, the High Court of Calcutta \nhad an occasion to consider the ambit and scope \nof the phrase taking cognizance under Section \n190 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 \nwhich was in pari materia to Section 190 of the \npresent Code of 1973. Referring to various \ndecisions, Das Gupta, J. (as His Lordship then \nwas) stated:\n",
        "p_30": "What is taking cognizance has not \nbeen defined in the Criminal Procedure \nCode, and I have no desire now to \nattempt to define it.

C., he \nmust not only have applied his mind to \nthe contents of the petition, but he \nmust have done so for the purpose of \nproceeding in a particular way as \nindicated in the subsequent provisions \nof this Chapter,-proceeding under \nSection 200, and thereafter sending it \nfor enquiry and report under Section \n",
        "p_31": "202.

        "p_32": "18.\t\tR.R. Chari v. State of Uttar Pradesh, \n1951 SCR 312 was probably the first leading \ndecision of this Court on the point. There, the \npolice, having suspected the appellant-accused \nto be guilty of offences punishable under \nSections 161 and 165 of the Indian Penal Code \n(IPC) as also under the Prevention of \nCorruption Act, 1947, applied to the District \nMagistrate, Kanpur to issue warrant of arrest \non October 22, 1947. Warrant was issued on the \nnext day and the accused was arrested on \nOctober 27, 1947. On March 25, 1949, the \naccused was produced before the Magistrate to \nanswer the charge-sheet submitted by the \nprosecution. According to the accused, on \nOctober 22, 1947, when warrant for his arrest \nwas issued by the Magistrate, the Magistrate \nwas said to have taken cognizance of offence \nand since no sanction of the Government had \nbeen obtained before that date, initiation of \nproceedings against him was unlawful. The \nquestion before the Court was as to when \ncognizance of the offence could be said to have \nbeen taken by the Magistrate under Section 190 \nof the Code. Considering the circumstances \nunder which cognizance of offence under sub-\nsection (1) of Section 190 of the Code can be \ntaken by a Magistrate and referring to Abani \nKumar Banerjee, the Court, speaking through \nKania, C.J. stated:\n",
        "p_33": "It is clear from the wording of the \nsection that the initiation of the \nproceedings against a person commences \non the cognizance of the offence by \nthe Magistrate under one of the three \ncontingencies mentioned in the \nsection. The first contingency \nevidently is in respect of non-\n",
        "p_34": "cognizable offences as defined in the \nCriminal Procedure Code on the \ncomplaint of an aggrieved person. The \nsecond is on a police report, which \nevidently is the case of a cognizable \noffence when the police have completed \ntheir investigation and come to the \nMagistrate for the issue of a process. \nThe third is when the Magistrate \nhimself takes notice of an offence and \nissues the process. It is important to \nremember that in respect of any \ncognizable offence, the police, at the \ninitial stage when they are \ninvestigating the matter, can arrest a \nperson without obtaining an order from \nthe Magistrate. Under section 167(b) \nof the Criminal Procedure Code the \npolice have of course to put up the \nperson so arrested before a Magistrate \nwithin 24 hours and obtain an order of \nremand to police custody for the \npurpose of further investigation, if \nthey so desire. But they have the \npower to arrest a person for the \npurpose of investigation without \napproaching the Magistrate first. \nTherefore in cases of cognizable \noffence before proceedings are \ninitiated and while the matter is \nunder investigation by the police the \nsuspected person is liable to be \narrested by the police without an \norder by the Magistrate.\n",
        "p_35": "19.\t\tApproving the observations of Das \nGupta, J. in Abani Kumar Banerjee, this Court \nheld that it was on March 25, 1949 when the \nMagistrate issued a notice under Section 190 of \nthe Code against the accused that he took \ncognizance of the offence. Since before that \nday, sanction had been granted by the \nGovernment, the proceedings could not be said \nto have been initiated without authority of \nlaw.\n",
        "p_36": "20.\t\tAgain in Narayandas Bhagwandas \nMadhavdas v. State of West Bengal, (1960) 1 SCR \n93, this Court observed that when cognizance is \ntaken of an offence depends upon the facts and \ncircumstances of each case and it is impossible \nto attempt to define what is meant by taking \ncognizance. Issuance of a search warrant for \nthe purpose of an investigation or a warrant of \narrest of accused cannot by itself be regarded \nas an act of taking cognizance of an offence. \nIt is only when a Magistrate applies his mind \nfor proceeding under Section 200 and subsequent \nsections of Chapter XV or under Section 204 of \nChapter XVI of the Code that it can be \npositively stated that he had applied his mind \nand thereby had taken cognizance of an offence \n[see also Ajit Kumar Palit v.

We are \nunable to construe the word may in \nSection 190 to mean must. The reason \nis obvious. A complaint disclosing \ncognizable offences may well justify a \nMagistrate in sending the complaint \nunder Section 156(3) to the police for \ninvestigation. There is no reason why \nthe time of the Magistrate should be \nwasted when primarily the duty to \ninvestigate in cases involving \ncognizable offences is with the \npolice. On the other hand, there may \nbe occasions when the Magistrate may \nexercise his discretion and take \ncognizance of a cognizable offence. If \nhe does so then he would have to \nproceed in the manner provided by \nChapter XVI of the Code.\n",
        "p_38": "22.\t\tIn Nirmaljit Singh Hoon v. State of \nWest Bengal & Anr., (1973) 3 SCC 753, the Court \nstated that it is well settled that before a \nMagistrate can be said to have taken cognizance \nof an offence under Section 190(1) (a) of the \nCode, he must have not only applied his mind to \nthe contents of the complaint presented before \nhim, but must have done so for the purpose of \nproceeding under Section 200 and the provisions \nfollowing that section. Where, however, he \napplies his mind only for ordering an \ninvestigation under Section 156(3) or issues a \nwarrant for arrest of accused, he cannot be \nsaid to have taken cognizance of the offence.\n",
        "p_39": "23.\t\tIn Darshan Singh Ram Kishan v. State \nof Maharashtra, (1972) 1 SCR 571, speaking for \nthe Court, Shelat, J. stated that under Section \n190 of the Code, a Magistrate may take \ncognizance of an offence either (a) upon \nreceiving a complaint, or (b) upon a police \nreport, or (c) upon information received from a \nperson other than a police officer or even upon \nhis own information or suspicion that such an \noffence has been committed. As has often been \nsaid, taking cognizance does not involve any \nformal action or indeed action of any kind. It \noccurs as soon as a Magistrate applies his mind \nto the suspected commission of an offence. \nCognizance, thus, takes place at a point when a \nMagistrate first takes judicial notice of an \noffence.\n",
        "p_40": "24.\t\tIn Devarapalli Lakshminarayana Reddy & \nOrs. v. V. Narayana Reddy & Ors., (1976) 3 SCC \n252, this Court said:\n",
        "p_41": "It is well settled that when a \nMagistrate receives a complaint, he is \nnot bound to take cognizance if the \nfacts alleged in the complaint, \ndisclose the commission of an offence. \nThis is clear from the use of the \nwords \"may take cognizance\" which in \nthe context in which they occur cannot \nbe equated with must take cognizance\". \nThe word \"may\" gives a discretion to \nthe Magistrate in the matter. If on a \nreading of the complaint he finds that \nthe allegations therein disclose a \ncognizable offence and the forwarding \nof the complaint to the police for \ninvestigation under Section 156(3) \nwill be conducive to justice and save \nthe valuable time of the Magistrate \nfrom, being wasted in enquiring into a \nmatter which was primarily the duty of \nthe police to investigate, he will be \njustified in adopting that course as \nan alternative to taking cognizance of \nthe offence, himself.\n",
        "p_42": "This raises the incidental question : \nWhat is meant by \"taking cognizance of \nan offence\" by a Magistrate within the \ncontemplation of Section 190?. This \nexpression has not been defined in the \nCode. But from the scheme of the Code, \nthe content and marginal heading of \nSection 190 and the caption of Chapter \nXIV under which Sections 190 to 199 \noccur, it is clear that a case can be \nsaid to be instituted in a Court only \nwhen the Court takes cognizance of the \noffence alleged therein. The ways in \nwhich such cognizance can be taken are \nset out in Clauses (a), (b) and (c) of \nSection 190(1). Whether the Magistrate \nhas or has not taken cognizance of the \noffence will depend on the \ncircumstances of the particular case \nincluding the mode in which the case \nis sought to be instituted and the \nnature of the preliminary action, if \nany, taken by the Magistrate. Broadly \nspeaking, when on receiving a \ncomplaint, the Magistrate applies his \nmind for the purposes of proceeding \nunder Section 200 and the succeeding \nsections in Chapter XV of the Code of \n1973, he is said to have taken \ncognizance of the offence within the \nmeaning of Section 190(1)(a). If, \ninstead of proceeding under Chapter \nXV, he has in the judicial exercise of \nhis discretion, taken action of    \nsome other kind, such as issuing a \nsearch warrant for the purpose       \nof investigation, or ordering \ninvestigation by the police under \nSection 156(3), he cannot be said to \nhave taken cognizance of any offence. \n[see also M.L.

Once it is \naccepted (and there is no dispute \nabout it) that it is not within the \ndomain of the complainant or \nprosecuting agency to take cognizance \nof an offence or to issue process and \nthe only thing the former can do is to \nfile a complaint or initiate \nproceedings in accordance with law.  \nIf that action of initiation of \nproceedings has been taken within the \nperiod of limitation, the complainant \nis not responsible for any delay on \nthe part of the Court or Magistrate in \nissuing process or taking cognizance \nof an offence. Now, if he is sought to \nbe penalized because of the omission, \ndefault or inaction on the part of the \nCourt or Magistrate, the provision of \nlaw may have to be tested on the \ntouchstone of Article 14 of the \nConstitution.  It can possibly be \nurged that such a provision is totally \narbitrary, irrational and \nunreasonable. It is settled law that a \nCourt of Law would interpret a \nprovision which would help sustaining \nthe validity of law by applying the \ndoctrine of reasonable construction \nrather than making it vulnerable and \nunconstitutional by adopting rule of \nlitera legis.  Connecting the \nprovision of limitation in Section 468 \nof the Code with issuing of process or \ntaking of cognizance by the Court may \nmake it unsustainable and ultra vires \nArticle 14 of the Constitution.\n",

According to the counsel, Section 468 \nof the Code starts with the expression Except \nas provided elsewhere in this Code. Section \n49(3) of FEMA, on the other hand, starts with a \nnon-obstante clause (Notwithstanding anything \ncontained in any other law for the time being \nin force).

The High Court dealt with \nonly one point as to whether the proceedings \nwere liable to be quashed on the ground that \nthey were time-barred and upholding the \ncontention of the accused, passed the impugned \norder. As we are of the view that the High \nCourt was not right in quashing the proceedings \non the ground of limitation, the order deserves \nto be set aside by remitting the matter to the \nChief Metropolitan Magistrate, Mumbai to be \ndecided in accordance with law.

        "p_1": "JUDGMENT\n \n\nMahmood Ali Khan, J.\n",
        "p_2": "1. In a passing off action the plaintiff has filed an application IA 8234/03 (Order 39, Rules 1 & 2 CPC) for grant of an interlocutory injunction order fur restraining the defendants from using the trademark 'REFORM' and from doing any other thing as may lead to confusion or deception resulting in passing off defendants' goods as those of the plaintiff sold under the trademark 'REFIRM'.\n",
        "p_3": "2. Plaintiff is a company which is manufacturing and marketing a large number of pharmaceutical preparations for different diseases. Plaintiff manufactured medicine for osteoporosis and marketed it under the trademark 'REFIRM'. It also applied for this trademark to be registered in its name on 30.1.0.2001. By virtue of plaintiff's prior adoption of the trademark 'REFIRM' bona fidely the plaintiff had become proprietor thereof. It started marketing the medicinal preparation under this trademark in January, 2002. It has become best selling pharmaceutical preparation in its segment. Trademark 'REFIRM' had acquired immense reputation and goodwill and had come to he exclusively associated and identified and recognized with the plaintiff. Plaintiff on account of continuous and exclusive use of the trademark 'REFIRM' and extensive publicity and advertisement has acquired under Common Law right of exclusive and undisturbed use of the said trademark in relation to the goods of its manufacture and sale. Plaintiff spent as much as Rs. 10.00 lac on the publicity and advertisement of its product in the year of its launch. In February, 2003 plaintiff came to know that defendant No. 2 is manufacturing and defendant No. 1 is marketing its medicinal preparation for treatment of osteoporosis under the trademark 'REFORM'. Plaintiff served legal notice but did not receive any reply. It issued a reminder on 5.5.2003. Defendant No. 1 sent its reply dated 12.5.2003 which showed that the defendant far from desisting, intended to continue with the infringement of the plaintiff's trademark. Defendants' adoption of the trademark 'REFORM' is visually, phonetically and conceptually similar to the trademark of the plaintiff in respect of the similar goods and it would lead to confusion and deception in the around of the customers that they were buying the goods of the plaintiff. Defendants had infringed upon the proprietory right of the plaintiff under the Common Law right acquired for exclusive use of the trademark 'REFIRM' by the plaintiff. The plaintiff prayed for grant of relief of permanent injunction restraining the defendants from manufacturing and selling its product adopting trademark 'REFORM' which was deceptively similar to the plaintiff's trademark 'REFIRM'; a decree of mandatory injunction directing the detendants to deliver up all the labels, stationery articles, blocks, dies and any other material bearing the impugned get-up/layout for the purpose of destruction/erasure; a decree of rendition of accounts of the profit illegally earned by the defendants and; a decree for damages of Rs. 5.01 lacs.\n",
        "p_4": "3. Counsel for defendants had stated that the reply to the interlocutory injunction order and the written statement has been filed yesterday. Same had not been added to the record but for hearing on the ad interim injunction application, a copy of the reply and the written statement which was supplied to counsel for plaintiff was produced which has been taken into consideration.\n",
        "p_5": "4. Defendant No. 1 in the written statement refuted the allegation of the plaintiff that it was infringing the proprietory right of the plaintiff in the trademark 'REFIRM' by manufacturing and selling its own product adopting trademark 'REFORM'. A discrepant allegation was made in regard to the time since when the defendants started manufacturing and selling its medicinal products under the trade mark 'REFORM'. In para-1 of the preliminary submissions it was alleged that defendant No. 1 adopted this trademark in June, 2002. In para-10 of the reply on merit it was mentioned that it started selling its product under this trademark in October, 2002 and in para-18 of the written statement it was alleged that the defendants started sale of the product under trademark 'REFORM' in the month of September, 2002. Anyhow, the defendants pleaded that word 'REFORM', is a common word and is commonly known and used in India and the world over. It is generic and descriptive and can be used by anyone. The product sold ,under this trademark was intended for reformation of the bones so the defendants cannot be said to have done anything wrong as the product could not have been described in a better way than the descriptive mark 'REFORM'. The defendants had no intention of passing off its own product as that of the plaintiffs as both the words 'REFIRM' and 'REFORM' have different meaning.\n",
        "p_6": "5. It was also alleged that when the products are sold under descriptive mark or generic mark, there can never be any confusion. Moreover, the packaging used by the defendants are totally different and there is no similarity at all between the two packaging. The product of the defendants is of superior quality as compared to the plaintiff's product. The sale figure of the product under the trademark \"REFORM\" in-a small territory is about Rs. 42.00 lacs whereas sale of the plaintiffs product under the trademark 'REFIRM' all over India is only Rs. 74.00 lacs. Popularity of the defendants' product made the plaintiff to come to the court with mala fide motive. Plaintiffs suit deserves to be dismissed.\n",
        "p_7": "6. In the reply to the application also similar allegations have been made and it is prayed that the application may be dismissed.\n",
        "p_8": "7. Plaintiff has argued that the pharmaceutical preparation of the plaintiff for treatment of osteoporosis is manufactured and sold under the trademark 'REFIRM' since January, 2001. He has invited attention to the application of the plaintiff dated 30.10.2001 filed with the Registrar of Trademark for registration of its trademark 'REFIRM' under Clause-V. He also drew attention to the copy of the invoice dated 12.4.2002 relating to the sale of 'REFIRM' tablets. There is another invoice dated 22.3.2002 which also showed that 'REFIRM' tablets were being sold by the plaintiff in March 2002. Counsel for plaintiff has stated that the pharmaceutical preparation of the plaintiff sold under the trademark 'REFIRM' on account of extensive publicity and advertisement had acquired exclusiveness and distinctiveness of the product of the plaintiff and the trademark 'REFIRM' is recognized by the common customer and dealers as a product of plaintiff. It is argued that the defendants by adopting visually, phonetically and conceptually similar trademark 'REFORM' for similar pharmaceutical preparation, subsequently intended to cash upon the reputation of the plaintiff's product. According to him offensive trademark of the defendant is deceptively and confusingly similar to the trademark 'REFIRM' of the plaintiff may lead to confusion in the mind of customers and dealers that they were buying the product of the defendants when they had no intention to buy it and wanted to buy the medicinal preparation manufactured by the plaintiff. It is argued that the defendants are guilty of passing off and they are liable to be injucted from manufacturing and selling their pharmaceutical preparation under the trademark 'REFORM' during the pendency of the suit.\n",
        "p_9": "8. The argument of counsel for defendants, on the other hand are four-fold. His first argument is that both the trademarks 'REFIRM' adopted by the plaintiff and 'REFORM' adopted by the defendants are of Schedule 'H\" drugs which is sold strictly on prescription by a medical practitioner and a doctor, therefore, there is no possibility of any confusion or deception in the mind of the customer or the trader that the goods sold under the trademark 'REFORM' has its origin from the plaintiff. He placed strong reliance on the judgment of the Gujarat High Court in Ciba Geigy Ltd. v. Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, PTC (Suppl) (1) 575 (Guj) in support of his argument. His second contention is that the word 'REFORM' is a common English word and is descriptive and generic so there is no bar to its adoption and use by anyone. He has pointed out to the exmaination and search report dated 27.8.2002 and has argued that it does not show the name of the plaintiff's trademark there. He has cited Automatic Electric Limited v. R.K. Dhawan and Anr., 1999 (19) PTC 81 in support of his argument. Thirdly, he has drawn attention to para-16 of the application under consideration wherein it was alleged that the defendants are selling its product under trademark 'REFORM' at a very low price of Rs. 35/- per strip of 10 tablets against the product of the plaintiff sold under the trademark 'REFIRM' at a price of Rs. 99/-per strip of 10 tablets. He argued that the grievance of the plaintiff is that the defendants were selling its medicinal product cheaper than the plaintiff and that is the reason behind filing the present suit. His last argument is that the plaintiff had valued the suit for the purpose of jurisdiction at Rs. 5.01 lacs and has paid the fee on it, but the aggregate valuation of the suit has been done by the plaintiff at Rs. 25,01,400/-, therefore, the plaintiff should be directed to pay the court fee also on the aggregate value of the suit for the purpose of jurisdiction.\n",
        "p_10": "9. To controvert, the counsel for plaintiff has drawn attention to Cadila Health Care Ltd. v. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd., 2001 PTC 300 (SC) where it was held that confusion and deception may occur even in the pharmaceuticals products and medicines which are sold on prescription of doctors or which are dispensed by professionally trained individuals. He also referred to the judgment of this Court in Ciba Geigy Ltd. v. Crosslands Research Laboratories Ltd., 1996 PTC (16) 1 wherein also it was laid down that there is possibility of confusion, deception and mistake of two medicinal products sold by phonetically, constructively or visually similar trademarks even when they are sold by prescription by doctors and medical practitioners and sold by qualified pharmacist. Counsel for plaintiff also referred to an American case R.J, Strasenburgh Co. v. Kenwood Labs Inc., 106 USPQ 379 wherein a Commissioner of Patent observed that the physicians are not immune from confusion in medicines even if they are sold only on prescription. Counsel for plaintiff has also argued that the defendants are not clear in their mind. At one place in the written statement it was pleaded that word 'REFORM' was descriptive and generic and on the other it claimed that it was a trademark adopted by it for selling its pharmaceutical preparations. It was argued that even the common words may be adopted as a trademark. The defendants themselves have applied for registration of their trademark 'REFORM'. Plaintiff has also filed an application for registration of its trademark 'REFIRM'. He also cited Automatic Electric Limited (supra) it was held that if the defendant was also claiming proprietory right and monopoly in a generic name, it does not lie in their mouth to say that the word adopted by him is a generic expression. In this case the dispute was on the proprietory right of the trademark \"DIMMER DOT\". Counsel for plaintiff also argued that the plaintiff is an established user of the trademark 'REFIRM' prior in time than the medical trademark 'REFORM' used by the defendant and, therefore, it is entitled to file a passing off action and the grant of ad interim injunction in its favor. He relied upon the judgment of this Court in Century Traders v. Roshan Lal Duggar & Co. and Ors., . Counsel for plaintiff has submitted that it had paid proper court fee in this case and cited Fenner India Ltd. v. Salbros Enterprises Pvt. Ltd.,  in support of his argument but he submitted that in case the court fee is found deficient, the plaintiff will make it good as and when asked by the court.\n",
        "p_11": "10. The suit is filed for passing off action. Briefly it is alleged that both the plaintiff and the defendants are manufacturing pharmaceutical medicinal preparation for the treatment of disease osteoporosis. Plaintiff is selling its product under the trademark 'REFIRM' since January, 2002. Defendant on the other hand adopted the trademark 'REFORM' and started selling its product from June, September or October, 2002. Both the parties have applied for registration of their respective trademarks. The suit is not on the basis of the infringement of the trademark. The suit is for restraining the defendants from passing off its goods sold under the trademark 'REFORM' which is phonetically and constructively similar to the trademark of the plaintiff 'REFIRM' as it is likely to cause confusion and deception in the mind of the customer and the dealers and even the medical practitioners could be deceived in believing that the medicinal preparation manufactured by the defendants had actually been manufactured by the plaintiff. The plaintiff has alleged that it had spent on advertisement about Rs. 10.00 lacs in the initial year of the product. Its product 'REFIRM' has acquired great reputation. The trademark 'REFIRM' is immediately associated with the product of the plaintiff. Adoption of the trade mark 'REFORM' by the defendants, therefore, may cause confusion and deception in the mind of medical practitioners, doctors issuing prescription and the pharmacist dispensing it that the defendants' product had its origin from the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_12": "11. Before considering the case law cited by the parties, it is necessary to understand the principles of law which are to be borne in mind while deciding the question of deceptive similarity on the basis of an unregistered trademark in a passing off action. The Supreme Court in Cadila Health Care Ltd. (supra) had laid down the principles as under:--\n",
        "p_13": "\"Broadly stated in an action for passing off on the basis of unregistered trade mark generally for deciding the question of deceptive similarity the following factors to be considered:\n",
        "p_14": "(a) The nature of the marks i.e. whether the marks are word marks or label marks or composite marks, i.e. both words and label works.\n",
        "p_15": "(b) The degree of resembleness between the marks, phonetically similar and hence similar in idea.\n",
        "p_16": "(c) The nature of the goods in respect of which they are used as trade marks.\n",
        "p_17": "(d) The similarity in the nature, character and performance of the goods or the rival traders.\n",
        "p_18": "(e) The class of purchasers who are likely to buy the goods bearing the marks they require, on their education and intelligence and a degree of care they are likely to exercise in purchasing and/or using the goods.\n",
        "p_19": "(f) The mode of purchasing the goods or placing orders for the goods, and\n \n\n",
        "p_20": "(g) Any other surrounding circumstances which may be relevant in the extent of dissimilarity between the competing marks.\n",
        "p_21": "Weightage to be given to each of the aforesaid factors depends upon facts of each case and the same weightage cannot be given to each factor in every case.\" \n",
        "p_22": "12. Now the facts of the present case may be tested on the above principles. Both the pharmaceutical preparations/medicines, manufactured and sold by the plaintiff as well as by the defendants, are used for treatment for disease osteoporosis, a bone diseases. Both are meant to be used by the same class of purchasers/consumers; namely, the persons suffering from this disease, the chemists who sell the medicine, the medical practitioners and doctors who issue prescriptions to their patients or hospital and patients who buy medicines for their own use and the medical sales representatives who publicize the medicine or motivate the doctors and the medical practitioners in prescribing the medicines. Both these medicines are Schedule 'H' drugs which means that they can be sold by the chemists only on the basis of a prescription. Furthermore, the trademark under which the plaintiff is selling its pharmaceutical preparations is 'REFIRM' while the defendant has adopted trademark 'REFORM' for manufacture and sale of its medicines. The packing of the medicines of the plaintiff are at pages 1 and 2 of the document file and that of the defendants is at page-4 of the document file. The strip containing the tablet of the product of the plaintiff is at page-3 and that of the defendants is at page-5. Indeed if these packages and strips are put side by side for examination, both look different to a discerning eye but in passing off action test is not side by side examination. As noticed both the trademarks 'REFIRM' and 'REFORM' are visually constructively and phonetically resemble each other and there can be possibility of a mistake of identifying one for the other on the part of the doctors and nurses who are not immune from mistake and cannot be said infallible and the chemists and dispenser who may make bona fide mistake in reading the prescription of the doctor and supply the medicine of the defendant for the medicine of the plaintiff asked for and vise versa.\n",
        "p_23": "13. Such a confusion in medicine has to be avoided at all cost because the mistake may not only cause pecuniary loss to the manufacturer of the medicine but it may some time result detrimental to the health of a person. The doctors, medical practitioners, hospital administration or even the dispensers cannot be immuned from confusion or committing mistake while placing order for the supply of the medicine, while issuing prescription of the medicine to the patient, while actually administering the medicine to the patient. Observation of the Commissioner of Patent in R.J. Strasenburgh Co.'s case (supra) cited on behalf of plaintiff supports the contention of counsel for plaintiff that the two trademarks may cause confusion and deception in the mind of its consumers and medical practitioners alike.\n",
        "p_24": "14. The medicines are Schedule 'H' drugs and can be sold on prescription by the pharmacist may not be a valid defense to the claim of the plaintiff. In Cadila Healthcare Ltd. (supra) exactly similar arguments were advanced on behalf of the party accused of infringing the trademark. The medicines involved were sold under the tradename 'Falcitab' and 'Falcigo1. Both were Schedule 'H' drug and so could be dispensed on prescription only. The Supreme Court rejected the argument advanced before it and observed as under:-\n",
        "p_25": "\"It was further submitted on behalf of the appellant that although the possibility of confusion in a drug being sold across the counter may be higher, the fact that a drug is sold under prescription or only to physicians cannot by itself be considered a sufficient protection against confusion. The physicians and pharmacists are trained people yet they are not infallible and in medicines, there can be no provisions for mistake since even a possibility of mistake may prove to be fatal.\n",
        "p_26": "As far as present case is concerned, although both the drugs are sold under prescription but this fact alone is not sufficient to prevent confusion which is otherwise likely to occur. In view of the varying infrastructure for supervision of physicians and pharmacists of medical profession in our country due to linguistic, urban, semi-urban and rural divide across the country and with high degree of possibility of even accidental negligence, strict measures to prevent any confusion arising from similarity of marks among medicines are required to be taken.\"\n",
        "p_27": "\"The defendant concedes that physicians and pharmacists are not infallible but urges that the members of these professions are carefully trained to detect differences in the characteristics of pharmaceutical products. While this is doubtless true to does not open the door to the adoption by manufacturers of medicines of trade marks or names which would be confusingly similar to anyone not exercising such great care. For physicians and pharmacists are human and in common with the rest of mankind are subject to human frailties. In the field of medicinal remedies the courts may not speculate as to whether there is a probability of confusion between similar names. If there is any possibility of such confusion in the case of medicines public policy requires that the use of the confusingly similar name be enjoyed (See Lambert Pharmacol Ltd. v. Bolton Chemical Corporation DCNY, 1915, 219 F. 325.326.\"\n",
        "p_28": "\"Public interest would support lesser degree of proof showing confusing similarity in the case of trade mark in respect of medicinal product as against other non-medicinal products. Drugs are poisons, not sweets. Confusion between medicinal products may, therefore, be life threatening, not merely inconvenient. Nothing the frailty of human nature and the pressure placed by society on doctors, there should be as many clear indicators as possible to distinguish two medicinal products from each other. It is not uncommon that in hospitals, drugs can be requested verbally and/or under critical/pressure situations. Many patients may be elderly, infirm or illiterate. They may not be in a position to differentiate between the medicine prescribed and bought which is ultimately handed over to them. This view finds support from McCarthy on Trade Marks, 3rd Edition, para 23.12 of which reads as under:--\n",
        "p_29": "\"The tests of confusing similarity are modified when the goods involved are medicinal products. Confusion of source or product between medicinal products may produce physically harmful results to purchasers and greater protection is required then in the ordinary case. If the goods involved are medicinal products each with different effects and designed for even subtly different uses, confusion among the products caused by similar marks could have disastrous effects. For these reasons, it is proper to require a lesser quantum of proof of confusing similarity for drugs and medicinal preparations. The same standard has been applied to medical products such as surgical sutures and clavicle splints\". \n",
        "p_30": "15. The decisions of English Courts would be relevant in a country where literacy is high and the marks used and in the language which the purchaser can understand. While English cases may be relevant in understanding the essential features of trade mark law but when we are dealing with the sale of consumer items in India, you have to see and bear in mind the difference in situation between England and India. Can English principles apply in their entirely in India with no regard to Indian conditions? We think not. In a country like India where there is no single common language, a large percentage of population is illiterate and a small fraction of people know English, then to apply the principles of English law regarding dissimilarity of the marks or the customer knowing about the distinguishing characteristics of the plaintiffs goods seems to over look the ground realities in India. While examining such cases in India, what has to be kept in mind is the purchaser of such goods in India who may have absolutely no knowledge of English language or of the language in which the trade mark is written and to whom different words with slight difference in spellings may sound phonetical the same. While dealing with cases relating to passing off, one of the important tests which has to be applied in each case is whether the misrepresentation made by the defendant is of such a nature as is likely to cause an ordinary consumer to confuse one product for another due to similarity of marks and other surrounding factors. What is likely to cause confusion would vary from case to case. However, the appellants arc right in contending that where medicinal products are involved, the lest to be applied for adjudging the violation of trade mark law may not be at part with cases involving non-medicinal products. A stricter approach should be adopted while apply the test to Judge the possibility of confusion of one medicinal product for another by the consumer. While confusion in the case of non-medicinal products may only cause economic loss to the plaintiff, confusion between the two medicinal products may have disastrous effects on health and in some cases life itself. Stringent measures should be adopted specially where medicines are the medicines of last resort as any confusion in such medicines may be fatal or could have disastrous effects. The confusion as to the identity of the product itself could have dire effects on the public health.\"\n",
        "p_31": "16. The judgment of the Gujarat High Court in Ciba-Geigy Ltd. (supra) relied upon by the defendant which laid down to the contrary cannot prevail and be followed. The Gujarat High Court has held that the medicinal preparation of the plaintiff and the defendant were, being Schedule 'H' drug, were available to the consumers only on prescription of a registered medical practitioner, so the plaintiff was not entitled to an ad interim injunction as prayed under Order 39 Rules 1 & 2 CPC. That decides the first objection of the defendants.\n",
        "p_32": "17. From the pleading made in the plaint and the application by the plaintiff and the facts stated by the defendants in the reply to the application, clearly established that the plaintiff is prior in use of the trademark 'REFIRM' for sale of its medicinal product. The evidence which has been placed on record has prima facie established it. The Court in Century Traders (supra) has held that in an action for passing off in order to succeed in getting an interim injunction plaintiff has to establish user of the mark prior in point of time than the impugned user by the defendants. It was further held that the proof of actual damage or fraud is unnecessary in a passing off action whether the relief asked for is injunction alone or injunction, accounts and damages. If there is a likelihood of the offending trade mark invading the proprietory right, a case for injunction is made out.\n",
        "p_33": "18. Counsel for defendants emphatically argued that the word 'REFORM' is a common and general word and there cannot be any restriction on the use of this word. In the written statement and reply to the application, defendants have repeatedly alleged that the defendants were selling its medicinal product under a descriptive mark or generic mark which cannot cause any confusion. But even a descriptive or a generic mark may sometimes become a trademark of a product so as to associate it with a particular manufacturer. Even the defendants themselves have filed an application for registration of the word 'REFORM' as trademark for its product. Counsel for defendants has referred to the judgment of this Court in Bharat Enterprises (India) v. C. Lall Gopi Industrial Enterprises and Ors., 1999 PTC (19) 598 where it was held that the plaintiff has to prove that his mark has become so distinctive that the public started associating it with the plaintiff and further to prove that the offending trademark was likely to deceive and cause confusion among the consumer. The trademarks involved in the case were 'Gopi Heat Pillar' and 'Belco Heat Pillar', both the products were room heaters. The court observed that the expression 'HEAT PILLAR' may be taken to be a generic word and all those room heaters which were so designed like a pillar are using the word 'Heat Pillar', so this expression cannot be confined to the respondents and the respondent cannot have exclusive right to use Heat Pillar for their own product. It was further observed that there was phonetic distinction between the words 'Belco' and 'Gopi', therefore, there was no cause of confusion. For this reason, the ad interim application was dismissed. But the facts of the present case are distinguishable. In Cadila Health Care Ltd. (supra) the Supreme Court has held that greater care to be exercised while dealing with a passing off action relating to the medicinal products. In the present case though the meaning of the word 'REFIRM' and 'REFORM' may be different, but they are constructively and phonetically similar so as to cause confusion and deception in the mind of an unwary customer like hospital administration, medical practitioners, doctors, nurses and even the dispenser, chemist and druggist which may lead to the sale of the medicine of the defendants in lieu of the medicine of the plaintiff. \n",
        "p_34": "19. In Automatic Electric Ltd. (supra) the competing trademarks were 'DIMMER DOT' and 'DIMMERSTAT. This Court held that the word 'DIMMER' may be a generic and descriptive word but since the plaintiff had been using the said trademark for a long period of time, user of deceptively similar trade mark by the defendants would necessarily cause irreparable loss and injury to the plaintiff. Second argument of counsel for defendants also is not tenable.\n",
        "p_35": "20. The third contention of counsel for defendants to my view will also not advance the case of the defendants. In the application it has been alleged by the plaintiff that the defendants are selling their medicinal preparation @ Rs. 35/- per strip of 10 tablets whereas the plaintiff was selling the same quantity of medicine for Rs. 99/-per strip of 10 tablets. According to counsel for defendants this is what was hurting the plaintiff as the medicine of the defendants was less expensive and of good quality. According to counsel for defendants, plaintiff's Common Law right in the trademark 'REFIRM' were prejudicially effected because the defendants were passing off its inferior quality of product under a deceptively confusing trademark which is identical to the trademark of the plaintiff and thus not only causing monetary loss to the plaintiff but may cause injury to the health to an unwary person suffering from the disease os-teoporosis who consumes it. Plaintiff cannot maintain its claim in an action of passing off on the ground that medicinal products of its rival are being available at a cheaper price and it is being out-passed in the competitive market. It cannot maintain the suit for passing off action only if it has been able to show that the offending trademark is confusingly and deceptively identical to the trademark of the plaintiff so as to cause or is likely to cause confusion and deception in the mind of its consumers and traders, in this case the hospital administration, medical practitioners, nurses and the dispenser of the medicine who may assume that the goods of the defendant was manufactured by the plaintiff. Counsel for plaintiff has neither argued nor has based its claim for grant of injunction on the ground of the price of the goods of the defendant having been kept very low.\n",
        "p_36": "21. The fourth argument of counsel for defendant is that the proper court fee has not been paid. Plaintiff has maintained that the suit has been correctly valued and proper court fee has been paid but has submitted at the hearing that in case it is found that the court fee paid is deficient, the plaintiff undertakes to make it good. This is a question to be gone into and decided at appropriate stage and certainly not at the stage of grant of ad interim injunction application. The plaintiff cannot be denied ad interim injunction if it is entitled to it, till the question of court fee is decided. Since the defendant is raising this objection, proper court fee shall be determined in accordance with law at the appropriate stage. Therefore, principles of law laid down in the judgment of Fenner India Ltd. v. Salbros Enterprises Pvt. Ltd., (supra), relied upon by the plaintiff may be taken into consideration at that stage.\n",
        "p_37": "22. It has already been held that the offending trademark 'REFORM' is deceptively, constructively and phonetically similar and it may or is likely to cause deception and confusion in the mind of the consumers, the dealers and the medical practitioners who issue prescriptions and nurses who administer it to the patient. Such a confusion created by the trademark of the defendant 'REFORM' not only may cause monetary loss to the plaintiff but may also be harmful to the public health. The plaintiff, as such, has prima facie raised bona fide dispute and serious contention which needs investigation and trial. Balance of convenience is certainly in favor of grant of interlocutory injunction order stopping the sale of the medicine under the offending trademark rather than allowing the medicines to be sold under the offending trademark. Plaintiff may suffer irreparable loss and injury if the interlocutory injunction order is declined at this stage.\n",
        "p_38": "23. For the reasons stated above, the application is allowed and the defendant is restrained from manufacturing and selling its medicinal preparation under the trademark 'REFORM' and from doing any other thing as may be likely to lead to confusion or deception resulting in passing off the defendant's goods as those of the plaintiff which are sold under the trademark 'REFIRM' during the pendency of these proceedings.\n",
        "p_39": "24. Before parting with, it may be noted that the observations made in the order are for the purpose of deciding interlocutory injunction application and will not influence the decision of the court at the final stage and it may be decided on its own merit.\n",

According  to  learned\nsenior counsel, appellants  have  a  right  to  be  heard  in  the  revision\napplication filed by the complainant as no  order  could   be  made  to  the\nprejudice of  the  accused  or  the  other  person  unless  he  has  had  an\nopportunity of being heard under  Section  401(2)  of  the  Code.    It  was\nargued on behalf of the appellants that the  result  of  acceptance  of  the\n\u2018C\u2019 Summary Report is that criminal proceedings launched by the  complainant\nhave come to an end  and  if  the  revision  application  preferred  by  the\ncomplainant is accepted, that would  have  the  effect  of  revival  of  the\ncomplaint and setting the criminal process back in  motion  which  would  be\ndefinitely prejudicial to the appellants and  before  any  such  prejudicial\norder is passed, the appellants ought to be heard.  In support of the  above\ncontentions, learned senior counsel relied upon decisions of this  Court  in\nP. Sundarrajan and others v. R.

The Magistrate has a duty to  elicit  all\nfacts having regard to the interest of an absent accused person and also  to\nbring to book a person or persons against whom the   allegations  have  been\nmade. To find out the above, the Magistrate  himself  may  hold  an  inquiry\nunder Section 202 of the Code or  direct an investigation to be  made  by  a\npolice officer. The dismissal of the complaint under Section 203 is  without\ndoubt a pre-issuance of process stage.

On  a  complaint  being\nmade to a Magistrate taking cognizance of an offence, he  is  required    to\nexamine the complainant on oath and the  witnesses,  if  any,  and  then  on\nconsidering the complaint and the statements on oath,  if   he   is  of  the\nopinion that there is no sufficient ground  for  proceeding,  the  complaint\nshall be dismissed after recording brief reasons. The  Magistrate  may  also\non receipt of a complaint of which  he  is  authorised  to  take  cognizance\nproceed with further inquiry into the  allegations  made  in  the  complaint\neither himself or direct  an  investigation  into  the  allegations  in  the\ncomplaint to be made by a police officer or  by  such  other  person  as  he\nthinks fit for the purpose of deciding whether or not  there  is  sufficient\nground for proceeding. In that event, the Magistrate in fact  postpones  the\nissue of process.  On conclusion of the inquiry by himself or on receipt  of\nreport from the police officer or  from  such  other  person  who  has  been\ndirected to  investigate  into  the  allegations,  if,  in  the  opinion  of\nMagistrate taking cognizance of an offence there  is  no  sufficient  ground\nfor proceeding, complaint is  dismissed  under  Section  203  or  where  the\nMagistrate  is  of  the  opinion  that  there  is  sufficient   ground   for\nproceeding, then a process is issued. In a summons  case,  summons  for  the\nattendance of the accused is issued and in a  warrant  case  the  Magistrate\nmay either issue a warrant or a  summons  for  causing  the  accused  to  be\nbrought or to appear before him.\n",

        "p_30": "29.         In R.R. Chari v. The State of Uttar  Pradesh  [20],  this  Court\nstated that taking cognizance did not involve  any formal action  or  indeed\naction of any kind but it takes place no sooner  a  Magistrate  applies  his\nmind to the suspected commission of an offence.\n",

In Kishun Singh5, while  dealing  with  the  expression  \u201ctaking\ncognizance of an offence\u201d the  Court said that cognizance can be said to  be\ntaken by a Magistrate when he takes notice of the  accusations  and  applies\nhis mind to the allegations made  in  the  complaint  or  police  report  or\ninformation and on being satisfied that the allegations,  if  proved,  would\nconstitute an offence, decides to initiate judicial proceedings against  the\nalleged offender.\n",

        "p_36": "35.         On  behalf  of  the  appellants,   it  was  submitted  that  the\ndirection by  the  CJM  to  the  Police  Officer  to  investigate  into  the\nallegations made in  the  complaint  amounts  to  taking  cognizance  of  an\noffence and the  dismissal of the complaint by the  CJM  under  Section  203\nof the Code was after he had taken cognizance of the offence. On  the  other\nhand,  on behalf of the respondent no. 1,  it was vehemently contended  that\ndismissal of complaint by the CJM under Section 203 of the  Code  was  at  a\npre-cognizance stage. The submission on behalf of the respondent  no.  1  is\nthat no cognizance has been taken by the  CJM  while  directing  the  Police\nOfficer to investigate into the allegations of the complaint.\n",
        "p_37": "36.         We shall immediately advert to the aspect  whether  or  not  CJM\nhad taken cognizance of  the  offence  and  whether  the  dismissal  of  the\ncomplaint under Section 203 in the matter was post-taking cognizance.\n",
        "p_38": "37.         The word, \u201ccognizance\u201d occurring  in  various  Sections  in  the\nCode is a word of wide import. It embraces  within  itself  all  powers  and\nauthority in exercise of jurisdiction and taking of authoritative notice  of\nthe allegations made in the complaint or a police report or any  information\nreceived that offence has been committed. In the context  of  Sections  200,\n202 and 203, the expression `taking cognizance\u2019 has been used in  the  sense\nof  taking notice of the complaint or the first information  report  or  the\ninformation that offence has  been  committed  on  application  of  judicial\nmind. It does not necessarily mean issuance of process.\n",
        "p_39": "38.         Having regard to the above legal position,  if the order of  the\nCJM passed on 18.6.2004 is seen, it becomes apparent  that  he  had  applied\njudicial mind on the complaint that day.  The order  records,  \u201con  perusing\nthe complaint and the accompanying documents,  in  the  said  matter  it  is\nnecessary to take into custody the documents mentioned in the complaint.  It\nis necessary to find out the persons who  have  forged  signatures  on  such\ndocuments, and record their statements, and to compare the  said  signatures\nwith the signatures of the family members of the complainant,  and  in  this\nregard obtain the opinion from the Handwriting  Expert, in view of all  this\nsuch investigations cannot be done by the Court, in view of this fact  below\nSection 156(3) of  Cr.P.C. in the matter of the said  complaint  for  police\ninvestigations it is hereby ordered to send the said inquiry  to  the  P.I.,\nUmra, Police Station. And,  he is ordered to investigate thoroughly in  this\nmatter and within 30 days present the report before this Court\u201d.\n",
        "p_40": "39.         From the above order passed by the CJM,  there remains no  doubt\nthat on 18.06.2004, he had taken cognizance although he  postponed issue  of\nprocess by directing an investigation to be made  by  Police  Officer.   The\nsubmission of the learned counsel for the respondent no.1 that the  CJM  had\nnot taken cognizance in the matter and the  complaint  was  dismissed  under\nSection 203 at the pre-cognizance stage has no substance and is rejected.\n",
        "p_41": "40.         The question now is, in a matter of this nature where  complaint\nhas been dismissed by  the  Magistrate  under  Section  203  post-cognizance\nstage and pre-issuance of process, whether  on challenge to the legality  of\nthe order of dismissal of complaint being  laid  by  the  complainant  in  a\nrevision application before the High Court, the persons  who  are  arraigned\nas accused in the complaint have a right to be heard.\n",
        "p_42": "41.         Before we deal with the above question  further,   some  of  the\ndecisions of the High Courts upon which heavy reliance was  placed   by  the\ncounsel for the respondent no. 1  may  be  noticed.  In  Panatar  Arvindbhai\nRatilal12, a Single Judge of the Gujarat  High  Court  had  an  occasion  to\nconsider  locus standi of  the  suspects  at  the  stage  of  grant  of  \u2018C\u2019\nSummary.  That  was  a  case  where  the  police  did   not   initiate   any\ninvestigation for quite some time in respect of an offence  registered  with\nthe police station. The complainant approached  the  CJM  wherein  direction\nfor  investigation by the police was made. The  police  after  investigation\nsubmitted report and sought \u2018C\u2019 Summary. The  complainant  objected  to  the\nreport submitted by the police as to \u2018C\u2019  Summary.  The  Magistrate  allowed\nthe suspects to be heard against which the complainant  filed  the  criminal\nrevision before the Sessions Judge.  The  Sessions  Judge  agreed  with  the\ncomplainant and overruled the order  of the Magistrate allowing the  accused\nto make submission. There were seven accused in the  complaint  and  two  of\nthem approached  the High Court against the order  of  the  Sessions  Judge.\nThe Single Judge of the High Court confirmed the order  of  Sessions  Judge.\nThe Magistrate thereafter heard the complainant and  granted   \u2018C\u2019  Summary.\nAgainst that order, the complainant filed a  revision  before  the  Sessions\nJudge. Two accused who had earlier challenged  the  order  of  the  Sessions\nJudge before the High Court applied to the Sessions Judge for permission  to\nmake submission in support of the order of  the   Magistrate.  The  Sessions\nJudge allowed the application made by the accused against  which  order  the\ncomplainant filed criminal revision before the High Court.  The  High  Court\nnoted the provisions contained in Sections 397(2) and 403 of  the  Code  and\nthen held that allowing the suspects to be heard at this stage would  amount\nto permitting them to have their say at the stage which is not  contemplated\nby the Code and it would be giving a premature hearing to the accused.   The\nHigh Court was persuaded by  the  submission  of  the  complainant  that  an\naccused cannot be given  pre-trial  hearing.  The  High  Court  observed  as\nfollows :\n",

The dismissal of complaint  by  the  CJM  for  want  of\nprosecution was at the initial stage. The challenge  to  the  order  of  the\nSessions Judge by the accused was on the  ground  that  the  Sessions  Judge\nwhile allowing the revision application  had  infringed  the  provisions  of\nSection 401(2) of the Code inasmuch as no opportunity  of  being  heard  was\ngiven to the accused although  the  complaint  was  dismissed  for  want  of\nprosecution.

In Tata Motors Limited, Single  Judge  of  the  High  Court  was\nconcerned with controversy arising out of complaint which was  dismissed  by\nthe Metropolitan Magistrate under Section 203 of the Code in limine. In  the\nrevision petition  filed  under  Section  397  read  with  Section  401  and\nSection 482 of the Code, it was contended on behalf of the complainant  that\nthe Metropolitan Magistrate erred  in  taking  into  consideration  possible\ndefence of the accused instead of ascertaining whether  on  a  consideration\nof the complaint and the pre-summoning evidence,  a  prima  facie  case  had\nbeen made out for summoning the accused for the  offence  mentioned  in  the\ncomplaint.  It was also argued on behalf of the complainant before the  High\nCourt that  the  accused  persons  have  not  yet  been  summoned  and  even\ncognizance of the case has not been taken  by  the  Metropolitan  Magistrate\nand, therefore, there was no occasion at all for the accused persons  to  be\nheard. It was also argued on behalf of the  complainant  that  at  the  pre-\ncognizance stage, there was no  question  of  the  accused  being  given  an\nopportunity even in a revision petition filed  by  the  complainant  against\nthe order of dismissal of complaint. On  the  contrary,  on  behalf  of  the\naccused persons it was argued that under Section 401(2)  of  the  Code,   if\nadverse order is going  to  be  passed  in  revision  petition  which  might\nprejudice either the accused or any other person then such a person  has  to\nbe mandatorily given an opportunity of being heard either personally  or  by\npleader in defence.  The Single Judge of that Court on consideration of  the\nsubmissions of the parties and the decisions cited  before  him  culled  out\nthe legal position as follows :\n",

The Single Judge of  that  Court  dealt  with\nthe question as under :\n",
        "p_49": "48.          The  legal  position  is  fairly  well-settled  that   in   the\nproceedings under Section  202  of  the  Code  the  accused/suspect  is  not\nentitled to be heard on the question whether the process  should  be  issued\nagainst him or not.  As a matter of law,  upto  the  stage  of  issuance  of\nprocess, the accused  cannot  claim  any  right  of  hearing.   Section  202\ncontemplates postponement of issue of process where the Magistrate is of  an\nopinion that further  inquiry  into  the  complaint  either  by  himself  is\nrequired  and  he  proceeds  with  the  further  inquiry   or   directs   an\ninvestigation to be made by a Police Officer or by such other person  as  he\nthinks fit for the purpose of deciding whether or not  there  is  sufficient\nground for proceeding. If the Magistrate finds that there is  no  sufficient\nground for proceeding with  the  complaint   and  dismisses  the   complaint\nunder Section 203 of the Code,  the question is whether a person accused  of\ncrime in the complaint can claim right of hearing in a revision  application\npreferred by the complainant against the  order  of  the  dismissal  of  the\ncomplaint. The Parliament  being  alive  to  the  legal  position  that  the\naccused/suspects  are  not  entitled  to  be  heard  at  any  stage  of  the\nproceedings until issuance of process under Section  204,  yet   in  Section\n401(2) of the Code provided that no order in exercise of the  power  of  the\nrevision shall be made by the Sessions Judge or the High Court, as the  case\nmay be,  to the prejudice of the accused or  the other person unless he  had\nan opportunity of being heard either personally or by  pleader  in  his  own\ndefence.

In a  case  where  the  complaint  has  been  dismissed  by  the\nMagistrate under Section 203 of the Code either at the stage of Section  200\nitself or on completion of inquiry by the Magistrate under  Section  202  or\non receipt of the report from the police or from any   person  to  whom  the\ndirection was issued by the Magistrate to investigate into  the  allegations\nin the complaint, the effect of such dismissal is termination  of  complaint\nproceedings.  On a  plain reading of sub-section (2)  of  Section  401,   it\ncannot be said that the person   against  whom  the  allegations  of  having\ncommitted offence have been made in the  complaint  and  the  complaint  has\nbeen dismissed by the Magistrate under Section 203,   has  no  right  to  be\nheard because no process has been issued. The dismissal of complaint by  the\nMagistrate under Section 203 \u2013  although  it  is   at  preliminary  stage  \u2013\nnevertheless results in termination of proceedings in  a  complaint  against\nthe persons who are alleged to have committed crime.  Once  a  challenge  is\nlaid to such order  at  the  instance  of  the  complainant  in  a  revision\npetition before the High Court or  Sessions  Judge,  by  virtue  of  Section\n401(2) of the Code, the suspects get  right  of  hearing  before  revisional\ncourt although such order  was  passed  without  their  participation.   The\nright given to \u201caccused\u201d or \u201cthe  other  person\u201d  under  Section  401(2)  of\nbeing heard before the revisional court to defend an  order  which  operates\nin his  favour  should  not  be  confused  with  the  proceedings  before  a\nMagistrate  under  Sections  200,  202,  203   and  204.  In   the  revision\npetition before  the High Court or the Sessions Judge  at  the  instance  of\ncomplainant challenging the order of dismissal  of  complaint,  one  of  the\nthings that could happen is reversal of the  order  of  the  Magistrate  and\nrevival of the complaint. It is in this view of the matter that the  accused\nor other person cannot be  deprived  of  hearing  on  the  face  of  express\nprovision contained in Section  401(2)  of  the  Code.   The  stage  is  not\nimportant whether it is pre-process stage or post process stage.\n",

Sundarrajan1,  a  two-Judge  Bench  of  this  Court  was\nconcerned with a case where a complaint under Section 420  IPC  came  to  be\ndismissed by the Judicial Magistrate. Against the order of dismissal of  the\ncomplaint, the complainant  preferred  revision  petition  before  the  High\nCourt. The High Court was of the view that no notice was  necessary  to  the\nsuspects for disposal of the  revision  and  set  aside  the  order  of  the\nMagistrate and directed the Magistrate to proceed with the complaint  afresh\nin accordance with law. Against the order of the High  Court,  the  suspects\napproached this Court under  Article  136.  The  Court   granted  leave  and\nallowed the appeal, set aside the order of  the  High  Court  and  sent  the\nmatter back to the High Court with a direction to  issue  proper  notice  to\nthe persons accused of the crime in  the  complaint  and  proceed  with  the\nrevision petition after affording them a reasonable opportunity of  hearing.\nThis Court in paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Report (Pg. 472  and  473)  held  as\nunder:\n",
        "p_57": "56.         In Raghu Raj Singh Rousha2, a two-Judge Bench of this Court  was\nfaced with a question whether, in the facts and circumstances of  the  case,\nthe High Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Sections  397  and  401\nof the Code was justified in  passing   an  order  in  the  absence  of  the\naccused persons.  That was a case where a complaint was filed under  Section\n200 of the Code in respect of  offences punishable under Sections 323,  382,\n420, 465, 468, 471, 120-B, 506 and 34 of IPC.  Along with the complaint,  an\napplication  under  Section  156(3)  was  also   made.    The   Metropolitan\nMagistrate passed an order refusing to direct  investigation  under  Section\n156(3) and the complainant was asked to  lead  pre-summoning  evidence.  The\ncomplainant aggrieved by the order of the Metropolitan  Magistrate  filed  a\nrevision petition before the High Court. The High Court with the consent  of\nthe APP appearing for the State set aside  the  order  of  the  Metropolitan\nMagistrate with a direction to  him  to  examine  the  matter  afresh  after\ncalling for a report from the police authorities.  It  is  from  this  order\nthat the matter reached this Court at the instance of  the  suspect/accused.\nThe Court observed that if the Metropolitan Magistrate had taken  cognizance\nof the offence and  issuance of summons upon the accused  persons  had  been\nmerely postponed, in a criminal revision filed  on  behalf  of  complainant,\nthe accused was entitled to be heard before the High Court.   Sections  397,\n399 and 401 were noticed by this Court and so  also  few  earlier  decisions\nincluding Chandra Deo Singh7, Vadilal Panchal14, P. Sundarrajan1   and  then\nin paragraphs 22 and 23 (Pg. 369) of the Report, the Court  held as under :\n",

Santhanam3,  a  two-\nJudge Bench of this Court was concerned with a question,  whether  the  High\nCourt committed an error in disposing  of  the  criminal  revision  petition\nfiled by the complainant without any notice to the accused.   On  behalf  of\nthe accused/suspect, it was argued that the High Court committed  the  error\nin disposing of the criminal revision without any  notice  to  him.  On  the\nother hand, on behalf of the complainant it was argued  that  no  notice  as\nsuch was required to be issued to the accused as it  was  at  the  stage  of\ntaking cognizance. The Court  considered  Section  401,  particularly,  sub-\nsection (2) thereof and held as under :\n",

Santhanam3  .\nWe hold,  as  it  must  be,   that  in  a  revision  petition  preferred  by\ncomplainant before the High Court or  the   Sessions  Judge  challenging  an\norder of the Magistrate dismissing the complaint under Section  203  of  the\nCode at  the  stage  under  Section  200  or  after  following  the  process\ncontemplated under Section 202 of the Code, the accused or a person  who  is\nsuspected to have committed crime is entitled to hearing by  the  revisional\ncourt. In other words, where complaint has been dismissed by the  Magistrate\nunder Section 203 of the Code, upon challenge to the legality  of  the  said\norder being laid by the complainant in a revision petition  before the  High\nCourt or the Sessions Judge, the persons who are arraigned   as  accused  in\nthe complaint have a right to be heard in such revision petition.   This  is\na plain requirement of Section 401(2)  of  the  Code.    If  the  revisional\ncourt overturns the order of the Magistrate  dismissing  the  complaint  and\nthe complaint is restored  to the file of the  Magistrate  and  it  is  sent\nback for fresh consideration, the persons who are alleged in  the  complaint\nto have committed crime have,  however,  no  right  to  participate  in  the\nproceedings nor they are entitled to any hearing of any sort  whatsoever  by\nthe Magistrate until the consideration of the matter by the  Magistrate  for\nissuance of process.

(Antox), the respondent, under which Antox agreed to manufacture vitaminsed Calcium Gluconate Tablets under the said registered Trade-Mark Cal-De-Ce and sell the entire production to the Wander Ltd. It would appear that pursuant to and in implementation of these arrangements Antox applied for the requisite manufacturing-license\n from the Drug Controller under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, in the course of the processing of which Wander Ltd. furnished before the Drug Controller an undertaking that Wander Ltd., would not authorize the use of its Trade-Mark Cal-De-Ce by any other company and further not to manufacture Cal-De-Ce with effect from 1st July, 1986, either by itself or under sole licenses from it. The Drug Controller issued the manufacturing licence to Antox.\n",

It is not necessary to advert to the rival contentions of the parties on the merits of this controversy as they may have to be gone into by the High Court in the pending suit. The disputes culminated in Wander Ltd., purporting to rescind the agreement by its notice dated 30th November, 1988 and calling upon Antox to stop manufacture of Cal-De-Ce under the Trade-mark. It would also appear that Wander Ltd., entered into a separate manufacturing arrangement with Alfred Berg & Co. (I) Pvt. Ltd., the second appellant, at Madras, under licenses issued to the second appellant by the authority administering the Drug and Cosmetics Act, 1940 in that State.\n",
        "p_7": "It is at this stage that the Antox came forward with the present suit and sought temporary injunction.\n",
        "p_8": "4. The case of Antox is that its agreement dated 28-2-1986 with Wander Ltd., was itself void in that its object was one forbidden by law ; that it would, if permitted defeat and violate several statutory provisions and prohibitions, that the agreement thus, out of way, the undertaking furnished on 21st June 1986 by Wander Ltd., to the Drug Controller in Karnataka, had the effect, in law, of and amounted to an abandonment by Wander Ltd., of its proprietorship of the Registered Trade-Mark Cal-De-Ce and all of such exclusive rights as Wander Ltd., had or may have had in respect of that Trade-Mark and that the subsequent continued user of the said Trade-Mark by Antox under the Drug Controller's licence amounted to an independent user of the Trade-Mark by Antox in its own right as, indeed, according to Antox, the said Trade-Mark after its abandonment by Wander Ltd., came to be in an ascent unwonted\n condition eligible to be picked up and used by any body. It was said that the user of the Trade-Mark by Antox after 21st of June 1986 amounted to such an independent user on the strength of which Antox claimed that it was entitled to maintain a passing off action even against Wander Ltd. The mere earlier registration of the Trade-Mark by Wander Ltd., it is urged, is no evidence of earlier user and with the abandonment of the Trade-Mark by Wander Ltd. Antox is entitled on the strength of its continuous user, to restrain Wander Ltd. from manufacture.\n",
        "p_9": "The point for consideration is whether there is a prima facie case on which Antox could be held entitled to restrain Wander Ltd. and Alfred Berg from manufacturing and marketing goods under the Trade name Cal-De-Ce and whether on considerations of balance of convenience and comparative hardship a temporary injunction should issue. The corollary is that even if the injunction sought by Antox is refused, that does not, ipso-facto, entitled Wander Ltd. and Alfred Berg to manufacture and market the goods if they are not otherwise entitled to do so under the relevant laws regulating the matter.\n",
        "p_10": "5. Usually, the prayer for grant of an interlocutory injunction is at a stage when the existence of the legal right asserted by the plaintiff and its alleged violation are both contested and uncertain and remain uncertain till they are established at the trial on evidence. The court, at this stage, acts on certain well settled principles of administration of this form of interlocutory remedy which is both temporary and discretionary. The object of the interlocutory injucntion, it is stated is to protect the plaintiff against injury by violation of his rights for which he could not adequately be compensated in damages recoverable in the action if the uncertainty were resolved in his favour at the trial. The need for such protection must be weighed against the corresponding need of the defendant to be protected against injury resulting from his having been prevented from exercising his own legal rights for which he could not be adequately compensated. The court must weigh one need against another and determine where the \"balance of convenience lies\". The interlocutory remedy is intended to preserve in status quo, the rights of parties which may appear on a prima facie. The court also, in restraining a defendant from exercising what he considers his legal right but what the plaintiff would like to be prevented, puts into the scales, as a relevant consideration whether the defendant has yet to commence his enterprise or whether he has already been doing so in which latter case considerations somewhat different from those that apply to a case where the defendant is yet to commence his enterprise, are attracted.\n",
        "p_11": "6. In the present case, the learned single Judge held that, at all events as between Antox and Wander Ltd. even to the extent considerations relevant for a passing-off action go, the latter was undisputably the earlier user of the Trade-Mark in that Wander Ltd. was manufacturing and marketing the Calcium Glouconate Vitamin Tablets under the Trade-Mark Cal-De-Ce at its own factory in Bombay from August 1983 upto June 1986. If this is correct, Antox's user cannot be held to be prior user. It is pertinent to note, and perhaps emphasise, that the appellate bench did not disturb this finding at all. Learned Single Judge was persuaded to the view that, in any event so far as the prima facie position as to the test of earlier user is concerned Antox could not be held entitled to interlocutory order in its favour on the basis of the earlier user claimed by it. The interlocutory relief was accordingly refused against both Wander and Alfered Berg.\n",
        "p_12": "7. Aggrieved by this order of the Trial Judge declining the interlocutory injunction Antox preferred O.S.A. Nos. 111-112 of 1989 before the Division Bench.

        "p_13": "The plaintiffs had licenses to manufacture for sale with the trade names and had indeed sold the manufactured stock in bulk to the defendants Its user of the trade marks pursuant to the licence obtained, was nut the user of the registered user under Sections 48 and 49 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, not was its manufacture carried out in pursuance of any loan licence taken out by the defendant under rule 69-A of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules.\n",
        "p_14": "The plaintiffs manufacture with the trade names, under licenses in the trade names and the consequent user of the trade names establish a prima facie case for passing off action and the balance of convenience, requiring and the status quo to be maintained, the plaintiff having had the benefit of the injunction from 23-9-1988 till 2-3-1989 when it was vacated and from 2-5-1989 when this Court granted the injunction, the plaintiff would be entitled to have the interim injunction as prayed for by them.\n",

        "p_16": "8. On a consideration of the matter, we are afraid, the Appellate Bench fell into error on own important propositions. The first is a misdirection in regard to the very scope and nature of the appeals before it and the limitations on the powers of the Appellate Court to substitute its own discretion in an appeal preferred against a discretionary order. The second pertains to the infirmities\n in the ratiocinations as to the quality of Antox's alleged user of the Trade-Mark on which the passing-off action is founded. We shall deal with these two separately.\n",
        "p_17": "9. The appeals before the Division Bench were against the exercise of discretion by the Single Judge. In such appeals, the Appellate Court will not interfere with the exercise of discretion of the court of first instance and substitute its own discretion except where the discretion has been shown to have been exercised arbitrarily, or capriciously or perversely or where the court had ignored the settled principles of law regulating grant or refusal of interlocutory injunctions. An appeal against exercise of discretion is said to be an appeal on principle. Appellate Court will not reassess the material and seek to reach a conclusion different from the one reached by the court below if the one reached by the court was reasonably possible on the material. The appellate court would normally not be justified in interfering with the exercise of discretion under appeal solely on the ground that if it had considered the matter at the trial stage it would have come to a contrary conclusion. If the discretion has been exercised by the Trial Court reasonably\n and in a judicial manner the fact that the appellate court would have taken a different view may not justify interference with the trial court's exercise of discretion. After referring to these principles Gajendragadkar, J. in Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd. v. Pothan Joseph  :\n",
        "p_18": "... These principles are well established, but as has been observed by Viscount Simon in Charles Osention & Co. v. Johnston the law as to the reversal by a court of appeal of an order made by a judge below in the exercise of his discretion is well established, and any difficulty that arises is due only to the application of well settled principles in an individual case.\n",
        "p_19": "The appellate judgment does not seem to defer to this principle.\n",
        "p_20": "10. We may now examine the tenability of the grounds on which a Division Bench reversed the single Judge's refusal. The passing-off action was based on the asserted right to a trade mark said to have been acquired by continuous user. According to the appellate-bench the user by Antox pursuant to the Drug-Controller's licence and after the under taking given by Wander Ltd. \"was not registered user under Sections 48 and 49 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act nor was it a manufacture carried out in pursuance of a loan because......\" In-passing-off action this would be relevant only in a negative way. Positively, the plaintiff must establish a prior user of his own prima facie. Antox's case appears silent on this requirement in the context of a specific finding of the single judge as to user by Wander Ltd. prior to June, 1986. Antox's user is admittedly after June, 1986.\n",
        "p_21": "An infringement action is available where there is violation of specific property-right acquired under and recognised by the statute. In a passing-of action, however, the plaintiff's right is independent of such a statutory right to a trade mark and is against the conduct of the defendant which lends to or is intended or calculated to lead to deception. Passing-off is said to be a species of unfair trade competition or of actionable unfair trading by which one person, through deception, attempts to obtain an economic benefit of the reputation which another has established for himself in a particular trade or business. The action is regarded as an action for deceit. The tort of passing-off involves a misrepresentation made by a trade to his prospective customers calculated to injure, as a reasonably foreseeable consequence, the business or goodwill of another which actually or probably, causes damage to the business or goodwill of the other trader. Speaking of the legal classification of this form of action, Lord Diplock said :\n",
        "p_22": " Unfair trading as a wrong actionable at the suit of other traders who thereby suffer loss of business or goodwill may take a variety of forms to some of which separate lables have become attached in English law. Conspiracy to injure a person in his trade or business is one, slander of goods another but most protean is that which is generally and nowadays, perhaps misleadingly, described as \"passing off\". The form that unfair trading takes will alter with the ways in which trade is carried on and business reputation and goodwill acquired. Emerson's maker of the better mousetrap if secluded in his house built in the woods would today be unlikely to find a path beaten to his door in the absence of a costly advertising campaign to acquaint the public with the excellence of his wares\" See Erven Warnink B.V. v. J. Towhand & Sons (Hull) Ltd. 1979 All E.R. 731.\n",
        "p_23": "11. Antox says that it is free from the inhibitions of the terms of the agreement dated 28th March 1986 on the ground that agreement is itself void for all purposes and, therefore, do not attach to or diminish the quality of its user, though commenced under that agreement. Antox says its user is referable to the Drug Controller's licence. But even assuming that the terms of the agreement dated 28th March 1986 are not to be put into the scales to determine the title to and character of the user by Antox, two crucial positions still stage Antox in the face.\n",
        "p_24": "The first is that the Drug Controller's licence claimed by Antox as the source of its right to the user of the trade-mark, itself expressly stipulates that the goods to be manufactured pursuant to the said licence shall be goods under the registered Trade-mark, of Wander Ltd. The effect of this on the quality of the user has not been examined by the Appellate-Bench.\n",
        "p_25": "Secondly, even if a prior registration of a Trade mark is not necessarily evidence of prior user as contended by Sri Raa, Antox cannot, prima facie, explain how in a passing-off action its user subsequent to June 1986 would prevail over the prima facie finding that Wander Ltd. was manufacturing Calcium Gluconate Tablets under the trade-mark Cal-De-Ce at its own factory in Bombay from August 1983 to June 1986. The Appellate Bench does not dislodge this finding nor does it recognise the crucial effect of prior use by the defendant on the plaintiff's case in a passing-off action. It appears to us that it was not an appropriate case where the appellate Bench could have interfered with the discretion exercised by the learned Single, Judge.\n",
        "p_26": "12. We, accordingly, allow these appeals, set aside order dated 19-1-1990 of the Division Bench in so far as it pertains to Civil Suit of 1220/ 1988 and restore the order dated 2-3-1989 made by the learned Single Judge on Applications 4941 and 4942 of 1988. Since we are examining the matter at an interlocutory stage, none of the observations contained in this order shall affect the final decision of the suit on the merits after evidence.\n",
        "p_27": "13. The order of the appellate Bench is common to the present suit as well as certain other proceedings between Antox on the one hand and certain other parties on the other. This judgment and the observations therein are confined to the facts of Civil Suit No. 1220/1988. The correctness of the Appellate Order in respect of other cases is not the subject-matter of these appeals and that, therefore, whatever we have said shall not prejudice the parties in those other proceedings.\n",

Sri Nariman for the respondent fairly consents to an order-and we accordingly make that order-setting aside the order under appeal and remitting the matter to the High Court for consideration afresh of the appeal for admission after affording another opportunity to the appellant of being heard.

Kapur (hereinafter referred to as \"the respondent\") and\nhis mother-in-law charging them with commission of  offences\npunishable under sections 420, 109, 114 and 120-B, I.P.C. It\ndoes not appear to be necessary\n523\nto give the details of the allegations made in that  report.\nThe charge in that First Information Report was based on the\nallegation  that  the respondent and his  mother-in-law,  by\nconspiring together, cheated the appellant and his wife of a\nsum  of Rs. 20,000/- by persuading the appellant to  take  a\nsale-deed of some land on certain false representations\t and\non suppression of facts indicating that on the date when the\nsale-deed by the respondent's mother-in-law was executed  in\nfavour of the wife of the appellant, the title of the former\nhad already been extinguished, as the land had been acquired\nby  the\t Government  under the Land  Acquisition  Act.\t The\noffence\t  was  registered  as  a  cognizable   offence\t and\ninvestigation was started.\n",
        "p_7": "On  April 11, 1959, the respondent filed a complaint in\t the\nCourt  of  Judicial  Magistrate,'  1st\tClass,\t Chandigarh,\nagainst\t the  appellant\t for commission\t of  offences  under\nsections  204,\t211 and 385 I.P.C. In  this  complaint,\t the\nrespondent alleged that the land was sold by his  mother-in-\nlaw to the appellant's wife as a favour to the appellant and\nthat at that time, no misrepresentations at all were made in\nrespect of any facts. The complaint added that the appellant\nwas  fully  aware of the land acquisition  proceedings;\t but\nbecause\t of  fixation  of low rate of  compensation  in\t the\nacquisition  proceedings,the  appellant suffered a  loss  of\nnearly\tRs. 13,000/-. The appellant,being a clever  criminal\nlawyer,\t  went\tto  the\t respondent's  mother-in-law,\tSmt.\nKaushaliya  Devi, and demanded the sum of  Rs.\t13,000/-,and\nwhen  she refused, he threatened her with dire\tconsequences\nof   criminal  proceedings against her and  her\t son-in-law,\nthe respondent.A similar threat of criminal proceedings\t was\nalso later given to the respondent himself by the appellant;\nand thereafter, the First Information Report was lodged with\nthe Inspector-General of Police by the appellant on December\n10,  1958. The charge in the complaint further was that\t the\nallegations  made  in the First Information  Report  by\t the\nappellant  were false to his knowledge and were contradicted\nby   the  appellant's  own  letters,  writings\t and   other\ncorrespondence.It  was also stated that the false report  to\nthe  police  was made with the knowledge  and  intention  of\nputting\t the respondent in fear of ,injury to his fair\tname\nand  reputation\t in service and otherwise and of  being\t put\nunder arrest and harassment in a criminal trial and  thereby\nto   induce  him  to  deliver to the appellant Rs.  13,000/-\nand  submit to other terms that the appellant may choose  to\nimpose.\t The  last  allegation was that\t the  appellant\t was\nguilty\tof the offence under s. 204, I.P.C.,  for  secreting\nfive  documents which were enumerated in the complaint,\t and\nthis offence was alleged to have been committed, because  if\nthese documents had been presented in time, the Police would\nnot have entertained the complaint which led to a  harassing\ninvestigation against the respondent.\n",

The first order was made on  an\napplication  presented\tby the appellant on May 6,  1963  in\nwhich  he  contended that no offence was  disclosed  on\t the\nallegations  made in the complaint and on the  statement  of\nthe  complainant recorded by the Magistrate  at\t Chandigarh,\nand,  further,\tthat, in any case, the trial was  barred  on\naccount\t of want of requisite previous sanction as  provided\nin  S. 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.  It  was\talso\nalleged that the facts were so inter-mixed that the trial of\nany  other offence separate from the offence under  S.\t211,\nI.P.C.,\t was  not  permissible\tor  possible,  so  that\t the\nMagistrate  was requested not to proceed with the trial\t and\nto  withdraw the order summoning the appellant; and  in\t the\nalternative,  the  prayer  was that  the  appellant  may  be\ndischarged  under S. 253, Cr.  P.C., as the  charge  against\nhim was groundless.\n",
        "p_9": "The second order of the Magistrate dated 5th October,  1963,\nwas passed on the application of the appellant dated  August\n12, 1963, in which it was prayed that the Court may not take\ncognizance  ,of the complaint as instituted, and  the  trial\nunder  S.  252, Cr.  P.C. may not proceed.  The\t prayer\t was\nagain  based  on the ground that cognizance of\tthe  offence\nunder  S.  21 1, I.P.C. could not be taken in  view  of\t the\nprovisions of S. 195(1)(a) & (b), Cr.  P.C., under which the\n,Court\twas empowered to proceed in respect of that  offence\nonly when there was a complaint, in writing by the authority\nconcerned.   The Additional District Magistrate by  his\t two\norders,\t rejected  the contention that s.  195,\t Cr.   P.C.,\nbarred\tthis  particular  complaint  which  had\t been  filed\nagainst the appellant.\tThe main ground for these orders was\nthat  no  proceedings  were pending in any  Court  when\t the\ncomplaint against the appellant was filed in the Court of\n525\nthe Magistrate at Chandigarh for the offences under sections\n204,  21 1, and 385, I.P.C. and consequently, s.  195,\t Cr.\nP.C.,  was  inapplicable.   That is the view  of  the  Addl.\nDistrict  Magistrate  which  has been  upheld  both  by\t the\nSessions  Judge\t and the High Court; and  consequently,\t the\nappellant has now come up to this Court in this appeal.\nOn behalf of the appellant, the first submission made by his\ncounsel, Mr. Frank Anthony, Was that the making of a  report\nof a cognizable offence with the police is both\t institution\nof  a criminal proceeding as well as charging a person\twith\nhaving committed an offence, so that, in this case, when the\nappellant  lodged his First Information Report\ton  December\n10,  1958, with the InspectorGeneral of Police, it  must  be\nheld  that he had instituted a criminal\t proceeding  against\nthe  respondent, as well as he had charged him\twith  having\ncommitted  the offences mentioned in that report within\t the\nmeaning\t of s. 21 1, I.P.C. In support of this\tproposition,\nlearned\t counsel  relied  on a Full Bench  decision  of\t the\nCalcutta High Court in Karim Buksh v. The  Queen-Empress(1),\nand a Full Bench decision of the Kerala High Court in Albert\nv.  State  of Kerala and Another.(2) It was urged  that,  on\nthis  interpretation, when the respondent filed a  complaint\nagainst\t the appellant under s. 21 1, I.P.C., together\twith\nother offences, the provisions of s. 195, Cr.  P.C.,  became\nattracted.  It appears to us that in this case it is not  at\nall  necessary to go into the question whether,\t whenever  a\ncomplaint of a cognizaable offence is filed, it must be held\nthat  the  complainant\tis  instituting\t or  causing  to  be\ninstituted a criminal proceeding, or is merely charging\t the\nperson\tnamed  in  the\treport\twith  having  committed\t the\noffences  mentioned therein, because, during the  course  of\nargument  in  the appeal before us, no\tcontention  was\t put\nforward\t that no offence under s. 211, I.P.C., was made\t out\nand  that  the\tcomplaint  of  the  respondent\tagainst\t the\nappellant  was\twrongly\t being treated as in  respect  of  a\ncharge under s. 21 1. Up to the stage of the revision before\nthe  High  Court,  some attempt was made on  behalf  of\t the\nappellant to plead that the facts alleged by the  respondent\nin his complaint to the Court did not constitute an  offence\nunder  s. 21 1, I.P.C. committed by the appellant;  but,  in\nthis  Court,  Mr. Frank Anthony on behalf of  the  appellant\ngave up this plea and, in fact, proceeded to urge before  us\nthat  the complaint of the respondent against the  appellant\ndid  specifically  include  in it a charge under  s.  21 1,\nI.P.C. On behalf of the respondent and the State  Government\nalso there was no suggestion that the complaint against\t the\nappellant  was not in respect of the offence under s. 21 1,\nI.P.  C. It is consequently unnecessary at this stage to  go\ninto the question whether the facts given in the  complaint,\nor the facts which may ultimately be found proved after\t the\ntrial,\tdo  or do not constitute an offence under s.  21 1,\nI.P.C. and if they do, whether those facts show that the\n(1) I.L.R.17 Cal. 574.\n",

That is a point which may\nhave  to  be decided at the conclusion of the trial  of\t the\nappellant; and consequently, we refrain from going into this\nquestion at this stage.\n",
        "p_12": "The only point that falls for determination by this Court is\nwhether,  in this case, cognizance of the_ complaint,  which\nincluded  an  offence under s. 21 1, I.P.C.,  filed  by\t the\nrespondent  against  the appellant, was rightly\t or  wrongly\ntaken  by the Courts.  The complaint, as we  have  mentioned\nearlier,  was  filed by the respondent in the Court  of\t the\nJudicial Magistrate at Chandigarh on April 11, 1959, and  on\nthe  same day, cognizance of the offence was taken  by\tthat\nMagistrate  under  s.  190,  Cr.   P.C.,  where\t after\tthat\nMagistrate   proceeded\tto  record  the\t statement  of\t the\nrespondent  under s. 200, Cr.  P.C. Before  this  cognizance\nwas  taken,  the  appellant had\t already  lodged  his  first\nInformation   Report   against\tthe  respondent\t  with\t the\nInspector-General  of  Police  on  December  10,  1958.\t  In\nconnection  with  that report, investigation by\t the  Police\nmust have been going on, though none of the judgments of the\nlower Courts mentioned what particular steps had been  taken\nin that investigation up to the 11th April, 1959, when\tthis\ncomplaint was filed by the respondent against the appellant.\nThe facts found only mentioned that in connection with\tthat\nFirst  Information Report of the appellant,  the  respondent\nwas arrested on July 18, 1959, and subsequently, the charge-\nsheet  was  submitted  by the Police to\t the  Court  of\t the\nMagistrate on July 25, 1959.  This arrest and submission  of\nthe  charge-sheet were both subsequent to the filing of\t the\ncomplaint  by  the respondent.\tIn these  circumstances,  we\nhave  to  examine whether the Magistrate at  Chandigarh\t was\ncompetent to take cognizance of this complaint on April\t 11,\n1959,  in  view of the provisions of s. 195 of the  Code  of\nCriminal Procedure.\n",
        "p_13": "In  dealing with this question of law, the important  aspect\nthat  has ,to be kept in view is that the point of  time  at\nwhich the legality of the cognizance taken has to be  judged\nis the time when cognizance is actually taken under S.\t190,\nCr.  P.C. Under the Code of Criminal Procedure which applies\nto  trials  of\tsuch cases, the only  provision\t for  taking\ncognizance  is\tcontained  in s. 190.\tSection\t 195,  which\nfollows\t that  section,\t is, in fact, a\t limitation  on\t the\nunfettered  power of a Magistrate to take  cognizance  under\ns.190.\tUnder the latter section cognizance of\tany  offence\ncan   be  taken\t by  any  Presidency  Magistrate,   District\nMagistrate  or\tSub-Divisional\tMagistrate,  and  any  other\nMagistrate  specially  empowered  in this  behalf  (a)\tupon\nreceiving  a  complaint\t of  facts  which  constitute\tsuch\noffence; (b) upon a report in writing of such facts made  by\nany  police-officer; and (c) upon information received\tfrom\nany  person  other than a police-officer, or  upon  his\t own\nknowledge or suspicion, that such\n527\noffence\t has  been  committed.\tIn  the\t present  case,\t the\nJudicial  Magistrate  at  Chandigarh  had  before  him\t the\ncomplaint  filed by the respondent, and if s. 190  stood  by\nitself,\t he  was competent to take cognizance  of  it  under\nclause\t(a)  of sub-s. (1) of that section.  This  power  of\ntaking\tcognizance was, however, subject to  the  subsequent\nprovisions  contained  in  the Code  of\t Criminal  Procedure\nincluding  that contained in s. 195.  Sub-s. (1) of s.\t195,\nwhich is relevant for our purposes, is reproduced below --\n",
        "p_14": "This sub-section thus bars any Court from taking  cognizance\nof  the\t offences  mentioned in clauses (a),  (b)  and\t(c),\nexcept\twhen the conditions laid down in those\tclauses\t are\nsatisfied.   In the case of an offence punishable  under  S.\n211, I.P.C., the mandatory direction is that no Court  shall\ntake  cognizance  of  any  offence  punishable\tunder\tthis\nsection, when such offence is alleged to have been committed\nin,  or in relation to, any proceeding in any Court,  except\non  the complaint in writing of such Court or of some  other\nCourt to which such Court is subordinate.  This provision in\nclause\t(b)  of\t sub-s.\t (1) of s. 195\tis  thus  clearly  a\nlimitation  on\tthe power of the Court\tto  take  cognizance\nunder  s.  190.\t  Consequently, it is at the  stage  when  a\nMagistrate  is taking cognizance under s. 190 that  he\tmust\nexamine the facts of the complaint before him and  determine\nwhether\t his power of taking cognizance under s. 190 has  or\nhas not been taken away by cl. (b) of sub-s. (1) of s.\t195,\nCr.  P.C. In\n528\nthe present case, therefore, at the time when this complaint\nwas  filed 'by the respondent in the Court of  the  Judicial\nMagistrate at Chandigarh, it was necessary and incumbent  on\nthat  Magistrate  to  examine whether his  power  of  taking\ncognizance  of the offence was limited by the provisions  of\ns.  195\t (1)(b).  He had, therefore,  to  determine  whether\ncognizance  of\tthis complaint charging the  appellant\twith\ncommission of an offence under s. 211, I.P.C., could not  be\ntaken by him, because that offence was alleged to have\tbeen\ncommitted  in,\tor  in relation to, any\t proceeding  in\t any\nCourt,\tand if he found that it was so, whether a  complaint\nin  writing by such Court or some other Court to which\tsuch\nCourt  was  subordinate was necessary before he\t could\ttake\ncognizance.   Consequently,  in deciding this  appeal,\tthis\nCourt has to examine whether on the date when cognizance was\ntaken\tby  the\t Judicial  Magistrate  at  Chandigarh\tsuch\ncognizance was barred under s. 195(1)(b), Cr. P.C.,  because\nthe offence punishable under s. 211, I.P.C., included in the\ncomplaint  was\talleged\t to have been committed\t in,  or  in\nrelation to, any proceeding in any Court.\n",
        "p_15": "    In\tthe interpretation of this cl. (b) of sub-s. (1)  of\ns. 195, considerable emphasis has been laid before us on the\nexpression  \"in, or in relation to\", and it has\t been  urged\nthat  the  use\tof  the expression  \"in\t relation  to\"\tvery\nconsiderably widens the scope of this -section and makes  it\napplicable  to\tcases where there can even in  future  be  a\nproceeding  in\tany Court in relation to which\tthe  offence\nunder s. 211, I.P.C., may be alleged to have been committed.\nA proper interpretation of this provision requires that each\ningredient in it be separately examined. This provision bars\ntaking\tof  cognizance if all  the  following  circumstances\nexist,\tviz., (1) that the offence in respect of  which\t the\ncase  is brought falls under s. 211 I.P.C.; (2)\t that  there\nshould\tbe  a  proceeding in any Court; and  .(3)  that\t the\nallegation  should  be\tthat the offence under\ts.  211\t was\ncommitted in, or in relation to, such a proceeding.   Unless\nall the three ingredients exist, the bar under s.  195(1)(b)\nagainst\t taking\t cognizance by the Magistrate, except  on  a\ncomplaint  in  writing\tof  a  Court,  will  not  come\tinto\noperation.  In the present case also, therefore, we have  to\nsee whether all these three ingredients were in existence at\nthe   time  when  the  Judicial\t Magistrate  at\t  Chandigarh\nproceeded  to  take cognizance of the charge under  s.\t211,\nI.P.C., against the appellant.\n",
        "p_16": "    There  is,\tof course, no doubt that  in  the  complaint\nbefore the Magistrate a charge under s..211, I.P.C., against\nthe  appellant\twas included, so that the  first  ingredient\nclearly\t existed. The question on which the decision in\t the\npresent\t case  hinges  is whether it can be  held  that\t any\nproceeding  in any Court existed when that  Magistrate\ttook\ncognizance.  If any proceeding in any Court existed and\t the\noffence under s. 211, I.P.C., in the complaint filed  before\nhim was alleged to have been committed in such a proceeding,\nor in\n529\nrelation  to any such proceeding, the Magistrate would\thave\nbeen  barred from taking cognizance of the offence.  On\t the\nother  hand, if there was no proceeding in any Court at\t all\nin which, or in relation to which, the offence under s.\t 211\ncould  have  been  alleged  to\thave  been  committed,\tthis\nprovision barring cognizance would not be attracted at all.\nIn this case, as we have already indicated when\t enumerating\nthe  facts, the complaint of which cognizance was  taken  by\nthe  Judicial Magistrate at Chandigarh was filed on April  1\n1,  1959,  and at that stage, the only proceeding  that\t was\ngoing on was investigation by the Police on the basis of the\nFirst Information Report lodged by the appellant before\t the\nInspector-General of Police on December 10, 1958.  There  is\nno  mention  at\t all  that there was,  at  that\t stage,\t any\nproceeding in any Court in respect of that F.I.R. When\texa-\nmining\tthe question whether there is any proceeding in\t any\nCourt,\tthere  are three situations that can  be  envisaged.\nOne is that there ,may be no proceeding in any Court at all.\nThe  second is that a proceeding in a Court may actually  be\npending at the point of time when cognizance is sought to be\ntaken of the offence under s. 211, I.P.C. The third is that,\nthough\tthere may be no proceeding pending in any  Court  in\nwhich,\tor in relation to which, the offence under  s.\t211,\nI.P.C.,\t could\thave been committed, there may have  been  a\nproceeding which had already concluded and the offence under\ns.  211\t may  be alleged to have been committed\t in,  or  in\nrelation  to, that proceeding.\tIt seems to us that in\tboth\nthe  latter  two circumstances envisaged above, the  bar  to\ntaking\tcognizance  under  s.  195(1)(b)  would\t come\tinto\noperation.  If there be a proceeding actually pending in any\nCourt  and the offence under s. 21 1, I.P.C., is alleged  to\nhave been committed in, or in relation to, that\t proceeding,\ns. 195(1)(b) would, clearly apply.  Even if there be a\tcase\nwhere  there  was, at one stage, a proceeding in  any  Court\nwhich  may  have  concluded  by the  time  the\tquestion  of\napplying  the  provisions of s. 195(1)(b)  arises,  the\t bar\nunder  that provision would apply if it is alleged that\t the\noffence\t under\ts.  211, I.P.C., was  committed\t in,  or  in\nrelation to, that proceeding.  The fact that\\ the proceeding\nhad concluded would be immaterial, because s. 195(1)(b) does\nnot  require that the proceeding in any Court must  actually\nbe  pending at the time when the question of  applying\tthis\nbar arises.\n",
        "p_17": "In the first circumstance envisaged above, when there is no\nproceeding pending in any court at all at the time when\t the\napplicability  of  S. 195(1)(b) has to\tbe  determined,\t nor\nearlier\t proceeding which may have been of this\t sub-section\nwould  not be attracted, has there been any  concluded,\t the\nprovisions  because  the language used in it  requires\tthat\nthere must be a proceeding in some Court in, or in  relation\nto,  which the offence under s. 21 1, I.P.C. is\t alleged  to\nhave been committed.  In such a case, a Magistrate would  be\ncompetent  to  take cognizance of the offence under  s.\t 211\nI.P.C., if his\n530\njurisdiction is invoked in the manner laid down in s. 190 of\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure.\n",

(b) of sub-s.\t (1)\nof s. 195 can justify any such interpretation.\tA proceeding\nin  contemplation  cannot be said to be a  proceeding  in  a\nCourt.\t When  there  is mere contemplation  of\t starting  a\nproceeding  in\tfuture,\t there\tis  no\tcertainty  that\t the\nproceeding  will  come into existence.\tIt  will  always  be\ndependent  on the decision to be taken by the person who  is\ncontemplating  that  the  proceeding  be  started;  and\t any\ninterpretation of the law, which will make the applicability\ndependent  on  a  future decision to  be  taken\t by  another\nperson,\t would, in our opinion, be totally  incorrect.\t The\napplicability  of  this provision at the sweet will  of\t the\nperson\tcontemplating  the  proceeding\twill  introduce\t  an\nelement of uncertainty in the applicability of the law;\t and\nsuch an interpretation must be avoided.\t In this case, apart\nfrom this circumstance, the language used clearly lends\t it-\nself  to the interpretation that the bar has been placed  by\nthe  Legislature  only in those cases where the\t offence  is\nalleged\t to have been committed in, or in relation  to,\t any\nproceeding actually pending in any Court, or any  proceeding\nwhich has already been taken in any Court.  There is nothing\nin  the\t language  to indicate\tthat  the  Legislature\talso\nintended to lay down this bar if a proceeding in a Court was\nstill under contemplation and if and when that proceeding is\ntaken, it may be found that the offence alleged to have been\ncommitted  was,\t in fact, committed in, or in  relation\t to,\nthat  proceeding.  In this connection, the question of\ttime\nwhen   the  applicability  of  this  provision\thas  to\t  be\ndetermined,  assumes importance.  It appears to us  that  at\nthe time when in the present case the Judicial Magistrate at\nChandigarh  had to determine the applicability of this\tbar,\nhe  could not be expected to come to a decision whether\t any\nproceeding  in any Court was under contemplation in,  or  in\nrelation  to,  which the offence under s. 21 1,\t I.P.C.,  of\nwhich  he was asked to take cognizance, was alleged to\thave\nbeen  committed.   In  fact,  it  would\t be  laying  on\t the\nMagistrate  a  burden  which he could  not  be\texpected  to\ndischarge  properly  and judicially as no  Magistrate  could\ndetermine in advance of a proceeding in a Court whether\t the\noffence\t under s. 21 1, I.P.C., of which he is\trequired  to\ntake  cognizance,  will be an offence which  will  be  found\nsubsequently  to  have\tbeen committed in  relation  to\t the\ncontemplated  proceeding  to  be  taken\t thereafter.\tThis\ninterpretation,\t sought\t to be placed on this  provision  on\nbehalf of the appellant, cannot, therefore, be accepted.\n",
        "p_19": "In  this connection, reliance was placed by learned  counsel\nfor  the appellant on a series of cases decided\t by  various\nHigh  Courts.  In Re Vasudeo Ramchandra Joshi(1),  the\tHigh\nCourt  of  Bombay quashed proceedings for prosecution  of  a\nlawyer\twho  had  instigated some witnesses  to\t give  false\nevidence.   It\tappears\t that a\t pleader  was  defending  an\naccused\t person in a proceeding pending before a  Magistrate\nagainst\t his  client in respect of a charge  under  s.\t401,\nI.P.C. On April 1, 1922, an application made by the  pleader\non  behalf of the accused for bail was refused.\t  Then,\t the\nstatements  of three witnesses were recorded under  s.\t164,\nCr.   P.C., on April 18, 1922, and from these statements  it\nappeared that on April 10, these witnesses had an  interview\nwith  the  pleader  who had instigated them  to\t give  false\nevidence.   On April 15, another case against the  pleader's\nclient\tin  respect of a dacoity was sent up  to  the  Magis\ntrate,\tand the allegation against the pleader was  that  it\nwas  in connection with this case of dacoity which was\tsent\nup  to\tthe  Magistrate on April 15, that  the\tpleader\t had\ninstigated the witnesses to give false evidence.  On June 2,\nthe  witnesses were actually examined before the  Magistrate\nin this dacoity case which was sent up on April 15; and then\non  June  7,  a complaint was filed by\tthe  Police  Officer\nagainst\t the  pleader charging him with having\tabetted\t the\ngiving\tof  false evidence.  It was in\tthese  circumstances\nthat  the High Court held that the provisions of  s.  195(1)\n",
        "p_20": "(b),  Cr.   P.C., were applicable and the case\tagainst\t the\npleader\t on the charge filed by the Police Officer  was\t not\nmaintainable  when there was no sanction by  the  Magistrate\nwho was enquiring into the dacoity case in relation to which\nthe  witnesses were instigated to give false  evidence.\t  On\nthe  facts,  it is clear that that case\t is  distinguishable\nfrom  the case before us.  In that case, the charge  by\t the\nPolice\tOfficer\t was  filed on June 7, and on  that  date  a\nproceeding  was\t already pending before\t the  Magistrate  in\nrelation to which the witnesses had been instigated to\tgive\nfalse evidence.\t The provisions of s. 195(1)(b) were, there-\nfore, clearly applicable.  Dealing with this matter, one  of\nthe  learned Judges of the High Court held that\t \"the  words\nare  very  general, and are wide enough, in my\topinion,  to\ncover a proceeding in contemplation before a Criminal Court,\nthough\tit may not have begun at the date when\tthe  offence\nwas committed.\tIf that is so, it is plain that sanction was\nnecessary   in\tthe  present  case,  and,   therefore,\t the\nproceedings  which  have been undertaken are  nun  and\tvoid\nwithout such sanction.\". These views expressed by Crump, J.,\nhad  been relied upon by learned counsel in support  of\t his\nproposition that even if an offence is committed in relation\nto a proceeding which is in contemplation, the provisions of\ns.  195(1) (b), Cr.  P.C., are attracted.  We do  not  think\nthat any such general proposition can be inferred from\tthat\ndecision.  It is to be noted that in that case though it was\nheld  that the offence of instigation of witnesses  to\tgive\nfalse evidence was committed when proceedings\n(1)  Al.R. 1923 Bom. 105.\n",

On the date on which the\ncomplaint  was\tfiled  by the Police  Officer  charging\t the\npleader with instigation of giving false evidence, there was\nalready a pending proceeding before the Court in relation to\nwhich  that offence had been committed.\t  Consequently,\t the\nobservations  in that case should be interpreted as  limited\nto  laying  down that the provisions of\t s.  195(1)(b),\t Cr.\nP.C.,  will  be attracted even if the  offence\tcharged\t was\ncommitted  while  the proceeding was in\t contemplation,\t and\nthat  there was no decision by the Court that  the  sanction\nunder  s. 195(1)(b) would be necessary even in\tthose  cases\nwhere  the proceeding is still\tunder contemplation  on\t the\ndate  when  the\t complaint is filed  before  the  Court\t for\ncommission  of\tthe  offence  mentioned\t in  s. 195(1)(b).\n    In Ghulam Rasul v.

Once again, a report was made by\nthe  police  that the complaint was false.   Thereupon,\t the\nMagistrate,  without  putting and end to that  complaint  of\nSyambar by dismissing it under s. 203, or passing any  other\norder as he might think fit, instituted proceedings  against\nGunamony  under\t s. 21 1, I.P.C.

On the analogy  to\tthis\ncase,  it  was urged by learned counsel that  in  this\tcase\nalso,  the  proceedings\t against  the  appellant  should  be\nquashed on the ground that, at the stage when the respondent\nfiled  his complaint against the appellant, the\t proceedings\nbeing taken by Police on the report of the appellant had not\ncome  to an end.

        "p_33": "In  K.Ramaswami Iyengar v. K. V. Panduranga  Mudaliar(1),  a\nlearned\t Judge\tof the Madras High Court, dealing  with\t the\nprinciple  underlying s. 195, Cr.  P.C. held: \"where an\t act\namounts\t to the offence of contempt of the lawful  authority\nof  public servants (ss. 172-188, I.P.C.), or to an  offence\nagainst\t public\t justice such as giving false  evidence\t (s.\n193,  et  seq.,\t I.P.C.),  or  to  an  offence\trelating  to\ndocuments  actually used in a Court (s. 471  etc.),  private\nprosecutions  are barred absolutely, and only the Court,  in\nrelation  to which the offence was committed,  may  initiate\nproceedings.   This  salutary  rule of\tlaw  is\t founded  on\ncommonsense.  The dignity and prestige of courts of law must\nbe upheld by their presiding officers, and it would never do\nto  leave  it  to  parties  aggrieved  to  achieve  in\t one\nprosecution   gratification   of   personal   revenge\t and\nvindication of a Court's honour and prestige.  To allow this\nwould  be  to sacrifice deliberately the  dispassionate\t and\nimpartial calm of tribunals and to allow a Court's  prestige\nto  be\tthe sport of personal passions.\" We  are  unable  to\ninterpret these views expressed by the Madras High Court  as\nimplying   that\t private  prosecutions\tfor   the   offences\nmentioned in clauses (b) & (c) of sub-s. (1) of s. 195,\t Cr.\nP.C., are barred absolutely and tinder no circumstances\t can\nsuch  offences be brought before courts by private  persons.\nIn  the case of cl.

If\t the\noffence\t was  not  committed  in, or  in  relation  to,\t any\nproceeding  in\tany Court, a private  complaint\t is  clearly\npermissible.   The  question of upholding  the\tdignity\t and\nprestige  of  courts  of law only  arises  after  there\t are\nproceedings in the Courts and not at the stage when no\tsuch\nproceedings have been instituted or have come into existence\nin  any\t Court.\t  In  the  present  case,  we  have  already\nindicated that the cognizance of the complaint filed by\t the\nrespondent  against the appellant was taken at a stage\twhen\nthere\twas  no\t proceeding  in\t any  Court  of\t  law,\t and\nconsequently,  at that stage, there could be no question  of\ndignity\t or prestige of a court of law being upheld or of  a\nprivate complaint being barred.\n",

This was again  a\tcase\nwhere  the statement under s. 164, Cr.\tP.C., was  found  to\nrelate to a proceeding that subsequently came into existence\nin a Court, and the question of filing the complaint for the\noffence\t of  making  that  false  statement  or\t of   taking\ncognizance in respect of that offence only arose after\tthat\nproceeding in Court had already come into existence.\nIn the case of Badri v. State(2), where an offence under  s.\n21 1,\tI.P.C., was alleged to have been  committed  by\t the\nperson\tmaking\ta false report against the  complainant\t and\nothers to the Police, it was held that it was an offence  in\nrelation  to the remand proceeding and the bail\t proceedings\nwhich  were  subsequently  taken  before  a  Magistrate\t  in\nconnection  with that report to the Police, and,  therefore,\nthe  case  was governed by s. 195(1)(b), Cr.  P.C.,  and  no\ncognizance  of\tthe  offence  could be\ttaken  except  on  a\ncomplaint  by  the Magistrate who held the remand  and\tbail\nproceedings.  We do not consider it necessary to express any\nopinion\t whether the remand and bail proceedings before\t the\nMagistrate  could be held to be proceedings in a Court,\t nor\nneed  we consider the question whether the charge of  making\nof the false report could be rightly held to be in  relation\nto  those  proceedings.\t  That aspect need  not\t detain\t us,\nbecause,  in  the case before us, the facts  are  different.\nThe  complaint\tfor the offence under s. 21 1,\t I.P.C.\t was\ntaken cognizance of by the Judicial Magistrate at Chandigarh\nat  a stage when there had been no proceedings\tfor  arrest,\nremand\tor  bail of the respondent and the  case  was  still\nentirely in the hands of the Police.\n",

It  is\nperfectly correct that when a report of a cognizable offence\nis  made, a duty is cast on the Police Officer in charge  of\nthe  station to investigate that case, and in certain  cases\nof serious offences, immediate report has to be sent to\t the\nMagistrate who has power to take cognizance of the offences.\nThere  is,  however, nothing in these sections\tto  indicate\nthat  the  Magistrate  is  required  to\t intervene  in\t the\ninvestigation  until the investigation is completed and\t the\ninvestigating\tofficer\t arrives  at  some   conclusion\t  in\naccordance  with s. 169 or s. 170, Cr.\tP.C.

If his  conclusion\nis  covered  by\t the provisions of s. 170,  Cr.\t  P.C.,\t the\nreport\t submitted   by\t the  investigating   officer\twill\nnecessarily  show  that a cognizable offence has  been\tcom-\nmitted and such a report will satisfy the requirements of s.\n190(1)(b),   Cr.

In two of these  cases,\nviz.,  .State v. Vipra Khimji Gangaram(2), and State &\tOrs.\nv.

Even if it be accepted that the final\norders to be made by the Magistrate are judicial orders, the\nonly  conclusion that follows is that at the last stage,  on\nreceipt\t of the report under s. 173, the Magistrate  has  to\nact in his judicial capacity.  Until that stage is  reached,\nthere  is no intervention by the Magistrate in his  judicial\ncapacity  or as a Court.  Consequently, until some  occasion\narises\tfor  a\tMagistrate  to\tmake  a\t judicial  order  in\nconnection with an investigation of a cognizable offence  by\nthe  police, no question can arise of the Magistrate  having\nthe power of filing a complaint under s. 195(1)(b),\n(1)   16 Cr.

        "p_17": "(vi) The mark of the Plaintiffs was registered as a nutritional factor of the Vitamin B Complex for the treatment of anemia and it is a misnomer to suggest that the mark as registered is confined to a folic acid preparation.

In the present case, the Plaintiffs have established sales of Rs. 9.89 crores in the year 200001 and Rs. 60 crores between 1990 and 2001 in respect of the mark FOLVITE.

There is a distinction between registration and use of a mark and while the Plaintiffs were opposing the registration of the mark, they consciously made a decision not to oppose the use of the mark, allowing the business of the Defendant to be built up over a period of seven years;\n",
        "p_24": "(ii) The judgment of the Supreme Court in Cadila Health Care which holds that a stricter test should be applied in the case of pharmaceutical Page 0417 products, should not be applied to all classes of medicines but only to those cases where both the drugs are meant for curing the same ailment but the compositions are different;\n",
        "p_25": "(iii) There is no phonetic or structural similarity between the two marks.

        "p_27": "8. At the outset, it would be necessary to advert to the relevant provisions of the Trade Marks Act, 1999. Section 28(1) of the Act confers upon the registered proprietor of a trade mark, the exclusive right - upon a valid registration - to the use of the trade mark in relation to goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered and to obtain relief in respect of infringement in the manner provided by the Act. Section 29(1) provides that a registered trade mark is infringed by a person who, not being a registered proprietor or a person using by way of permitted use, uses in the course of trade, a mark which is identical with, or deceptively similar to the trade mark in relation to goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered and in such manner as to render the use of the mark likely to be taken as being used as a trade mark. The expression \"deceptively similar\" is defined in Section 2(1)(h): \n",
        "p_28": " A mark shall be deemed to be deceptively similar to another mark if it so nearly resembles that other mark as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion.\n",
        "p_29": "Section 30 of the Act defines limits on the effect of a registered trade mark. Subsection (2) of Section 30 provides for certain situations in which a registered trade mark is not infringed. Among them is a situation in which a mark is used in relation to goods or services to indicate inter alia the kind, quality, intended purpose, value, geographical origin or other characteristics of the goods or services. \n",
        "p_30": "9. The principles which must guide the Court in determining whether the Defendant's mark is deceptively similar to the mark of the Plaintiffs were enunciated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Parker in the Pionotist Case: 1906(23) RPC 774 \n You must take the two words. You must judge them, both by their look and by their sound. You must consider the goods to which they are to be applied. You must consider the nature and kind of customer who would be likely to buy those goods. In fact, you must consider all the surrounding circumstances; and you must further consider what is likely to happen if each of those trade marks is used in a normal way Page 0418 as a trade mark for the goods of the respective owners of the marks. If, considering all those circumstances, you come to the conclusion that there will be a confusion - that is to say, not necessarily that one man will be injured and the other will gain illicit benefit, but that there will be a confusion in the mind of the public which will lead to confusion in the goods - then you may refuse the registration, or rather you must refuse the registration in that case.\n",
        "p_31": "The dictum of Justice Parker has been cited with approval in the judgments of the Supreme Court in Amritdhara v. Lakshmandhara  and more recently in Cadila Health Care Ltd. v. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (supra). The judgments of the Division Bench of this Court in Ciba Ltd. v. M. Ramalingam 1957 (59) BLR 548 and Indchemie Health Specialities Pvt. Ltd. v. Naxpar Labs Pvt. Ltd. 2002(24) PTC 341(Bom) follow the dictum. \n",
        "p_32": "10. Since the judgment of the Supreme Court in National Sewing Thread Co. Ltd. Chidambaram v. James Chadwick and Bros. Ltd.  it is a settled principle of law that the Court must assess each matter from the position of a purchaser \"who must be looked upon as an average man of ordinary intelligence\". For it is such a purchaser whose reaction to a particular trade mark has to be considered and what association he would form, by looking at the trade mark and in what respect he would connect the mark with the goods he would be purchasing. In Corn Products Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food Products Ltd.  the mark of the appellant, \"Glucovita\", was registered. The Respondent applied for the registration of the mark \"Gluvita\". The Deputy Registrar held that the mark proposed to be registered by the Respondent was not visually and phonetically similar. A Learned Single Judge of this Court held that the two marks were sufficiently similar so as to be reasonably likely to cause deception and confusion and held that the Respondent's mark could not be registered. A Division Bench on appeal held inter alia that there were a series of marks in which the prefix or suffix 'Gluco'or 'Vita'occurred and it could not be said that these common features were only associated with the appellant's case. The judgment of the Learned Single Judge was set aside. The Supreme Court set aside the judgment of the Division Bench of this Court and restored the order of the Learned Single Judge. The Supreme Court dealt with the finding of the Division Bench that trade marks with the prefix or suffix 'Gluco' and 'Vita' were common features of the trade and could not be associated only with the appellant's product, and observed thus: \n",
        "p_33": " The second point on which the learned appellate Judges based themselves in arriving at the conclusion that there was no reasonable apprehension of confusion or deception was, as we have earlier stated, Page 0419 that there were various trade marks with a prefix or suffix 'Gluco'or 'Vita'and that made it impossible to say that the common features 'Glu' and 'Vita' were only associated with the appellant's products. This view was founded on a passage which the learned appellate Judges quoted from Kerly on Trade Marks, 7th Edn., p.624. That passage may be summarised thus: \n",
        "p_34": "Where there are a \"series of marks, registered or unregistered, having a common feature or a common syllable, if the marks in the series are owned by different persons, this tends to assist the applicant for a mark containing the common feature. This statement of the law in Kerly's book is based on In re: an Application by Beck, Koller and Co. (England) Ltd., (1947) 64 R.P. C. 76.\n",
        "p_35": "It is clear however, from that case, as we shall presently show, that before the applicant can seek to derive assistance for the success of his application from the presence of a number of marks having one or more common features which occur in his mark also, he has to prove that these marks had acquired a reputation by user in the market.\n",
        "p_36": "(emphasis supplied)\n \n\nThe Supreme Court cited with approval the judgment in re: Harrods Application and the principle therein that the character comprising of a common element should be established to be in fairly extensive use. The Supreme Court observed thus:\n",
        "p_37": " (15) The series of marks containing the common element or elements therefore only assist the applicant when these marks are in extensive use in the market. The onus of proving such user is of course on the applicant, who wants to rely on those marks. Now in the present case the applicant, the respondent before us, led no evidence as to the user of marks with the common element. What had happened was that the Deputy Registrar looked into his register and found there a large number of marks which had either 'Gluco' or 'Vita' as prefix or suffix in it. Now of course the presence of a mark in the register does not prove its user at all. It is possible that the mark may have been registered but not used. It is not permissible to draw any inference as to their user from the presence of the marks on the register. If any authority on this question is considered necessary, reference may be made to Kerly p. 507 & Willesden Varnish Co. Ltd. v. Young & Marten Ltd. (1922) 39 RPC 185 at p. 289.\n",
        "p_38": "(emphasis supplied)\n \n\nThe Supreme Court noted that the Court would have to give due regard to the position that the word was an English word and was a foreign word to the mass of the Indian people and observed that in deciding a question of similarity between two marks, the marks have to be considered as a whole. Again, the question has to be approached \"from the point of view of a man of average intelligence and/or imperfect recollection\". To such a person, the structural and phonetic similarity and the similarity of the idea underlying the two marks was held to be reasonably likely to result in confusion.\n",
        "p_39": "Page 0420\n \n\n",
        "p_40": "11. The same principles were reiterated by the Supreme Court in Amritdhara Pharmacy (supra) and in Durga Dutt Sharmav. N.P. Laboratories.  In F. HoffmannLa Roche & Co. Ltd. v. Geofferey Manners & Co. Pvt. Ltd.  the question was as to whether the mark 'Dropovit'of the Respondent was deceptively similar to the registered mark 'Protovit' of the Appellant so as to warrant a removal from the register. The Joint Registrar had dismissed an application for rectification of the Register made by the Appellant, for the removal of the Respondent's mark and the decision was affirmed by a Learned Single Judge and a Division Bench of this Court. The Supreme Court observed that the affidavits of the Appellant itself indicated that the last three letters 'VIT' constituted a well known abbreviation in the pharmaceutical trade to denote vitamin preparations. The abbreviation 'vit' in both the marks was regarded as being descriptive and common to the trade. The Supreme Court held that if greater regard was to be had to the uncommon element, it was difficult to hold that the prefix 'Dropo' would be confused with 'Proto'. The Supreme Court reiterated the test that the two marks would have to be compared as a whole and little assistance would be obtained from a meticulous comparison, letter for letter. The Court would have to make an allowance for a person with imperfect recollection. Thus considered the word Dropovit was held not to be deceptively similar to Protovit. \n",
        "p_41": "12. In Cadila Health Care (supra), the Supreme Court revisited the entire issue of deceptive similarity in the context of pharmaceutical preparations. About a year before the decision in Cadila, there was an earlier decision of the Court in S.M. Dyechem Ltd. v. Cadbury (India) Ltd.  in which it was observed that where common marks are included in rival trade marks, more regard was to be paid to the parts not common and the proper course was to look at the marks as a whole, but at the same time not to disregard the parts which are common. The Court had observed that dissimilarities in essential features in devices and composite marks are more important than some similarity. The Supreme Court disapproved of the formulation of legal principle in S.M. Dyechem and observed that decisions of the Court over four decades had laid down that what was required to be analysed in an action for passing off was the similarity between the competing marks and the likelihood of deception. The factors which were enunciated by the Supreme Court in deciding the issue of deceptive similarity are as follows : \n",
        "p_42": "(a) The nature of the marks i.e. whether the marks are word marks or label marks or composite marks, i.e. both words and label marks; \n",
        "p_43": "b) The degree of resemblance between the marks, phonetically similar and hence similar in idea; \n",
        "p_44": "Page 0421\n \n\n",
        "p_45": "c) The nature of the goods in respect of which they are used as trade marks; \n",
        "p_46": "d) The similarity in the nature, character and performance of the goods of the rival traders; \n",
        "p_47": "e) The class of purchasers who are likely to buy the goods bearing the marks they require, or their education and intelligence and a degree of care they are likely to exercise in purchasing and/or using the goods; \n",
        "p_48": "f) The mode of purchasing the goods or placing orders for the goods; and \n \n\n",
        "p_49": "g) Any other surrounding circumstances which may be relevant in the extent of dissimilarity between the competing marks.\n",
        "p_50": "13. The Supreme Court emphasized the need of a stricter standard in matters of infringement and passing off involving pharmaceutical products in Cadila: At paragraph 32 page 1964\n Public interest would support lesser degree of proof showing confusing similarity in the case of trade mark in respect of medicinal product as against other nonmedicinal product. Drugs are poisons, not sweets. Confusion between medical products may, therefore, be life threatening, not merely inconvenient.\n",
        "p_51": "14. But the Defendant in the present case has submitted that the observations of the Supreme Court in Cadila must be confined to those cases where the competing marks are used in drugs with different compositions and in support of this submission, reliance has been placed on the following observations contained in paragraph 25 of Cadila: \n",
        "p_52": " The drugs have a marked difference in the compositions with completely different side effects, the test should be applied strictly as the possibility of harm resulting from any kind of confusion by the consumer can have unpleasant if not disastrous results. The Courts need to be particularly vigilant where the defendant's drug, of which passing of is alleged, is meant for curing the same ailment as the plaintiffs medicine but the compositions are different. The confusion is more likely in such cases and the incorrect intake of medicine may even result in loss of life or other serious health problems.\n",
        "p_53": "The judgment of the Supreme Court in Cadila has to be read in its entirety. The width and ambit of the test laid down by the Supreme Court cannot be restricted by an artificial process of construction which focuses attention only upon the observations contained in the aforesaid extract. In fact, in a subsequent part of the judgment, Supreme Court held thus: \n",
        "p_54": "What is likely to cause confusion would vary from case to case. However, the appellants are right in contending that where medicinal products are involved, the test to be applied for adjudging the violation of trade mark law may not be at par with cases involving non medicinal products.  A stricter approach should be adopted while applying the test to Judge the possibility of confusion of one medicinal product for another by the consumer. While confusion in the case of non medicinal products may only cause economic loss to the plaintiff, confusion between the two medicinal products may have disastrous effect on Page 0422 health and in some cases life itself. Stringent measures should be adopted specially where medicines are the medicines of last resort as any confusion in such medicines may be fatal or could have disastrous effects. The confusion as to the identity of the product itself could have dire effect on the public health.\n",
        "p_55": "14A. As a matter of principle, it would be inappropriate for the Court to apply a stricter standard only to a particular class of medicinal preparations. If the Court were to do this, it would have to make artificial distinctions from case to case based on whether or not the Court considers that a confusion arising out of the medicinal product in issue may or may not have disastrous effects on health and life. Such an approach is impermissible. An ostensibly innocuous medicinal preparation taken for an affliction which is not life threatening may yet result in a serious danger to life and health, where the drug is not manufactured under correct conditions. A consumer who desires to obtain a medicine even for an ordinary ailment is entitled to be sure that the drug that he purchases is of an assured character and quality. A manufacturer builds up a reputation for quality and standards assiduously over a length of time and an established mark assures to the consumer that the medicine which he has purchased is of a requisite quality that is associated with the mark. A less than strict standard cannot be applied on the hypothesis that the ailment which the drug is intended to treat is not life threatening, nor for that matter can the application of a lower standard be justified merely on the ground that the composition of the Plaintiff's product is the same as that of the Defendant and the confusion caused by mistaking one for the other would not result in a danger to health. Undoubtedly, where the competing drugs are meant to cure the same ailment but the compositions are different, mistaking one for the other may result in deleterious consequences. But, merely because the two competing marks are used for drugs with the same composition that would not justify applying a lower standard of scrutiny. For, even in such a case, the public interest lies in protecting the consumer against an unwary purchase of a deceptively similar product. The consumer must be protected against a reasonable possibility of confusion arising out of a deceptively similar mark. The attempt, therefore, to read down Cadila is impermissible. \n",
        "p_56": "15. The Plaintiffs are proprietors of the mark Folvite of which registration dates back to 1946. The Plaint contains a disclosure of the sales and the sales promotion expenses since 1981. The sales for the years 19992000 and 200001 were Rs. 9.28 crores and Rs. 9.89 crores respectively. Between 1980 and 2001, the Plaintiffs had total sales of Rs. 60 crores. The relevant date for determining whether the Plaintiffs have an established reputation or goodwill is the date of commencement of the conduct complained of. Narayanan on Trade Marks, 6th Edition page 728. The sales figures disclosed by the Plaintiffs for the relevant years prima facie demonstrate an established reputation and goodwill associated with the mark FOLVITE.\n",
        "p_57": "16. The Defendant commenced the use of the mark in December 2000. It is an undisputed position before the Court that the Defendant had originally adopted the mark FOLCACID. To the adoption of that mark the Plaintiffs Page 0423 had no objection. This brand name was changed to FOLV for which the Drugs Control Authorities signified their permission of 19th December 2000. The Defendant sought registration of the mark in an application of 31st May 2000 which reflected that the mark was proposed to be used. In seeking the registration of mark FOLV, the Defendant could not have been unaware of the existence on the Register of the mark of the Plaintiffs. A search of the Register would reveal that the mark FOLVITE had remained on the Register since 1946. The Defendant has furnished no cogent explanation before the Court in altering the mark under which their product was being sold and for the adoption of the new mark. The Plaintiffs contend that the adoption of the mark FOLV by the Defendant was neither bona fide nor honest and in the absence of a cogent explanation, the challenge of the Plaintiffs must be regarded as possessing substance. \n",
        "p_58": "17. In considering the question of deceptive similarity, the two marks have to be considered as a whole. The structure of the mark visually and phonetically must be borne in mind. The image which the Court must have is that of the quintessential common man. When the Judge looks at phonetics, the sound which accompanies the pronunciation of the mark is the sound of the mark to an ordinary purchaser bereft of the niceties of language. Structurally and phonetically FOLV falls within that perilous zone where approximation to the mark of the Plaintiffs is close enough to be deceptively similar. It is to my mind, no answer to state that the Plaintiffs intend that the VITE in their mark is to be so pronounced as to rhyme with 'white' while the Defendant intends that the \"V\" in their mark has to be so pronounced as to rhyme with the 'V' in 'victory' and to then make a distinction between VITE and the V. The ordinary customer goes to a small shop of a Chemist and to him the distinction between FOLVITE on the one hand and FOLV on the other is so thin as to almost be lacking in significance. It may well be that the manner in which the mark of the Plaintiffs is written in Devnagari may make the VITE in the mark resemble 'white'. But every customer in a multi lingual country such as India is not conversant with that script. An average consumer who asks for FOLVITE would fail to gauge the distinction when he is given a strip of tablets of FOLV and that is what matters on the question of deceptive similarity. \n",
        "p_59": "18. The contention of the Defendant is that the mark FOLVITE is a combination of FOL which stands for folic acid and VIT which is an abbreviation for Vitamin. The theory propounded by the Defendant is that the Plaintiffs cannot assert a monopoly over folic acid on the one hand and Vitamin on the other by adding an \"e\" to an abbreviation of the two words. This argument of the Defendant clearly misses the point and there are several reasons why it cannot be accepted. First and foremost, the word FOLVITE has absolutely no meaning in the English language. It is an invented word. As the Supreme Court observed in Cadila, it is not right to take a part of a word and compare it with a part of another. Each word must be taken as a whole and compared as a whole with the other:\n",
        "p_60": " It is not right to take a portion of the word and say that because that portion of the word differs from the corresponding portion of the word in the other case, there is no sufficient similarity to cause confusion.\n",
        "p_61": "Page 0424\n \n\n",
        "p_62": "19. Secondly, it is a settled principle of law that so long as a mark continues on the Register, it is not open to the Defendant in an action for infringement to question the validity of the registration. Subsection (1) of Section 31 postulates that in all legal proceedings relating to a trade mark registered under the Act, the original registration of the trade mark and of all subsequent assignments and transmissions of the mark shall be prima facie evidence of the validity thereof. The sequitur of the submission of the Defendant is that the mark of the Plaintiffs comprises of a generic description of two elements, namely, folic acid and Vitamin, resulting thereby in the mark losing its distinctive character. During the course of the submissions, however, Mr. Dhond, the Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the Defendant who argued the case with felicity, submits that the Defendant does not question the distinctive character of the mark of the Plaintiffs or the validity of the mark. The mark of the Plaintiffs constitutes a composite invented word and it would not be open to the Defendant by a process of breaking down the mark to claim that it is only a combination of common elements. Such an exercise would be impermissible and so long as the mark continues to borne on the Register of Trade Marks, the validity of the mark cannot be questioned. \n",
        "p_63": "20. Thirdly, before the Court can accept that the words incorporated in a mark are elements which are common to the trade or business, certain essential ingredients must demonstrably be established. The judgment of the Supreme Court in Corn Products (supra) categorically lays down the principle of law that before an applicant can assert the presence of a number of marks having one or more common features in the trade \"he has to prove that these marks had acquired a reputation by user in the market\". The onus of establishing this lies on him who asserts the existence of such other mark. The judgment in Corn Products emphasizes that the presence of a mark in the Register does not prove its use and it is quite possible that the mark may have been registered but not used. Now, from this stand point if the material which is produced by the Defendant is assessed, the Defendant relies upon a Continuous Prescription Report of a Calcutta based agency, C. Marc. The parameters on the basis on which the survey was carried out have not been set out. The period of the report is between September and October 2007 which is irrelevant to the period when the cause of action arose. The relevant date for determining whether the Plaintiffs have established a reputation and goodwill is the date of the commencement of the action complained of. The relevant date for determining whether the conduct of the Defendant amounts to passing off is when the conduct commenced. The relevant period for which material ought to have been produced is the year 200001. No proof has been produced of the actual sales of those other products or that the sales were extensive. The same position holds in respect of the issue of the Current Index of Medical Specialties which is for the period July to October 2007 and of the periodical Drug Today which is for July to September 2007. \n",
        "p_64": "21. Fourthly, the mark of the Plaintiff has been registered as a nutritional factor of the Vitamin Bcomplex in the treatment and prevention of vitamin Page 0425 deficiencies and anemia. Butter worth's Medical Dictionary (2nd edition p. 1822) identifies the factors of the vitamin B complex as : \n",
        "p_65": " 1. Thiamine.... 2. Riboflavine.... 3. Pyridoxine.... 4. Folic acid.... 5. Biotin.... 6. Aminobenzoic acid.... 7. Vitamin B12.... 8. Nicotinic acid, pyridine Bcarboxylic acid.... 9. Pantothenic acid.... 10. Inositol.... 11. Choline....\n",
        "p_66": "Therefore, it would in the nature of things be impermissible to equate the registration of the mark of the Plaintiff for a preparation involving folic acid alone. \n",
        "p_67": "22. This principle was followed in a judgment of a Learned Single Judge (S.J. Vazifdar, J.) in Pidilite Industries Ltd. v. S.M. Associates 2004(28) PTC 193 (Bom) and by the Delhi High Court in Remidex Pharma Private Limited. v. Savita pharmaceuticals P. Ltd. 2006(33) PTC 157 (Del.) and Glaxo Group Limited v. Vipin Gupta 2006(33) PTC 145 (Del.). A Division Bench of this Court consisting of Chief Justice C.K. Thakker (as His Lordship then was) and Mr. Justice S. Radhakrishnan in Medley Laboratories (P) Ltd. v. Alkem Laboratories Limited 2002(25) PTC 592 (Bom), considered the question of deceptive similarity in an action for infringement and passing off where the Defendant started selling a pharmaceutical preparation under the mark 'Supaxin' which was claimed to be deceptively similar to the Plaintiff's registered mark 'Spoxin'. The medicinal preparation of the Plaintiffs contained a generic drug Sparfloxacin. The Defendant used the mark Supaxin for its preparation based on Ofloxacin. A Learned Single Judge of this Court had declined ad interim relief holding that the explanation of the Defendant for the adoption of the mark was plausible and the marks were not phonetically similar. Relying on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Cadila, the Division Bench, while allowing the appeal set aside the order declining adinterim relief and observed thus: \n",
        "p_68": " The case of the appellants is that suffix 'XIN' being common to both the drugs, there is likelihood of confusion. The mark of the plaintiffs is registered, and, hence, it has statutory protection. It relates to a medicinal preparation. In the circumstances, in our opinion, the test of 'possibility' laid down in Cadila Healthcare Ltd. would apply. Applying the said test, there is likelihood, or in any case, possibility of consumer being confused, and the plaintiffs were entitled to interim injunction. Moreover, SPOXIN and SUPAXIN are visually, phonetically and structurally similar. No doubt, both the drugs are sold under prescription, but that fact alone is not sufficient to prevent confusion which is likely to arise.\n",
        "p_69": "23. A large number of authorities have been cited by Learned Counsel appearing for the contesting parities. Once the principle which forms the basis for adjudication is formulated, the outcome of each case necessarily turns on the application of the principle to the facts of that case. The Defendant relied upon a judgment of the Division Bench in Johann A. Wulfing v. Chemical Industrial & Pharmaceutical Laboratories Limited  where the Court held that visually and phonetically, the Page 0426 marks Complamina and Ciplamina were as a matter of first impression not deceptively similar. The judgment of the Supreme Court in F. HoffimannLa Roche (Supra) involved a fact situation where the marks Dropovit and Protovit were held not be deceptively similar. Affidavits were filed before the Supreme Court by the appellants themselves who were aggrieved by the rejection of an application for rectification of the register, that there were as many as 57 trade marks registered with the suffix 'VIT'which denoted vitamin preparations. The Supreme Court held that the marks would have to be considered as a whole and the different prefixes of the two marks belied the claim of deceptive similarity. The prefix 'Dropo'was sufficiently distinguished from the prefix 'Proto'. In the judgment of the Delhi High Court in SBL Ltd. v. Himalaya Drug Co. 1997(17) PTC 540 the word 'LIV'was regarded as a generic abbreviation of 'Liver' so as to afford the Defendant a valid defence in an action for infringement and passing off. The decided cases furnish other instances. Among them is a judgment of the Delhi High Court where a trade mark of a medicinal preparation (Nimulid) is wholly derived from the principal drug used in its manufacture (Nimesulide). (Panacea Biotec Ltd. v. Recon Ltd. . Griffon Laboratories (P) Ltd. v. Indian National Drug Co. P. Ltd. Order dated 18-9-11987 in Suit 399/1985 (Calcutta High Court) was a decision of the Calcutta High Court where both the preparations -Sorbiline and Sorbitone were derived from the drug Sorbitol used in the preparation. Reference may also be made to the decisions in Kalindi Medicure Pvt. Ltd. v. Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd. 2006(33) PTC 477 (Del) and Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. v. Indohemie Health Specialities Pvt. Ltd. 2002(24) PTC 510 (Bom)) Several of these cases turn on the application of the principle to the facts of each case. In certain decisions which were rendered before the decision of the Supreme Court in Cadila, the approach of the Court may now need to be reconsidered in view of the principle of strict scrutiny enunciated in Cadila. For instance, in the Liv 52 case (supra), an important consideration which weighed with the Delhi High Court was that the sales of medicinal preparations were made only by authorised or licensed vendors and a purchaser would normally have a Doctors' prescription, the purchasers continuing to remain in touch with the Doctors. Learned Counsel for the Defendant fairly did not therefore, rely on this part of the reasoning of that decision. The same reasoning forms the basis of the judgment of a Learned Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court in Griffon Laboratories (supra) where the Court held that medicines are either advertised in Special Journals or are prescribed by doctors and the prescriptions are served by registered Chemists. The Calcutta High Court observed that the public does not enter into the picture at all, in the selection of the product for after all it is the doctor who knows what is good for the heart and good for the liver. This line of reasoning is inconsistent with the law laid down by the Supreme Court in Cadila. A Learned Single Judge of this Court held in Schering Corporation v. United Biotech (P) Ltd. Notice of Motion No. 3459/2004 in Suit No. 3419/2004, dated 14-7-2006 that the Defendants'mark 'Netmicin'did not Page 0427 infringe the mark 'Netromycin' of the Plaintiffs or amount to passing off. The Learned Judge was of the view that the Plaintiffs had not been able to establish the distinctiveness of their mark and the words Netmicin and Netromycin were not phonetically similar. There was no possibility of confusion because while the Defendants' product was purchased in bulk by hospitals, the Plaintiffs' product was sold over the counter. Moreover, the Learned Single Judge accepted the claim that there were several other pharmaceutical products being traded in the market, ending with the letters MYCIN, MICIN and CIN. In Bal Pharma Ltd. v. Wockhardt Limited Judgment dated 12-6-2002 in Appeal 498/2002 in Notice of Motion 725/02 in Suit 1305/02 the mark AZIWOK was regarded as distinct from as AZIWIN. The Division Bench accepted the contention of the appellant that various brands of Azithromycin in the tablet and syrup form were being marketed by pharmaceutical Companies and AZI was an abbreviation for the generic name of the drug. There were thirteen other Companies which were using the prefix AZI. It was in these circumstances, that the word AZI was regarded as not being distinctive but as common to the trade. The suffixes WOK and WIN were regarded as dissimilar. The judgment of a Learned Single Judge in Medley Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. Khandelwal Laboratories Ltd. Judgment dated 27-9-2005 in Notice of Motion 2808/02 in Suit 3323/02 holds that the mark CEFO of the Plaintiff and CEFI of the Defendant used for the manufacture and sale of Cefixime were not deceptively similar. In affirming the view of the Learned Single Judge, the Division Bench in the judgment in appeal (Appeal 1118 of 2005, decided on 22nd December 2005) held that there were cefixme preparations available in the market, using the prefix CEF and sales of those products were in millions of rupees. The finding of the Trial Judge that the Plaintiff had failed to establish the distinctiveness of his mark was, therefore, held not to suffer from any infirmity.\n",
        "p_70": "24. All these are cases where there was ample and demonstrable material before the Court to hold that there was a substantial sale involving competing products using a generic description of the bulk drug from which a preparation was manufactured. That is the distinguishing feature in the decided cases. \n",
        "p_71": "25. Counsel appearing on behalf of the Defendant has submitted that the Plaintiffs must be regarded as having acquiesced in the use of the mark by the Defendant for seven years. There is no merit in the contention. The ingredients spelt out in the judgment of the Supreme Court in Power Control Appliances v. Sumit Machines Pvt. Ltd. 1994(1) PTC 117 to establish acquiescence are lacking. In the present case the conduct of the Plaintiffs shows that immediately after the application of the Defendant for the registration of the mark was advertised, the Plaintiffs opposed the registration by adopting due process of law. Similarly, material has been placed before the Court to indicate that the Plaintiffs had pursued similar cases involving infringements of their mark by others. An application for the registration of a trade mark FULVIT was withdrawn on 9th March 2006, the application having been made by Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Similarly, an application for the registration of the mark FOLIVIT was abandoned Page 0428 and an order was passed by the Deputy Registrar, Chennai on 17th October 2007. The Plaintiffs have been vigilant to protect themselves against infringing marks by opposing these registrations.\n",
        "p_72": "26. The Plaintiffs have established a prima facie case for the grant of interim relief. The Plaintiffs are the proprietors of the mark Folvite of which the registration dates back to 1946. Associated with the mark, is a reputation and goodwill which has been built up over the last 60 years. The Defendant has no cogent explanation for changing the mark FOLCACID to FOLV.\n",
        "p_73": "The mark of the Defendant is deceptively similar. The balance of convenience in a case such as the present is in favour of the grant of an interim injunction. Irreparable harm would be caused to the Plaintiffs if an injunction were not to be granted.\n",
        "p_74": "The Motion is made absolute in terms of prayer Clauses (a), (b), (c1) and (c2). \n"

No. 6563/ 94) under Order 39, Rule 1 & 2 read with Section 151, CPC seeking temporary injunction, restraining the defendant, its agents, dealers and all others acting for and on its behalf from manufacturing, selling, offering for sale, advertising, directly or indirectly and dealing in edible oils under the trade mark 'Jiwan Dhara' or any other trade mark identical with or deceptively similar to the plaintiff's said trade mark till the disposal of the suit.  \n",

        "p_5": " 4. Briefly stated, the case of the plaintiff is that it is engaged in the business of manufacture and marketing of edible oils and adopted the trade mark 'Jiwan Dhara' label since 1 October, 1993; has been continuously using the same since then; it is the adaptor of the said trade mark; it has established extensive business in major parts of the country; its sales under the said trade mark since its adoption till the date of filing of the suit were to the tune of Rs. 48 lacs; it has spent substantial amount on the publicity of the said trade mark and as a result thereof it enjoys good reputation in the market; its trade mark has become sufficiently distinctive in the trade.  \n",
        "p_6": " 5. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant has adopted a similar trade mark 'Jiwan Dhara' only in the second week of June, 1994 with a view to trade upon the reputation of the plaintiff to earn undue profits to which it is not entitled; user of the similar trade mark by the defendant is bound to cause confusion and/or deception amongst the purchasing public and trade leading to passing off the goods and business of the defendant as the goods and business of the plaintiff, particularly when the goods, trade channels and purchasers of the plaintiff as well as of the defendant are the same.  \n",
        "p_7": " 6. The suit as well as plaintiff's application is resisted by the defendant and the plaintiff's assertion of being the originator and the prior user of the trade mark 'Jiwan Dhara' is not only emphatically denied by the defendant, but it has also filed counter claim to restrain the plaintiff, etc., from using the impugned trade mark, along with their application i.e., 8323/94 for interim relief to the same effect. \n",
        "p_8": " 7. The stand of the defendant in its written statement and counter claim is that the defendant adopted the trade mark 'Jiwan Dhara' on 1 April, 1993; an application for registration of the said trade mark was filed on 19 July, 1993; the defendant started selling edible oils under the said trade mark in the end of October, 1993; the plaintiff came in the market subsequently with the impugned trade mark in order to trade upon the established goodwill and reputation of the defendant, its sales from 30 October, 1993 to 29 July, 1994 were over Rs. 5 crores out of which the sales of edible oil under the trade mark 'Jiwan Dhara' were approximately Rs. 85 lacs. It is asserted that on gaining knowledge about the plaintiff's user of its trade mark, the defendant sent a legal notice to the plaintiff on 12 March, 1994 urging it to desist from using the said trade mark to which the plaintiff sent a vague and evasive reply on 25 March, 1994 without disclosing since when it was using the trade mark 'Jiwan Dhara'.  \n",
        "p_9": " 8. I have heard Mr. S.K. Bansal, learned Counsel for the plaintiff and Mr. M.L. Mangla, learned Counsel for the defendant, who have taken me through the documents filed in support of their respective cases.  \n",
        "p_10": " 9. It is well settled principle of law relating to an action for passing off that in order of succeed in getting an interim injunction the plaintiff has to establish the user of the impugned trade mark prior in point of time than the impugned user by the defendant. The registration of the mark or a similar mark prior in point of time to user by the plaintiff is irrelevant and the mere presence of the mark in the register maintained by the trade mark registry does not prove its user by the person(s) in whose name(s) the mark was registered and it was irrelevant for the purpose of deciding the application for interim injunction. In other words the priority in adoption and user of a trade mark is superior to priority in registration (see Century Traders v. Roshan Lal Duggar and Company,  and N.R. Dongre v. Whirlpool Corporation, , affirmed by the Supreme Court in ).  \n",
        "p_11": " 10. In the present case, in view of the admitted position that both the parties, dealing in the same goods, are using the same trade mark, having common trade channels and common consumers, the area of controversy is very narrow being restricted to the question as to which of the two parties is a prior adaptor and user of trade mark 'Jiwan Dhara'.  \n",
        "p_12": " 11. Mr. S.K. Bansal, learned Counsel for the plaintiff, in support of his claim that the plaintiff, having adopted the said trade mark since 1 October, 1993, is a prior user of the said trade mark, has invited the attention of the Court to the application for registration of the said trade mark and various invoices, which show that though in the registration application the user has been claimed from 1 October, 1993 but the plaintiff has been using the impugned trade mark atleast from 26 January, 1994. Challenging the stand of the defendant that it had adopted and started my attention to carbon copies of the invoices filed by the defendant. has drawn my attention to carbon copies of the invoices filed by the defendant. He has contended that some of the invoices are fabricated for the purpose of the present case and in fact the plaintiff has been able to procure one of the original invoices dated 26 November, 1993, which shows that the mustard oil supplied. under the said invoice was with the trade Mark 'Paawan Dhara' whereas the carbon copy produced by the plaintiff bears the trade mark 'Jiwan Dhara'. His submission is that the documents as relied upon the defendant to establish its user prior to that of the plaintiff, are of dubious and doubtful nature and cannot be relied upon. He points out that the plaintiff has in fact moved an application under Section 340, Cr.P.C. for initiating criminal action against the defendant, in relation to the said invoices. His submission is that if these invoices are ignored the case of the plaintiff's user prior in time stands established. \n",
        "p_13": " 12. On the other hand, Mr. Mangla, learned Counsel for the defendant, countering the allegation of the plaintiff' counsel that the invoices produced by the defendant are unreliable being fabricated, has attempted to explain the alleged discrepancy in invoice dated 26 November, 1993. He asserts that even if this invoice is ignored for the time being there are other invoices which show that the defendant had marketed its product under the impugned trade mark in September, 1993 and December, 1993 i.e., prior to plaintiff's user in January, 1994. Learned Counsel has also contended that the present suit was failed by the plaintiff only after the defendant had issued a legal notice to it, preempting initiation of legal action by the defendant against it. \n",
        "p_14": " 13. Having given my thoughtful consideration to the rival contentions and the material placed on record by both the parties, I feel that, prima facie, the plaintiff has been able to establish user of the trade mark 'Jiwan Dhara' prior in time than its user by the defendant. Though at this stage it may not be appropriate to give any finding on the issue whether some of the invoices furnished by the defendant are fabricated or not because it would be a matter to be considered and decided after trial but a bare look at the copies of the invoices dated 30 September, 1993, 26 November, 1993 & 8 December, 1993 tends to indicate that the words 'Jiwan Dhara' have been inserted in the said copies subsequently. I say no more lest it may prejudice the defendant's main case but I am constrained to observe that when a party itself seeks a relief in equity, it must unequivocally demonstrate that its hands are absolutely chain, which, prima facie, does not seem to be the case here. It is also pertinent to note that though in the copies of some other invoices, dated 4 May, 1994 and thereafter the goods sold are shown to be of trade mark 'Jiwan Dhara' written in hand but the trademark 'Paawan Dhara' which was being used by the defendant earlier, when it had commenced its business has been printed on the invoices itself. These invoices, all dated after the plaintiff had sent its reply to the defendants legal notice, not only appear to have been prepared as self serving evidence but also appear to show that the defendant itself attached more importance to its original trade mark 'Paawan Dhara'. On the other hand copies of the invoices placed on record by the plaintiff bear the trade mark 'Jiwan Dhara' and show its user atleast from 26 January, 1994 i.e., prior in point of time than its user by the defendant from 4 May, 1994. Nothing turns on the argument of learned Counsel for the defendant that the present suit has been filed by the plaintiff after issue of legal notice by the defendant to foreclose the issue in its favour. The notice issued by the defendant seems to be as vague as plaintiff's reply to it. Having arrived at the conclusion that the plaintiff's user of the impugned trade mark is prior in time than its user by the defendant it must necessarily follow that the defendant cannot be permitted to use the same trade mark jointly with the plaintiff because, as observed by the Supreme Court in  Power Control Appliances and Ors. v. Summet Machines Private Limited, , there can be only one mark, one source and one proprietor. It cannot have two origins. \n",
        "p_15": " 14. For all these reasons, in my view, the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case for grant of  ad-interim injunction in its favour. The balance of convenience is also in its favour. As regards the question of irreparable injury to the plaintiff, if the defendant is not restrained from using the impugned trade mark, the product, being traded by both the parties, being same, there is every possibility of difference in standard and quality of the goods which would not only cause confusion in the minds of purchasing public but may also affect the reputation of the plaintiff. On the other hand, no injury is likely to be caused to the defendant on account of restraint order because on its own showing major portion of its sales has been under the trade mark \"Paawan Dhara\" which it had adopted at the time of commencement of its business. \n",
        "p_16": " 15. Consequently, I restrain the defendant, its agents or anyone else acting on its behalf from manufacturing, selling or offering for sale, directly or indirectly edible oils with mark 'Jiwan Dhara' or any other mark which may be deceptively similar to the said mark till the final disposal of the suit.  \n",
        "p_17": " 16. However, having regard to the fact that the claimed user of impugned trade mark by both the parties in very close proximity in time, I would direct the plaintiff to maintain a proper account of its sales under the trade mark 'Jiwan Dhara' and submit the same in the Court biyearly till the disposal of suit.  \n",
        "p_18": " 17. It is made clear that whatever has been observed hereinabove will have absolutely no bearing in the trial of the suit and the counter claim. \n",
        "p_19": " 18. In the result plaintiff's I.A. No. 6563/94 is allowed and I.A. No. 8323/94 filed by the defendant is dismissed.  \n"

It is  unnecessary  to\nrefer to the decisions of the various High Courts in the light of\nthe  decisions of this Court.  Per contra, Mr.\tVimal Dave, while\nadopting  the  reasoning of the courts below, contended that  the\nprovisions of Section 69 of the Partnership Act are no impediment\nto  the respondent getting relief as a defendant in the hands  of\nthe  Arbitrator in a proceeding initiated by the appellant itself\nand  as long as the respondent was only a respondent and had  not\ninitiated  or  commenced any proceedings of its own, there is  no\nmerit  in  the preliminary objection raised, which, according  to\nthe learned counsel, has been rightly overruled.\n",

In construing the words, ``a claim of  set\noff  or\t other\tproceeding  to enforce a  right\t arising  from\ta\ncontract  .., it was held that the section thinks in terms of\n",
        "p_7": "(a)  suits and (b) claims of set off which are in a sense of  the\nnature\tof suits and (c) other proceedings and while the  section\nfirst  provides for exclusion of suits in sub-sections (1) &  (2)\nof  Section 69 the same ban is also applied to a claim of set off\nand  other  proceedings\t to  enforce any  right\t arising  from\ta\ncontract.   This  Court\t ultimately construed the  words  ``other\nproceedings  in sub-section (3) of Section 69 giving them their\nfull  meaning  untrammelled by the words ``a claim of set  off,\nand  held that the generality of the words ``other  proceedings\nare not to be cut down by the latter words.  The said case, being\none  concerning an application before Court under Section 8(2) of\nthe  Arbitration  Act,\t1940  in the  light  of\t the  arbitration\nagreement,  this  Court finally held that since\t the  arbitration\nclause\tformed part of the agreement constituting the partnership\nthe  proceeding under Section 8(2) was in fact to enforce a right\nwhich arose from a contract/agreement of parties.\n",
        "p_8": "The above referred to decision was adverted to and the principles\ntherein\t were also applied in the subsequent decision reported in\nRaptakos Brett & Co.  Ltd.  (supra) and on the facts of that case\nthat  the  cause of action for the suit was not the agreement  of\ntenancy\t which\tlapsed by efflux of time but really  one  arising\nunder  the  General Law and Transfer of Property Act it was  held\nthat  the bar of suit or other proceedings based upon the lack of\nregistration  of  the  firm does not apply to the case.\t  In  yet\nanother\t decision  of this Court reported in Haldiram  Bhujiawala\n(supra)\t rendered  by a Bench to which one of us (M.   Jagannadha\nRao,  J.) was a party, following the earlier decision reported in\n1998  (7) SCC 184 (supra) it was held that the bar under  Section\n69  (2)\t was  not  attracted  to that case  since  the\tsuit  for\npermanent  injunction  to restrain the defendants from using  the\nplaintiffs  trade mark/name was based upon the statutory  rights\nunder  the  Trademarks Act and on common law principles\t of  tort\napplicable  to passing off actions and not under the unregistered\npartnership agreement.\n",
        "p_9": " The persistent plea made on behalf of the appellant before us is\nthat the bar imposed under Section 69(3) is attracted to the case\non  hand and that inasmuch as the same prohibits the  enforcement\nof any right arising from a contract by an unregistered firm, the\nobjection  can\tbe  taken  at any stage\t i.e.,\teven  post  award\nproceedings  instituted\t to  enforce the award.\t  Inspiration  is\ndrawn  for this claim from the decision of a learned Single Judge\nof  the\t Madras High Court reported in J.  Belli Gowder vs  Joghi\nGowder\tand another [AIR 1951 Mad.683].\t That was a case  wherein\nan  award came to be passed by an Arbitrator on an oral reference\nor  submission\tmade.\tUnlike\tthe law in  force  prior  to  the\nArbitration  Act,  1940, the said Act in Section 2(a) defined  an\narbitration agreement to be one made in writing to submit present\nor  future differences to arbitration and, therefore, it was held\nthat after the coming into force of the Act an award passed on an\noral submission or reference can neither be filed and made a rule\nof  Court under the Act nor enforced apart from the provisions of\nthe  Act.  This decision which is based on the principle that the\nArbitrator  is a creature of the contract between the parties and\na  reference  to  the  Arbitrator could be only by  means  of  an\nagreement  in writing only indicates that such infirmity goes  to\nthe root of the very jurisdiction of the Arbitrator to enter into\nthe  reference and decide by passing an award and in our view the\nsame can be of no assistance to the case of the appellant.  It is\nnot  the  case\tof  the appellant before us  that  there  was  no\narbitration  clause  in\t writing  or  that  the\t dispute  is  not\narbitrable but yet the Arbitrator has undertaken it for decision.\nAs rightly pointed out for the respondent the very reference came\nto  be\tmade at the instance of the appellant and what is  really\nobjected  to  in  the  form of a preliminary issue  is\tonly  the\ninfirmity based upon Section 69 of the Partnership Act, 1932.\n",
        "p_10": "The  prohibition  contained  in\t Section  69  is  in  respect  of\ninstituting  a\tproceeding  to\tenforce a right\t arising  from\ta\ncontract  in  any  Court by an unregistered firm, and it  had  no\napplication  to the proceedings before an Arbitrator and that too\nwhen  the reference to the Arbitrator was at the instance of  the\nappellant  itself.   If the said bar engrafted in Section  69  is\nabsolute  in its terms and is destructive of any and every  right\narising\t under\tthe  contract itself and not confined  merely  to\nenforcement of a right arising from a contract by an unregistered\nfirm by instituting a suit or other proceedings in Court only, it\nwould\tbecome\ta  jurisdictional  issue   in  respect\t of   the\nArbitrators  power, authority and competency itself, undermining\nthereby\t the  legal efficacy of the very award, and  consequently\nfurnish\t a  ground  by itself to challenge the award when  it  is\nsought\tto be made a rule of Court.  The case before us cannot be\nsaid  to  be one such and the learned counsel for  the\tappellant\nthough was fully conscious of this fact, yet tried to assert that\nit  is open to the appellant to take up the objection based  upon\nSection 69 of the Partnership Act, at any stage - even during the\npost award proceedings to enforce the award passed.  The Award in\nthis  case  cannot  either  rightly or legitimately  said  to  be\nvitiated on account of the prohibition contained in Section 69 of\nthe  partnership  Act, 1932 since the same has no application  to\nproceedings before an Arbitrator.  At the stage of enforcement of\nthe  award by passing a decree in terms thereof what is\t enforced\nis the award itself which crystallise the rights of parties under\nthe  Indian  Contract Act and the general law to be paid for  the\nwork   executed\t and  not  any\t right\tarising\t only  from   the\nobjectionable contract.\t It is useful in this connection to refer\nto  the\t decision  of  this Court in Satish  Kumar  &  others  vs\nSurinder  Kumar\t & others [AIR 1970 SC 833], wherein it has  been\nstated\tin  unmistakable terms that an Award is not a mere  waste\npaper  but  does create rights and has some legal effect  besides\nbeing  final  and binding on the parties.  It has also been  held\nthat  the  award is, in fact, a final adjudication of a Court  of\nthe  parties  own  choice and until  impeached\tupon  sufficient\ngrounds\t in an appropriate proceedings, an award which is on  the\nface  of  it  regular,\tis  conclusive upon  the  merits  of  the\ncontroversy  submitted\tfor arbitration.  Consequently, the  post\naward proceedings cannot be considered by any means, to be a suit\nor  other  proceedings\tto  enforce any rights\tarising\t under\ta\ncontract.   All the more so when, as in this case, at all  stages\nthe  respondent\t was  only  on the defence  and\t has  not  itself\ninstituted  any\t proceedings to enforce any rights of the  nature\nprohibited  under  Section 69 of the Partnership Act, before  any\nCourt  as  such.  We see no infirmity or error whatsoever in  the\ndecision of the courts below to call for our interference in this\nappeal.\t The appeal fails and shall stand dismissed.\n",

Brand image\nrefers to the role of brand names and other aspects of a brand's trade dress\nas cues that retrieve or signal product attributes, benefits, affect or overall\nquality. In this sense, the brand itself is not a memory target but a cue that\nmight facilitate recall or inference of previously learned brand\nassociations. A paramount factor influencing a consumer's choice of\nbrand is his memory of previous exposures of the brand. Distinctive brand\nnames and packaging are highly conducive to mental associations and\nserve as pathways to facilitate a much more accurate recall by a\nconsumer. It enables finer retrieval of the experience. Studies reveal that\nextrinsic brand cues might actually enhance the memorability of prior\nexperiences with specific brands, thereby facilitating accurate quality\ndiscrimination and improving consumer welfare. Thus, the development\nof such brand value in the form of a mark containing names, patterns, etc.\nwhich would often be a direct reflection of an enterprise's goodwill and\nmarket reputation was accorded protection in the form of their registration\nas trademark. A similar mark causes a slow decline in the accuracy of a\nconsumer\u201fs memory-based judgments and therefore, the Trademarks Act\nseeks to put a check on such practises. It also assumes significance that\nthe learning process of a consumer is the result of a consumption\nexperience which is sequential as opposed to simultaneous. There may be\nvast spells between consumption which may naturally give impetus to\nconfusion. Confusion of very satisfactory consumption experiences with\nless satisfying experience may lead to a reduction in repeated purchase\n\nFAO (OS) No.389/2014                                               Page 5 of 26\n and dilution of brand equity.

He also operated under the trademark 'PUTTING ON\nTHE RITZ' for shower curtains. The respondent owned the trademark\n'RITZ' and had also been using it in connection with the sale of kitchen\ntextiles, towels, potholders, etc. The respondent opposed the appellant's\napplication for the registration of the trademarks 'PUTTING ON THE\nRITZ'. The Court applied the anti-dissection rule and held that the mark\nmust be viewed in its entirety. It observed that the rule ensures that the\nmark is evaluated in the same way as a prospective buyer i.e. the\ncommercial impression of the mark as a whole needs to be considered. It\nheld that the trademark 'PUTTING ON THE RITZ' when evaluated as a\nwhole, conveyed an image of 'comfort, sophistication and wealth\u201f which\nwas completely different from the commercial impression that\nrespondent's mark gave, which is that of cooking or manual labour.\n",

Though it bears no reiteration that while a mark is to be considered\nin entirety, yet it is permissible to accord more or less importance or\n'dominance' to a particular portion or element of a mark in cases of\ncomposite marks. Thus, a particular element of a composite mark which\nenjoys greater prominence vis-\u00e0-vis other constituent elements, may be\ntermed as a 'dominant mark'.\n",

It was observed:\n",
        "p_24": "21.    The view of the author makes it scintillatingly clear, beyond pale of\ndoubt, that the principle of 'anti dissection' does not impose an absolute\nembargo upon the consideration of the constituent elements of a\ncomposite mark. The said elements may be viewed as a preliminary step\non the way to an ultimate determination of probable customer reaction to\nthe conflicting composites as a whole. Thus, the principle of 'anti-\ndissection' and identification of 'dominant mark' are not antithetical to\none another and if viewed in a holistic perspective, the said principles\nrather compliment each other.\n",
        "p_25": "22.    We may refer to the decision of the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Federal Circuit reported as 380 F.3d 1340 Re Chatam Int\u201fl, Inc,\nwherein the Court enunciated the interplay between the principle of 'anti\ndissection' and identification of 'dominant mark'. The Court, while\nascertaining whether the mark 'JOSE GASPAR GOLD' was similar to the\nregistered mark 'GASPAR'S ALE', held that 'GASPAR' was clearly the\ndominant element in the two marks and resembled the relevant mark\nenough to cause a likelihood of confusion, to cause a mistake or to\n\nFAO (OS) No.389/2014                                             Page 12 of 26\n deceive. Relevant would it be to note that the defendant in the said case\nurged that the approach of splitting of the marks was in violation of the\nanti-dissection rule. The said contention was repelled by the Court and it\nwas pertinently observed that there was no violation of anti-dissection rule\nbecause the marks were any way examined in entirety, and each\nindividual term in the marks were given more or less weightage\ndepending on the overall impression it appeared to create. The Court was\nof the view that both marks convey the commercial impression that a\nname, GASPAR, is the source of related alcoholic beverages, tequila or\nale. In other words, the commercial significance of ALE in the registered\nmark 'GASPAR'S ALE' and JOSE and GOLD in appellant's mark\n'JOSE'S GASPAR GOLD' assumed less significance in the opinion of\nthe Court.\n",
        "p_26": "23.    It is also settled that while a trademark is supposed to be looked at\nin entirety, yet the consideration of a trademark as a whole does not\ncondone infringement where less than the entire trademark is\nappropriated. It is therefore not improper to identify elements or features\nof the marks that are more or less important for purpose of analysis in\ncases of composite marks.\n",

The facts of the said case reveal that the plaintiff\nmanufactured coated paper under the registered trademark 'Super-Ko-\nRec-Type'. The defendant manufactured and advertised a similar product\nunder the mark 'Super Type' and 'Super Type-7'.The defendant\ncontended that the only similarity between the said marks was use of the\nwords 'Super' and 'Type', terms which were neither significant parts of\nthe plaintiff's registered trademark nor protectable as a matter of law.

Therefore, the submission of the appellant-defendant predicated\nupon the principle of 'anti-dissection' that action for infringement would\nnot lie since use of the word 'D'DAAZS' does not result in complete\nappropriation of the respondent-plaintiff's mark 'HAAGEN DAZS',\nwhich is to be viewed as an indivisible whole, is liable to be rejected.\n",

However, words that are\narbitrary and distinct possess greater strength and are thus accorded\ngreater protection.[174 F. Supp. 2d 718, 725 (M.D. Tenn. 2001) Autozone,\nInc. v.

The plaintiff was\nengaged in selling rice under the registered trademarks 'Golden Qilla' and\n'Lal Qilla'. The defendant, who was also selling the same product, was\noperating under the trademark 'Hara Qilla', against which the plaintiff\nsought injunction. The Court held that the essential feature of the mark is\nthe word 'QILLA', whether it is spelt as QILLA or KILLA, or even\nwritten in a different style or colour combination. It was further observed\nthat for a customer who would seek to purchase the QILLA brand rice,\nboth the names would sound phonetically similar. The Court held that\nsince the trademark QILLA was being utilised for the same commodity\ni.e. rice, there existed every possibility of there being confusion created in\nthe mind of the purchaser of rice that the product being sold by the\ndefendant was in fact a product that had emanated from or had been\nmanufactured by the plaintiff.\n",

Prima facie, it appears that both\nthe elements constituting the mark of the respondent-plaintiff ['HAAGEN'\nand 'DAZS'] are equally dominant and are liable to be accorded sufficient\nprotection under the legal framework.

The appellant challenged the said\nrejection on the ground that word 'ENERGON' was not a dominant part\nof the registered trademark and therefore negated any likelihood of\nconfusion.

It\nhas been submitted that though the products are similar i.e. frozen desserts,\nhowever they cater to entirely distinct class/strata of consumers.         It is\ncontended that the consumers of the product marketed by the respondent -\nplaintiff are sophisticated owing their capacity to afford such expensive ice-\ncreams and this would obviate any likelihood of confusion with the\nappellant - defendant's mark.\n",

It would be pertinent to note\nthat the product in question i.e. frozen desserts/ice-creams is of such nature\nthat it is consumed by people of all age group and strata, transcending all\nbarriers. Experience suggests that ice-cream is cherished by people\nbelonging to all age-group, especially children.

It cannot be realistically expected that\nchildren; who constitute a substantial chunk of consumers, would be in a\nposition to distinguish between the two products by taking into account\nniceties such as price difference. Doubtless, in assessing cases of trademark\ninfringement and ascertaining the likelihood of confusion, the effect of\ndifference in price between the two products may perhaps be more profound\nwhere products such as- premium alcohol, luxury cars, exclusive perfumes\netc. are involved since the prospective consumers in such cases are generally\nexpected to be endowed with a greater sense of maturity and a keen eye\nagainst deception.\n",

The plaintiff was engaged in real\nestate business under the trademark 'IREO SKYON' whereas the defendant\nwho was also dealing in the same line of business was operating under the\ntrademark 'Genesis SKYON'. A suit was filed by the plaintiff against the\ndefendant for infringement of trademark. It was contended on behalf of the\ndefendant that the cost of the property being sold by the plaintiff is much\nhigher than the cost of property being dealt by him and thus there exists no\nlikelihood of confusion. The Court rejected the said contention and held that\nthe defendant had slavishly copied the mark of the plaintiff and cannot be\npermitted to continue to use a deceptively similar trademark. In order to\nfortify its conclusion the Court cited with approval the decision reported as\n2011 (45) PTC 329 (Del) Aman Resorts Limited v. Mr. Deepak Narula &\nAnr.

The defendants submitted that the washing machines\nproduced by them costs less than l/3rd the price of the washing machine\nmarketed by the plaintiff; and the full description affixed on the washing\nmachine leaves no room for any confusion in the mind of the buyer. It was\nheld that where a rival, operating in the same trade name as the plaintiff's,\nprices his goods or services at significantly cheaper rates than the plaintiff,\nthere is likelihood of irreparable injury to the plaintiffs' reputation and\ngoodwill.\n",

The registered trademarks are \u201e8 PM\nBERMUDA XXX RUM\u201f, \u201e8 PM ROYALE\u201f, \u201e8 PM EXCELLENCE\nBRANDY\u201f and \u201e8 PM BERMUDA WHITE ORIGINAL\u201f.                         Apart\ntherefrom, Radico claims to be the registered proprietor of the\nmark \u201e8 PM\u201f pertaining to whisky under Class-32 of the T.M.Act\n1999.

Further grievance\nis that Radico\u201fs slogan \u201eAATH KE THAATH\u201f pertaining to the\nwhisky sold by it under the trademark \u201e8 PM\u201f has been piggy\nridden on by Carlsberg by using the slogan \u201e8 KA DUM\u201f. The\ngrievance is to the stealing of the idea \u201eAATH KE THAATH\u201f i.e.\n\u201ethe luxury of eight\u201f by Carlsberg using the slogan \u201e8 KA DUM\u201f\ni.e. \u201ethe potency of eight\u201f, to the concept which emerges in the\nmind of the buyer who, with the imperfect recollection of a\nnormal person remembering that Radico\u201fs product has a\nfeature of \u201ethe luxury of eight\u201f, with reference to Radico\u201fs\ntrademark \u201e8 PM\u201f would think, and associate, Carlsberg beer\nwhen he sees the beer bottle with the label prominently\ndisplaying the numeral \u201e8\u201f in the same font, size and colour\nand styling as that of Radico and the slogan \u201e8 KA DUM\u201f and\nthink that he is seeing a product having same source as that of\nthe whisky i.e. being misled that the beer is a product of\nRadico.\n",

Defence   of   Carlsberg   is   that    it   has      sought\nregistration of the trademark \u201ePALONE 8\u201f for beer in Class-33,\nand that beer and whisky are different products and the\nconsumer of alcohol is an informed consumer and would not\nbe misled, as claimed by Radico, not only for the reason the\n\n\n\n\nFAO(OS)-549&567/2011                                Page 3 of 22\n two products are different but even for the reason the price\ndifference of the two products is substantial, in that, the\nwhisky sold by Radico is priced at `300/- per bottle and the\nbeer sold by Carlsberg is priced at `65/- per bottle. Secondly\nthat the numeral \u201e8\u201f is publici juris and common to the trade in\nalcohol, inasmuch as it is used to denote the quality or the\ncharacter of an alcoholic drink; and being common to the\ntrade, Radico cannot appropriate the numeral \u201e8\u201f to its\nexclusive use.         Thirdly that the cardinal numbers by their\ninherent feature of being a cardinal number are bound to lack\ndistinctiveness in character. Fourthly, the trademark \u201e8 PM\u201f is\nper se non-descriptive and registration being granted under\nPart-B of the erstwhile Trade and Merchandise Marks Act 1958\nwas proof of the weakness, due to non-descriptiveness, of the\nmark. Lastly, Radico does not have any separate registration\nfor the numeral \u201e8\u201f as its trademark and thus cannot claim any\nexclusive right over the numeral \u201e8\u201f.       On said account, it is\njustified in using the numeral \u201e8\u201f as a part of its trademark\n\u201ePALONE 8\u201f, in          respect whereof its application         seeking\nregistration was pending. It is pleaded by Carlsberg that since\nthe beer being marketed by it was a \u201eStrong Beer\u201f i.e. high in\nalcohol content, it was entitled to use the numeral \u201e8\u201f to inform\nthe consumer, by way of description of its product, i.e. that the\nbeer had a strong alcoholic content. The slogan \u201e8 KA DUM\u201f\nwas justified by pleading that it was conveying the \u201edum\u201f i.e.\nthe potency of its product.\n",

        "p_40": "             It is, of course, conceivable that there will be\ninstances where the use of a numeral in a trademark will be\npurely descriptive in nature, even if the trademark itself does\nnot consist of a numeral simpliciter and is accompanied by\nsigns, colours or other devices. In evaluating such marks, the\ntest to be applied would be one of: Whether the relevant class\nof persons, without further thought, perceive the numeral to\nbe descriptive of the characteristics of the goods in question?\n",

The result of such a\ntest is also negative in so much as the product though called\n\u201ePALONE 8\u201f by Carlsberg, but given that the numeral \u201e8\u201f is the\n\n\n\n\nFAO(OS)-549&567/2011                           Page 18 of 22\n single most prominent feature of the label, the product for all\npractical purposes is being sold under the mark \u201e8\u201f and\nconsumers are likely to identify and ask for the product as \u201e8\u201f\nand not \u201ePALONE 8\u201f i.e. the consumer is most likely to tell the\nbartender or the salesman at a liquor vend: \u201eGive me beer 8\u201f\nand not \u201eGive me beer Palone 8\u201f.\n",

        "p_2": " 1. This defendants appeal is against the order of the learned City Civil Judge, Ahmedabad dated 30th December 1997 passed on a Notice of Motion restraining the defendants appellants by way of temporary injunction from using the word \"DON\" henceforth in respect of marketing their hosiery products as it infringes plaintiffs' Trade Mark 'DAWN Hosiery' till the hearing and final disposal of the suit. \n",
        "p_3": "2. The facts leading to this appeal are that the plaintiff is a public limited company and is carrying on business of manufacturing, marketing and selling hosiery. The word \"DAWN\" is a main and essential feature of the plaintiff's trade mark which is registered under Trade Mark Act. The defendant No. 1 is also a company engaged in the business of manufacturing and marketing hosiery products. The registered trade mark for marketing its hosiery products is \"RUPA\". The plaintiff's trade mark has been registered and in use by it for over 40 years. The dispute is about use of words 'DON' conjunctively or disjunctively by defendant No. 1 in respect of some of its hosiery products as its identify mark whether in conjunction with its registered trade mark \"RUPA\" to be read as \"RUPA DON\" or the word mark \"DON\" separately used as feature of identifying the commodity for marketing as one of specific brand of its hosiery products. The plaintiffs having come to know use of word 'DON' by the defendant No. 1 company in the field to marketing its hosiery products, gave a registered notice dated 29-4-1995 stating that use of word mark 'DON' in respect of their hosiery products by the defendant No. 1 amounts to infringing their trade mark and asked them to stop the use of the word 'DON'. The defendants replied by letter dated 25th May, 1995 denying the plaintiffs claim. In reply, it was also mentioned that the defendant No. 1 has filed the application for rectification of plaintiff's trade mark in respect of which infringement has been alleged by the plaintiff. There after, the plaintiff has filed the present suit on 4th March 1997 for restraining the defendant by way of perpetual injunction from using in relation to any of hosiery items the impugned word 'DON' or other marks in any manner so as to infringe the plaintiff's registered trade mark. Alternatively same relief on the basis of passing off the defendant No. 1 goods as the plaintiff's goods' was also claimed. Other reliefs pertaining to the rendering of accounts of profit earned by defendants by infringing the trade mark and a decree for damages in the like amount was asked for. \n",
        "p_4": "3. A notice of motion for grant of temporary injunction restraining the defendants from using word 'DON' in connection with its hosiery products during the pendency of the suit was also moved. \n",
        "p_5": "4. The defendant's plea was that its products are marked under the brand 'RUPA'. However, in order to identify and distinguish its products of different character, different names like 'DON' 'Kidline' 'Ribline' etc. are used along with the mark 'RUPA'. Since 1994 the defendant is manufacturing and marketing openly its products by bonafidely using mark 'RUPA DON'. It has also applied for registration under the Trade and Merchandise Act, 1958 for brand name used as 'RUPA DON' and the application is pending before the Registrar of Trade Marks at Bombay. It is further urged that mark 'RUPA DON' is composite mark comprising of 'RUPA' representing its own registered trade mark and 'DON' an imaginary charisming character having no significant relevance to goods in question and is not deceptively similar to the plaintiff's mark nor is it likely to cause any confusion so as to result in infringement of its mark. It was also urged that if the two marks bear no ocular similarity, and phonetic similarity of words like 'DON' or 'down' it cannot cause any significant confusion. \n",
        "p_6": "5. The case of the plaintiff on the issue of infringement to trade mark is that the word 'DON' is phonetically similar to the plaintiffs trade mark 'DOWN' and that the offending word 'DON' when used in other vernacular language is written in the same way as plaintiffs mark 'DAWN', which is likely to cause confusion of similarity and identity of two products in question amongst the buyers and they are likely to be deceived by the use of word mark 'DON' as identifying particular goods of the defendants in the market with the plaintiffs goods. The defence of the defendant on the merit is that one of the plaintiffs mark comprise of word 'DAWN' together with rising sun with word hosiery. It is in the form of a label and the mark as registered under the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, in its entirety constitutes the registered mark and only a part of it cannot be construed as a mark owned by the plaintiff so as to make out a case for infringement of its trade mark. It was also urged that considering the total sales of the RUPA Brand, in the year 1995-96, which amounted to about Rs. 58.7 crores out of which the sales or turnover of its DON BRAND of goods amounted to about Rs. 2.70 crores only, goes to show that when defendants on their own has such large turnover and looking to small ratio which the total sales of its products with offending mark bears to it, defendants cannot have intention to pass of their goods as the goods of the plaintiff and action for passing off the goods is not maintainable. It was also urged that no confusion in the mind of people would arise at large as word 'DON' is used with 'RUPA' which is the registered trade mark of the defendants and is quite dissimilar to the mark used by the plaintiff. In other words, it was urged that word 'RUPA DON', mark used by the defendant is quite dissimilar to mark 'DAWN' used by the plaintiff. \n",
        "p_7": "6. The trial Court found that the word 'DON' is given prominence repeatedly in the cartons and packages, labels and in the advertisements which prima facie amounts to infringement of plaintiffs' mark 'DAWN' visually. It also found that the word 'DON' used by defendants for merchandising their goods is phonetically very similar to the mark 'DAWN' owned by the plaintiffs for merchandising its articles. The plea of delay and latches on part of the defendants did not find favour with the learned trial Judge. Thus, finding that defendant has prima facie infringed the registered trade mark of the plaintiff by using the word 'DON' along with 'RUPA' and that balance of convenience favours plaintiff and that no irreparable injury would be caused to the defendants if the interim relief is confirmed to nonuser of the word DON by the defendants, the interim injunction referred to above was granted in favour of the plaintiff. To challenge the aforesaid order, the defendants has preferred this appeal. \n",
        "p_8": "7. Heard learned counsel for the parties. \n",
        "p_9": "8. It was first urged by learned counsel for the defendant-appellants that delay in filing the suit and seeking relief of injunction ought to be held against plaintiff disentitling them from relief of temporary injunction as because of that balance of convenience cannot favour the plaintiff. It was urged that during the year ending 1996-97, the appellants had total sale of about Rs. 58.00 crores of which Rs. 2.74 crores accounted from sale of 'DON' brand of hosiery goods. Injunction, if granted, will affect daily sale of about Rs. 1.50 lakhs per day. By not filing the suit promptly, the plaintiffs have allowed the defendants to believe that there is no infringement of plaintiffs trade mark and increase their trading activity. It was urged that plaintiffs sent notice about alleged infringement as bar back as in April 1995, which was replied to on 25-5-1995. Yet suit has been filed only on 4-3-1997 after about 21 months. This delay in action according to learned counsel is fatal to plaintiffs application for temporary injunction. Reliance was placed on Unjha Formulations Ltd. v. Unjha Pharmacy ((1996) 2 G.L.H. 511), Paras Traders v. Rajasthan Copy Manufacturing Associates (1996 PTC 229), Kirloskar Proprietary Ltd. v. Kirloskar Dimensions (P.) Ltd.

Digambar ((1995) 4 SCC 683), and an unreported decision of this court in Indico Laboratories P. Ltd. v. Burroughs Williams (India) Ltd. (Appeal from Order No. 443 of 1992 decided on 7-10-1992). \n",
        "p_10": "9. The question cannot be considered in a pedantic manner, by evolving a strait jacket formulate to be applied in all cases. Firstly delay or latches, as a sole ground for referring temporary injunction, has to be discerned from the principle applicable while exercising discretion under Article 226 of the Constitution. In the latter case relief itself cannot be refused altogether on the ground of delay or latches impinging on the conduct of the petitioner, which is a vital consideration. It cannot be so in the case of a suit to enforce a statutory remedy within the precincts of statute itself. The ultimate relief in the case of an infringement action is not a discretionary one, but once establishing such infringement it is a matter of course. In Saville Perfumery Ltd. v. June Perfect Ltd.

The defence of laches or inordinate delay is a defence in equity. In equity both the parties must come to court with clean hands.

The concept of infringing trade mark is in user of a mark which is like to deceive or cause confusion. The subject of likely deception or confusion is un wary buying public. The user of trade mark results in associating the trade mark with particular goods. The buyer acts on the reputation which a particular trade mark enjoys in public eye in relation to particular goods. Thus an injunction is remedy provided in how not only to protect the registered owner of a mark against invasion of his business by the user of offending mark but to guard the general buying public from likely deception or confusion in the goods which he intends to buy and goods which are likely to be offered to him instead. \n",

In this regard while dealing with the protection of third parties he observed that some courts also consider the necessity of protecting third parties. In Trade Mark cases third parties means the bying public.

        "p_26": "  \"It would appear to me that where there is an honest concurrent user by the defendant then inordinate delay or laches may defeat the claim of damages or rendition of accounts but the relief of injunction should not be refused. This is so because it is the interest of the general public which is the third party in such cases which has to be kept in mind. In the case of inordinate delay of laches, as distinguished from an acquiescence, the main prejudice which may be caused to the defendant is that by reason of the plaintiff not acting at an earlier point of time the defendant has been able to establish his business by using the infringing mark. Inordinate delay or laches may be there because the plaintiff may not be aware of the infringement by the defendant or the plaintiff may consider such infringement by the defendant as not being serious enough to hurt the plaintiff's business. Nevertheless, if the Court comes to conclusion that prejudice is likely to be caused to the general public who may be misled into buying the goods manufactured by the defendant thinking them to be the goods of the plaintiff then an injunction must be issued.\" \n",
        "p_27": "18. Thus, the Court held that where there is infringement of mark which is likely to deceive or cause confusion injunction must issue to safeguard public interest. \n",

It relates to dealing in the goods associating with such mark which due to likelihood of causing deception or confusion, apart from exact imitation, continuously in market. Such offending activity is continuous and uninterrupted giving a recurring cause of action to the holder of mark infringed. The Supreme Court in M/s. Bengal Water Proof Ltd. v. Bombay Water Proof Manufacturing Co. (AIR 1997 SC 1398 = 1996 (Suppl.) Arb. LR 335), considering the maintainability of a second suit for infringement when first suit was dismissed with reference to Order II, Rule 2 of Civil Procedure Code, and noticing, as in the present case, that the defendants were trading in the offending goods even upto hearing of the appeal held (at page 1404 of AIR) : \n",
        "p_29": "  \"It is obvious that such infringement of a registered trade mark carried on from time to time would give a recurring cause of action to the holder of the trade mark to make a grievance about the same and similarly such impugned passing off actions also would give a recurring cause of action to the plaintiff to make a grievance about the same and seek appropriate relief from the Court. It is now well settled that an action for passing off is a common law remedy being an action in substance of receit under Law of Torts. Wherever and whenever fresh deceitful act is committed, the person deceived would naturally have a fresh cause of action in his favour ........ Similarly whenever and wherever a person commits breach of a registered trade mark giving a recurring and fresh cause of action at each time of such infringement to the party aggrieved.\" \n",
        "p_30": "20. If that be so, it is difficult to accept that for such recurring cause of fresh action remedy against future injury be denied because damages relating to distinct part may be inappropriate to be awarded. The principle strengthen the view expressed in Hindustan Pencil's (supra) that in such case inordinate delay may defeat the claim to remote or past damages and accounts but not the claim to relief to an injunction, both on the ground of protecting the proprietary right from future damage and the interest of general public consisting of unwarry buyers in the field of continuous dealing. \n",
        "p_31": "21. Law also appears to be otherwise fairly settled that delay by itself cannot be ground for refusing to exercise discretion of the trial Court in the matter of granting temporary injunction. It is just one of consideration in the total gamut of consideration and unless there is justification for accusing the plaintiff of culpable delay amounting to acquiescence or abandonment of right, it cannot disentitle him to relief of injunction. If in totality of circumstances if the trial Court has exercised its discretion by reaching conclusions which are reasonably possible, the appellate Court will not interfere with such exercise of discretion. In N. R. Dongre v. Whirlpool Corporation ((1996) 5 SCC 714 = 1996(1) Arb. LR 488), the Whirlpool Corporation has sued the defendants for alleged violation of their mark by defendants in selling of washing machines by the defendant under the mark Whirlpool. Trial Court granted temporary injunction in favour of the plaintiffs which had been affirmed by High Court. The plaintiffs had registered 'Whirlpool' as their trade mark in 1956-57 which lapsed in 1977. Fresh application was made only in 1988 by the plaintiff which was pending. Meanwhile defendants had applied for registration of 'Whirlpool' as their trade mark on 6-8-1986 which was advertised on 16-10-1988. To this applicant had filed opposition on 16-1-1989. On 12-8-1992 the registrar dismissed the opposition and on 30-11-1992 certificate of registration was issued in favour of the defendant. Plaintiff had preferred appeal on 7-11-1992 which was still pending. In the aforesaid circumstances plea of delay was raised in the suit for infringement filed on 4-8-1994. Thus, it was a case where in fact infringing mark as on the date of suit stood registered in the name of defendant. Suit has been filed about 5 years after plaintiffs were aware about defendants design to use their mark and two years after opposition to registration has filed before the registrar, clearing the deck for the defendant to use the mark unless injunction was obtained. The trial Court finding that in the facts of the case user of. 'Whirlpool' mark by the defendant amounted to infringement had granted the temporary injunction restraining the defendants from using the mark. The learned single judge did not consider the delay as obstruction to grant of injunction when it held that there is no justification to accuse the plaintiff of culpable delay, acquiescence and laches or abandonment so as to disentitle them form relief of injunction. The Supreme Court noticed that recently adopting the mark 'WHIRLPOOL' when business of washing machine was carried out earlier in other name at that stage was supportive of plea of unfair trading activity in an attempt to obtain economic benefit of the reputation established by the plaintiff. The plaintiff's conduct in opposing the application of registration by the plaintiff and filing rectification application was held against the plea of acquiescence or abandonment and supporting the finding that there was no culpable delay. By reaffirming that action for 'passing off' is regarded as action in deceit reiterated the principle governing interference in appeal (at page 3517 of AIR SCW) : \n",
        "p_32": "  \"An appeal against exercise of discretion is said to be an appeal on principle. Appellate Court will not reassess the material and seek to reach a conclusion different from the one reached by Court below if the one reached by that Court was reasonably possible on the material ......... If the discretion has been exercised by the trial Court reasonably and in a judicial manner the fact that appellate Court would have taken a different view may not justify interference with the trial Court's exercise of discretion.\" \n",
        "p_33": "22. The Court declined to interfere on principle on the ground of delay only, when keeping other facts and circumstances in view the Court was of opinion that conclusion reached by trial Court was reasonably possible on the material.

        "p_34": "23. Unjha Formulation Ltd. v. Unjha Pharmacy (supra) was a case in which the respondent firm was engaged in the business of medicinal preparations in the name of Unjha Pharmacy since 1884. The appellant was registered as a company in the name of Unjha Formulation Limited with the Registrar of Companies on or about 2-2-1994, but it was doing the business of manufacturing and marketing Allopathic, Veterinary and Ayurvedic Medicine, since over a decade in the same name. The plaintiff had give a notice in 1988 to the defendant to stop using word 'Unjha', in their name and style of trading which was replied to in 1988 itself. No action whatever was taken since then until filing of the suit for passing off in February 1996 claim relief that defendant be required to change his name so as not to include word 'Unjha' in it to which use the plaintiff has acquired goodwill and defendant is not entitled to use the said word. Relief for accounts and claim to profits made under the name Unjha was also made. Suit has been filed after the defendant company has gone for public issue to gather capital from the market. In notice of motion for interim injunction the only relief that was claimed was to restrain the defendants from raising capital by public issue by using the word 'Unjha' in its corporate name. The Court found with this background the action to be not bona fide which will appear from following observations : \n",
        "p_35": "  \"It is to be noted that even though the respondents in the suits have pleaded that the appellant company is not entitled to use the word \"Unjha\" being the trade name of the respondent-plaintiff, as far as the prayer made in the Notice of Motion is concerned, they have prayed for an injunction against the Public Issue only. In others words, the respondents are permitted the appellant to continue its trading activities by using the word \"Unjha\" till the disposal of the suit. However, for reasons best known, it has objection against the appellant's Public Issue. This really appears strange and fishy.\" \n",
        "p_36": "  \"The fact that in the application for Notice of Motion the only relief prayed for by the respondents is to restrain the appellants' Company from proceeding further with the Public Issue. This would further go to show that the respondents are keen to see that the Public Issue is stalled for any reason.\" \n",
        "p_37": "  \"Mr. Vakil rightly contended that if the period of ten weeks under Section 73 of the Companies Act is allowed to bypass and thereafter if the respondents withdraw the suits, in that case, the entire exercise will be rendered void and the purpose of filing the suits by the respondents would be achieved without even trial thereof. I see quite justification in the apprehension of Mr. Vakil. As stated above, after the receipt of subscription it is neither possible nor feasible to change the name of the appellants' Company in the midstream.\"  \n",
        "p_38": "24. The Court also found the raising funds by Public Issue did not amount to passing off goods and that defendants' company had already received huge amount of subscription from investors as the suit has been filed after Public Issue to decide issue of balance of convenience and irreparable injury in favour of the defendant. \n",
        "p_39": "25. In the aforesaid circumstances, the Court refused to grant relief of transferring injunction by also taking into consideration laches on the part of plaintiff. \n",
        "p_40": "26. The facts of the case speak for themselves to malke it distinguishable. As discussed above, that in the case of the passing off action or infringement action mere delay by itself cannot be fatal to claim to relief of temporary injunction, if prima facie case of infringement is made out, but delay coupled with conduct of plaintiff, which may lead to inference of acquiescence, or which is not bona fide or which is contumacious, may be fatal to plaintiff's claim. That will again depend on facts and circumstances of each case. As noticed from the report in the passing off action the Court had reached conclusion that plaintiff has failed to make a prima facie case of 'passing off the goods' in respect of capital issue. It has also found the conduct of plaintiff in confining relief for restraining the defendant from using the offending word 'Unjha' only in connection with 'capital Issue' but not asking any relief for excluding the same from other trading activity to be fishy. The decision had not rested on the ground of delay alone or independently. Thus, the case does not afford a parallel to case in hand. \n",

In Paras Trader's (supra) the defendant has been manufacturing exercise books with Chetan brand depicting Rana Pratap riding horse in Rajasthan since 1975 under approval from the Government. He has filed a suit under Section 120 of the Trade Marks Act and Section 60 of Copy right Act against plaintiff. To counter blast that suit the plaintiff had filed the suit in 1992. The Court found that notwithstanding a registered trade mark in favour of plaintiff to use word 'Chetan' since 1971, there was no satisfactory evidence of actual user by the plaintiff and six bills spread over a period of five years between 1987 to 1992 had been produced to prove the actual user. The plaintiffs had in fact at least come to know of user of their trade mark by the defendant in 1987, yet the suit was filed in 1992. In these circumstances, the plaintiff was held to be disentitled to temporary injunction because of delay and laches. \n",

The Court while agreeing that delay in bringing action may not come in the way of granting injunction, the Court was not inclined to issue injunction as it did not see any immediate threat of injury to plaintiffs, as the two rivals field of activity was different. The ratio of Hindustan Pencils case (supra) laid down by Delhi High Court that : \n",
        "p_43": "  \"No doubt the delay in bringing the action itself may not come in the way of grating an order of injunction in favour of the plaintiffs as per the decision reported in AIR 1990 Delhi 19 cited by the counsel for the plaintiffs case. In the instant case, the plaintiffs and defendants are not engaged in the common field of activity and there is no material to show that the defendants are passing off their goods or business representing are passing off their goods or business representing as that as the goods or business of the plaintiffs and therefore, that is no immediate threat of causing any damage to the plaintiffs. \n",
        "p_44": "29. In the Fair Deal Corporation case 1985 PTC 80, the Court found as a fact a palpably wrong assertion about the date of knowledge about alleged offending activity that too in the face of fact that plaintiff himself if has not proved that defendant should not use the mark Vijay Electrolyte but only attack was on the user of Sachet similar to that of plaintiff. The Court also considered that goods in question being Medicinal preparation and ordinarily sold on doctor's prescription, that was little likelihood of confusion on the part of consumer. \n",

In the case of Indico Laboratories the unreported judgment of this Court (Appeal from order No. 443 of 1992) though detailed comparative facts are not discernible, it appears that what weighed with the Court was progressively increased sale of defendants since last 10 years, tilted the balance of convenience in favour of defendants for refusing temporary injunction to plaintiff. \n",
        "p_46": "31. The decision in Digambar's case (supra) does not directly concern the grant of temporary injunction in infringement or passing off suits but relates to general principles governing exercise of extra ordinary jurisdiction of superior Courts wherein grant of ultimate relief by very nature of jurisdiction discretionary and petitioner's own conduct has a vital bearing on exercise of discretion. It was in that context that the court has observed that conduct of delay and laches on the part of petitioner disentitled him to exercise of discretion in his favour. \n",

        "p_48": "33. In my opinion, on each principle individually or taking compendious view of principles discussed above plea to deny relief of temporary injunction solely on the ground of delay and latches in bringing the suit cannot be sustained. \n",
        "p_49": "34. On the merit of the finding as to prima facie case about the infringement of mark owned by the plaintiff, two-fold contentions have been raised before me. Firstly, it was urged that the trade mark under document mark 3/4 consists of a label. Therefore, while considering the question of infringement of mark under the document exh. 3/4, it is only visual or ocular similarity is relevant and phonetic 'similarity' of the word 'DAWN' with 'DON' is not relevant and in respect of other registered mark under document mark 3/5, registered mark is word 'DAWN HOSIERY' per se meaning thereby, it is the use of the words 'DAWN HOSIERY' in totality makes use of the trade mark owned by the plaintiff. By dissecting it for confining the alleged infringement to the word 'DAWN' only is not permissible. There is no similarity visually or phonetic between the 'RUPA DON', the words used by the defendants, while marketing their commodity and the 'DAWN HOSIERY' marketed by the plaintiffs. In this connection, it was also urged that symbol of rising sun in the background of word 'DOWN', is the essential feature of the plaintiff's trade mark which makes ocular similarity more relevant and as the defendants have not adopted any such device to have visual similarity with picture of rising sun, there is no similarity much less deceptive similarity by the use of word 'DON' simpliciter identifying some of the defendants goods with the registered mark of the plaintiffs. \n",
        "p_50": "35. When a trade mark can be said to be infringed by another trader, the law appears to be settled that even without using the whole of it, on or in connection with his goods, if one or more of its essential features are adopted by the other traders. It may amount to infringement of mark. \n",
        "p_51": "36. The action for infringement of a trade mark is authorised by statute under Section 29 of (hereinafter called as the Act), which provides as to when a trade mark can be said to be infringed. It says a registered trade mark is infringed by a person, who not being the registered proprietor of the trade mark, or a registered user thereof using by way of permitted use, uses in the course of trade a mark which is identical with or deceptively similar to the trade mark in relation to any goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered and in such manner as to render the use of the mark likely to be taken as bona fide use as a trade mark. In other words, using of a mark by a person which is 'deceptively similar' to a registered trade mark owned by another person as distinct from user of an identical mark also amounts to infringement of a trade mark. \n",
        "p_52": "37. What is meant by 'deceptively similar' is defined is Section 2(d) of the Act which postulates that a mark shall be deemed to be deceptively similar to another mark if it so nearly resembles that other mark as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion. This definition makes two distinct areas to be probed to find out whether the impugned mark can be held to be deceptively similar to one in respect of which infringement is alleged or where it is likely to deceive another, though it may not actually confuse, but is likely to cause confusion. The test of considering whether a particular mark is likely to deceive may vary from the test whether the disputed mark is likely to cause confusion. The test of considering whether a particular mark is likely to deceive may vary from the test whether the disputed mark is likely to cause the use of the mark likely to be taken as being used as a trade mark. This provision also goes to show that a user of mark by a person which may be taken by those persons who are to acquired the goods in question, which is not a registered trade mark nor intended to be used as a trade mark but still if in the minds of people, ordinary user of the goods, buying the same are likely to take the same to be a trade mark because of the manner in which the mark has been used by a person trading in those goods, if use in that manner is likely to deceive or cause confusion about the identify of required goods or articles, still it would amount to infringement of trade mark. In other words, in considering the question whether a mark used by a person infringes the registered trade mark held by another, the test is not confined to exact reproduction of the infringed mark or to actual deceptions or confusion to exist among its users, but it is enough if the offending mark is deceptively similar to a degree with the infringed mark to a degree which is likely to deceive or cause confusion in the minds of buyer. It is even not necessary that offender may have intended to use, it as a mark, if the manner of use of a mark impresses in the mind of buyer that the same is being used as mark. It relates to association of mind of an average buyer with the mark for identification of goods he wants to buy connecting the same with the reputation it has acquired with the goods. It in that process of association of mind, there is likelihood of deception or confusion amongst the two marks, infringement is said to have taken place by the offending mark. \n",
        "p_53": "38. In substance it can be stated that in determining the question of likely to deceive or likely to cause confusion, it is necessary to assess the psychological reaction that mention association which the mark will generate in the mind of average buyer when he buys the goods under normal circumstances and conditions in the trade. The area of conflict between the user of two marks in the case about existing trade mark by user of another marketing is to be resolved by considering the fair and normal use of both the marks. It is all the more so where confusion or deception has to be assessed when the marks are used in relation to the same goods or same description of the goods. Expression likely to deceive or likely to cause confusion indicate that what is required to be considered and established while considering whether a particular mark infringes another mark is only a probability of deception or confusion and not actual deception or confusion in the minds of the buyers. Nor does, the definition of deceptively similar or likely to cause confusion restricted in its scope to the particular type of confusion. If a person may buy the goods seeing one mark thinking that it is the brand which is in his mind which in fact is not the case, it may amount to confusion or deception. So also where a person looking at a mark may buy the goods thinking that it is coming from the same source as some other goods bearing a similar mark which he is familiar with. The word 'likely' excludes the necessity of proving the injury to one or illicit benefit to others, before establishing the case of deceptive similarity. The test is not whether one man will be injured and the other man will gain illicit benefit, but whether there will be a confusion in the mind of public which will lead to confusion in the goods. \n",
        "p_54": "39. Ocular comparison is not necessarily the test to find out infringement and sound similarity may be decisive where goods of particular class are associated by name in the market is the principle recognised for long. In Saxio v. Bovezende ((1866) LR 1 Ch. 192), it was enunciated that : \"Actual physical resemblance of the two marks is not the sole question for consideration. If the goods of a manufacturer have, from the mark or device he has used; become known in the market by particular name, the adoption by a rival trader of the mark which will cause his goods to bear the same name in the market may be as much as violation of the rights of that manufacturer as the actual copy of his device. \n",
        "p_55": "40. It was a case where plaintiffs mark containing the device of a crown and word 'Seixo' and other features used for wine came to be known as 'Crown Sexio' wine. Defendant sold wine under a mark containing inter alia the device of a 'crown' the words \"Sexio de Cima\" and other features. Holding it to be a violation of plaintiff's mark injunction was granted although the marks when seen side by side were not similar. \n",
        "p_56": "41. What should be the test in determining whether the similarity between the two marks are likely to cause deception or confusion in comparison to each other has been succinctly stated by Parker, J. in Pianotist Application. (1906) 23 RPC 774 when it said : \n",
        "p_57": "\"It always is so in cases of this sort where you cannot really test whether a confusion has arisen, but only have to judge from the general appearance or sound of the two words whether confusion is likely to arise. With regard to the law upon the point, it seems to me quite settled and quite clear ........... It may be taken that the law is as follows : \n",
        "p_58": " You must take the two words. You must judge them, both by their look and by their sound. Your must consider the goods to which they are to be applied. You must consider the nature and kind of customer who would be likely to buy those goods. In fact, you must consider all the surrounding circumstances; and you must further consider what is likely to happen if each of those trade marks is used in a normal way as a trade mark for the goods of the respective owners of the marks. If, considering all those circumstances, you come to the conclusion that there will be a confusion - that is to say, not necessarily that one man will be injured and the other will gain illicit benefit, but that there will be a confusion in the goods - then you may refuse the registration, or rather you must refuse the registration in that case.\"  \n",
        "p_59": "42. The observation came in the wake of an application for registration of trade mark. But this clearly gives out that the likelihood of causing confusion may arise not only from the visual or ocular effect of the mark but by reason of similarity in the sound. The phonetic similarity gains more important role where the competing marks in respect of which conflict is to be resolved are words. In ordinary case when the essential feature of a trade mark is expressed in word or words, phonetic resemblance gains importance and any physical similarity or dissimilarity in appearance is pushed to the background. The fact that phonetic resemblance has relevance and the test in such circumstances as dealt with by Lords Parker quoted above, has found its approval by the Supreme Court in State of West Bengal v. S. N. Basak (AIR 1963 SC 449), and F. Hoffimann-La Roche & Co. Ltd. v. Geoffrey Manners Private Ltd. (AIR 1970 SC 2062). \n",

This was a case where Vicks Chemical has registered one trade mark consisting of words 'Vicks Vapo Rub Salve' a device consisting of a triangle with the words Vicks Chemical Company printed on sides and other subsidiary words below the triangle and another consisting of single word 'VapoRub' in Jamaica. These marks were registered with reference to an ointment kind of which were described to mean by British Pharmaceutical Codex 1934 as 'Vapor Rubs are preparations of menthol with other volatile substances in a basis of soft paraffin and are applied on chest for their local action and as account of their value when inhaled. 'The' Vapour Rubs were referred to as a generic term. The defendant started marketing the similar ointment under the name 'Karsote Vapour Rub'. In an action for passing off and infringement of trade mark by V. Chemical, when the matter reached Privy Counsel at the instance of defendant in respect of first trade mark No. 1952 it was urged that on account of ocular distinctiveness of two competitive marks there was no infringement. Lord Radcliffe in his opinion emphasising when the phonetic similarity becomes important to test the likely causation of deception or confusion holding that there is an infringement said : \n",
        "p_62": "  \"They have not used the mark itself on the goods that they have said, but a mark is infringed by another trader if even without using the whole of it upon or in connection with his goods, he uses one or more of its essential features. The identification of an essential feature depends partly on the Court's own judgment and partly on the burden of evidence that is placed before it. A trade mark is undoubtedly a visual device but it is well established that the ascertainment of an essential feature is not essential feature is not to be by ocular test alone. Since words can form part, or indeed the whole, of a mark, it is impossible to exclude considerations of the sound or significance of those words. Thus, it has long been accepted that if a word forming part of a mark has come in trade to be used to identify the goods of the owner of the mark or part of the mark it is an infringement of the mark itself to use that word or part of the mark of another trader, for confusion is likely to result ............... The likelihood of confusion or deception in such cases in not disproved by placing the two marks side by side and demonstrating how small is the chance of error in any customer who places his order for goods with both the marks clearly before him, for orders are not placed or are often not placed under such condition. It is made useful to observe that in most persons the eye is not an accurate reader of visual detail and that marks are remembered rather by general impressions or by some significant detail than by any photographic recollection of the whole.\" \n",
        "p_63": "45. Contention of the appellant as to latter mark on the ground that word 'Vapo Rub' is merely description of goods and cannot be registered as trade mark, the Board opined, 'there is no absolute incompatibility between what is descriptive and what is distinctive'. It was further opined that though the word has a descriptive element for it was a compound of two ordinary English words which were chosen for the purpose of suggesting to reader the leading characteristics of the substance. 'But the word itself is no description of a substance except to those persons to whom the term 'Vapour Rub' would be an intelligible use of words.\" \n",
        "p_64": "46. The principle in above case was approved by the Supreme Court in K. Krishna Chetiar's case. The ratio applies to facts of the case in hand as will be seen in discussion hereinafter. \n",
        "p_65": "47. Where the words are distinctive features of a trade mark, the apex Court in K. R. Chinna Krishna Chettiar v. Sri Ambal & Co. and another (AIR 1970 SC 146), opined at page 149 : \n",
        "p_66": "  \"The resemblance between the two marks must be considered with reference to the ear as well as the eye and occular comparison is not always the decisive test. Therefore, even if there be no visual resemblance between the two marks, that does not matter when there is a close affinity of sound between the words which are distinctive features of the two marks.\" \n",
        "p_67": "48. The Court was considering whether the two marks in question prevailing in the field of snuff trade can be considered to be deceptively similar. A mark which came prior in existence was the mark owned by the respondents prior to the date of application made by the appellant before the Supreme Court consisted of a lable containing a device of a goddess Sri Ambal seated on a globe floating on water enclosed in a circular frame with the legend \"Sri Ambal parimala snuff\" at the top of the label, and the name and address \"Sri Ambal and Co., Madras at the bottom. Trade mark No. 14691 consists of the expression \"Sri Ambal\". The appellant had sought the registration of label consisting of three panels. The first and the third panels contain in Tamil, Devnagri, Telugu and Kannada the equivalents of the words \"Sri Andal Madras Snuff.\" The centre panel contains the picture of goddess Sri Andal and the legend \"Sri Andal.\" Sri Andal and Sri Ambal are separate divinities. Sri Andal was a vaishnavite woman saint of Srivilliputur village and was deified because of her union with Lord Ranganatha. Sri Ambal is the consort of Siva or Maheshwara. Pointing out these dissimilarities in the appearance the objection to the registration of Shri Ambal and Co., Madras shown as Trade mark of the appellant was registered. Laying down the aforesaid ratio, the Court on the merit stated : \n",
        "p_68": "  \"Now the words \"Sri Ambal\" form part of trade mark No. 126808 and are the whole of trade mark No. 146291. There can be no doubt that the word \"Ambal\" is an essential feature of the trade marks. The common \"Sri\" is the subsidiary part. Of the two words \"Ambal\" is the more distinctive and fixes itself in the recollection of an average buyer with imperfect recollection.\" \n",
        "p_69": "49. Applying the test as aforesaid, the Court came to the conclusion that : \n",
        "p_70": "  \"There is no evidence of actual confusion, but that might be due to the fact that the appellant's trade is not of long standing. There is no visual resemblance between the two marks, but ocular comparison is not always the decisive test. The resemblance between the two marks must be considered with reference to the ear as well as the eye. There is a close affinity of sound between 'Ambal' and 'Andal' .......... The distinguishing feature of the respondents mark is Ambal while that of the appellant's mark is Andal. The two words are deceptively similar in sound. The name Andal does not cease to deceptively similar because it is used in conjunction with a pictorial device.\" \n",
        "p_71": "50. The principle for considering infringement was also considered by Supreme Court in Amritdhara Pharmacy v. Satya Deo Gupta (AIR 1963 SC 449), when question arose in the context of whether use of mark 'Lakshmandhara' is likely to deceive or cause confusion with trade mark 'Amritdhara' used by plaintiffs so as to refuse registration to former. Applying Parker L.J.s test in Re Pianoist's case (23 RPC 774, the Court said : \n",
        "p_72": "  \"For deceptive resemblance, the two important questions are (1) who are the persons whom the resemblance must be likely to deceive or confuse and \n \n\n(2) What rules of comparison are to be adopted in judging whether such resemblance exist.  \n",
        "p_73": "As to confusion, it is perhaps an appropriate description of mind of a customer who on seeing a mark think that it differs from the mark on goods which he has previously bought, but is doubtful whether the impression is not due to imperfect recollection. \n",
        "p_74": "51. Applying the test to two marks the Court though of the view that the critical examination of two marks disclosed some dissimilarity, said : \n",
        "p_75": " \"The question has to be approached from the point of view of an average intelligent man with imperfect recollection. To such a man the over all structural, and phonetic similarity of the two names 'Amritdhara' and Lakshmandhara' is in our opinion likely to deceive or cause confusion .......... An unwary purchaser of average intelligence and imperfect recollection would not ........ split the name into its component parts and consider the etymological meaning thereof or even consider the meaning of composite words ...... He will go more by similarity of the two names in the context of widely known medicinal preparation which he wants for his ailments.\" \n",
        "p_76": "52. Lord Dening in Peter Knoll Ltd. v. Knoll International Ltd. ((1962) 10 RPC 265), succinctly stated the test to determine the question whether the offending mark is likely to deceive or cause confusion relates to state of mind of buyer when he said : \n",
        "p_77": "  \"It is not necessary that it should be intended to deceive or intended to cause confusion. You do not have to look into the mind of the user to see what he intended. It is its probable effect on ordinary people which you have to consider.\" \n",
        "p_78": "53. The opinion also explains distinction between 'to deceive' and 'cause confusion' as under : \n",
        "p_79": "  \"Secondly, \"to deceive\" in one thing. To \"cause confusion\" is another. The difference is this : \n",
        "p_80": " When you deceive a man, you tell him a lie. You make a false representation to him and thereby cause him to believe a thing to be true which is false. You may not do it knowingly, or intentionally, but still you do it, and so you deceive him. But you may cause confusion without telling him a lie at all, and without making any false representation to him. You may indeed tell him the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, but still you may cause confusion in his mind, not by any fault of yours, but because he has not the knowledge or ability to distinguish it from the other pieces of truth known to him or because he may not even take the trouble to do so.\"  \n",
        "p_81": "Thus, in the field of same goods where word was essential feature of mark the test of phonetic similarity, which was likely to confuse was applied. \n",
        "p_82": "54. The Court also emphasised that each case must be decided on its own facts what degree of resemblance is necessary to deceive or cause confusion must in the nature of things be incapable of definition a priori. \n",
        "p_83": "55. With parity test in the present case will be whether the buyer will go mere by the similarity of two names ('DAWN' or 'DON') in the context of widely know hosiery goods which he wants to buy for his use or by identifying the hosiery goods with reference to visual background of cartons and labels, the devices on which mark is projected. \n",
        "p_84": "56. The principle has been accepted that phonetic similarity of the essential or distinctive feature of mark that may cause deception or cause confusion to an unwary customer is the acceptable test was again reaffirmed by Apex Court in Durga Dutt v. N. P. Laboratories (AIR 1965 SC 980) : \n",
        "p_85": " \"The degree of resemblence which is necessary to exist to cause deception not being capable of definition by lying down objective standards. The persons who would be deceived are, of course, the purchasers of the goods and it is the likelihood of their being deceived that is the subject of consideration. The resemblance may be phonetic, visual or in the basic idea represented by the plaintiff's mark. The purpose of the comparision is for determining whether the essential features of the plaintiff's trade mark are to be found in that used by the defendant.\" \n",
        "p_86": "57. The Court also made out clearly that the comparison of similarity between distinctive or essential feature of the mark for the purpose of enquiry into alleged infringement is relevant. The Court said : \n",
        "p_87": "  \"In an action for infringement, the plaintiff must, no doubt, make out that the use of the defendant's mark is likely to deceive, but where the similarity between the plaintiff's and the defendant's mark is so close either visuall, phonetically or otherwise and the Court reaches the conclusion that there is an imitation, no further evidence is required to establish that the plaintiff's rights are violated. Expressed in another way, if the essential features of the trade mark of the plaintiff have been adopted by the defendant, the fact that the get-up, packing and other writing or marks on the goods or on the packets in which he offers his goods for sale show marked difference, or indicate clearly a trade origin different from that of the registered proprietor of the mark would be immaterial; whereas in the case of passing off, the defendant may escape liability if he can show that the added matter is sufficient to distinguish his goods from those of the plaintiff. \n",
        "p_88": "      ***                 ***             ***               *** \n\n \n\nThis has necessarily to be ascertained by a comparison of the two marks - the degree of resemblance which is necessary to exist to cause deception not being capable of definition by laying down objective standards. The persons who would be deceived are, of course, the purchasers of the goods and it is the likelihood of their being deceived that is the subject of consideration. The resemblance may be phonetic, visual or in the basic idea represented by the plaintiff's mark. The purpose of the comparison is for determining whether the essential features of the plaintiff's trade mark are to be found in that used by the defendant.\"  \n",
        "p_89": "58. The principle was reiterated and applied in Parle Products (P.) Ltd. v. J.P. & Co. Mysore (AIR 1972 SC 1359). \n",
        "p_90": "59. As to what constitutes a distinctive or essential feature to Court referred to Section 9(1) of the Act of 1958, which can usefully be quoted here : \n",
        "p_91": "Section 9. Requisites for registration in Parts A and B of the register : \n",
        "p_92": "(1) A trade mark shall not be registered in Part A of the register unless it contains or consists of at least one of the following essential particulars namely; \n",
        "p_93": "(a) the name of a company, individual or firm represented in a special or particular manner; \n",
        "p_94": "(b) the signature of the applicant for registration or some predecessor in his business; \n",
        "p_95": "(c) one or more invented words; \n",
        "p_96": "(d) one or more words having no direct reference to the character or quality of the goods and not being, according to its ordinary signification, a geographical name or a surname or a personal name or any common abbreviation thereof or the name of a sect, caste or tribe in India : \n",
        "p_97": "(e) any other distinctive mark.    \n",
        "p_98": "60. Section 9 in no unmistakable terms tells us that words which directly refers to character or quality of goods in connection with which they are used are not the distinctive marks. Ordinarily such words also cannot be treated as essential feature of the mark taken as a whole. \n",
        "p_99": "61. A classical example of this class of cases is Coca Cola Co. of Canada v. Pepsi Cola Co. of Canada Ltd. ((1942) 50 RPC 127). In comparing the two marks it was found that Cola was in common use in Canada for naming the beverages. The distinguishing features of the mark Coca Cola was Coca and not Cola. For the same reason the distinguishing feature of make Pepsi Cola was 'Pepsi' and not Cola. There was no likelihood of confusing Coca with Pepsi. The principle was approved by Supreme Court in K. Krishna Chettiar's case (supra). \n",
        "p_100": "62. This case aptiy answers the objection that in the present case the mark registered is 'DAWN HOSIERY' per se or word 'DAWN' with rising sun in the back ground with 'Hosiery' written below word 'DAWN' in small letters. Word 'Hosiery' being referrable to character of goods dealt with by plaintiff or for that matter all hosiery products by whomsoever manufactured and dealt with cannot be considered as distinctive or essential feature. \n",
        "p_101": "63. An average purchaser asking for the goods with plaintiff's mark, applying the tests of an average intelligent person with imperfect meaning is more likely to distinguish the good desired by him by the brand name 'DAWN' than by visual mark of rising sun. Customer is not likely to ask for hosiery goods with picture of rising sun but is most likely to ask for the goods by brand name. Thus in my opinion, word 'DAWN' is the essential feature of plaintiff's both marks in question likely to hang on in the mind of an average person with imperfect recollection and in the circumstances the phonetic similarity is to be most important test to be considered while comparing the plaintiff's mark with offending mark. Applying the test with keeping in mind the persons who are to be customers, who are scattered all over the country in India, not necessarily literate or knowing English language keeping the distinction of spelling and etymological meanings of two words 'DAWN' and 'DON' in mind, and is more likely to identify the requisite goods with vernacular inscription on the packing or advertisements, the vernacular transcription and phonetic sound are to provide acceptable test for the present purposes to compare the two marks and find degree of similarity and whether the same is likely to result in deception or cause confusion. Once this conclusion is reached there is no serious dispute, rather it was candidly stated by learned counsel for the appellant that word 'DON' and 'DAWN' sound similar when spoken. Thus, there cannot be any dispute about phonetic similarity of the two words and the two words when written in vernacular script, whether Devnagri or Gujarati or Marathi or other language, will look and read similar. An average purchaser scattered in distant part of country like India with level of education, nay literacy, it cannot but be expected that with phonetic similarity he is further likely to discert with difference in spelling and meaning between word 'DAWN' and 'DON' when both words do not bear reference to character or quality of goods he is buying but are used only as distinct trade names in the term of spoken words only. \n",
        "p_102": "64. A faint attempt was made to urge that registered trade mark Exh. 3/5 is of a lable and it can only be tested on the anvil of occular similarity and phonetic similarity cannot be of any avail. Reference was made to Sunstar Lubricants Ltd. v. Federal Chemical Industries (1997 PTC (17) 64 = 1997(1) Arb. LR 337), Amar Singh Chawlwala v. Shree Wardhman Rice and General Mills (1996(16) PTC 196 = 1996 (Suppl.) Arb. LR 183), Application by Thomas A Smith Ltd. to Registrar of Trade Mark, 1913 RPC 363 and Kirloskar Proprietory Ltd. v. Kirloskar Dimensions (P.) Ltd. (supra). \n",
        "p_103": "65. The contention does not appear to be well founded on principle. As has been discussed hereinabove, the essence of a mark giving rise to infringement action is comparison of two marks concerned keeping in view the essential feature of the mark. Section 2(1)(f) speaks that a mark includes a device, brand, heading, label, ticket, name, signature, word, letter or numeral or any combination thereof. It does not say that various forms of marks envisaged are to be treated on different anvil. On the contrary it envisages combination of one or two of device. Label or other designs are only vehicle of manifesting the mark. Label, or packets etc., are at best devices of projecting the mark. Any mark will obviously be put in format on some device. Words simply, or in the form of a slogan or sentence used as mark will find place on some device like label, sachet, cartons only. Section 2(1)(d) defines 'trade mark' to mean a mark used or proposed to be used in relation to goods for the purpose of indicating or so as to indicate a connection between the goods and some persons having the right either as proprietor or registered user to use that mark. These two definitions leave no room for doubt that the fact that trade mark indicating connection between the goods as its user is projected through any device, it makes no difference while considering the question whether particular user of a mark infringes right of other to use his mark. What is relevant is what is the essential feature of the mark that connects the goods, with its rightful user, in the mind of buyer with imperfect recollections. If this is the design, visual similarity may result in infringing, if the reputation of goods conecting them with its origin is built around word mark, phonetic test may be of more relevance. Its phonetic resemblance will be of greater relevance when the goods have acquired reputation with reference to word used for its distinctions, whether used on lable or other device. Else phonetic similarity could not be a relevant consideration inasmuch as spoken word in audible form will not be considered as mark. Mark will ordinarily refer to visual presentation through some device projecting its phonetic it. Phonetic similarity becomes relevant when words used in such device acquire the distinct character of the mark providing reputation to goods to be identified or associated with such word. Secondly, in considering similarity between the two marks to find whether it is deceptively similar to the mark as a whole in its essential feature has to be kept in consideration. \n",
        "p_104": "66. In Sunstar Lubricants case (supra) the comparison was between plaintiffs mark 'Golden Cruise-1200' and defendants mark 'Sun Cruiser 2001'. The commodity in both case was automobile lubricants. As in Cola' case, the Court found that in trade circle word 'crusier' came to be associated with character of goods i.e., automobile lubricants and chemicals and had no such significance. The first name provides essential feature and distinctive mark of the goods providing it the reputation denoting its origin. There being no likelihood of deception or confusion between the two words Sun and Golden, no infringement was found. The test was not the dissimilarity of packet or label. \n",
        "p_105": "67. Likewise in Amar Singh Chawbwala's case, (supra) the commodity in respect of which both the parties were using their respective marks was rice. The marks in comparison were plaintiff's trade mark 'GOLDEN QILLA' and defendant mark 'NEELA QILLA'. This case was also within the principle enunciated in Cola's case referred to above. 'QILLA' was the word that had come to be associated with 'Rice' the commodity generally and the 'Golden', 'Lal', 'Neela' were the different and distinctive mark associated with marketing the rice denoting the origin of goods associated with its reputation. Thus, the question of dissimilarity rested on principle of essential feature and not on the basis of the device that has used as a mark viz., label or word. \n",
        "p_106": "68. In the Application by Thomas A. Smith Ltd. (1913 RPC 363), the comparison was between two words 'LIMIT' and 'SUMMIT'. Objection to register word 'LIMIT' as registered mark. The case related to goods where customers were English people as the case had arisen in England in respect of goods to be marketed there. The Court rejected the objection in following words : \n",
        "p_107": " \"The words in question \"LIMIT\" and \"SUMMIT\" are words in common use and each of them conveys a perfectly definite idea, and the only connections between them, that I can see, is that one refers to the extreme of height, and the other refers to the extreme of breadth, and undoubtedly, in the vulgar colloquialism of the day of word 'LIMIT\" has a secondary meaning attached to it which may convey the idea of the extreme of excellence, or the extreme of the reverse. I do not think that so far as the meaning of the words is concerned, a reference to the one would in the least leave such an impression in the mind of the reader as to make him mistake the other for it. Looking at the marks I do not think that there is any possibility of anybody being deceived. That nobody will ever make a mistake is more than I am prepared to say, but if there is a mistake, I think it will be made by some person so foolish, or so unobservant, as in that respect to be without the pale of the protection of the law.\" \n",
        "p_108": "69. Obviously, words 'LIMIT' and 'SUMMIT' would not phonetically or otherwise cause deception or confusion in the minds of an Englishman with average intelligence with imperfect memory. The case did not rest on any such distinction between the device in which the mark was depicted viz., Label or carton or advertisement. \n",
        "p_109": "70. The appellants reliance on Kirloskar's case (supra) is also misplaced. It was a case where plaintiffs and defendants were not engaged in common field of activity. There was no immediate threat of causing any damage to plaintiff's interest. The dispute related not primarily to offending trade mark, but user or Kirloskar as the part of Corporate name, and suit had been filed after company had already been incorporated. In these circumstances, suit filed after notice of incorporation was held to conclusions independently reached that neither balance of convenience favoured the plaintiff nor it would cause irreparable injury to it if injunction prayed for is not granted. Primary factor which weighed was that field of activities of two companies, using the corporate name was entirely different. \n",
        "p_110": "71. From the above discussion, in the light of decided cases, it can be broadly stated that in an action for infringement of passing off, that crux of enquiry is whether mark used by defendant on comparison is deceptively similar to that of plaintiff which is likely to deceive or cause confusion amongst its buyers. The similarity which can cause infringement may be ocular as well as phonetic similarity on comparison of two marks, depending upon the essential feature of the marks in question. Comparison has to be concerning essential feature of the marks and not with each and every detail of each mark to find exact or near exact reproduction. The essential feature of a mark is one by which an average person with imperfect recorrection remembers it rather by general impression or by some significant detail than by any photogenic recollection of the while in visual detail. Test of such enquiry being in the state of mind of an average buyer of the goods, it is equally important to consider the class of persons who are likely to buy the goods bearing the mark, back ground from which they come, leval of their education and degree of care they are likely to exercise in purchasing goods. What degree of resemblance is necessary and in which field, visual or sound, is from the very nature of things a matter incapable of a definition a priori. Each case must depend on its own facts and on the satisfaction of Court on totality of evidence where words or group of words are considered essential feature of the mark, than instead of its visual detail, resemblance in sound or phonetic similarity will be of prime relevance. \n",
        "p_111": "72. For determining the question of similarity between two marks and likelihood of deception or confusion arising from their use, following factors may be considered, as succintly stated by Delhi High Court in Essco v. Mascot (AIR 1982 Delhi 308) : \n",
        "p_112": "(1) the nature of the marks, i.e., whether they are words, coined or descriptive or non-descriptive, surname or geographical name, device, letters or numerals or a combination of one or more of the above; \n",
        "p_113": "(2) the degree of resemblance between the marks phonetic, visual as well as similarity in idea; \n",
        "p_114": "(3) the nature of goods in respect of which they are used or likely to be used as trade marks; \n",
        "p_115": "(4) the similarity in the nature, character and purpose of the goods of the rival traders; \n",
        "p_116": "(5) the class of purchasers who are likely to buy the goods bearing the marks, their level of education and intelligence and the degree of care they are likely to exercise in purchasing the goods; \n",
        "p_117": "(6) the mode of purchase of the goods or of placing orders for the goods; and \n \n\n(7) any other surrounding circumstances.  \n",
        "p_118": "73. These are by no means exhaustive enumerations of considerations. As noticed above, it is impossible to lay down a precise and universal test for resolving the question. It must depend on the facts of each case. The court is guided by general principles emerging from earlier precedents, which provide broadly the line of enquiry to be pursued. \n",
        "p_119": "74. Coming to the facts of the case at hand, it may be recapitulated that plaintiffs are owner of registered trade mark in the form of label depicting figure of sun at dawn with prominently displayed word 'DAWN' and subsidiary word hosiery beneath DAWN as well as words 'DAWN HOSIERY' per se since last over 40 years and are marketing their products under that name and in the circumstances it can well be said that word 'DAWN' which is not directly referable to the character or quality of goods, corresponds to essential requisite to require registration under Section 9(1)(d) of the Act of 1958 and has acquired a reputation associated with the hosiery goods manufactured by the plaintiff. So also defendants are manufacturing and trading in the same field of hosiery for over 25 years now under his own registered trade name RUPA. Yet prior to 1994, they did not think of adopting word 'DON', phonetically very similar to plaintiffs mark 'DAWN' and when written in vernacular language offering no dissimilarity as far as the identity of word mark is concerned. There is no explanation as to what promoted the defendants to adopt word 'DON' having similarity to plaintiff's mark with reference to their own hoisery articles, which hitherto is traded by them in other names. In fact plea of likelihood of cusing confusion due to user of this name is supported by the fact that defendant has taken the stance that they have in fact moved for rectification application to remove the mark 'DAWN', from register of trade marks, which is pending, though the plaintiffs assert that they have not yet received even the notice of such application. The admitted fact that defendants are continuously trading with the offending mark causing uninterrupted injury giving fresh cause of action to plaintiff to complain of his grievance. Except for the fact of alleged in-action on the part of plaintiff since May 1995 in not filing suit until March, 1997 there is no suggestion of any culpable delay or acquiescence on the part of plaintiffs to raise it to level of abandonment, either in pleading or in affidavit. \n",
        "p_120": "75. In Karly's words 'mere' failure to sue without some positive act of encouragement is not general enough to give a defence. A defendant who infringe knowing of the plaintiffs mark can hardly complain if he is later sued upon it. A defence of estoppel by acquiescence is to be distinguished from defence that by delay the mark has become publici juris.\" \n",
        "p_121": "76. The fact that in reply to very first notice the defendant held out that he has taken proceedings for rectification for removing the mark 'DAWN' registered in favour of plaintiff from the registrar of trade marks at least does go to show that defendants knew that use of word 'DON' by it is likely to cause confusion in the minds of prospective buyers with plaintiffs registered mark 'DAWN' so as to cause infringement of trade mark unless the same is removed from register and it was not a case where be bona fide believed that no infringement is likely to cause by the use of word 'DON' by him. \n",
        "p_122": "77. It is also noticed from the sample of offending hosiery products and cartons in which the same are offered to buyers by the defendants shown to the Court, that on labels attached to it word 'DON' is shown in prominence rather than its registered trade mark 'RUPA'. So also, on the carton slogan \"xZsxjoBxNuU\" the word \"xNuU\" in vernacular script is shown prominently within inverted comas. The advertisement of this particular class of goods also gives prominence to word \"xNuU\" in vernacular script. Thus, the manner in which defendant is projecting its product in the market leaves little room of doubt in the mind of buyers that the goods offered to him are of 'DON' or \"DAWN\" mark. Notwithstanding that there is quite dissimilarity in the visual background of the packing carton, one cannot say with confidence that a buyer of average intelligence with imperfect recollection is not likely to be confused by the manner in which the mark of defendant is projected to treat it as the trade mark under which the goods are being sold and confusion between the two marks is likely to prevail in his mind. Particularly, keeping in mind that goods in question are hosiery products like banyans and underwear of daily use used by thousands of persons from common milieu scattered all over the country in far flung areas, with level of common education and acquintance with English language, the likelihood of average buyer discerning differences is spelling of 'DON' and 'DAWN' and difference between their etymological meaning is little, as was the case in an English Court in the application. Thomas A Smithy Ltd. (supra). He is more likely to relate the goods by name \"DAWN\" than by pictorial presentation on the package. The very fact that both the plaintiff and defendant have registered words 'DAWN' and 'RUPA' respectively as their trade marks in connection with conveying on their trade of hosiery further strengthen the view that goods are identified by name of the brand and not by pictorial background of package or label or the device on which the brand mark is projected. With all these material on record, the conclusion of trial court that the use of word 'DON' by defendant prima facie infringes plaintiff's registered mark in question, is a reasonable conclusion. \n",
        "p_123": "78. It will be apt to refer the following observation of the Supreme Court in Corn Products v. Shangrila Food Products (supra), while considering the phonetic similarity between words 'Glucovita' and 'Gluvita'; it is observed that at page 147 : \n",
        "p_124": " \"It is well known that the question whether the two marks are likely to give rise to confusion or not is a question of first impression. It is for the court to decide that question English cases proceeding on the English way of pronouncing an English word by Englishmen, which it may be stated is not always the same, may not be of much assistance in our country in deciding questions of phonetic similarity. It cannot be overlooked that the word is an English word which to the mass of the India people is a foreign word ........ Apart from the syllable 'co' in the appellant's mark, the two marks are identical. That syllable is not in our opinion such as would enable the buyers in our country to distinguish the one mark from the other.\" \n",
        "p_125": "79. The phonetic similarity test must be keeping in view the person who are concerned with was against emphasised by the Court in Amritdhara Pharmacy v. Satya Deo Gupta (supra), that at page 453; \n",
        "p_126": "  \"Where the trade relates to goods largely sold to illiterate or badly educated persons, it is no answer to say that a person educated in the Hindu language would go by the etymological or ideological meaning and see the difference between 'current of nectar' and 'current of Lakshman'. 'Current of Lakshman' in a literate sense has no meaning, to give it meaning one must further make the inference that the 'current or steam' is as pure and strong as Lakshman Lakshman of the Ramayana. An ordinary Indian villager or towns man will perhaps know Lakshman, the story of the Ramayana being familiar to him, but we doubt if he would etymologise to the extent of seeing the so-called ideological difference between 'Amritdhara' and 'Lakshmandhara'. He would go more by the similarity of the two names in the context of the widely known medicinal preparation which he wants for his ailments.\" \n",
        "p_127": "The assertions that by injunction the defendants sale of DON' brand of hosiery is likely to be affected to the tune of Rs. 1.50 lacs per day also suggest that defendant is intending to take benefit of buyers support who have associated that hosiery goods to be purchased by them with 'DAWN' name, notwithstanding that it claims to have its own good will with the name of RUPA. In the former, it is a clear case of lack of bona fide. In the latter case, even if the defendant is restrained from using the word 'DON', he is not likely to suffer any injury as it was suggested by learned counsel for the defendant himself that they will have only to place some sticker on the cartons for blocking the word 'DON' appearing thereon and to replace the labels only on the finished goods before offering to public in their own name 'RUPA' or some other name not offending the plaintiffs mark to which plaintiffs too does not have any objection. This was the course suggested by apex Court in Whirpool's case too. When according to defendants, they have a turnover of over 58 crores of which share of goods with 'DON' make is only about 2.25 crore, the demand to use of word 'DON' cannot affect the business of defendant on their own goodwill adversely. \n",
        "p_128": "80. Thus in totality of circumstances plea of delay in isolation to deny the relief of temporary injunction cannot be accepted. So also temporary injunction has been granted by the trial Court in reasonable exercise of its discretion on materials before it. Hence, the order does not call for interference in appeal, even if the Court were to come to different conclusion on merit, though on merit also as seen above this court agrees with the trial Court finding. \n",
        "p_129": "81. Coming thus far, it was stated by Mr. A. C. Gandhi, learned counsel for the appellant-defendant that defendant shall not use the word 'DON' in any of its products or cartons in which they are packed or in any advertisement independently either in English or any vernacular language until disposal of the suit. However, he may be permitted to use word 'DON' in company with 'RUPA' without prominence to either of it on its product to read as 'RUPA DON' until decision of the suit, hearing of which may be expedited. \n",
        "p_130": "82. Mr. Shelat, appearing for the respondent plaintiff had urged that permitting the defendant to use the word 'DON' in any manner at this stage would continue to cause confusion in the market and may give wrong signals for future adjudication. Therefore, any modification in the trial Court's order will not be justified. However, he had no objection to trial of the suit being expedited. In that connection, it was stated by him that the plaintiff does not wish to lead any oral evidence so far the question of infringement is concerned. However, the evidence, if any, required for establishing for passing of action and damages may be required to be led for which the plaintiff would abide by any time schedule fixed by the Court. In response, Mr. Gandhi too stated that defendant also would not be leading any oral evidence in respect of the infringement action but he would lead the evidence only in rebuttal in respect of which the plaintiff leads evidence as aforesaid without prolonging the proceedings before the trial court, within the time frame fixed by the Court. \n",
        "p_131": "83. Having considered the request of the parties, in the light of discussion made above, I am of the opinion that since I have come to the conclusion that the temporary injunction has been granted by the trial Court in reasonable exercise of its discretion on the materials before it, and to that conclusion, I have also agreed on merits, and keeping in view the limitation of the appellate jurisdiction, as pointed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Whirlpool's case (supra), I am not inclined to make any modification in the order passed by the trial Court at this stage without expressing any opinion on the question whether the user of the word 'RUPA-DON' as suggested by the defendants at this stage in future would amount to infringement or not, except to that in the circumstances of this pending litigation, if such permission is granted, the apprehension of the plaintiff that it is likely to cause confusion and give wrong signals is justified. \n",
        "p_132": "84. However, the prayer for expeditions trial of the suit appears to be reasonable. \n",
        "p_133": "85. In view of the statement made about the confining the precincts of evidence to be led before the trial Court, the suit itself shall be put on the Board of hearing of the trial Court in the month of July 1998.

The trial should be completed by the Court as far as possible by 3 1st January, 1999. \n",

        "p_5": "\t4.The case of the applicants/plaintiffs in brief is as follows:-\n",
        "p_6": "\t\t4(1)The applicants/plaintiffs commenced their business in the year 1995 with the objective of manufacturing and marketing various kinds of masalas and spices.  Over the years, the applicants have grown into one of the leading manufacturers and marketers of spices in India, by their sheer high quality and reliability and due to the enormous goodwill earned by the applicants in the course of their business.  The applicants are presently dealing in over 400 different products with the Trade Mark AACHI.  The applicants have also diversified their business activities and started manufacturing and marketing various kinds of consumer goods, within a short span of 17 years.   The applicants in order to distinguish their various items of products from others, adopted the Trade Mark 'AACHI' for all their products and services.  The expression 'AACHI' has become very popular because of their continuous and substantial usage of the mark over a decade.   This Trade Mark has become very popular and a very valuable intellectual property of the applicants.    No one can use the said expression  AACHI for spices and masalas and other goods or services, for which the applicants are using the said mark.   The mark is unique and distinctive of the applicants' goods and no one has used the Trade Mark AACHI  for masala preparations and its allied preparations prior to the applicants.   The applicants have honestly adopted the Trade Mark and have put in enormous hard work and labour and invested huge sums of money, for advertisement and sales promotional expenses. The applicants have been using the Trade Mark 'AACHI' with respect to almost all the masala preparations from the commencement of their business.  The applicants have acquired enormous goodwill and reputation. In order to protect this intellectual property, particularly with respect to the Trade Mark, the applicants applied for the registration of trademark on 04.05.2000 in Class 20. The Registrar of Trade Marks, on consideration of the substantial use and reputation, granted registration for the Trade Mark AACHI under Registration No.922594 in favour of the applicants.  Since then, the applicants have become exclusive owner of this trademark 'AACHI'.    \n",
        "p_7": "\t\t4(2)The applicants have also obtained registration of the trademark AACHI CHETTINAD RESTAURANT under No.1116254 on 03.07.2002 in respect of Food Preparations for Human Consumption like coffee, tea, coca, sugar, rice, tapioca, sago, coffee substitutes, flour and preparations made from cereals, bread, biscuits, cakes, pastry, and confectionery, ice.  The applicants have  sole proprietary right over this mark.  Any unthorized use of the same mark or similar Trade Mark would amount to infringement of the applicants' trademark.  \n",
        "p_8": "\t\t4(3)While so, in December-2012 the applicants came across the respondent-restaurant bearing the name Aachi Aappakadai Chettinad A/c Restaurant, which is a blatant infringement of the applicants' registered Trade Mark 'AACHI CHETTINAD RESTAURANT'.  The two marks are visually and phonetically similar. The respondent-restaurant namely Aachi Aappakadai Chettinad A/c Restaurant is identical to the applicants' Trade Mark.   The copy is total and consciously taken from the applicants' label with intention of taking undue advantage of reaping the benefit without sowing.  The respondent's service is inferior in quality and substandard.   Hence, according to the applicants, if the respondent/defendant is not stopped from using the identical trademark, then it will cause irreparable loss and hardship to the applicants/plaintiffs. Hence, the applicants/plaintiffs filed the present suit.  Pending the suit, the plaintiffs have filed the above applications for the relief as stated supra. \n",
        "p_9": "\t5.This Court, by order dated 13.09.2013, while ordering notice to the respondent, has granted interim injunction for a period of four weeks.\n",
        "p_10": "\t6.On appearance, the respondent has filed applications in A.Nos.1595 & 1596 of 2013 to vacate the interim injunction, contending as follows:-\n",
        "p_11": "\t\t6(1)The word 'AACHI' is a common Tamil word, which is prominently used in Chettinad region of Tamil Nadu.  The simple meaning of the word 'AACHI' is elderly woman.  This word is commonly used in relation to Chettinad Style of cooking.  It is neither an invented word nor coined word of the applicants and hence, it does not carry any distinctive character.  Hence, under Section 9(1)(a) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, (for short 'Act') common words such as AACHI ought not to have been registered as a Trade Mark.  Hence, the registration of the word AACHI is inherently incapable of becoming distinctive of any single person with respect to any product or service.  The word 'AACHI' is used in relation to Chettinadu style of cooking and it is closely associated to the Karaikudi region.   It is also customary for Restaurants offering Chettinad variety of dishes to use the word 'AACHI'.   Hence,  the registration of the word 'AACHI' is violative of Section 9(1)(b) and (c) of the Act.   It is not the claim of the applicants that the trademark acquired distinctive character even long prior to the registration.  Hence, the word 'AACHI' is incapable of being registered under the aforesaid provisions of Trade Marks Act, 1999.  Any such use of the word 'AACHI' by the respondent herein enjoys the protection offered by Section 30(2)(a) of the Act, despite the registration made by the applicants herein. \n",
        "p_12": "\t\t6(2)The respondent is a honest and bone fide user of the word 'AACHI' in relation to the Chettinad Restaurant run by them in the name and style of 'AACHI AAPAKADAI CHETTINAD A/c RESTAURANT'.  The respondent was not aware of the Trademark of the applicants.  The respondent does not claim exclusive right or monopoly over the word 'AACHI' or 'Karaikudi' or 'Chettinad', since such words are generic in nature and not capable of being monoplised by any person.   Similarly the applicants are not entitled to claim monopoly right over such words and wrongfully prevent others from using such generic words.   Therefore, the registration of the Trade Mark 'AACHI' is contrary to the provision of  the Trade Marks Act.  Hence, there is no need to pass any interim injunction order by this Court.  Thus, the respondent sought for vacating the interim injunction. \n",
        "p_13": "\t7.Learned counsel for the applicants submitted that the 1st applicant is the Registered proprietor of the Trademark AACHI in respect of various spices, condiments, goods and services.   The 2nd applicant-Company is permitted to use the Trademark AACHI by way of a common law license.   The applicants are the prior users of the trademark AACHI since 1995.   At present, the applicants are the Registered Proprietors of the Trademark AACHI in respect of a variety of goods and services in various stylized marks.   Among other marks, the 1st applicant is also the proprietor of the trademark AACHI CHETTINADU RESTAURANT under Reg. No.1116254 in Class 30, from 03.07.2002.  The applicants label mark was registered on 01.11.2004.  The Trademark AACHI had acquired a secondary meaning on account of long usage.   While so, in December 2012, the applicants came across the Restaurant run by the respondent at Chennai having the name AACHI AAPAKADAI CHETTINADU A/C RESTAURANT.  The use of the said mark by the respondent has not been authorized by the applicants and hence, it amounts to infringement of Registered Trademark and Passing Off.   The applicants are not objecting the use of AAPAKADAI CHETTINADU A/C  RESTAURANT.  The applicants are only objecting the use of word AACHI by the respondent.  Thus, the learned counsel for the applicants prays to make the interim injunction order as absolute. \n",
        "p_14": "\t8.Per contra, the learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the word AACHI is a common Tamil word and it does not carry any distinctive character.  Under Section 9(1)(a) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, the common words such as 'AACHI' shall not be registered as Trade Mark.    Hence, the registration of the word AACHI as a Trademark by the applicants is invalid.  Since the word AACHI is a common word, the question as to whether the word AACHI carries any distinctive character or secondary meaning could be decided only at the time of trial.   In this regard, the learned counsel for the respondent relied upon the judgment reported in AIR 1955 SC 558 (Registrar of Trade Marks Vs. Ashok Chandra Rakhit Ltd) wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the word 'Shree' is a common word in India with multiple meanings and such common words are not entitled to protection.   Similarly, the learned counsel for the respondent has relied upon the judgment reported in  CDJ 2011 DHC 1174 (Bhole Baba Milk Food Industries Ltd Vs. Parul Food Specialities Pvt. Ltd.), wherein the Division of Bench of Delhi High Court held that the registration would give protection for the Trade Mark as a whole and not to a particular word of common origin. \t\n",
        "p_15": "\t9.The learned counsel for the respondent has further submitted that though the applicants are the proprietors of the registered Trade Mark 'AACHI',  they are primarily dealing with only Masalas and spices.  Though the applicants have registered the Trademark AACHI CHETTINADU RESTAURANT on 03.07.2002, till date they have not used the said Trademark in respect of the restaurant business.  While the word AACHI is being used as common word, the applicants cannot prevent the respondent  from using the said word.    In this regard, the learned counsel for the respondent relied upon the judgment reported in CDJ 2007 BHC 624 (Balkrishna Hatcheries Vs. Nandos International Ltd & another), wherein the Bombay High Court has held that when the plaintiff has no business or goodwill or reputation in the business of running restaurant, there is no question of passing of by the defendants of their restaurant business or business of sale of sauces as that of the plaintiff. The learned counsel for the respondent has also relied upon the judgment reported in 1997(4) SCC 201 (Vishnudas Trading Vs. Vazir Sultan Tobacco Co. Ltd), wherein it has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that non-user of the Trademark should not be allowed to enjoy monopoly, otherwise, he will indulge in mischief of trafficking in Trademark and prevent all bone fide user of such common word.    \n",
        "p_16": "\t10.By way of reply, the learned counsel for the applicants submitted that under Section 31 of the Trade Marks Act, the validity of the registered Trademark cannot be challenged on the ground that it was not registrable under Section 9 of the Act.   Now, the respondent is seeking to challenge the validity of the appellants' trademark on the ground that it is of a descriptive expression.  The Law provides for a separate procedure to challenge the registration under Sections 46 & 57 of the Act.  The respondent has not chosen to invoke the said provisions.  In support of her contention, the learned counsel for the applicants relied upon the judgment reported in AIR 1994 DELHI 239 (Daimler Benz Aktiegesellschaft Vs. Hybo Hindustan).  In that case, the defendant therein was using the word 'Benz' in respect of their products like underwears.  Hence, a suit was filed as against the defendant therein to restrain them from using the word 'Benz' with reference to underwears.  In that case, the Delhi High Court held that 'Benz' as a name of a Car would be known to every family that has ever used a quality car and when 'Benz' is a name given to a very high priced and extremely well engineered Car,  the defendant therein cannot dilute that, by user of the name 'Benz' with respect to a product like underwears.   Thus, the Delhi High Court granted injunction in favour of the appellant therein. \n",
        "p_17": "\t11.For the same proposition of law, the learned counsel for the applicants has also relied upon the judgment reported in 1988 PTC 1 (Kmala Trading Co., Bombay and other Vs. Gillette U.K.Limited, Middle Sex, England).  In that case, as the tooth brushes were manufactured and sold in the Bombay market under the trademark 7 O' CLOCK by the defendant therein, a suit was filed by  the plaintiff therein who is the manufacturer of 7 O' CLOCK blade.  In that case, a defence was taken by the defendants stating that the goods manufactured by the plaintiffs and the defendants are different in nature and they are not available in the same shop and the customers of those goods are different.   But, the said contention was rejected by the Bombay High Court observing that those goods are available in every shop including a small shop and they are daily requirement of every person.  Thus, the Bombay High Court granted injunction.\n",
        "p_18": "\t12.It is yet another submission of the learned counsel for the applicants that the trademark AACHI is not a descriptive expression and it is only suggestive.  The word ACCHI denotes a distinguished elderly lady.   In support of this contention, the learned counsel for the applicants relied upon the judment reported in 2005(30) PTC 1 (Godfrey Philips India Ltd. Vs. Girnar Food & Beveraes (P) Ltd), wherein it has been held that even descriptive expressions can acquire exclusive right and a descriptive/laudatory trademark entitled to protection if it assumed a secondary meaning identifying it with a particular product or being from a particular source.  \n",

In support this contention, the learned counsel for the applicants has also relied upon the judgment reported in AIR 1972 SC 232 (State of U.P. Vs. Ram Nath).\n",

Further, according to the learned counsel for the applicants, the mark AACHI by continuous and long usage by the applicants in their various products has acquired secondary meaning.   Therefore,  even assuming for a moment that the applicants are not carrying on restaurant business, the same will not give right to the respondent to run the restaurant business by using the applicants' trademark AACHI. \n",

Though the applicants have registered the trademark AACHI CHETTINADU RESTAURANT in the year 2002, they are not carrying on hotel business; that since the word AACHI is a common word the applicants are not legally entitled to prevent the respondent from running the hotel business under the name of Aachi Aappakadai Chettinad A/c Restaurant.\n",

But, I am of the opinion, under Section 31 of the Trade Marks Act, the validity of the registered trade mark cannot be challenged in the legal proceedings on the ground that it is not registrable under Section 9 of the Act.  Section 31 of the Trade Marks Act reads as follows:-\n",

        "p_31": "Even if the trade mark is not registrable, the respondent is having remedy only before the Registrar of the Trade Marks under Section 57 of the Act to remove the trade mark from the register.

The applicants obtained 51 registrations in respect of their various products.   Though the applicants are mainly dealing with masalas and spices, they had also registered the trademark AACHI CHETTINADU RESTAURANT  in the year 2002 and the restaurant business is an allied business to the other businesses of the applicants, since they are dealing with various food products.  The use of the words Aachi Aappakadai Chettinad A/c Restaurant by the respondent in their restaurant business would result in confusion and deception in the market; that the general public will assume that there is a business relationship between the applicants and the respondent, whereas there is no such relationship.   In support of this submissions,  reliance was placed by the learned counsel for the applicants on the judgments reported in AIR 1994 DELHI 239 (Daimler Benz Aktiegesellschaft Vs.

        "p_33": "\t21(2)  But, I find that in those cases, the word used as trademark is not a common or generic word and on the other hand, it is either an invented word or a coined word of the owner of the registered trade mark.  In the instant case, the word registered by the applicant is \"AACHI CHETTINADU RESTAURANT\".  The word AACHI in Tamil means 'Grand Mother'.  Though the applicants identified themselves with their business in masalas and spices by using the trademark AACHI, all along they are not carrying on restaurant business, in respect of their registered trade mark AACHI CHITTINADU RESTAURANT.   Unless and until the said trade mark 'AACHI' which is a common and generic word, is used as the trademark in every business, for which they have registered the said trade mark, in my considered opinion, they can not prevent the respondent from doing business by using the word 'AACHI' in respect of those businesses, which they are not using the trade mark ' AACHI'.   In fact, the judgment reported in (1997) 4 SCC 201 (Vishnudas Trading Vs. Vazir Sultan Tobacco Co. Ltd.), gives a fitting answer to this issue.  In the said judgment it has been held as follows:- \n",
        "p_34": "\t47.The respondent Company got registration of its brand name 'Charminar' under the broad classification manufactured tobacco.  So long such registration remains operative, the respondent Company is entitled to claim exclusive use of the said brand name in respect of articles made of tobacco coming under the said broad classification manufactured tobacco.  Precisely for the said reason, when the appellant made application for registration of quiwam and zarda under the same brand name Charminar, such prayer for registration was not allowed.  The appellant, therefore, made application for rectification of the registration made in favour of the respondent Company so that the said registration is limited only in respect of the articles being manufactured and marketed by the respondent Company, namely, cigarettes.  In our view, if a trader or manufacturer actually trades in or manufactures only one or some of the articles coming under a broad classification and such trader or manufacturer has no bona fide intention to trade in or manufacture other goods or articles which also fall under the said broad classification, such trader or manufacturer should not be permitted to enjoy monopoly in respect of all the articles which may come under such broad classification and by that process preclude the other traders or manufacturers from getting registration of separate and distinct goods which may also be grouped under the broad classification.  If registration has been given generally in respect of all the articles coming under the broad classification and if it is established that the trader or manufacturer who got such registration had not intended to use any other article except the articles being used by such trader or manufacturer, the registration of such trader is liable to be rectified by limiting the ambit of registration and confining such registration to the specific article or articles which really concern the trader or manufacturer enjoying the registration made in his favour.  In our view, if rectification in such circumstances is not allowed, the trader or manufacturer by virtue of earlier registration will be permitted to enjoy the mischief of trafficking in trade mark.   Looking to the scheme of the registration of trade ark as envisaged in the Trade Marks Act and the Rules framed thereunder, it appears to us that registration of a trade mark cannot be held to be absolute, perpetual and invariable under all circumstances.  Section 12 of the Trade Marks Act prohibits registration of identical or deceptively similar trade marks in respect of goods and description of goods which is identical or deceptively similar to the trade mark already registered.  For prohibiting registration under Section 12(1), goods in respect of which subsequent registration is sought for, must be (i) in respect of goods or description of goods being same or similar and covered by earlier registration and (ii) trade mark claimed for such goods must be same or deceptively similar to the trade mark already registered.  It may be noted here that under Sub-Section (3) of Section 12 of the Trade Marks Act, in an appropriate case of honest concurrent use and/or of other special circumstances, same and deceptively similar trade marks may be permitted to another by the Registrar, subject to such conditions as may deem just and proper to the Registrar.  It is also to be noted that the expression goods and description of goods appearing in Section 12(1) of the Trade Marks Act indicate that registration may be made in respect of one or more goods or of all goods confirming a general description.  The Trade Marks Act has noted distinction between description of goods forming a genus and separate and distinctly identifiable goods under the genus in various other sections e.g., goods of same description in Section 46, Sections 12 and 34 and class of goods in Section 18, Rules 12 and 26 read with Fourth Schedule to the Rules framed under the Act.\n\nThe dictum laid down in the above said judgment would show that when the trademark registered by a person is a word of common nature, unless the said trademark is put in use in his business, he cannot prevent the other from using the said word in their business. \n",
        "p_35": "\t21(3) Though the learned counsel for the applicants relied upon number of judgments in support of her contention that even in the absence of similar goods, injunction was granted by the Courts, I find that in all those cases, the word used by the parties is either an invented word or a coined word and not a common word.  Hence, the decisions relied upon by the learned counsel for the applicants cannot be made applicable to the present facts of the case.   \n",
        "p_36": "\t21(4). The applicants are having protection under the Trade Marks Act only in respect of the products, which they are manufacturing and marketing, and not for the business, which they are not carrying on, since the word registered by them namely \"AACHI\", is a common word.  The applicants herein are not doing restaurant business, though they registered a trademark in respect of restaurant business.  Hence, I am of the opinion that they are not entitled for interim injunction.\n",
        "p_37": "\t21(5)  But, the learned counsel for the applicants relied upon the judgment reported in AIR 1972 SC 232 (The State of U.P. Vs. Ram Nath) and submitted that even if the trademark is abandoned by a registered user, it can only furnish a ground for a person to make an application under Section 46 of the Trade Marks Act to have the trade mark removed from the registers and it does not entitle him to use a trade mark.\n",
        "p_38": "\t21(6) The factual aspects of that case would show that the respondents 1 to 4 therein, who are the partners of the firm M/s.Pannalal Durga Prasad of Nayalion, Kanpur, were minting gold coins with a trade mark said to be similar to that of the appellant therein viz., M/s.Habib Bank Ltd.  Hence, a criminal complaint was lodged against the respondents therein under Sections 78 and 79 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act.  In this regard, a letter was written by the Inspector of Trade Marks on behalf of the Director of Industries, to the Additional City Magistrate-I, Kanpur to take necessary action.  On receipt of the said letter, the Magistrate directed the Police to register a case and investigate the same.  Accordingly, a police report was made to the Magistrate, who adopted the procedure under Section 251-A under the old code of Cr.P.C. by examining each of the respondents, after which he framed charges against them.   During the course of the trial, the respondents therein filed an application stating that Habib Bank had stopped dealing in gold and does not manufacture gold coins and that it had also destroyed the dies and since 1954 the trade mark of Habib Bank had become ineffective and was thrown open to the public. But, the Magistrate had dismissed the application filed by the respondent and directed the production of the entire evidence on the next date. Against this order, a revision was filed before the Sessions Judge of Kanpur.  The Sessions Judge made a reference to the High Curt recommending the quashing of the charge on the ground that The principle of abandonment is given legal recognition in Section 46, Trade & Merchandise Marks Act which provides that a registered trade mark may be taken off the register if it was not used for continuous period of five years or longer.  The High Court had accepted the reference made by the Sessions Judge and quashed the proceedings against the accused for offences under Sections 78 and 79 of the Act, against which an appeal was filed before the Hon'ble Supreme Court.  Only while dealing with the Sections 78 & 79 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act , the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that since the trademark was abandoned, it will not entitled the accused person to use the trademark.\n",
        "p_39": "\t21(7) The dictum laid down in the said judgment  would show that in a criminal case lodged under Sections 78 & 79 of the Trade mark and Merchandise Marks Act, the respondents 1 to 4 therein had taken a defence with an intention to escape from the criminal liability stating that since the Habib Bank had stopped dealing in gold and does not manufacture gold coins, the criminal case is not maintainable against them.  The said judgment cannot be made applicable to the present facts of the case.  In the case on hand, the point that has to be gone into is as to whether the word AACHI is a common word or not and if so, whether the said word is in usage by the applicants in their restaurant business, and whether the applicants are entitled for grant of interim injunction,  since the applicants are alleging infringement of their trademark by the respondent.  As observed earlier, the applicants are not entitled for grant of interim injunction, since the word AACHI registered by them in respect of restaurant business is a common word, and unless the same is put into use in the restaurant business, the applicants cannot prevent others from using the same. Therefore, I am not inclined to accept the submission made by the learned counsel for the applicants by relying upon the said judgment. \n",
        "p_40": "\t22.Question No.III :-  It is yet another contention of the learned counsel for the applicants that the word 'AACHI' has been registered as Trademark of the applicants and by continuous and long usage of the said word AACHI by the applicants, it has acquired a secondary meaning.   But, I am of the opinion, even assuming for a moment the word 'AACHI' acquired the secondary meaning, the applicant can claim protection only in respect of the products that they are manufacturing and marketing under the registered trade mark 'AACHI' and not for the business which they are not carrying on since the said trade mark is common word.  Further more, whether the word AACHI has acquired secondary meaning or not in respect of Restaurant business could be gone into only at the time of the trial on the basis of the oral and documentary evidence that may be adduced.\n",
        "p_41": "\t23.In view of the above discussion, I am of the opinion that the applicants have not made out a case for granting interim junction.  Hence, these applications are liable to be dismissed.\n",
        "p_42": "\t24.It is contended by the learned counsel for the applicants that the respondent has adopted the oval shaped label mark AACHI, which is the label mark of the applicants. But, the said contention was denied by the learned counsel for the respondent.  However, it is made clear that though the respondent-company is entitled to use the word AACHI in their restaurant business, they are not entitled to adopt the oval shaped label mark,  which is a registered label mark of the applicants.\n",
        "p_43": "\tIn fine, the above applications are dismissed and the interim injunction granted by this Court is vacated.  Consequently, Application Nos. 1595 & 1996 of 2013 are allowed.\n",

He filed the complaint\non May\t6, 1994.   After  recording preliminary evidence the\nMagistrate passed orders summoning the appellants and others\non May\t9, 1994.   It  appears that when the summons reached\nthe appellants\tthey immediately  approached the  High Court\nseeking aforesaid reliefs.  The High Court, however, refused\nto entertain  the writ\tpetition  on  the  ground  that\t the\nappellants should  approach the\t 1st  respondent  for  their\ndischarge  under   Section  245\t of  the  Code\tof  Criminal\nProcedure (for\tshort 'the  Code'), if the complaint did not\ndisclose commission of any offence by the appellants and the\nCourt considered  the charge  to be  groundless.   The\tHigh\nCourt did not approve of the appellants approaching it under\nwrit jurisdiction when sufficient remedy was available under\nthe Code.   The\t High Court  was also of the opinion that it\ncould not  be said at that stage that the allegations in the\ncomplaint were\tso absurd  and inherently  improbable on the\nbasis of  which no  prudent man\t could\tever  reach  a\tjust\nconclusion that\t there\texisted\t no  sufficient\t ground\t for\nproceedings against  the  accused.    On  the  plea  of\t the\nappellants that\t the provisions\t of Section 13(2) of the Act\nread with  Rule 9-A  of the  Rules framed under the Act were\nviolated and  on that  account the  inquiry or\ttrial  stood\nvitiated the  High Court said that the appellants could well\napproach the court for that purpose and that it was no stage\nfor the\t High Court to record its finding.  yet another plea\nof the appellants that provisions of Section 203 and 245 (2)\nof the\tCode did not provide an adequate remedy for a person\ncharged on  flimsy grounds  and that in view of the decision\nof this\t Court in  State of Haryana vs. Chaudhary Bhajan Lal\nand others  (JT 1990  (4) S.C.\t650 [(1992) supp. 1 SCC 335]\nthe court should interfere also did not find favour with the\nHigh Court.   It  was of  the opinion  that Chaudhary Bhajan\nLal's case  pertained to  a cognizable\toffence where police\nhad taken  cognizance of  the matter and in a complaint case\nthe Magistrate was empowered to discharge the accused at any\nstage of  the trial  if it  was found  that the\t charge\t was\ngroundless.\n",

If in a case like the present one the court find\nthat the  appellants could not invoke its jurisdiction under\nArticle 226,  the court can certainly treat the petition one\nunder Article  227 or  Section 482  of the  Cod. it  ay\t not\nhowever, be  lost sight of that provisions exist in the Code\nof revision  and appeal\t but sometime  for immediate  relief\nSection 482  of the  Code or  Article 227  may\thave  to  be\nresorted to  for correcting  some grave errors that might be\ncommitted by  the subordinate  courts.

A court is not\nto be  equated with  a tribunal\t exercising  quasi  judicial\npowers.\t We would, therefore, strike out the name of the 1st\nrespondent from the arrary of the parties.\n",
        "p_29": "     Summoning of an accused in a criminal case is a serious\nmatter.\t  Criminal law cannot be set into motion as a matter\nof course.  it is not that the complainant has to bring only\ntwo witnesses to support his allegations in the complaint to\nhave the  criminal law\tset into  motion.   The order of the\nmagistrate summoning  the accused  must reflect\t that he has\napplied his  mind to  the facts\t of the\t case  and  the\t law\napplicable thereto.    He  has\tto  examine  the  nature  of\nallegations made in the complaint and the evidence both oral\nand  documentary  in  support  thereof\tand  would  that  be\nsufficient for the complainant to succeed in bringing charge\nhome to\t the accused.\tIt  is not  that the Magistrate is a\nsilent spectator  at the  time of  recording of\t preliminary\nevidence before\t summoning of the accused. Magistrate has to\ncarefully scrutinise  the evidence brought on record and may\neven himself  put  questions  to  the  complainant  and\t his\nwitnesses to  elicit answers to find out the truthfulness of\nthe allegations or otherwise and then examine if any offence\nis prima facie committed by all or any of the accused.\n",
        "p_30": "     No doubt  the magistrate  can discharge  the accused at\nany stage  of the  trial if  he considers  the charge  to be\ngroundless, but\t that does  not mean that the accused cannot\napproach the  High Court  under Section\t 482 of\t the Code or\nArticle 227  of the  Constitution  to  have  the  proceeding\nquashed against him when the complaint does not make out any\ncase against  him and  still he\t must undergo the agony of a\ncriminal trial.\t it was submitted before us on behalf of the\nState that  in case  we find  that the\tHigh Court failed to\nexercise its jurisdiction the matter should be remanded back\nto it  to consider  if the  complaint and  the\tevidence  on\nrecord did not make out any case against the appellants, If,\nhowever, we refer to the impugned judgment of the High Court\nit has\tcome to the conclusion, though\twithout referring to\nany material  on record, that \"in the present case it cannot\nbe said\t at this stage that the allegations in the complaint\nare so\tabsurd and  inherently improbable  on the  basis  of\nwhich no  prudent man  can ever reach a just conclusion that\nthere exists  no sufficient  ground for\t proceedings against\nthe accused.\"  We do  not think\t that  the  High  Court\t was\ncorrect in coming to such a conclusion and in coming to that\nit has\talso foreclosed\t the matter  for the  magistrate  as\nwell,  as   the\t magistrate  will  not\tgive  any  different\nconclusion on  an application filed under section 245 of the\ncode. The  High Court  says that  the appellants  could very\nwell appear  before the\t court and move an application under\nSection 245(2)\tof the\tCode and  that the  magistrate could\ndischarge them\tif he  found the charge to be groundless and\nat the\tsame time  it has  itself returned  the finding that\nthere are  sufficient grounds  for  proceeding\tagainst\t the\nappellants.  if we now refer to the facts of the case before\nus it  is clear\t to us that not only that allegation against\nthe appellants\tmake out  any  case  for  an  offence  under\nSection 7 of the Act and also that there is no basis for the\ncomplainant to make such allegation.  The allegations in the\ncomplaint merely  show that  the appellants have given their\nbrand name  to \"Residency  Foods  and  Beverages  Ltd.\"\t for\nbottling the  beverage \"Lehar Pepsi\". The complaint does not\nshoe what  is the  role of the appellants in the manufacture\nof the\tbeverage which\tis said to be adulterated.  The only\nallegation is  that the\t appellants are\t the manufacturer of\nbottle.\t  There is  no averment\t as to\thow the\t complainant\ncould say  so and  also if  the appellants  manufactured the\nalleged bottle\tor its\tcontents.   His sole  information is\nfrom A.K.  Jain\t who  is  impleaded  as\t accused  No.3.\t The\npreliminary evidence  on which\tthe 1st respondent relied in\nissuing summon\tto the\tappellants also\t does not show as to\nhow it\tcould be  said that the appellants are manufacturers\nof either  the bottle  or the  beverage or  both.   There is\nanother aspect of the matter.  The Central Government in the\nexercise of  their powers  under Section  3 of the Essential\nCommodities Act,  1955 made  the Fruit\tProducts Order, 1955\n(for short,  the \"Fruit Order\"), It is not disputed that the\nbeverage in  the question  is a\t \"fruit product\"  within the\nmeaning of clause (2)(b) of the Fruit Order and that for the\nmanufacture thereof  certain licence is required.  The fruit\nOrder defines  the manufacturer and also sets out as to what\nthe  manufacturer  is  required\t to  do\t in  regard  to\t the\npackaging,  making  and\t labeling  of  containers  of  fruit\nproducts.   One of such requirement is that when a bottle is\nused in\t packing any  fruit products,  it shall be so sealed\nthat it\t cannot be  opened without  destroying\tthe  licence\nnumber\tand   the  special   identification  mark   of\t the\nmanufacture to\tbe displayed  on the  top  or  neck  of\t the\nbottle.\t  The licence  number of  manufacturer shall also be\nexhibited prominently  on the  side  label  on\tsuch  bottle\n[clause (8)(1)(b)].   Admittedly,  the\tname  of  the  first\nappellant is  not mentioned as a manufacturer on the top cap\nof the\tbottle.\t  It is\t not necessary to refer in detail to\nother requirements  of the  Fruit Order and the consequences\nof infringement of the Order and to the penalty to which the\nmanufacturer would  be exposed\tunder the  provisions of the\nEssential Commodities Act, 1955.  We may, however, note that\nin The\tHamdard Dawakhana  (WAKF) Delhi & Anr. vs. The Union\nof India  & Ors.  [AIR 1965  SC 1167 = (1965) 2 SCR 192], an\nargument was raised that the Fruit Order was invalid because\nits provision  indicated that  it was  an Order\t which could\nhave been  appropriately issued under the Prevention of Food\nAdulteration Act,  1954.  This Court negatived this plea and\nsaid that  the Fruit  Order was\t validly  issued  under\t the\nEssential Commodities Act.  What we find in the present case\nis  that  there\t was  nothing  on  record  to  show  if\t the\nappellants held\t the licence  for  the\tmanufacture  of\t the\noffending  beverage  and  if,  as  noted  above,  the  first\nappellant was the manufacturer thereof.\n",
        "p_31": "     It is  no comfortable  thought for the appellants to be\ntold that  they could  appear before the court which is at a\nfar off place in the Ghazipur in the State of Uttar Pradesh,\nseek   their release  on bail  and then\t to either  move  an\napplication under  Section 245(2)  of the  Code or  to\tface\ntrial  when  the  complaint  and  the  preliminary  evidence\nrecorded makes out no case against the.\t it is certainly one\nof those cases where there is an abuse of the process of the\nlaw and\t the courts and the High Court should not have shied\naway in\t exercising its jurisdiction. Provisions of Articles\n226 and\t 227 of the Constitution and Section 482 of the Code\nare devised  to advance justice and not to frustrate it.  In\nour view  High Court  should not  have adopted\tsuch a rigid\napproach which\tcertainly has  led to miscarriage of justice\nin the\tcase.  Power of judicial review is discretionary but\nthis was  a case  where the High Court should have exercised\nit.\n",
        "p_32": "     We, therefore,  allow this\t appeal, set aside the order\nof the\tHigh Court  and quash  the complaint  and proceeding\nagainst the appellants.\n"

        "p_2": " (1) On 23.2.95 the plaint in the suit was presented praying for the following reliefs :-    \"(A)For permanent injunction restraining the defendant themselves, their servants, their dealers, stockists, agents, shopkeepers and all other persons on their behalf from using the trade mark Borosil in respect of Mixer-cum-grinder, Juicer, Food Processor and Washing Machine and other allied and cognate goods and thereby passing off and enabling others to pass off their goods as the goods of the plaintiff. (b) For permanent injunction restraining the defendants themselves, their servants, dealers, stockists, agents, shopkeepers and all other persons on their behalf from using of the trading style Borosil Appliances in respect of their business by manufacturing Mixer-cum-grinder, Juicer, Food Processor and washing machine or any other cognate and allied goods by passing their trading style as that of the plaintiff's trade mark and corporate name or by using of any other trade mark which is identical or deceptively similar with the trade mark Borosil of the plaintiff. (c) For delivery upon affidavit by the defendants to the plaintiff of the impugned trade mark Borosil and Borosil Appliances, plates, blocks, stationery, advertising and printing material for purposes of destruction and/or obliteration as the case may he. (d) For rendition of accounts into the profits earned by the defendant in respect of the sale of their goods under the trade mark Borosil as well as trading style Borosil Appliances during the last three years and for a decree of the amount so found due. (e) For costs of the suit.\"   \n",
        "p_3": " (2) The case of the plaintiff briefly is as follows : The plaintiff has been carrying on business under the trade mark Borosil since 14th December, 1962. The mark is registered under the Trade Marks Act, 1958 in the following manner :-   \"Trade Mark No. Class Goods 427793 21 Small domestic utensils and containers (not of precious metals or coated there with) glass ware - porcelain and earthen ware not included in other closes. 427792 16 Paper and paper articles including filter paper. 427789 9 Scientific, electrical apparatus and instrument teaching apparatus. 427790 10 Surgical and Medical Instruments & apparatus. 427791 11 Installations and parts thereof for lighting, heating, steam generating and cooking.\"  \n",
        "p_4": "It is stated by the plaintiff in paragraph 11 that the plaintiff is an expanding company and it is planning to enter cognate and consumer products in respect of various household utensils, electrical goods, Mixer-cum-grinder, thermoware, ovens etc. It is asserted by the plaintiff that the trade name Borosil and the corporate name Borosil in India as well as abroad denote the goods coming from the house of the plaintiff. The plaintiff in or about May 1992 came to know about the user of the trade mark by the defendants and on 28th May 1992 a notice was issued by M/s. Crawford Bayley & Co. to the defendants. There is no reply. On 4.4.94 another notice was issued calling upon the defendants to discontinue the trade mark Borosil in respect of kitchenware and other goods and also use of the name Borosil. By reply dated 27th April, 1994 the defendants admitted use of the trade mark Borosil in respect of Mixer-cum-grinder, Juicer and washing machine but the defendants gave justification for use of the name. By reply dated 11.6.94 the plaintiff wrote back to the defendants in answer to then letter dated 27.4.94. On 30.6.94 the defendants sent an undertaking which was not acceptable to the plaintiff as the defendants did not agree to stop the user of the trade mark BOROSIL. Again on 24th August, 1994 the plaintiff sent a reply informing the defendants that they shall not use the trade mark Borosil with respect to Mixer-cum-grinder, Juicer and Food Processor and washing machine. By letter dated 16.9.94 the defendants agreed to change the name of the company Borosil Appliances and they kept on using the trade name Borosil in respect of the Mixer-cum-grinder, Juicer, Food Processor and Washing Machine.   \n",
        "p_5": "(3) The user of the trade mark by the defendant is not lawful and they arc purposely trading on the name of the plaintiff's trade mark. The goods sold by the plaintiff and the defendants belong to the same class and their use in the kitchens and, therefore, the general public would be greatly affected by the deceptive similarity which would effect the business of the plaintiff The defendants being a competitor of the plaintiff are fully aware of goodwill and the name of the trade mark Borosil of the plaintiff and the conduct of the defendants is deliberate and with main fide intentions they are passing off their goods as the goods of the plaintiff. The defendants have already made huge and illegal profits by using the name of the plaintiff. On these allegations, the plaintiff has come forward with the reliefs adverted to above.   \n",
        "p_6": "(4) On 8th March, 1995 the defendants have filed the written statement contending inter-alia that the plaintiff is not a proprietor of the trade mark Borosil in respect of Mixers-cum-grinders, Juicers, Food Processors and Washing Machines falling in Class 7 of the Fourth Schedule of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958, the plaintiff never used the trade mark Horosil in respect of the aforementioned goods and since April 1991 the defendants have been using the trade mark and after the ad-interim injunction, passed by this Court on 24.2.95 the defendants are not using the trade mark; the defendants have already applied for registration under Application No. 545313 and same is pending registration. The word Borosil is not an invented word and different companies have been using the trade mark Borosil and in particular the trade mark Borosil is being used by M/s. East end Pharmaceuticals Private Limited, 34 Industrial Colony, Naini, Allahabad (U.P.) in respect of soaps, perfumery, hair oil, cosmetics and toilet preparations and the said party applied for registration in Application No. 483917 and the same has been advertised in the Trade Mark Journal No. 1060 dated 1.8.1993 at page 395. The said party has also applied for registration under Application No. 373918 in respect of ointment in Class 5. The defendants denied the user of the trade mark by the plaintiff since December 1962 and the plaintiff cannot claim any exclusive right in the trade mark. It may be noticed that in the written statement no particular reason is given by the defendants as to how the defendants came to use this trade mark BOROSIL. The defendants have also stated that the plaintiff has known the defendants using the trade mark and has stood by it. At page 13A the defendants have given their sales figures, which are is under :-    \"YEAR Amount in Rs. 1991-92 59,905.00 1992-93 84,867.58 1993-94 2,37,578.84 1994-95 (up to 28.2.95) 4,42,308.00\"  \n",
        "p_7": "The plaintiff has filed the replication to the written statement traversing the allegations therein. I do not want to repeat the averments in the petition for injunction, the reply and the rejoinder.   \n",
        "p_8": "(5) The plaintiff has filed documents showing the models of the plaintiff by way of photographs and the defendants have also produced few documents. The plaintiff claims that the defendants with a view to trading upon the plaintiff's reputation have adopted the mark which is identical to that of the plaintiff. The learned Counsel for the plaintiff referred to a number of cases. In the case of Joseph Rodgers & Sons Ltd. v. W.N. Rodgers & Co., (1924) 41 Rpc 277 Justice Rosser observed :-    \"IT is the law of this land that no man is entitled to any on its business in such a way as to represent that it is the business of another or is in any way connected with the business of another; that is the first proposition. The second proposition is that no man is entitled so to describe or mark his goods so as to represent that the goods are the goods, of another. To the first proposition there is, I must think an exception; a man, in my opinion, is entitled to carry on his business in his own name so long as he does not do anything more than to cause confusion with the business of another and so long as he does it honestly. To the second rule to which I have referred there is no exception at all; that is that a man is not entitled so to describe his goods has to lead to be belief that they are the goods of somebody else.\"  \n",

        "p_10": "(6) Lord Morris opened his speech for the House of Lords in the case of Parker Knoll Limited v. Knoll International Limited, 1962 R.PC. 265 as under :-    \"IN the interests of fair trading and in the interests of all who may wish to buy or to sell goods the law recognises that certain limitations upon freedom of action are necessary desirable. In some situations the law has had to resolve what might at first appear to be conflicts between competing rights. In solving the problems which have arisen there has been no need to resort to any abstruse principles but rather, I think, to the straight forward principle that trending must not only be honest but must not even unintentionally be unfair. \"  \n",
        "p_11": "(14) In Bajaj Electricals Limited, Bombay v. Metals & Allied Products, Bombay and Another,  a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court had occasion to deal with a case where the defendant carried on business using the name of Bajaj of the reputed Bajaj Electricals. The plaintiff prayed for an injunction restraining the defendant from in any manner using in relation to domestic appliances and kitchen utensils and appliances and wares using the mark Bajaj or any other mark deceptively similar to the plaintiff's registered mark. After considering all the facts, the Division Bench reversing the judgment of the learned Single Judge granted injunction restraining the defendant from in any manner using the mark Bajaj.   \n",
        "p_12": "(15) In Tata iron & Steel Co. Ltd. v. Mahavir Steels & Others,  the plaintiff Tata Iron & Steel Co. Ltd sought for an injunction restraining the defendant from selling or offering for sale and from using in any manner whatsoever the trade mark Tisco or FISCO. At page 417 the learned Single judge discussed the matter, with great respect, in a very interesting fashion and the same is relevant and runs as follows :-    \"THE next question is whether the defendants should be allowed to use trade mark 'FISCO' at this stage in relation to channels which are being manufactured by it. 'TISCO' and 'FISCO' a re, prima fade, too close phonetically. The plaintiff has been carrying on its business under the trade name TISCO' for a period of 80 years. The trade mark is registered in favor of the plaintiff. It is the owner and proprietor of the said trade mark. The difendants' trade name is deceptively similar to the plaintiff's trade mark. Learned Counsel for the defendants, however, submitted that the trademark of the plaintiff is different from the trade mark of the defendants. He submitted that the most important letter in the mark employed by the defendants is \"F\" which distinguishes the trade mark of the defendants from that of the plaintiff. I am afraid I can not accept the submission of the learned Counsel for the defendants. As is self evident, there is a very little difference between the trade marks 'FISCO' and 'TISCO'. In a dispute, like the present one although the Court is primarily concerned with the rights and obligations of the parties before it nevertheless the Court is also required to protect the interests of the nameless and face less consumers. The Court has to view the affect of a trade mark on the buyer. The purchaser can be easily misled by phonetic similarity of trade marks. Aping of Trade mark cannot be allowed as it confuses and deceives the consumer. It, prima facie, seems to me that defendants 2 to 5 by use of the trade name Fisco have infringed the registered trade mark of the plaintiff. Even a literate purchaser can be taken in by the offending trademark and can be led to believe that he is buying the product of the plaintiff when actually he would be purchasing the product of the defendants. There is also no denying that large number of people in our country are illiterate who can be the victims of imitation. Fake easily passes as real. Learned Counsel for the defendants failed to give any explanation as to why the defendants were using the suffix TSCO' with letter \"F\". On the other hand in the plaint it has been explained as to why the plaintiff was using TISCO' as its trade mark. A look at the name of the defendant No. 2, which is Ispat Udyog shows that it bears no similarity, proximity, affinity and resemblance with the trade name of its product. In these circumstances can it be a honest use of the trade mark Fisco by the defendants? Can it be said that there is an innocent or accidental resemblance between the trade mark of the defendant No. 2 with that of the plaintiff and the former has not deceptively copied the trade mark of the latter in its essential features, namely, TSCO'. Defendants have given no explanation on these questions. Their pleadings say nothing except citing the example of few others who are also similarly using trade names having suffix TSCO' in conjunction with one letter prefix in connection with their goods. An imitation remains an imitation whether it is done by one or by many. It acquires no legitimacy. A wrong is not righted by the following it musters. Infringement of trade mark by a trader cannot be justified on the ground that there are others like him who are doing the same. There is a growing tendency to copy the trade marks to cash upon some one else's business reputation. The pirates of trade marks are like parasites clinging to others for their growth. Imitators of trade marks have the sole object of diverting the business of others. The tendency must be curbed in the interest of the trade' and the consumers.\"  \n",

Therefore, I do not want to deal with it in detail.   \n",
        "p_16": "(18) In Mis. Hindustan Pencils Pvt. Ltd. v. Mis. India Stationery Products Co. and Another, ; Kirpal, J (As His Lordship then was) considered the use of the mark Natraj by the defendants, the mark belonging to the plaintiff. The learned Judge found on a prima facie consideration of the material that the mark used by the defendant is similar and there is a clear breach of the plaintiff's right under Section 20 of the Trade Marks Act, 1958. The learned Judge granted injunction restraining the defendant from using the defendant offending mark Natraj, which is an infringement on the plaintiff's registered trade mark.   \n",
        "p_17": "(19) The learned Counsel for the plaintiff also referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in Mis. Power Control Appliances & Others v. M/s. Sumeet Machines Pvt. Ltd., . The facts of the judgment of the Supreme Court are different and the decision is not of any assistance in this case.   \n",
        "p_18": "(20) The learned Counsel for the plaintiff referred to the decision of the Chancery Division reported in Lego System Aktieselskab and Another v. Lego M. Lemelstrich Ltd., 1983 Fleet Street Reports 155. This is also a case where the matter was dealt with after full trial and I do not want to refer to it at all as the ratio laid down therein has no bearing on the issue in this casr.   \n",
        "p_19": "(21) The learned Counsel for the defendants referred to Nestle's Products Ltd. and Others v. Mis. Milk made Corporation and Another, . The facts of the case are entirely different and that case does not help the defendants in any way.   \n",
        "p_20": "(22) In my view, the defendants are not carrying on their trade in the name of Borosil but using the mark to sell their goods taking advantage of the reputation of the plaintiff. From a perusal of the documents and the correspondence one would get the impress ion that the intention on the part of the defi.-ndants to deceive, is very apparent and clear.   \n",
        "p_21": "(23) The contention of the learned Counsel for the defendants is that the goods manufactured by the plaintiff and the defendants are different and hence the apprehension of the plaintiff that the use of the mark Borosil by the defendants is likely to cause confusion in the minds of the buyers is unfounded is not acceptable. The articles manufactured by the plaintiff and the defendants are kitchen wares and are generally and commonly used by every family having a meagre income and, in particular, by families where both the husband and wife arc employed. I am unable to resist the conclusion that the defendants are intentionally and dishonestly are trying to pass off their goods by the use of the name Borosil. It is also patent from the facts that user of the name by the defendants is a calculated attempt to lull a buyer into an impression that the article sold was that of the plaintiff. A buyer not very much alert and intelligent would be guided by the word 'Borosil' and what would attract him immediately is the word Borosil and eves would be glued only to the word Borosil. Following the Supreme Court this Court posited in Mis. Atlas Cycle Industries Ltd. v .Ceylon Cycles Ltd., I.L.R. 1973 (1) Delhi 398 in the following terms:--    \"IN an action for passing off the test for deceptively -Similarity i.e. as to the likelihood of confusion or deceptively raising very similarity of the marks is practically the same as in an action for infringement except that it has to be seen whether the defendant's are get up, talking etc. of his goods as besides the essential features of the plaintiff's mark or goods any additional features which distinguishes it from the plaintiff's mark or goods.\"  \n",
        "p_22": "(24) In the instant case before me, there is some difference in the shade of the colours and the get up showing in the advertisements but the word Borosil used as the trade mark is the same as used by the plaintiff and the word Borosil is seen strikingly similar and strongly pronounced and the likelihood of a buyer of an average intelligence and imperfect memory or recollection being misled easily be assumed. As pointed out by the Bombay High Court in 1988 Iplr 135 (supra) the defendants are entitled to explain how the mark was invented by them. At this juncture, the observation by the Court in 63 Rpc 171 (supra) at page 181 is relevant and the same is as follows :-    \"BEFORE doing so, however, I should, I think, say that in my judgment the circumstances which attend the adoption of a trade mark in the first instance are of considerable importance when one comes to consider whether the use of that mark has or has not been a honest user. If the user in its inception was tainted it would be difficult in most cases to purify it subsequently.\"  \n",
        "p_23": "(25) The balance of convenience is in favor of the plaintiff. Damages cannot be an adequate remedy for the plaintiff. The defendants are not prevented from selling their products in any other trade name but they are injuncted from using the name Borosil. In my view, the defendants cannot be permitted to use trade mark Borosil. Therefore, pending the suit injunction is granted restraining the defendant by themselves, their servants, agents, dealers, shopkeepers, representatives, stockists and all other persons acting for and on their behalf from manufacturing and selling the Mixer-cum-grinder, Juicer, Food Processors and Wash ing Machine and all other allied and cognate goods bearing the trade mark Borosi I as well as from using the mark Borosil in respect of their trade name/trading style thereby passing off their goods as the goods of the plaintiffs or from using the said trade name which is identical or deceptively similar with the trade marl- and trade name of the plaintiff. 1.A. 1690/95 is allowed. Consequently, IAs. 2303/95 and 4967/95, filed by the defendants under Order 39 Rule 4 Civil Procedure Code ., are dismissed There shall be no order as to costs. \n"

Hal-diram\nBhujiawala and Sri Ashok Kumar against the judgment of the Delhi High Court\nin FAO 365 of 1999 dated 30.11.1999. By that order the High Court summarily\ndismissed the appellants' appeal against the order of the learned Single\nJudge dated 2.11.1999 in IA 5996/99 in Suit No. 635/92. The IA was filed\nunder Order 7 Rule 11 CPC by the appellants for rejection of the plaint\nfiled by two plaintiffs, Anand Kumar Deepak Kumar trading as Haldiram\nBhujiawala and Shiv Kishan Agarwal, - on the ground that the 1st plaintiff\nwas a partnership not registered with the Registrar of Firms on the date of\nsuit i.e. on 10.12.91 and that the subsequent registration of the firm on\n29.5.92 would not cure the initial defect.\n",
        "p_2": "The suit was filed by the plaintiff (1) for permanent injunction\nrestraining the defendants - appellants, their partners, servants etc. from\ninfringing the trade-mark No. 285062 and from using the trademark/name\n'HALDIRAM BHUJIA WALA' or any identical name/mark deceptively similar\nthereto (2) for damages in a sum of Rs. 6 lakhs and (3) for destruction of\nthe material etc.\n\nAs we are dealing with a matter arising under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC, it will\nbe necessary to refer to the plaint allegations. One Ganga Ram alias\nHaldiram, carried on business in the name Maldiram Bhujia Wala, since 1941.\nIn 1965, he constituted a partnership with his two sons Moolchand, Shiv\nKishan and his daughter-in-law Kamla Devi, (wife of another son R.L.\nAggarwal) to carry on business under the same name. In December 1972, the\nsaid firm applied for registration before the Registrar of Trade Marks for\nregistration of the name Haldiram Bhujia Wala - Chand Mal - Ganga Bishan\nBhujiawala, Bikaner. The Registrar of Trade Marks granted registration with\nthe No. 285062. On 16.11.1974, the partnership was dissolved and under the\nterms of the dissolution deed the above trade mark fell exclusively to the\nshare of Mool Chand. son of Ganga Bishan and father of plaintiffs, for the\nwhole country (except West Bengal). Thus Sri Mool Chand became sole\nproprietor of the trade-mark in the said area while Smt. Kamla Devi was\ngiven ownership of the trade-mark rights for West Bengal. It is stated that\nSri Lala Ganga Bishan Haldi Ram executed his last will dated 3.4.1979 and\nalso reiterated the rights conferred by the dissolution deed on the\nrespective parties. Ganga Bishan died in 1980. His will was later acted\nupon. Later, the testator's son, Sri Moolchand too died in 1985 leaving\nbeing his lour sons, Shiv Kishan, Shiv Kishan, Manohar Lal and Madhusoodan.\nAll of them got their names recorded as subsequent -joint proprietors. The\nlatter three formed a partnership in 1983 and were running a shop in\nChandni Chowk, New Delhi selling various goods under the abovesaid trade\nmark of Haldiram Bhujia Wala. In the meantime, on 10.10.77, Mool Chand's\nbrother Sri R.L. Aggarwal (husband of Kamla Devi) and his son Prabhu\nShankar, Calcutta applied for registration in this very name at Calcutta\nclaiming to be full owners of the said trade mark without disclosing the\ndissolution deed dated 16.11.74. When the Registrar objected on 14.4.78,\nthey replied on 18.7.78 that they alone were trading in this name in\nCalcutta. The defendants have no right to use the said trade beyond\nCalcutta. The plaintiff s registered trade mark was, in the usual course,\nrenewed on 29.12.86 till 28.12.93. The plaintiffs have also acquired a\nright on account of prior adoption and long user The 1st plaintiff firm,\nconsisting of three sons of Moolchand and the 2nd plaintiff (the fourth son\nof Moolchand) are joint owners of the trade mark (except in West Bengal).\nThe 1st defendant firm is a namely constituted firm intending to start its\nbusiness and has been formed by Ashok Kumar, son of Kamla Devi. The 2nd\ndefendant is Ashok Kumar himself in his individual capacity. They have no\nright to use this trade mark outside West Bengal. The plaintiffs came to\nknow of the violation of trade mark by defendants 1 and 2 in December 1991\nwhen defendants opened a shop at Arya Samaj Road, Karol Bagh, New Delhi.\nThe cause of action for the suit is the fact that defendant acted :\n",
        "p_3": "'\"in violation of the common law and contractual rights of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_4": "On these grounds, defendants are to be restrained by permanent injunction\nfrom using the trade mark and a sum of Rs. 6 lakhs is payable as damages.\n",
        "p_5": "The defendants, as already stated, have filed the application under Order\n7, Rule 11, CPC pleading Section 69(2) of the Partnership Act, 1932 as a\nbar to maintainability of the suit. The learned Single Judge dismissed the\napplication after referring to M/s. Virendra Dressers Delhi v. M/.v.\nVarinder Garments, AIR (1982) Delhi 482 and to M/s. Bestochem For-malities\nv. M/s. Dinesh Ayurvedic Agencies and Ors., RFA (OS) 17/99 dated 12.7.99\nrendered by the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court on the ground that\nthe right to injunct the defendants in respect of the plaintiffs' Trade\nMark was based on principles applicable to a passing off action and the\nsaid right was a common law right and did not arise under any contract. The\nlearned Judge also relied upon a judgment to this Court in M/.s. Raptakos\nBrett & Co. Ltd. v. Ganesh Property, [1998] 7 SCC 184. The application\nunder Order 7, Rule 11, CPC was dismissed by an order dated 2.11.99. This\norder was confirmed by a Division Bench of the Delhi High Court on\n30.11.99, as already stated.\n",
        "p_6": "In this appeal, learned senior counsel for appellants, Sri Ashok Desai and\nSri R.F. Nariman contended that the 1st plaintiff firm was not registered\nwith the Registrar of Firms on the date of suit, that the plaint repeatedly\nreferred to the proprietary right of late Moolchand as having arisen out\nthe dissolution deed dated 16.11.1974 and that without reference to the\nsaid document - which was a contact - the plaintiffs could not prove their\nright to the trade mark through Moolchand and the suit was barred since\nSection 69(2) referred to a right \"arising from a contract'. The plaintiffs\nright was based on the contract dated 16.11.74. The words 'arising from a\ncontract' were akin to the words 'arising out of a contract' used in Ruby\nGeneral Insurance Co. Ltd. v Pearey Lal Kumar and Anr, [1952] SCR 501\nwherein while construing those words in relation to an arbitration clause,\nthis Court held that the said words held to be construed widely. The\nlearned counsel contended that, on the facts of this case and as stated in\nthe plaint at several places, the 1st plaintiff was compelled to rely on\nthe contract of dissolution dated 16. 11.74 to prove title to the trade\nmark and thereby for an injunction and hence it was not a right claimed\nunder Common Law or under any statute, like the Trade Marks Act.\n",
        "p_7": "On the other hand, learned senior counsel lor the respondents -plaintiffs,\nSri Copal Subramanium supported the view of the High Court by contending\nthat the suit for injunction was based upon two rights, one being statutory\nunder the Trade Marks Act arising out of prior registration of trade mark\nand alternatively, the suit was also based on Common Law right available in\na passing-off action. The suit was not based on any contract between\nplaintiffs and defendants. The provision in Section 69(2) did not apply if\nthe right sought to be enforced did not arise out of a contract between the\nplaintiffs' firm and the defendants. The reference in the plaint to the\ndissolution deed dated 16.11.74 was merely a reference to a historical fact\nthat that was the source of the right of Moolchand and on his death, the\nsaid right to the trade mark devolved on his sons, three of whom are joined\nin a firm (i.e. 1st plaintiff) and the fourth son is the second plaintiff.\nThe plaintiffs were not parties to (he deed of dissolution. The defendants\ntoo were not parties to the dissolution deed though their mother was.\nHence, the bar under Section 69(2) did not apply.\n",
        "p_8": "The points that arise for consideration are :\n",
        "p_9": "(i) whether Section 69(2) bars a suit by a firm not registered on the date\nof suit where permanent injunction and damages are claimed in respect of a\ntrade marks as a statutory right or by invoking Common Law principles\napplicable to a passing-off action?\n",
        "p_10": "(ii) whether the words 'arising from a contract' in Section 69(2) refer\nonly to a situation where an unregistered firm is enforcing a right arising\nfrom a contract entered into by the firm with the defendant during the\ncourse of its business or whether the bar under Section 69(2) can be\nextended to any contract referred to in the plaint unconnected with the\ndefendant, as the source of title to the suit property?\n",
        "p_11": "Point 1 :\n",
        "p_12": "The question whether Section 69(2) is a bar to a suit filed by an\nunregistered firm even if a statutory right is being enforced or even if\nonly a Common Law right is being enforce came up directly for consideration\nin this Court in M/s. Raptokas Brett Co. Ltd. v. Ganesh Property, [1998] 7\nSCC 184. In that case, Majmudar, J. speaking for the Bench clearly\nexpressed the view that Section 69(2) cannot bar the enforcement by way of\nsuit by an unregistered firm in respect of a statutory right or a common\nlaw right. On the facts of that case, it was held that the right to evict a\ntenant upon expiry of the lease was not a right 'arising from a contract'\nbut was a common law right or a statutory right under the Transfer of\nProperty Act. The fact that the plaint in that case referred to a lease and\nto its expiry, made no difference. Hence, the said suit was held not\nbarred. It appears to us that in that case the reference to the lease in\nthe plaint was obviously treated as a historical fact. That case is\ntherefore directly in point. Following the said judgment, it must be held\nin the present case too that a suit is not barred by Section 69(2) if a\nstatutory right or a common law right is being enforced.\n",
        "p_13": "The next question is as to the nature of the right that is being enforced\nin this suit. It is well settled that a passing off action is a common law\naction based on tort (vide) Bengal Waterproof Ltd. v. Bombay Waterproof\nManufacturing Company and Anr., [1997] 1 SCC99. Therefore, in our opinion,\na suit for perpetual injunction to restrain the defendant not to pass-off\nthe defendant's goods as those of plaints by using the plaintiffs' trade\nmark and for damages is an action at common law and is not barred by\nSection 69(2). The decision in M/s. Virendra Dresses Delhi v. M/s. Varinder\nGarments, AIR (1983) Delhi 482 and the decision of the Division Bench of\nthe Delhi High Court in M/s. Bestochem Formulation v. M/s. Dinesh Ayurvedic\nAgencies and Ors., RFA (OS) 17/99 dt. 12.7.99) state that Section 69(2)\ndoes not apply to a passing-off action as the suit is based on tort and not\non contract. In our opinion, the above decisions were correctly decided.\n(The special leave petition No. 18418 of 1999 against the latter was in\nfact dismissed by this Court on 28.1.2000.) The learned senior counsel for\nthe appellants no doubt relied upon Ruby General Insurance Co. Ltd. v.\nPearey Lal Kumar and Anr., [1952] SCR 501. That was an arbitration case in\nwhich the words \"arising out of a contract\" were widely interpreted but\nthat decision, in our view, has no relevance in interpreting the words\n\"arising from a contract\" in section 69(2) of the Partnership Act.\n",
        "p_14": "Likewise, if the reliefs of permanent injunction or damages are being\nclaimed on the basis of a registered trade mark and its infringement, the\nsuit is to be treated as one based on a statutory right under the Trade\nMarks Act and is, in our view, not barred by Section 69(2).\n",
        "p_15": "For the aforesaid reasons. In both these situations, the unregistered\npartnership in the case before us cannot be said to be enforcing any right\n\"arising from a contract\". Point 1 is therefore decided in favour of the\nplaintiffs-respondents.\n",
        "p_16": "Point 2 :\n",
        "p_17": "Question however arises as to what is the scope of the words 'enforc-ing a\nright arising under the contract' used in Section 69(2)? Learned senior\ncounsel for the appellants repeatedly drew our attention to the allegation\nin the plaint at various places that it was only under the deed of\ndissolution dated 16.11.1974 that Moolchand, - the father of the partners\nof the 1st plaintiff firm and the 2nd plaintiff - became proprietor of the\ntrade mark lor the whole of India (except West Bengal). That right develop\non the plaintiffs on the death of Moolchand. Therefore, it was contended\nthat the 1st plaintiff firm was definitely seeking to enforce a right\n\"arising from a contract\", namely, the contract of dissolution dated\n16.11.74. It was argued that the 1st plaintiff could not claim any\ninjunction or damages unless reliance was placed on the said contract and\nhence the suit was barred by Section 69(2).\n",
        "p_18": "For the purpose of deciding this point, it is necessary to go into the\nquestion as to what the legislature meant when it used the words 'arising\nfrom a contract' in Section 69(2).\n",
        "p_19": "In our view, it will be useful in this context to refer to the Report of\nthe Special Committee (1930 -31) which examined the draft Bill and made\nrecommendations to the legislature.\n",
        "p_20": "Before going into the above Report of the Special Committee which preceded\nthe Partnership Act, 1932, it will be necessary to refer to the case in\nCommissioner of Income Tax, AP v. Jayalakshmi Rice and Oil Mills Contractor\nCo., [1971] 1 SCC 280, where this Court refused to refer to this very\nReport for construing Section 59 of the Partnership Act. But, in our view,\nthat decision is no longer good law as it was clearly dissented on this\naspect in the judgment of the Constitution Bench in R.S. Nayak v. A.R.\nAntulay, [1984] 2 SCC 183. In number of later judgments, this Court has\nreferred to the Reports of similar Committees or Commissions (vide G.P.\nSingh's Interpretation of Statute, 7th Ed, pp. 196-197). In the latest case\nin Hyderabad Industries Ltd. v. Union of India, [1995] 5 SCC 15 para 15,\nnotes on clauses were relied upon by the Constitution Bench for\nunderstanding the legislative intent. The English Law has changed\ncompletely after Pepper v. Hart, (1993) 1 All ER 42 (HL) in favour of\nadmissibility of such material. A restricted view was no doubt expressed in\nP.V. Narasimharao v. State, in [1998] 4 SCC 626 (at. 691-692) that such\nReports can be looked into for the purpose of knowing the historical basis\nor mischief sought to be remedied, but not for construing the provision\nunless there is ambiguity. Even going by this restricted view, we find that\nthere is considerable ambiguity in Section 69(2) (unlike the English\nStatute of 1916 and 1985) as to what is meant by the words 'arising out of\na contract' inasmuch as the provision does not say whether the contract in\nSection 69(2) is one entered into by the firm with the defendant or with\nsomebody else who is not a defendant, nor to whether it is a contract\nentered into with the defendant in business or unconnected with business.\nHence, in our view, it is permis-sible to look into the Report even for\npurpose of construing Section 69(2).\n",
        "p_21": "We may state that it was on the basis of the Report of the Special\nCommittee that the Partnership Act, 1932 was later passed by the Legisla-\nture. The Committee consisted of Sir Brojendra Lal Mitter, Sir Dinshah F.\nMulla, Sir Alladi Krishnaswamy Iyer and Mr. Arthur Eggar. Para 16 of the\nReport states that the 'Bill seeks to overcome this class of difficulty by\nmaking registration optional, and by creating inducements to register which\nwill only bear upon firms in a substantial and fairly permanent way of\nbusiness. Paras 17, 18 and 19 of the Report are important. (See Mulla,\nPartnership Act, 1st Ed. 1934, p. 167 at PP.176-177). Para 17 reads :\n",
        "p_22": "\"17. The outlines of the scheme are briefly as follows. The English\nprecedent, in so far as it makes registration compulsory and imposes a\npenalty for non-registration has not been followed, as it is considered\nthat this step would be too drastic for a beginning in India, and would\nintroduce all the difficulties connected with small or ephemeral\nundertakings. Instead, it is proposed that registration should lie entirely\nwithin the discretion of the firm or partner concerned; but, following the\nEnglish precedent, any firm which is not registered will be unable to\nenforce its claim against third parties in the civil Court; and by partner\nwho is not registered will be unable to enforce his claims either against\nthird parties or against fellow partners\".\n",
        "p_23": "It will be noticed that the above extract refers to the English precedent\nwhich is partly not followed and which is partly followed. We shall be\nreferring to the said English precedent shortly but before we do so, we\nhave also to refer to paras 18 and 19 of the said Report.\n",
        "p_24": "The Report states in para 18, 19 and follows :\n",
        "p_25": "\"18. Once registration has been effected the statement recorded in the\nregister regarding the constitution of the firm will be con-clusive proof\nof the facts therein contained against the partners making them and no\npartner whose name is on the register will be permitted to deny that he is\na partner - with certain natural and proper exceptions which will be\nindicated later. This should afford a strong protection to persons dealing\nwith firms against false denials of partnership and the evasion of\nliability by the substantial members of a firm\".\n",
        "p_26": "19...............On the other hand, a third party who deals with a firm\n\nand knows that a new partner has been introduced can either make\nregistration of the new partner a condition fur further dealings, or\ncontent himself with the certain security of the other partners and the\nchance of proving by other evidence, the partnership of the new but\nunregistered partner. A third party who deals with a firm without knowing\nof the addition of a new partner courts on the credit of the old partners\nonly and will not be prejudiced by the failure of the new partners to\nregister\"\n",
        "p_27": "Similarly, para 23 also refers to those who deal with the firm.\n",
        "p_28": "The English precedent referred to in para 17, which has been not followed\nin part but followed in part in drafting Section 69(2) is the one contained\nby the Registration of Business Names Act. 1916. Section 7 of that Act\nrefers to penalties lor default in registration. As stated in the Report,\nthe penalty part of that Act has not been introduced in India but the\nprovisions of Section 8 creating disabilities in the way of the firm in\ndefault is adopted. Section S of the above English Act is relevant and it\nspeaks of:\n",
        "p_29": "\"the rights of that defaulter under or arising out of any contract made or\nentered into by or on behalf of such defaulter in relation to the business\nin respect to the carrying on of which particulars were required to be\nfurnished\" (See Halsbury Statutes, 3rd Ed. Vol.37, p.867).\n",
        "p_30": "The above provision clearly signifies that the right that is sought to be\nenforced by the unregistered firm and which is barred must be a right\narising out of a contract with a third party - defendant in respect of the\nfirm's business transactions.\n",
        "p_31": "Business Names Act, 1985 has replaced the above Act of 1916 and Section 4\nof the new Act refers to the \"Civil Remedies for breach of Section 4\". It\nprovides for dismissal of the action \"to enforce a right arising out of a\ncontract made in the course of a business\" if the firm is not registered.\n(see Halsbury, Statutes, 4th Ed, Vol. 48 at p.101).\n",
        "p_32": "The above Report and provisions of the English Acts, in our view, make it\nclear that the purpose behind Section 69(2) was to impose a disability on\nthe unregistered firm or its partners to enforce rights arising out of\ncontracts entered into by the plaintiff firm with third party - defendant\nin the course of the firm's business transactions.\n",
        "p_33": "In Raptokas Brett and Co., [1998] 7 SCC 184 it was clarified that the\ncontractual rights which are sought to be enforced by plaintiff firm and\nwhich are barred under section 69(2) are \"rights arising out of the\ncontract\" and that it must be a contract entered into by the firm with the\nthird party defendants. Majmudar, J. stated (at p.191) as follows :\n",
        "p_34": "\"A mere look at the aforesaid provision shows that the suit filed by an\nunregistered firm against a third party for enforcement of any right\narising from a contract with such a third party would be barred........\"\n",
        "p_35": "From the above passage it is firstly clear that contract must be a contract\nby the plaintiff firm not with anybody else but with the third party\ndefendant.\n",
        "p_36": "The further and additional but equally important aspect which has to be\nmade clear is that - the contract by the unregistered firm referred to in\nsection 69(2) must not only be one entered into by the firm with the third\nparty - defendant but must also be one entered into by the plaintiff firm\nin the course of the business dealing of the plaintiffs firm with such\nthird party - defendant.\n",
        "p_37": "It will also be seen that the present defendants who are sued by the\nplaintiff - firm are third parties to the 1st plaintiff firm. Section 2(d)\nof the Act defines 'third parties' as persons who are not partners of the\nfirm. The defendants in the present case are also third parties to the\ncontract of dissolution dated 16.11.74. Their mother, Kamla Devi was no\ndoubt a party to the contract of dissolution. The defendants are only\nclaiming a right said to have accrued to their mother under the said\ncontract dated 16.11.74 and then to the defendants. In fact, the said\ncontract of dissolution is not a contract to which even the present 1st\nplaintiff firm or its partners or the 2nd plaintiff were parties. Their\nfather Moolchand was a party and his right to the trade mark devolved in\nplaintiffs. The real crux of the question is that the legislature when it\nused the word \"arising out of a contract\" in Section 69(2), it is referring\nto a contract entered into in course of business transaction by the\nunregistered plaintiff firm with its customers - defen-dants and the idea\nis to protect those in commerce who deal with such a partnership firm in\nbusiness. Such third parties who deal with the partners ought to be enabled\nto know what the names of the firm are before they deal with them in\nbusiness.\n",
        "p_38": "Further Section 69(2) is not attracted to any and every contract referred\nto in the plaint as the source of title to an asset owned by the firm. If\nthe plaint referred to such a contract it could only be as a historical\nfact. For example, if the plaint filed by the unregistered firm refers to\nthe source of the firm's title to a motor car and states that the plaintiff\nhas purchased and received a Motor Car from a foreign buyer under a\ncontract and that the defendant has unauthorisedly removed it from the\nplaintiff firm's possession,  it is clear that the relief for possession\nagainst defendant in the suit does not arise from any contract with\ndefendant entered into in the course of plaintiff firm's business with\ndefendants but is based on the alleged unauthorised removal of the vehicle\nfrom the plaintiff firm's cus- tody by the defendant. In such a situation,\nthe fact that the unregistered firm has purchased the vehicle from somebody\nelse under a contract has absolutely no bearing on the right of the firm to\nsue the defendant for possession of the vehicle. Such a suit would be\nmaintainable and Section 69(2) would not be a bar, even if the firm is\nunregistered on the date of suit. The position in the present case is not\ndifferent.\n",
        "p_39": "In fact, the Act has not prescribed that the transactions or contracts\nentered into by a firm with a third party are bad in law if the firm is an\nunregistered firm. On the other hand, if the firm is not registered on date\nof suit and the suit is to enforce a right arising out of a contract with\nthe third party- defendant in the course of its business, then it will be\nopen to the plaintiff to seek withdrawal of the plaint with leave and file\na fresh suit after registration of the firm subject of course to the law of\nlimitation and subject to the provisions of the Limitation Act. This is so\neven if the suit is dismissed for a formal defect. Section 14 of the\nLimitation Act will be available inasmuch as the suit has failed because\nthe defect of non-registra-tion falls within the words \"other cause of like\nnature\" in section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963. See Surajmal Dagduramji\nShop v. M/s. Srikishan Ram Kishan, AIR (1973) Bom. 313.\n",
        "p_40": "For all the reasons given above, it is clear that the suit is based on\ninfringement of statutory rights under the Trade Marks Act. It is also\nbased upon the common law principle of tort applicable to passing-off\nactions. The suit is not for enforcement of any right arising out of a\ncontract entered into by or on behalf of the unregistered firm with third\nparties in the course of the firm's business transactions. The suit is\ntherefore not barred by section 69(2).\n",
        "p_41": "For the aforesaid reasons, the appeal fails and is dismissed without costs.\nWe should not be understood as having said anything on the merits of the\ncase for we have confined ourselves to the allegations in the plaint as we\nare here only dealing with an application filed by the appellants under\nOrder 7 Rule 11 CPC.\n"

The defendants have come to the market in 1996 with the mala fide and fraudulent intention of utilising the goodwill earned by the plaintiff. The mark LIV-T is deceptively similar with the mark Liv. 52 of the plaintiff and is likely to mislead or confuse those who are likely to purchase such preparations in the market. The plaintiff complains of infringement of its trade mark as also passing off by the defendants.  \n",
        "p_6": " 5. According to the defendants they are renowned manufacturers of Homoeopathic and Ayurvedic preparations. They have a collaboration with BIRON Lab of France from whom they have obtained the technical know-how for many of its Homoeopathic formulations. They obtained a drug licence to manufacture its LIV-T formulation in the year 1987. They also applied for registration of the trade mark LIV-T together with bits packaging carton in April, 1988. The application No. 490010 is pending with the Registrar of the Trade Marks. Ever since 1989 they have been marketing their preparations under their trade mark and figures of sales have risen from Rs. 96,843/- in the year 1988-89 to Rs. 46,68,614/- in 1995-96.  \n",

There are a good number of medicines already in the market associated with treatment of liver ailments/disorders using the word Liv as suggestive of liver and prefixing or suffixing words or figures so as to confer a distinction on the name associated with the manufacturer or trader. It is submitted by the defendant that mark Liv-T is neither similar to nor deceptive with the plaintiff's mark Liv-52. Such medicines cannot be manufactured without a drug licence nor sold in retail without any medical prescription. It is not likely that the prospective customer would be deceived or confused. The defendants have also pleaded as their defense the delay is bringing the action by the plaintiff.  \n",

It is not necessary to reproduce entire result of search. It would suffice to mention a few trade marks which are already in the market being used by several companies. LIV as an abbreviation of Liver is a generic term or a descriptive word - its use suggesting reference of the preparation to liver.

A trade mark is a mark used or proposed to be used in relation to goods for the purpose of indicating or so as to indicate a connection in the course of trade between the goods and some person having the right to use the mark. (Section 2(v)). A mark shall be deemed to be deceptively similar to another mark if it so nearly resembles that other mark as to be likely to deceive ar cause confusion. (Section 2(d)). Name includes any abbreviation of a name. (Section 2(k)). A mark the use of which would be likely to deceive or cause confusion is prohibited from being registered. (Section 11) Use of a trade mark which is identical with or deceptively similar to a registered trade mark amounts to infringement of trade mark. (Section 29). The statutory remedy of action for infringement does not take away the Common Law remedy of an action for passing off, which in substance is an action for deceit (Section 27).  \n",

Their Lordships have set out the distinction between action for passing off and action for infringement of a trade mark.

        "p_18": " (2) When the two marks are not identical, the plaintiff would have to establish that the mark used by the defendant so nearly resembles the plaintiff's registered trade mark as is likely to deceive or cause confusion and in relation to goods in respect of which it is registered;  \n",
        "p_19": " (3) The onus would be on the plaintiff;  \n",
        "p_20": " (4) The court has to compare that two marks - the degree of resemblance which is necessary to exist to cause deception not being capable of definition by laying down objective standard. The persons who would be deceived are of course the purchasers of the goods and it is the likelihood of their being deceived that is the subject for consideration. The purpose of the comparison is for determining whether the essential features of the plaintiff s trade mark are to be found used by the defendant. The ultimate test is whether the mark used by the defendant as a whole is deceptively similar to that of the registered mark of the plaintiff;  \n",
        "p_21": " (5) The resemblance may be phonetic, visual or in the basic idea represented by the plaintiff's mark;  \n",

        "p_25": " (ii) In a passing off action the issue is : Is the defendant selling goods so marked as to be designed or calculated to lead purchasers to believe that they are the plaintiff's goods ?  \n",
        "p_26": " (iii) In an infringement action the issue is : Is the defendant using a mark which is the same as or which is colourable imitation of the plaintiff's registered trade mark ?  \n",

The broad and essential features of the two are to be considered. One need not place side by side the two to find out if there are any differences in the design, and if so, whether they are of such character as to prevent one from being mistaken for the other. The likelihood of a person usually dealing with the one being mislead to accept the other if offered to him, would be enough. Their Lordships have held that an ordinary purchaser is not gifted with the powers of observation of a Sherlock Homes and cited with approval the following statement from Karly's Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names, (9th edition, paragraph 838) :  \n",

A person acquainted with one mark, and not having the two side by side for comparison, might well be deceived, if the goods were allowed to be impressed with the second mark, into a belief that he was dealing with goods which before the same mark as that with which he was dealing with goods which bore the same mark as that with he was acquainted. Thus, for example, a mark may represent a game of football; another mark may show players in a different dress, and in very different positions, and yet the idea conveyed by each might be simply a game of football. It could be too much to expect that persons dealing with trade marked goods, and replying, as they frequently do, upon marks should be able to remember the exact details of the marks upon goods with which they are in the habit of dealing. Marks are remembered rather by general impressions or by some significant recollection of the whole. Moreover, variations in detail might well be supposed by customers to have been made by the owners of the trade mark they are already acquainted with for reasons for their own.\"  \n",

If the proprietor is not in a position to use the mark to distinguish his goods from those of others or has abandoned it or the mark has become so common in the market that it has ceased to connect him with his goods, there remains no jurisdiction in retaining it on the register.

This abbreviation has been used in over 100 registrations as a constituent of the name under which the products relating to treatment associated with liver in the field of medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations - Homoeopathic and Ayurvedic are being marketed. The work 'LIV' is, therefore, generic and common to trade as describing the medicines associated with the treatment of liver. It has become public juris. In the filed of medicines and pharmaceuticals, it is common practice that the drugs are named either by the name of the organ which it treats or by the principal ingredients or the name of the ailment. This enables a doctor to associate a particular trade name with the organ, ingredient or ailment, thereby reducing chances of error. No trader can therefore restrain another trader from using the description of the organ, ingredients or ailment. The learned counsel has cited a host of authorities in support of his submission that a word or its abbreviation having become public juris ceases to be subject matter of proprietorship, also ceases to be source of deception ar confusion for the person likely to deal with such goods would ignore the public juris and go distinguishing the products by the prefixes and/or suffixes.  \n",
        "p_58": " 19.2. Secondly, he submitted that the goods, trade marks whereof are under scrutiny, are medicines. They are sold by the licensed chemists and druggists and that too under prescription by medical practitioners. It is not that airy man in the street would just reach the counter in a shop, ask for the goods by spelling out the trade mark and the salesman would hand over one or the other of the two goods which would be carried away by the unwary customer unmindful of what he intended to purchase and what he in fact got into his hands. Attention was invited to certain provisions of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules 1945 framed under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. No drug may be sold without a licence. A licence to sell stock, exhibit or offer for sale or distribute Homoeopathic medicines by retail or by wholesale has to be under a licence under Rule 67C. One of the conditions of the licence as provided by Clause (2) of Rule 67G is that the sale of Homeopathic medicine shall be conducted under the supervision of a person competent to deal with Homoeopathic medicines.

Their Lordships held that micro-chip technology being the base of many of the products the word 'Micro' has much relevance in describing the products. It was descriptive of the micro-technology used for production of many electronic goods which daily come to the market. No one can claim monopoly over the use of the said word.

It has been adopted for beverages in Canada. PEPSI and COLA joined by a hyphen so also COCA and COLA joined by a hyphen, were both written in a script form with flourishes. Both had been used simultaneously and for sometime with wares of the same kind. The judicial Committee of the Privy Council found that both the trade marks had a descriptive flavour to the trade.

It is difficult, indeed impossible, to imagine that the mark Pepsi-Cola as used by the defendant, in which the distinctive feature is, for the same reason, the first word Pepsi and not Cola, would lead anyone to confuse it with the registered mark of the plaintiff. The trade mark used by the defendant and the registered mark of the plaintiff are not trade marks so nearly resembling each other or so clearly suggesting the idea conveyed by each other, that the contemporaneous use of both in the same area in association with wares of the same kind would be likely to cause dealers in or users of such wares to infer that the same person assumed responsibility for their character, or quality, or for the conditions under which or the class of persons by whom they were produced or for their place of origin.\"  \n",

Both were pharmaceutical preparations. Evidence was adduced to show that the word Seltzer was having general usage in the trade and there were several trade mark using a prefix to the word Seltzer and available in the market. One of the relevant factors relied on by their Lordships for holding the word SELTZER as public juris was that both the parties were using it in specification of goods suggesting that the word is one which is descriptive and well understood.

In Bayer Products Ltd. v. Wander Ltd. ((1947) LXIV RPC 125), Application to register BIASIL was objected to by proprietor of ALACIL. Both were pharmaceutical preparations consisting of sulphadiazine.

Of course, it is impossible to exclude entirely the risk of confusion. What we are concerned with are not unlikely cases which may happen once in one hundred years but reasonable probabilities and we have to ask ourselves in relation to those facts. Is there such a risk that a doctor or a chemist or the two of them in combination by some carelessness in expression, some obscurity in handwriting, some slip of recollection or some careless mistake which you would not expect highly trained professional people to fail into will refer to the product in such a way as will lead the court to say that there is a reasonable probability of confusion.\"   \n",

Liv has thus become a generic term and public juris. It is descriptive in nature and common in usage. Nobody can claim' an exclusive right to the use of 'Liv' as a constituent of any trade mark. The class of customers dealing with medicines would distinguish the name of the medicines by ignoring 'Liv' and by assigning weight to the prefix or suffix so as to associate the name with the manufacturer.

The two rival marks Liv. 52 and LJV-T contain a, common feature Liv which is not only descriptive but also public juris; a customer will tend to ignore the common feature and will pay more attention to uncommon features i.e., 52 and T.

The defendant through their attorneys have made repeated telephone calls to the office of the attorneys of the plaintiff, despite which the plaintiff till date has supplied the defendant with a complete set.

Lall and Sethi also sent a facsimile message dated May 30, 1996 to Mr. Hemant Singh Counsel for the plaintiff, requesting Mr. Singh to supply the complete set to enable the defendants to file an appropriate reply, but no reply has been received to the same till dated. A copy of the said letter was also delivered personally to Mr. Singh's office. A copy of the facsimile message is attached as Annexure-A hereto. Only an incomplete set was received by the defendant by post and that too as late as on May 31, 1996. The said set does not even have a complete index and there are only 43 pages in the same. The injunction granted in favour of the plaintiff is liable to set aside on this ground alone.\"  \n",
        "p_137": " 34. Looking to the scheme of Order 39, CPC it is clear that ordinarily an order of injunction may not be granted ex parte. The opposite party must be noticed and heard before an injunction may be granted. Rule 3 carves out an exception in favour of granting an injunction without notice to the opposite party where it appears that the object of granting injunction would be defeated by the delay. Conferment of this privilege on the party seeking an injunction is accompanied by an obligation cast on the court to record reasons for its opinion and an obligation cast on the applicant to comply with the requirements of Clauses (a) and (b) of the proviso. Both the provisions are mandatory. The applicant gets an injunction without notice but subject to the condition of complying with Clauses (a) and (b) above said.  \n",

Though the observations have been, made primarily on the obligation of the Court to record the reasons but in our opinion they equally apply to the obligation cast on the applicant by the proviso. The provisions are mandatory. Their Lordships have observed :  \n",
        "p_139": "  \"The imperative nature of the proviso has to be judged in the context of Rule 3 of Order 39 of the Code. Before the proviso aforesaid was introduced, Rule 3 said \"the court shall in all cases, except where it appears that the object of granting the injunction would be defeated by the delay, before granting an injunction, direct notice of the application for the same to be given to the opposite party\". The proviso was introduced to provide a condition, where court proposes to grant an injunction without giving notice of the application to the opposite party being of the opinion that the subject of granting injunction itself shall be defeated by delay. The condition so introduced is that the court \"shall record the reasons\" why an ex parte order of injunction was being passed in the facts and circumstances of a particular case. In this background, the requirement for recording the reasons for grant of ex parte injunction cannot be held to be a mere formality. This requirement is consistent with the principle, that a party to a suit, who is being restrained from exercising a right which such party claims to exercise either under a statute or under the common law, must be informed why instead of following the requirement of Rule 3 the procedure prescribed under the proviso has been followed. The party which invokes the jurisdiction of the court for grant of an order of restraint against a party, without affording an opportunity to him of being heard, must satisfy the court about the gravity of the situation and court has to consider briefly these factors in the ex parte order. We are quite conscious of the fact that there are other statutes which contain similar provisions requiring the court or the authorities concerned to record reasons before exercising power vested in them. In respect of some of such non-compliance therewith will not vitiate the order so passed. But same cannot be said in respect of the proviso to Rule 3 of Order 39. The Parliament has prescribed a particular procedure for passing of an order of injunction without notice to the other side under exceptional circumstances. Such ex parte orders have far-reaching effect, as such a condition has been imposed that court must record reasons before passing such order. If it is held that the compliance with the proviso aforesaid is optional and not obligatory, then the proviso by the Parliament shall be a futile exercise and that part of Rule 3 will be a surplusage for all practical purposes. Proviso to Rule 3 of Order 39 of the Code, attracts the principle that if a statute requires a thing to be done in a particular manner it should be done in that manner or not all.\" (Para 34)  \n \n\n",
        "p_140": " 36. We are of the opinion that if the court is satisfied of non-compliance by the applicant with the provisions contained in the proviso then on being so satisfied the court which was persuaded to grant an ex parte ad interim injunction confiding in the applicant that having been shown indulgence by the court he would comply with the requirements of the proviso, it would simply vacate the ex parte order of injunction without expressing any opinion of the merits of the case leaving it open to the parties to have a hearing on the grant or otherwise on the order of injunction but bi-part only. The applicant would be told that by this conduct (mis-conduct to be more appropriate) he has deprived the opponent of an opportunity of having an early or urgent hearing on merits and, therefore, the ex parte order of injunction cannot be allowed to operate any more.  \n",
        "p_141": " 37. The appeal is allowed. The impugned order of injunction granted by the learned Single Judge is set aside. The plaintiff respondent's seeking the injunction is dismissed. Defendant-appellants' application seeking vacating of the ex parte injunction is allowed. No order as to costs.  \n",

        "p_5": "3.    The facts of the case may be noticed in brief.  The appellant nos.1 and 2 \nare real brothers of Mukhtar Singh Marwah, while respondent nos.1 and 2 \nare his widow and son respectively. Mukhtar Singh Marwah died on \n3.6.1993.   The appellant no.1 filed Probate Case No.363 of 1993 in the \nCourt of District Judge, Delhi, for being granted probate of the will allegedly \nexecuted by Mukhtar Singh Marwah on 20.1.1993.  The petition was \ncontested by the respondents on the ground that the will was forged.  On \ntheir application the appellant no.1 filed the original will in the Court of \nDistrict Judge on 10.2.1994.  Thereafter, the respondents moved an \napplication under Section  340 Cr.P.C. requesting the Court to file a criminal \ncomplaint against appellant no.1 as the will set up by him was forged.   A \nreply to the said application was filed on 27.7.1994 but the application has \nnot been disposed of so far.   Thereafter, the respondents filed a criminal \ncomplaint in May 1996 in the Court of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, New \nDelhi, for prosecution of the appellants and their mother Smt. Trilochan \nKaur Marwah under Sections 192, 193, 463, 464, 465, 467, 469, 471, 499 \nand 500 IPC on the ground that the will of Mukhtar Singh Marwah set up by \nthe appellants is a forged and fictitious document.  It is stated in the \ncomplaint that though Mukhtar Singh Marwah was an educated person, but \nthe will bears his thumb impression. He had accounts in Bank of Tokyo and \nStandard Chartered Bank which he used to operate by putting his signature.   \nUnder the will he had completely divested the respondents, who were his \nwidow and son respectively and also a daughter who was spastic and had \nbequeathed his entire property to his mother and after her death to his \nbrothers and sisters.   The appellant no.1 Iqbal Singh Marwah was appointed \nas the sole executor and trustee of the will.   Before the learned Metropolitan \nMagistrate, the complainant examined six witnesses including two persons \nfrom the banks who brought the relevant records and deposed that Mukhtar \nSingh Marwah used to operate the accounts by putting his signature.   The \nlearned Metropolitan Magistrate held that as the question whether the will \nwas a genuine document or a forged one, was an issue before the District \nJudge in the probate proceedings where the will had been filed, Sections 195 \n(1)(b)(i) and (ii) Cr.P.C. operated as a bar for taking cognizance of the \noffences under Sections 192, 193, 463, 464, 471, 475 and 476 IPC.   The \ncomplaint was accordingly dismissed by the order dated 2.5.1998.   The \nrespondents thereafter filed a criminal revision against the order of the \nlearned Metropolitan Magistrate, before the Sessions Judge, who, relying \nupon Sachida Nand Singh vs. State of Bihar 1998 (2) SCC 493, held that \nthe bar contained in Section  195 (1)(b)(ii) Cr.P.C. would not apply where \nforgery of a document was committed before the said document was \nproduced in Court.  The revision petition was accordingly allowed and the \nmatter was remanded to the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate for proceeding \nin accordance with law.   The appellants challenged the order passed by the \nlearned Additional Sessions Judge by filing a petition under Section  482 \nCr.P.C. before Delhi High Court, but the same was dismissed on 15.9.2000 \nfollowing the law laid down in Sachida Nand Singh.  Feeling aggrieved, \nthe appellants have preferred the present appeal in this Court.\n",

The object \nthereby is to preserve purity of the administration of \njustice and to allow the parties to adduce evidence in \nproof of certain documents without being compelled or \nintimidated to proceed with the judicial process.

        "p_20": "23.\tThe sequitur of the above discussion is that the bar \ncontained in Section 195(1)(b)(ii) of the Code is not \napplicable to a case where forgery of the document was \ncommitted before the document was produced in a \ncourt.\"   \n",
        "p_21": "6.\tOn a plain reading clause (b)(ii) of sub-section (1) of Section  195 is \ncapable of two interpretations.

The \nother possible interpretation is that when a document has been produced or \ngiven in evidence in a proceeding in any Court and thereafter an offence \ndescribed as aforesaid is committed in respect thereof, a complaint by the \nCourt would be necessary.   On this interpretation if the offence as described \nin the Section  is committed prior to production or giving in evidence of the \ndocument in Court, no complaint by Court would be necessary and a private \ncomplaint would be maintainable. The question which requires consideration \nis which of the two interpretations should be accepted having regard to the \nscheme of the Act and object sought to be achieved. \n",
        "p_22": "7.\tDr. A.M. Singhvi, learned senior counsel for the appellants, submitted \nthat the purpose of Section  195 is to bar private prosecution where the cause \nof justice is sought to be perverted leaving it to the Court itself to uphold its \ndignity and prestige.  If a very restricted interpretation is given to Section \n195(1)(b)(ii) Cr.P.C., as held in Sachida Nand Singh, the protection \nafforded by the provision will be virtually reduced to a vanishing point, \ndefeating the very object of the enactment.  The provision, it is urged,  does \nnot completely bar the prosecution of a person who has committed an \noffence of the type described thereunder, but introduces a safeguard in the \nsense that he can be so prosecuted only on the complaint of the Court where \nthe document has been produced or given in evidence or of some other Court \nto which that Court is subordinate.  Learned counsel has also submitted that \nbeing a penal provision, giving a restricted meaning as held in Sachida \nNand Singh, would not be proper as a person accused of having committed \nan offence would be deprived of the protection given to him by the \nlegislature.  He has also submitted that on the aforesaid view there is a \npossibility of conflicting findings being recorded by the civil or revenue \nCourt where the document has been produced or given in evidence and that \nrecorded by the criminal Court on the basis of private complaint and \ntherefore an effort should be made to interpret the Section  in the manner \nwhich avoids such a possibility.\n",
        "p_23": "8.\tShri Y.P. Narula, learned counsel for the respondents has submitted \nthat the language of the Section  is clear and there being no ambiguity \ntherein, the only possible manner in which it can be interpreted is that the \ncomplaint by a Court would be necessary when the offences enumerated in \nthe Section  are committed at a time when the document has already been \nproduced or given in evidence in Court i.e. when it is in the proceedings of \nthe Court.  The provision has to be strictly construed as it creates a bar on \nthe power of the Court to take cognizance of an offence and any provision \nwhich ousts the jurisdiction of the Court, which it otherwise possesses, must \nbe strictly construed and cannot be given an enlarged meaning.  Since the \nprovision deprives a person who is a victim and is aggrieved by the offences \ndescribed under Section  463 or punishable under Sections 471, 475 or 476 \nIPC to initiate a criminal prosecution by filing a complaint, his interest \ncannot be overlooked and therefore the provision should not be given an \nenlarged meaning, but only a restricted meaning should be given.   Learned \ncounsel has also submitted that in certain situations where the forgery has \nbeen committed at any time prior to the production or giving in evidence of \nthe document in Court, it may not at all be possible for such Court to \neffectively form an opinion as to whether it is expedient to file a complaint \nand that may facilitate the escape of a guilty person.  Shri Narula has also \nsubmitted that in Sachida Nand Singh, the Court has reiterated and has \nadopted the same view which has been taken in several earlier decisions of \nthis Court, and only in Surjit Singh a discordant note has been struck which \nis not correct.\n",
        "p_24": "9.\tThe scheme of the statutory provision may now be examined. \nBroadly, Section  195 Cr.P.C. deals with three distinct categories of offences  \nwhich have been described in clauses (a),  (b)(i) and (b)(ii) and they relate to \n(1) contempt of lawful authority of public servants, (2) offences against \npublic justice, and (3) offences relating to documents given in evidence.  \nClause (a) deals with offences punishable under Sections 172 to 188 IPC \nwhich occur in Chapter X of the IPC and the heading of the Chapter is  'Of \nContempts Of The Lawful Authority Of Public Servants'.  These are \noffences which directly affect the functioning of or discharge of lawful \nduties of a public servant.  Clause (b)(i) refers to offences in Chapter XI of \nIPC which is headed as  'Of False Evidence And Offences Against Public \nJustice'.  The offences mentioned in this clause clearly relate to giving or \nfabricating false evidence or making a false declaration in any judicial \nproceeding or before a Court of justice or before a public servant who is \nbound or authorized by law to receive such declaration, and also to some \nother offences which have a direct co-relation with the proceedings in a \nCourt of justice (Sections 205 and 211 IPC).  This being the scheme of two \nprovisions or clauses of Section  195, viz., that the offence should be such \nwhich has direct bearing or affects the functioning or discharge of lawful \nduties of a public servant or has a direct correlation with the proceedings in a \ncourt of justice, the expression \"when such offence is alleged to have been \ncommitted in respect of a document produced or given in evidence in a \nproceeding in a Court\" occurring in clause (b)(ii) should normally mean \ncommission of such an offence after the document has actually been \nproduced  or given in evidence in the Court. The situation or contingency \nwhere an offence as enumerated in this clause has already been committed \nearlier and later on the document is produced or is given in evidence in \nCourt, does not appear to be in tune with clauses (a)(i) and (b)(i) and \nconsequently with the scheme of Section  195 Cr.P.C.  This indicates that \nclause (b)(ii) contemplates a situation where the offences enumerated therein \nare committed with respect to a document subsequent to its production or \ngiving in evidence in a proceeding in any Court.\n",
        "p_25": "10.\tSection 195(1) mandates a complaint in writing of the Court for \ntaking cognizance of the offences enumerated in clauses (b) (i) and (b)(ii) \nthereof.   Sections 340 and 341 Cr.P.C. which occur in Chapter XXVI give \nthe procedure for filing of the complaint and other matters connected \ntherewith.  The heading of this Chapter is --'Provisions As To Offences \nAffecting The Administration Of Justice'.  Though, as a general rule, the \nlanguage employed in a heading cannot be used to give a different effect to \nclear words of the Section  where there cannot be any doubt as to their \nordinary meaning, but they are not to be treated as if they were marginal \nnotes or were introduced into the Act merely for the purpose of classifying \nthe enactments.  They constitute an important part  of the Act itself, and may \nbe read not only as explaining the Sections which immediately follow them, \nas a preamble to a statute may be looked to explain its enactments, but as \naffording a better key to the constructions of the Sections which follow them \nthan might be afforded by a mere preamble.(See Craies on Statute Law, 7th \nEd. Pages 207, 209).   The fact that the procedure for filing a complaint by \nCourt has been provided in Chapter XXVI dealing with offences affecting \nadministration of justice, is a clear pointer of the legislative intent that the \noffence committed should be of such type which directly affects the \nadministration of justice, viz., which is committed after the document is \nproduced or given in evidence in Court.  Any offence committed with \nrespect to a document at a time prior to its production or giving in evidence \nin Court cannot, strictly speaking, be said to be an offence affecting the \nadministration of justice.\n",

        "p_30": "12.\tA Full Bench of Allahabad High Court in Emperor vs. Kushal Pal \nSingh  AIR 1931 All 443 considered the scope of the aforesaid provision and \nheld, that clause (c) of Section 195 applies only to cases where an offence is \ncommitted by a party, as such, to a proceeding to any Court in respect of a \ndocument which has been produced or given in evidence  in such \nproceeding. It was held that an offence which has already been committed \nby a person who does not become a party till, say, 30 years after the \ncommission of the offence,  cannot be said to have been committed by a \nparty within the meaning of clause (c).   A three Judge Bench of this Court \nin Patel Lalji Bhai Somabhai vs. The State of Gujarat  1971(2) SCC 376 \nafter examination of the controversy in considerable detail observed that as a \ngeneral rule the Courts consider it expedient in the interest of justice to start \nprosecutions as contemplated by Section  476  (of the old Code which now \ncorresponds to Section  340 Cr.P.C.) only if there is a reasonable foundation \nfor the charge and there is a reasonable likelihood of conviction. The \nrequirement of a finding as to the expediency is understandable in case of an \noffence alleged to have been committed either in or in relation to a \nproceeding in that Court in case of offences specified in clause (b) [of the \nold Code corresponding to clause (b)(i) Cr.P.C.] because of the close nexus \nbetween the offence and the proceeding.  In case of offences specified in \nclause (c)   they are required to be committed by a party to a proceeding in \nthat Court with respect to a document produced or given in evidence in that \nCourt.  The Court approved the view taken by Allahabad High Court in \nEmperor vs. Kushal Pal Singh (supra) and held as under in para 7 of the \nreport :\n",
        "p_31": "\"(i)  The underlying purpose of enacting Section \n195(1)(b) and (c) Section 476 seems to be to control the \ntemptation on the part of the private parties to start \ncriminal prosecution on frivolous vexations or \nunsufficient grounds inspired by a revengeful desire to \nharass or spite their opponents.  These offences have \nbeen selected for the court's control because of their \ndirect impact on the judicial process.  It is the judicial \nprocess or the administration of public justice which is \nthe direct and immediate object or the victim of these \noffences.  As the purity of the proceedings of the court is \ndirectly sullied by the crime, the court is considered to be \nthe only party entitled to consider the desirability of \ncomplaining against the guilty party.  The private party \nwho might ultimately suffer can persuade the Civil Court \nto file complaint.\n",
        "p_32": "(ii)  the offences about which the court alone is clothed \nwith the right to complain may, therefore, be \nappropriately considered  to be only those offences \ncommitted by a party to a proceeding in that court, the \ncommission of which has a reasonably close nexus with \nthe proceeding in that court so that it can without \nembarking upon a completely independent and fresh \ninquiry, satisfactorily consider by reference principally to \nits records the expediency of prosecuting the delinquent \nparty.  It, therefore, appears to be more appropriate to \nadopt the strict construction of confirming the prohibition \ncontained in Section 195(1)(c) only to those cases in \nwhich the offences specified therein were committed by a \nparty to the proceeding in character as such party.  The \nLegislature could not have intended to extend the \nprohibition contained in Section 195(1)(c) to the offences \nmentioned therein, when committed by a party to a \nproceeding in that court prior to his becoming such \nparty.\".     \n",
        "p_33": "The court clearly rejected any construction being placed on the \nprovision by which a document forged before the commencement of the \nproceeding in which it may happen to be used in evidence later on, to come \nwithin the purview of Section  195, as that would unreasonably restrict the \nright to initiate prosecution possessed by a person and recognized by Section  \n190 Cr.P.C. \n",

Here, the accused had obtained sale deed of the property \nof a widow by setting up of an imposter and thereafter filed a mutation  \napplication before the Tehsildar  The widow contested the mutation \napplication on the ground that she had never executed the sale deed and \nthereafter filed a criminal complaint under Sections 465, 468 and 471 IPC in \nwhich the accused were convicted.  In appeal, it was contended that the \nprivate complaint was barred by virtue of Section  195(1)(c) Cr.P.C. and the \nrevenue court alone could have filed the complaint.  The court repelled the \naforesaid contention after relying upon the ratio of Patel Lalji Bhai vs. State \nof Gujarat and the private complaint was held to be maintainable.  In Mohan \nLal  vs. State of Rajasthan 1974(3) SCC 628, the above noted two decisions \nwere relied upon for holding that provisions of Section  195(1)(c) (old Code) \nwould not be applicable where mutation proceedings were commenced after \na will had been forged.  In Legal Remembrancer, Govt. of West Bengal vs. \nHaridas Mundra  1976(1) SCC 555 Bhagwati, J. (as His Lordship then was),  \nspeaking  for a three Judge Bench observed that earlier there was divergence \nof opinion in various High Courts, but the same was set at rest by this Court \nin Patel Lalji Bhai Somabhai (supra) and approved the view taken therein \nthat the words of Section  195(1)(c) clearly meant the offence alleged to \nhave been committed by a party to the proceeding in his character as such \nparty, i.e. after having become a party to the proceeding, and Sections \n195(1)(c), 476 and 476-A (of the old Code) read together indicated beyond \ndoubt that the legislature could not have intended to extend the prohibition \ncontained in Section  195(1)(c) to the offences mentioned in the said Section  \nwhen committed by a party to a proceeding prior to his becoming such party. \nSimilar view has been taken in  Mahadev Bapuji Mahajan vs. State of \nMaharashtra 1994(3) Supp SCC 748 where the contention that the absence \nof a complaint by the revenue court was a bar to taking cognizance by the \ncriminal court in respect of offences under Sections 446, 468, 471 read with \nSection  120-B IPC which were committed even before the start of the \nproceedings before the revenue court, was not accepted. \n",
        "p_35": "14.\tDr. Singhvi, learned senior counsel for the appellants, in support of \nhis contention has placed strong reliance on Gopalkrishna Menon vs. D. \nRaja Reddy 1983 (4) SCC 240  which is a decision rendered by a Bench of \ntwo learned Judges.  In this case, the appellants filed a civil suit for refund of \nRs.20,000/- which they claimed to have deposited with the first respondent \nand for recovery of certain amount. Along with the plaint the appellants \nproduced a receipt for Rs.20,000/- in support of their claim.  Thereafter the \nfirst respondent filed a criminal complaint against the appellants alleging \nforgery of his signature on the money receipt and thereby commission of \noffences punishable under Sections 467 and 471 IPC. The appellants moved \nthe High Court for quashing of the proceedings on the ground that in \nabsence of a complaint by the court, the prosecution was barred under \nSection 195(1)(b)(ii) Cr.P.C.  The High Court dismissed the petition holding \nthat Section 463 cannot be construed to include Section 467 IPC as well and, \ntherefore, the Magistrate was competent to take cognizance on the \ncomplaint.  This Court reversed the view taken by the High Court observing \nthat as Section  463 defines the offence of forgery and Section  467 punishes \nforgery of a particular category, Section 195(1)(b)(ii) Cr.P.C. would be \nattracted  and in the absence of a complaint by the Court the prosecution \nwould not be maintainable.   After briefly referring to Patel Lalji Bhai \n(supra), the Court observed that \"not the conclusion but the ratio\" of the said \ncase supported the view taken by it.  The judgment does not show that \napplicability of Section 195(1)(b)(ii) was examined with regard to the \nquestion as to whether the alleged forged receipt was prepared before or \nafter commencement of the civil suit, nor any such principle has been laid \ndown that the bar would operate even if the forgery was committed prior to \ncommencement of the proceeding in the civil court.\n",
        "p_36": "15.\tThe other case which is the sheet-anchor of the argument of learned \ncounsel for the appellants is Surjit Singh vs. Balbir Singh 1996(3) SCC \n",
        "p_37": "533.  The facts as stated in paras 1 & 11 of the report show that a criminal \ncomplaint was filed by the respondent under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471 \nread with 120-B IPC alleging that the appellants had conspired and \nfabricated an agreement dated 26.7.1978 and had forged the signature of \nSmt. Dalip Kaur and on the basis thereof, they had made a claim to remain \nin possession of a house.  The Magistrate took cognizance of the  offence on \n27.9.1983.  The appellants thereafter filed a civil suit on 9.2.1984 wherein \nthey produced the agreement.  It may be noticed that the cognizance by the \ncriminal Court had been taken much before filing of the Civil Suit wherein \nthe agreement had been filed.  During the course of discussion, the court not \nonly noticed Gopalkrishna Menon  (supra), but also quoted extensively from \nPatel Lalji Bhai (supra).  Reference was then made to Sanmukh Singh vs. \nThe King AIR 1950 Privy Council 31 and Sushil Kumar vs.  State of \nHaryana  AIR 1988 SC 419 wherein it has been held that the bar of Section  \n195 would not apply if the original document had not been produced or \ngiven in evidence in Court.  Then comes the passage in the judgment (para \n10 of the reports) which we have reproduced in the earlier part of our \njudgment. The observations therein should not be understood as laying down \nanything contrary to what has been held in Patel Lalji Bhai, but was made in \nthe context that bar contained in Section 195 (1)(b)(ii) would not be attracted \nunless the original document was filed.  It is for this reason that in the very \nnext paragraph, after observing that the cognizance had been taken prior to \nfiling of the civil suit and the original agreement in Court, the view taken by \nthe High Court that the Magistrate could proceed with the trial of the \ncriminal case was upheld and the appeal was dismissed. \n",

On principle there is no reason why the \nsafeguard in clause (c) should not apply to offences \ncommitted by witnesses also.  Witnesses need as much \nprotection against vexatious prosecutions as parties and \nthe court should have as much control over the acts of \nwitnesses that enter as a component of a judicial \nproceeding, as over the acts of parties.

Section 195 Cr.P.C. is a \nsort of exception to this general provision and creates an embargo  upon the \npower of the Court to take cognizance of certain types of offences \nenumerated therein. The procedure for filing a complaint by the Court as \ncontemplated by Section 195(1) Cr.P.C. is given in Section 340 Cr.P.C. and \nsub-section (1) and (2) thereof are being reproduced below : \n",

        "p_51": "18.\tIn view of the language used in Section 340 Cr.P.C. the Court is not \nbound to make a complaint regarding commission of an offence referred to \nin Section 195(1)(b), as the Section  is conditioned by the words \"Court is of \nopinion that it is expedient in the interest of justice.\"  This shows that such a \ncourse will be adopted only if the interest of justice requires and not in every \ncase.  Before filing of the complaint, the Court may hold a preliminary \nenquiry and record a finding to the effect that it is expedient in the interests \nof justice that enquiry should be made into any of the offences referred to in \nSection 195(i)(b).  This expediency will normally be judged by the Court by \nweighing not the magnitude of injury suffered by the person affected by \nsuch forgery or forged document, but having regard to the effect or impact, \nsuch commission of offence has upon administration of justice.  It is possible \nthat such forged document or forgery may cause a very serious or substantial \ninjury to a person in the sense that it may deprive him of a very valuable \nproperty or status or the like, but such document may be just a piece of \nevidence produced or given in evidence in Court, where voluminous \nevidence may have been adduced and the effect of such piece of evidence on \nthe broad concept of administration of justice may be minimal.  In such \ncircumstances, the Court may not consider it expedient in the interest of \njustice to make a complaint.  The broad view of clause (b)(ii), as canvassed \nby learned counsel for the appellants, would render the victim of such \nforgery or forged document remedyless.  Any interpretation which leads to a \nsituation where a victim of a crime is rendered remedyless, has to be \ndiscarded.\n",
        "p_52": "19.\tThere is another consideration which has to be kept in mind.  Sub-\nsection (1) of Section 340 Cr.P.C. contemplates holding of a preliminary \nenquiry.  Normally, a direction for filing of a complaint is not made during \nthe pendency of the proceeding before the Court and this is done at the stage \nwhen the proceeding is concluded and the final judgment is rendered.  \nSection 341 provides for an appeal against an order directing filing of the \ncomplaint.  The hearing and ultimate decision of the appeal is bound to take \ntime.  Section 343(2) confers a discretion upon a Court trying the complaint \nto adjourn the hearing of the case if it is brought to its notice that an appeal \nis pending against the decision arrived at in the judicial proceeding out of \nwhich the matter has arisen.  In view of these provisions, the complaint case \nmay not proceed at all for decades specially in matters arising out of civil \nsuits  where decisions are challenged in successive appellate fora which are \ntime consuming.  It is also to be noticed that there is no provision of appeal \nagainst an order passed under Section 343(2), whereby hearing of the case is \nadjourned until the decision of the appeal.  These provisions show that, in \nreality, the procedure prescribed for filing a complaint by the Court is such \nthat it may not fructify in the actual trial of the offender for an unusually \nlong period.   Delay in prosecution of a guilty person comes to his advantage \nas witnesses become reluctant to give evidence and the evidence gets lost.  \nThis important consideration dissuades us from accepting the broad \ninterpretation sought to be placed upon clause (b)(ii).    \n",
        "p_53": "20.\tAn enlarged interpretation to Section 195(1)(b)(ii), whereby the bar \ncreated by the said provision would also operate where after commission of \nan act of forgery the document is subsequently produced in Court, is capable \nof great misuse.  As pointed out in Sachida Nand Singh, after preparing a \nforged document or committing an act of forgery, a person may manage to \nget a proceeding instituted in any civil, criminal or revenue court, either by \nhimself or through someone set up by him and simply file the document in \nthe said proceeding.  He would thus be protected from prosecution, either at \nthe instance of a private party or the police until the Court, where the \ndocument has been filed, itself chooses to file a complaint.  The litigation \nmay be a prolonged one due to which the actual trial of such a person may \nbe delayed indefinitely.  Such an interpretation would he highly detrimental \nto the interest of society at large.  \n",
        "p_54": "21.\tJudicial notice can be taken of the fact that the Courts are normally  \nreluctant to direct filing of a criminal complaint and such a course is rarely \nadopted.   It will not be fair and proper to give an interpretation which leads \nto a situation where a person alleged to have committed an offence of the \ntype enumerated in clause (b)(ii) is either not placed for trial on account of \nnon-filing of a complaint or if a complaint is filed, the same does not come \nto its logical end.  Judging from such an angle will be in consonance with \nthe principle that an unworkable or impracticable result should be avoided.  \nIn Statutory Interpretation by Francis Bennion (Third ed.) para 313, the \nprinciple has been stated in the following manner :\n",
        "p_55": "\"The court seeks to avoid a construction of an enactment \nthat produces an unworkable or impracticable result, \nsince this is unlikely to have been intended by \nParliament.

This follows the path taken \nby judges in developing the common law. ' the \ncommon law of England has not always developed on \nstrictly logical lines, and where the logic leads down a \npath that is beset with practical difficulties the courts \nhave not been frightened to turn aside and seek the \npragmatic solution that will best serve the needs of \nsociety.\"\n",

Therefore, in order that a victim of a crime of forgery, \nnamely, the person aggrieved is able to exercise his right conferred by law to \ninitiate prosecution of the offender, it is necessary to place a restrictive \ninterpretation on clause (b)(ii). \n",
        "p_59": "22.\tDr. Singhvi has also urged that since we are dealing with a penal \nprovision it should be strictly construed and in support of his proposition he \nhas placed reliance upon a Constitution Bench decision in Tolaram Relumal \nvs. State of Bombay, 1955(1) SCR 158, wherein it was  held that it is well \nsettled rule of construction of penal statutes that if two possible and \nreasonable constructions can be put upon a penal provision, the Court must \nlean towards that construction which exempts the subject from penalty rather \nthan the one which imposes penalty and it is not competent for the Court to \nstretch out the meaning of expression used by the legislature in order to \ncarry out the intention of the legislature.  The contention is that since Section  \n195(1)(b)(ii) affords protection from private prosecution, it should not be \ngiven a restrictive interpretation to curtail its scope.   We are unable to \naccept such broad proposition as has been sought to be urged.  In Craies on \nStatute Law (1971 ed.  Chapter 21), the principle regarding penal \nprovisions has been stated as under :\n",

But where the thing is brought \nwithin the words and within the spirit, there a penal \nenactment is to be construed, like any other instrument, \naccording to the fair commonsense meaning of the \nlanguage used, and the court is not to find or make any \ndoubt or ambiguity in the language of a penal statute, \nwhere such doubt or ambiguity would clearly not be \nfound or made in the same language in any other \ninstrument.\"\n",
        "p_61": " In Lalita Jalan vs. Bombay Gas Co. 2003 (6) SCC 107 this question \nwas examined in considerable detail and it was held that the principle that a \nstatute enacting an offence or imposing a penalty is to be strictly construed is \nnot of universal application which must necessarily be observed in every \ncase.  The Court after referring to Murlidhar Meghraj Loya vs. State of \nMaharasthra AIR 1976 SC 1929, Kisan Trimbak Kothula vs. State of \nMaharashtra AIR 1977 SC 435, Superintendent and Remembrancer of Legal \nAffairs to Govt. of West Bengal vs. Abani Maity AIR 1979 SC 1029 and \nState of Maharashtra vs. Natwarlal Damodardas Soni AIR 1980 SC 593 held \nthat the penal provisions should be construed in a manner which will \nsuppress the mischief and advance the object which the legislature had in \nview.\n",
        "p_62": "23.\tThat apart, the section which we are required to interpret is not a penal \nprovision but is part of a procedural law, namely, Code of Criminal \nProcedure which elaborately gives the procedure for trial of criminal cases.   \nThe provision only creates a bar against taking cognizance of an offence in \ncertain specified situations except upon complaint by Court. A penal statute \nis one upon which an action for penalties can be brought by a public officer \nor by a person aggrieved and a penal act in its wider sense includes every \nstatute creating an offence against the State, whatever is the character of the \npenalty for the offence.   The principle that a penal statute should be strictly \nconstrued, as projected by the learned counsel for the appellants can, \ntherefore, have no application here.   \n",
        "p_63": "24.\tComing to the last contention that an effort should be made to avoid \nconflict of findings between the civil and criminal Courts, it is necessary to \npoint out that the standard of proof required in the two proceedings are \nentirely different.  Civil cases are decided on the basis of preponderance of \nevidence while in a criminal case the entire burden lies on the prosecution \nand proof beyond reasonable doubt has to be given.  There is neither any \nstatutory provision nor any legal principle that the findings recorded in one \nproceeding may be treated as final or binding in the other, as both the cases \nhave to be decided on the basis of the evidence adduced therein.  While \nexamining a similar contention in an appeal against an order directing filing \nof a complaint under Section 476 of old Code, the following observations \nmade by a Constitution Bench in M.S.

        "p_2": "1. The allegations in the plaint and the interim application are that the Plaintiff is using the trade mark \"Kesh Nikhar\" since 1935 and is its proprietor under registration No. 216597 of 17.7.1963. This trade mark has been renewed from time to time. The Plaintiff has also applied for registration of the trade mark \"Nikhar Beauty Bar\" on 3.3.1997 vide application number 216597 in Class 3. It has also been pleaded that the Plaintiff is the registered proprietor of the Copyright No.A-30760/70 of Kesh Nikhar Label. Kesh Nikhar has been continuously, regularly and extensively used by the Plaintiff in respect of soaps since 1935 with past sales of approximately Rs.200 crores, and `present' sales of Rs.30 crores. It is the Plaintiff's assertion that the word \"Nikhar\" is an essential and integral part of the registered trade mark. Approximately Rs.2 crores are being spent annually on advertisement of \"Kesh Nikhar\". In June 2000 the Plaintiff learnt that the Defendant had marketed a soap with the mark `Nikhar'. Hence the present suit for infringement of Trade Mark and Copyright, and for passing-off was filed seeking an injunction and orders for the rendition of accounts was filed. On 16.6.2000, K. Ramamoorthy J. granted an ex parte ad interim injunction restraining the Defendants from using the name `Nikhar' until further orders. \n",
        "p_3": "2. The Defendants reply is that Plaintiff has been using the Trade Mark PESCO KESH NIKHAR and has never used the Trade Mark `NIKHAR' and has mischievously sought to mislead the Court by filing a wrapper of its product under the Trade Mark `NIKHAR' which word and wrapper has not been previously used by the Plaintiff. ORG MARG, reputed to be an independent, largest and well respected retail audit body had not reported the use of the brand name NIKHAR in its Report of May 2000. It is the Defendant's submission that the competing Trade Marks are PESCO KESH NIKHAR and GODREJ NIKHAR, which are structurally, phonetically and visually not deceptively similar. It is submitted that whilst the Plaintiff's product is a shampoo in cake form the Defendant's product is a bath soap; there is a significant price difference between them; the packaging is entirely different - one is in a carton the other in a wrapper, Plaintiff's product is packed vertically and Defendant's horizontally. It has further been averred that since the Trade Marks GODREJ and PESCO have been prominently used, confusion or deception is inconceivable. The Defendant is stated to have spent in excess of Rs.1 crore on publicity. The Defendant has also asserted that the word KESH NIKHAR per se had not been registered and what is registered is a composite trade mark containing the device of a woman combing her hair with the names PESCO as also KESH NIKHAR present thereon. According to the Defendant the Plaintiff has never used the word NIKHAR BEAUTY BAR, KESH NIKHAR or NIKHAR. \n",
        "p_4": "3. Before discussing the plethora of precedents pressed by both parties I shall deal with their cartons/wrappers. Having examined that carefully I am of the view that there is insignificant commonality between the Plaintiff's carton, which is in red with an artwork of a woman, and the Defendant's wrapper, which is in yellow with a female model's photograph. There is no likelihood of any confusion, leave alone deception, between them. I hold the same opinion even in respect of the Plaintiff's wrapper on page 62-A which is in purple/lilac and contains an outwork of flowers. The pagination of the plaint, applications and documents, is significantly tell-tale, in that it is evident that the wrapper was included in the documents just before the plaint was filed, (in all likelihood created at that time also), with a view to cause an impression that `NIKHAR' soap was already being marketed by the Plaintiff. Had the Plaintiff already put this product on the market it would have been boldly stated so in the plaint and there would have been no reason for the Plaintiff to plead that the word `NIKHAR' is an essential and integral part of the registered Trade Mark `KESH NIKHAR'. Use of the words `KESH NIKHAR & `NIKHAR' in parenthesis appears incongruous since it is not the Plaintiff's case that these words have been conjointly used in any of its products. From a perusal of the plaint it is clear that it is the Defendant who has used the word `NIKHAR' since this is the grievance aired and voiced therein. \n",
        "p_5": "4. Mr. R.K. Anand, Learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Plaintiff cited  Ruston & Hornsby Ltd. v. The Zamindara Engineering Co., , in which the dispute revolved around the marks `RUSTAM INDIA' and `RUSTON'. The Supreme Court observed that when the marks were similar the enquiry should be directed to the likelihood of confusion or deception, which enquiry is relevant equally for infringement or passing off actions. It also held that since the marks `RUSTAM' and `RUSTON' were deceptively similar, it made no difference that the mark actually was `RUSTAM INDIA'. Mr. Anand next cited  K. R. Chinna Krishna Chettiar v. Ambal & Co., , where the conflict was between the registered trade mark SRI AMBAL and the mark SRI ANDAL; both were different divinities/goddesses. The Court upheld the injunction on the grounds of phonetic similarity, disregarding the fact that the names were of different goddesses, a distinction that would have been evident to the public in India. Reference was also made to the decision in  M/s.Jay Bharat Industries v. M/s. R.T. Engineering & Electronics Co., , in which the Learned Judge had framed the query viz. whether the mark `MASTER' and `REEC MASTER' are phonetically similar, then answered it in the affirmative, and injuncted the use of `REEC MASTER'. Mr. Anand also referred to  Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma v. Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories, . The Respondent who had commenced business from Eranakulam was the proprietor of the Trade Marks `NAVARATNA' and `NAVARATNA PHARMACEUTICAL LABORAtorIES'. The appellants were engaged in Jullundar in a similar business, using the Trade Mark `NAVRATNA KALPA' registration whereof was declined consequent upon the objection lodged by the Respondent. The Supreme Court affirmed the finding that since the Respondent had been using the Trade Mark long before 1937, even though the mark might not satisfy the requirements of Section 6(1) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940, it was worthy. of protection observing that \"length of user would, of course, be a material factor for the mark to become distinctive\" having \"by such a long user........become exclusively associated with the goods of the respondent in the market\". It was further observed as follows, after which the appeal was dismissed with costs: \n",
        "p_6": " \"The other ground of objection that the findings are inconsistent really proceeds on an error in appreciating the basic differences between the causes of action and right to relief in suits for passing off and for infringement of a registered trade mark and in equating the essentials of a passing off action with those in respect of an action complaining of an infringement of a registered trade mark. We have already pointed out that the suit by the respondent complained both of an invasion of a statutory right under S.21 in respect of a registered trade mark and also of a passing off by the use of the same mark. The finding in favor of the appellant to which the learned Counsel drew our attention was based upon dissimilarity of the packing in which the goods of the two parties were vended, the difference in the physical appearance of the two packets by reason of the variation in their colour and other features and their general get-up together with the circumstance that the name and address of the manufactory of the appellant was prominently displayed on his packets and these features were all set out for negativing the respondent's claim that the appellant had passed off his goods as those of the respondent. These matters which are of the essence of the cause of action for relief on the ground of passing off play but a limited role in an action for infringement if a registered trade mark by the registered proprietor who has a statutory right to that mark and who has a statutory remedy in the event of the use by another of that mark or a colourable imitation thereof. While an action for passing off is a Common Law remedy being in substance an action for deceit, that is, a passing off by a person of his own goods as those of another, that is not the gist of an action for infringement. The action for infringement is a statutory remedy conferred on the registered proprietor of a registered trade mark for the vindication of \"the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods\" (Vide S.21 of the Act). The use by the defendant of the trade mark of the plaintiff is not essential in an action for passing off, but is the sine qua non in the case of an action for infringement. No doubt, where the evidence in respect of passing off consists merely of the colourable use of a registered trade mark, the essential features of both the actions might coincide in the sense that what would be a colourable imitation of a trade mark in a passing off action would also be such in an action for infringement of the same trade mark. But there the correspondence between the two ceases. In an action for infringement, the plaintiff must, no doubt, make out that the use of the defendant's mark is so close either visually, phonetically or otherwise and the court reaches the conclusion that there is an imitation, no further evidence is required to establish that the plaintiff's rights are violated. Expressed in another way, if the essential features of the trade mark of the plaintiff have been adopted by the defendant, the fact that the get-up, packing and other writing or marks on the goods or on the packets in which he offers his goods for sale show marked differences, or indicate clearly a trade origin different from that of the registered proprietor of the mark would be immaterial; whereas in the case of passing off, the defendant may escape liability if he can show that the added matter is sufficient to distinguish his goods from those of the plaintiff\".\n",
        "p_7": "5. In  Amritdhara Pharmacy v. Satyadeo Gupta, , the contention was that the mark `LAKSHMANDHARA' was likely to deceive and cause confusion because of its similarity with `AMRITDHARA'. Since it was the finding that the Respondent had used the name for a long period to the knowledge of the other, this acquiescence was a special circumstance under Section 10(2) entitling concurrent user. It must be underscored that the Court found that the concurrent user of the two marks was likely to deceive or cause confusion even though, to my mind, there is phonetic dissimilarity. Therefore if there is conceptional identify, in conformity with the ratio of this decision, an injunction ought to be granted, as the consumer \"would go more by the similarity of the two names in the context of the widely known medicinal preparation which he wants for his ailment\". Although this case appears not to have been relied on in  M/s. Hindustan Pencils Pvt. Ltd. v. M/s. India Stationery Products Co. and another, , the reasoning of the Learned Judge is on the very same lines. \n",
        "p_8": "6. The dispute in  London Rubber Co. Ltd. v. Durex Products, , was disposed off on similar considerations and hence I shall not delve into its details. In  Registrar of Trade Marks v. Ashok Chandra Rakhit Ltd., , the concurrent finding was that the concerned mark, namely, `SHREE' had not been adopted in a distinguishing or distinct manner and was not a word which could have been exclusively used by any trader. It was held that the Respondent could protect its rights in a passing off action but could not be heard to complain of infringement. It was also observed that \"where a distinctive label is registered as a whole, such registration cannot possibly give any exclusive statutory right to the proprietor of the trade mark to the use of any particular word or name contained therein apart from the mark as a whole\". This decision was followed in  Godfrey Phillips India Ltd. v. Girnar Food & Beverages Pvt. Ltd., , where the Apex Court held that the Plaintiff could pray for an injunction of passing-off despite a disclaimer of the relevant words \"SUPER CUP\". To the same effect is the decision in  Charan Dass & M/s. Veer Industries (India) v. M/s. Bombay Crockery House, 1984-PTC-102, where the plaintiffs mark was 'PERFECT' and 'SWASTIC PERFECT' and it had disclaimed the word `perfect'. \n",
        "p_9": "7. In  Corn Products Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food Products Ltd., , the competing marks were `GLUCOVITA' and `GLUVITA'. It was observed that in deciding the question of similarity it is a person of average intelligence and of imperfect recollection that has to be kept in mind; and trade connection between the different goods is of equal significance. The Respondent's mark `GLUVITA' was held to be non-registrable. In  Kedar Nath v. Monga Perfumery & Floor Mills, , it was found that merely because the mark `SUDERSHAN' used by both parties was prefixed by the Defendant with the word `VIJAY', it did not disentitle the Plaintiff from the relief of injunction. The very same view was expressed in  Kochhar Oil Mills Ltd. v. M/s. Chhatar Extractions Ltd., 1995 (1) Arbitration Law Reporter 120, in respect of the mark 'PAKWAN' for refined oil in spite of the fact that the mark/word was descriptive, was sold to a different clientele and the Defendant had offered to prefix this mark with his own trading name, namely, Chhatar. The applicability of this string of judgments would now have to be reconsidered keeping in perspective the recent decision of the Apex Court in  M/s. S.M. Dyechem Ltd. V. M/s. Cadbury (India) Ltd., 2000 (4) SCALE 713. \n",
        "p_10": "8. Prior user of the Trade Mark `USHA' was held to be sufficient reason for the passing off an injunction in  Usha Intercontinental Ltd. & Ors. v. Usha Television Ltd., 1987-PTC-240-A. In  M/s. R.P. Locks Company v. M/s. Sehgal Locks Co. and others, 1988-PTC-10, it was opined that the defendant's contention that they were using their name Sehgal Lock Co. along with the Trade Mark `HARVCON' may be relevant in a case of passing off action but was irrelevant since the Plaintiff had filed an infringement action in the context of its well established Trade Mark `HARRISON'. Reliance, perhaps misplaced on the facts at issue, was placed on  National Bell Co. v. Metal Goods Mfg. Co. Ltd. and another, AIR 1971 SC 898. In  M/s. Bhatia Plastics v. M/s. Peacock Industries Ltd. and another, 1995-PTC-150, the Plaintiff's registered mark `MAYUR' was protected against the Defendant's use of the Trade Mark `PEACOCK'. The Privy Council in  Colgate Palmolive Ltd. and another v. K.F. Pattron, [1978] R.P.C. 635, found the packaging of toothpaste `COLGATE' and `TRINGATE' to be similar and containing borrowed features and granted the injunction; it reiterated that the proper test was whether the ordinary purchaser of normal memory, purchasing with ordinary caution could not be expected to make a close and careful side-by-side examination of the two products and also the use of the syllable `trin' for a product being marketed in Trinidad may well imply to its public that it was the local product of Colgate.   \n",
        "p_11": "9. In  Registrar of Trade Marks v. Hamdard National Foundation (India),  the Division Bench was to adjudge the legal propriety of the Appellant's refusal to register the mark `SAFI' on the finding that it was a descriptive word having direct reference to the character and quality of goods and was incapable of distinguishment. The Trade Mark `SAFI' was given judicial imprimatur and the views of the Appellant were rejected. The following passage is extremely instructive and calls for reproduction: \n",
        "p_12": "\"There are words which have a direct relation to the character and quality of goods which nevertheless may lose their primary meaning and acquire in a particular trade a secondary meaning as indicated to people interested, whether as traders or as the public in trade, the goods of a particular manufacturer. When that does occur and the evidence shows that the word has attained a secondary meaning then, in my opinion, the word is registrable as trade-mark\".\n",
        "p_13": "\"It is, therefore, possible that there may be some words which though they may have reference to the character and quality of goods yet have over a course of period, become associated with the goods of a particular trader and in that sense they would certainly be capable of distinguishing the goods of a particular trader and which would satisfy the test of Section 9 (5) of the Act and would be entitled to be registered in Part `B' of the register.\" \n",
        "p_14": "10. The last case cited by Shri Anand, Learned Senior Counsel for the Plaintiff was where the Plaintiff herein was also the party instituting the suit in the previous litigation. The contention was between the Trade Mark `KESH NIKHAR' and `BAL NIKHAR'. The Learned Judge held in the decision reported in  M/s. Peshawar Soap & Chemicals Pvt. Ltd. and another v. M/s. Anil Soap and Chemical Works and others, 1989-PTC-191, that the two marks were `deceptively similar' and injuncted the Defendant also on the grounds of infringement. \n",
        "p_15": "11. From the precedents discussed above the following legal propositions emerge - (a) the true and appropriate test is whether an ordinary purchaser of normal memory, purchasing with common caution, who could not be expected to make a close and careful examination of the products in juxtaposition, was likely to be induced or confused into buying the wrong product. The commercial reality is that newcomers most often arrange incentives of myriad natures to get the retailer to promote its product. The customers/purchasers choice is undermined by stratagems such as the purveyor implying that the products are the same; it would be sanguine to expect that the shopkeeper will explain the differences in the source of the two products and/or put both products before the confused or unaware client in order to help him to take his decision. (b) Even though a disclaimer may have been recorded, this would not disentitle such a party to complain of imitation in a passing-off action. (c) Acquiescence, or laches or failure to object would disentitle a challenge to a similar mark since the rival would have built-up a reputation and clientele and that then apple-cart of balance of convenience ought not to be upset. (d) Acquiescence would also lend legal legitimacy to exclusive user of a descriptive word, which if contemporaneously challenged would call for cancellation. (e) Use of a prefix to the same mark is no justification for permission to use two identical or similar marks. (f) User of the mark is of preeminent importance and would override the rights of the owner of a registered mark who had not entered the market till the time its competitor did. \n",
        "p_16": "12. The Defendant has prayed for the vacation of the ex parte injunction on a number of grounds. (1) It is contended that the Plaintiff has created a confusion in the plaint between the mark KESH NIKHAR and NIKHAR, and that while stating that its product is the former, it has attempted to convey that the latter is a world renounced trademark; (2) That in its application for registration of the mark NIKHAR Beauty Bar the Plaintiff has falsely and misleadingly claimed user since 1935, since it is the mark KESH NIKHAR which has been used since then; (3) From surveys conducted by/on behalf of the Defendant it has been revealed that the Plaintiffs have never used the mark NIKHAR and this mark has been employed only as recently as June 2000; (4) The Defendant launched its GODREJ NIKHAR on 27th May 2000 and hence was the first user of this word; (5) The Defendant's assertion that the Plaintiff mark is PESCO KESH NIKHAR, and that it has not used the trade mark NIKHAR, has been admitted by the Plaintiff to the extent that its mark was \"KESH NIKHAR\" whereas \"PESCO\" has been separately registered; (6) Unless there is user of the Trade Mark concurrent with its registration, no exclusive rights will ensure to the holder; (7) The Plaintiff has a trade mark registration only for its label and not for the word \"KESH NIKHAR\" per se, and the labels of the Defendant and Plaintiff are so dissimilar that a passing off action should be dismissed summarily; (8) The word `NIKHAR' is descriptive, meaning cleanliness and for this reason the Defendant has only applied for label registration; (9) The Plaintiff has neither pleaded nor proved that the word `NIKHAR' has acquired a secondary meaning; (10) That the Plaintiff's product is a shampoo in cake form whilst the Defendant's product is a toilet soap; (11) The addition of the Defendant's house mark `GODREJ' eliminates any possibility of confusion; (12) Because of the Plaintiff's misrepresentations, it has disentitled itself of discretionary relief. (13) The Plaintiff's registration is for a Label mark and not a word mark, and hence all precedents relating to `word marks' is irrelevant. (14) For the forgoing reason there has been a violation of Section 81. \n",
        "p_17": "13. The Defendant has also relied on a catena of precedents, first amongst which is  M/s. S.M. Dyechem Ltd. case (supra) in which the rival marks were PICNIC used by the Defendant and PIKNIK of the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff started business, principally in four products like potato chips and wafers, corn-pops and preparations made of rice. It thereafter applied for registration for other products including confectionery chocolates etc., which was granted after advertisement on 1.9.1993. The Respondent contended that `CADBURY PICNIC' was introduced in 1998 for chocolates etc. It applied for the rectification of the Plaintiff's mark on 19.3.1999. It also contended that `CADBURY PICNIC' and/or PICNIC and/or the Label had been registered in over 110 countries, and had attained a transborder reputation and goodwill. The Plaintiff had never intended to transact business in chocolates. The Apex Court condensed the contentions into seven compartments as under: \n",
        "p_18": "\"11. On these contentions, the following points arise for consideration: \n",
        "p_19": "(1) Whether the defendant could, in the present interlocutory proceedings, based on infringement and passing off, raise any defense that the registration of plaintiff's mark was itself \"invalid\" because the plaintiff's mark did not satisfy the ingredients of clauses (a) to (3) of section 9(1) and was, in particular, not \"distinctive\" as required by section 9(1)(e)?\n",
        "p_20": "(2)Whether, on the other hand, plaintiff could rely on the presumption in section 31 and also contend that under Section 32 the \"validity\" of the registration of the plaintiff's mark had become conclusive on the expiry of 7 years long before defense was raised in the suit (such time reckoned from date of application for rectification under section 23(1) and whether there were any exceptions to the said bar?\n",
        "p_21": "(3) Whether, assuming that section 31 and section 32 did not come in the way of the defendant on merits the word `PIKNIK' was not distinctive and id not satisfy section 9 (1)(e)?\n",
        "p_22": "(4) For grant of temporary injunction, should the Court go by principle of prima facie case (apart from balance of convenience) or comparative strength of the case of either parties or by finding out if the plaintiff has raised a `triable issue'?\n",
        "p_23": "(5) Whether, assuming that plaintiff's registration was valid, the comparative strength of the case on the question of infringement is in favor of plaintiff?\n",
        "p_24": "(6) Whether, alternatively, the plaintiff had made out that for grant of temporary injunction treating the suit as a `passing off' action, the relative strength of the case, was in plaintiff's favor?\n",
        "p_25": "(7) Whether there was unreasonable delay on the part of the plaintiff in filing suit and whether the High Court was justified in interfering in appeal in interlocutory proceedings?\n",
        "p_26": "14. On the first three issues the Court opined that if rectification proceedings had been initiated the suit must be stayed to await the verdict, but the Court could still pass temporary injunctions. It was their Lordships opinion that it would be impermissable for the Civil Court to go into the question of `validity' or `distinctiveness' of the Plaintiff's Trade Mark as these issue would properly be decided in the rectification proceedings. The Hon'ble Supreme Court further observed that the case could well be disposed off \"by considering whether there is prima facie any deception and hence infringement and whether there is any `passing off'.\" On the 4th issue their Lordships held that the test of the existence of a `triable issue' must give way in trade mark matters to the principle of `comparable strength' of the cases of the adversaries. The methodology employed by their Lordships for deciding with the 5th point is of special significance, as it would have a direct bearing on the resolution of the controversies raised in the present application. It was opined that \"a mark is said to be infringed by another trader if, even without using the whole of it, the latter uses one or more of its  essential features.........Ascertainment of an essential features is not to be by ocular test alone; it is impossible to exclude consideration of the sound of words forming part or the whole of the mark.......It is no answer to a charge of infringement - as contrasted with a passing off action - that the defendant's mark, whilst including the plaintiff's mark, includes other matters too. Still less is it an answer that by something outside that actual mark the defendant has distinguished his goods from those of the plaintiff - by adding his own name (Kerly para 14.22). But this principle is not absolute. It is also accepted that the addition of his own name by the defendant is an element to be considered and may turn the scales in favor of the defendant. It was further observed that whilst resemblance was important in the instance of words, in the cases of devices and composite marks dissimilarity in essential features is more important than similarity. The leading character of each i.e. the \"whole thing\" both orally and visually would be the relevant indicia; where marks are of similar nature, more regard must be had to the parts that are not common, since this will be the indicator of what impression is left on the mind. The Court should ascertain whether the Defendant has copied any of the distinctive arrangements of the common elements. These principles were applied by the Court in resolving the dispute between PIKNIK and PICNIC by holding that apart from the word the script was also an essential feature; but that the \"dissimilarities appear to be clear and more striking to the naked eye than any similarity between the marks\". It applied the Palmolive case test of `relative strength of pleas' to decline a temporary injunction to the Plaintiff. The Apex Court further observed that where the essential features have been copied, the Court would not return a finding on whether there was an intention to deceive or cause confusion in infringement actions. It is significant that their Lordships considered it unnecessary to delve into the aspect of transborder reputation in the facts of the case. It was further opined that a suit for passing off may fail but a suit for infringement may succeed because the additions, the get up and trade dress may enable a Defendant to escape in a passing of action. Diverging from previous decisions it was held that \"the fact that the Defendant's wrapper contains the word `Cadbury' above the words PICNIC is therefore a factor to be taken into account.\" \n",
        "p_27": "15. In  McCain International Ltd. v. Country Fair Foods Ltd. and another, [1981] RPC 69, the Court of Appeal reversed the decree of injunction, as it was of the opinion that (1) that, the plaintiffs having consistently advertised and sold their product under the name \"McCain oven chips\", this was strong evidence that the name \"oven chips\" was descriptive of the product and the name \"McCain\" indicated the source of original of the product. (2) \"oven chips\" was an ingenious and apt description of the product, although the consumer could not have become aware of what the expression meant until the product came on the market; once on the market the name \"oven chips\" would inform the consumer of the nature of the product.\" In  Parle Products Ltd. v. Bakemans Industries Ltd, 1998 PTC (18), a Single Judge of the High Court of Madras had to consider whether the Plaintiff had made out a case for the grant of an injunction against the Respondent's biscuits Glucogold for its biscuits Parle-G Gluco. The Learned Judge, following the dicta of the Supreme Court in Corn Products case (supra) found in favor of the Defendant, in that the Gluco was a generic description of use of glucose in the product and that the work or mark which was originally a trade mark had subsequently become publico Jurisdiction and that the marks were always used with a suffix/prefix i.e. GLUCOGOLD and PARLE-G GLUCO. In  Rupee Gains Tele-Times Pvt. Ltd. v. Rupee Times, 1995 PTC (15), it was held by S.K. Mahajan, J. that since the word Rupee was a not distinctive term but was a generic term, the Plaintiff was not entitled to an injunction. \n",

L.R. 97 is not of much assistance since its gravamen is that the balance of convenience is against the Plaintiff if the action can be assailed on the grounds of delay. The case  Mc Andrew v. Basset, 1864 Ch. 4 D.J.& S. 380 at page 356 was cited for the proposition that an injunction should be granted only in respect of a product which is a vendible article in the market. \n",
        "p_29": "17. With this understanding of the law pertaining to legal disputes of the nature raised in these proceedings, let me now return to the facts of the case. The first feature is that the word `NIKHAR' is not an extremely relevant for soaps, and quite obviously was one of the primary reasons why the Plaintiff has used it for several decades, along with the word `KESH', which is also not an artificial or created word and means hair. One should not lose sight of the fact that the Plaintiff's product is undisputedly a shampoo in a cake form and not a beauty soap. Kesh Nikhar therefore is a combination of descriptive words already prevalent in vernacular vocabulary, and individuality is imparted thereto by the prefix of `PESCO', which is particular only to the Plaintiff. The extract from the Trade Marks Journal No. 388 dated 1.8.1965 starts with the inscription - The Hindi words \"Kesh Nikhar\" appearing on the mark mean \"Hair shine\". In Bhargava's Dictionary `nikhar' is stated to mean cleanness, embellishment, elegance. The Copyright registration, No. A-30 760/80, is in respect of Kesh Nikhar (carton) and not purely the two words in their conjoint user. The following observation of Lord Simonds in Yorkshire 71 RPC 150 at 154 is as relevant today as it was several years ago: \n",
        "p_30": " \"The more apt a word is to describe the goods of a manufacturer, the less apt it is to distinguish them, for a word that is apt to describe the goods of A is likely to be apt to describe the similar goods of B. It is, I think, for this very reason that a geographical name is prima facie denied registrability. For just as a manufacturer is not entitled to a monopoly of a laudatory or descriptive epithet, so he is not to claim for his own a territory, whether country, county or town, which may be in the future if not now, the seat of manufacture of goods similar to his own......\"\n",
        "p_31": "17. Learned counsel for the Plaintiff had relied heavily on the following passage from the treatise of Narayanan titled - Law of Trade Marks and Passing Off:\n",
        "p_32": "\"8.69. Factual Distinctiveness. Distinctiveness is not necessarily an inherent or innate quality; it can be acquired. Where the primary signification of the word is descriptive in relation to the goods to which it is applied as a trade mark, the applicant may be able to show that by long user of the mark it has lost its primary signification and has acquired a secondary signification as denoting his goods and his goods only.\n",
        "p_33": "Acquired distinctiveness has to be considered only where the mark lacks sufficient degree of inherent distinctiveness. The extent to which courts will require proof of acquired distinctiveness depends upon the nature of the case; the less the mark is inherently distinctive the greater will be the requirement as to acquired distinctiveness.\n",
        "p_34": "Although acquisition of distinctiveness of trade mark is often a long, laborious and time consuming process, no minimum period of user has been prescribed by Statute for the purpose. There may be cases where a trade mark may attain the requisite distinctiveness within a short period and it is not possible to predict or lay down any hard and fast rule about the period of time on the expiry whereof only a trade mark by user can attain distinctiveness required under the Act. Each case will depend on the attending circumstances and the evidence adduced in support of the acquisition of distinctiveness.\"\n",
        "p_35": "18. As was emphatically pointed out by Shri Chidambaram, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Defendant, it has not been averred by the Plaintiff that the mark KESH NIKHAR or NIKHAR has by long user lost its primary signification and acquired a secondary signification which is particularly and singularly indicative of the Plaintiff's goods. What has been averred in the plaint is that over the past sixty-five years `KESH NIKHAR' soap has come to be associated with the Plaintiff. My attention was also drawn to the fact that this product was accorded registration as a soap in contradistinction to a `shampoo'; however, the Court is called to consider the actual sales of the product and in this aspect there is little doubt that the Plaintiff has marketed only a cake shampoo. No doubt, the Plaintiff has also applied for registration of the trade mark Nikhar Beauty Bar in March 1997 but this by itself would not create any preferential rights in favor of the Plaintiff, unless it is shown that a soap by the name Nikhar Beauty Bar has been genuinely manufactured and marketed by the Plaintiff. I am immediately reminded of the decision of the Court of Appeals in the `Merit' and `Nerit' controversy, where, despite the manufacture of one million cigarettes under the trade mark Nerit, the Court declined protection since it was not convinced that this manufacture was with the intent to market this product, but rather for blocking the introduction of MERIT cigarettes on the grounds of prior user of a similar word.\n",
        "p_36": "19. The registration accorded to the Plaintiff under the Copyright Act, in 1980, was for Kesh Nikhar (Carton). A perusal of the Plaintiff's packaging/carton for KESH NIKHAR, KESH BAHAR and BAL SANWAR will make it immediately evident that the distinctive feature in all the products is the artwork of the woman, and even here, the prominent aspect is her long flowing hair which is engaging her attention and activity. When a prospective customer examines the product in its packaged form, it is this aspect which would be looked for primarily. I have already observed that the soap allegedly marketed by the Plaintiff under the trade mark `Nikhar' is so recent as to make it conspicuously obvious that it was intended to thwart the Defendant's product of the same trade mark but in an entirely distinguishable and different trade-dress. While on the topic of the `fides' of the parties, the Defendant has taken the trouble to undertake a market search prior to the launch of its soap, and I am prima facie convinced that the reputed, independent agency had reported the absence of the Plaintiff's soap under the trade mark Nikhar. It will be relevant to mention that the Defendant has categorically averred in its application under Order XXXIX Rule 4 that the Plaintiff \"has never, thus far, used the trade name NIKHAR in the course of trade\" and in respect of this statement there is, significantly, non-traverse and absence of denial. Inasmuch as Mr. R.K. Anand, learned Senior Counsel for the Plaintiff had argued that the word NIKHAR is an integral part of KESH NIKHAR, the argument admits that `Nikhar' had not been previously exploited. It was also for this reason that Mr. Anand had drawn attention to Section 2(f) of the Act. I am also of the prima facie view that it is the Defendant who has shown prior user of the word `Nikhar' in soap. As opined by the Division Bench of this Court in  Metro Playing Card Co. Vs. Wazir Chand Kapoor, , prior acceptance of an application for registration of a trade-mark or its advertisement confers no right, instead `honest concurrent user' is to be looked for. The Defendant has not claimed exclusivity in the use of the word `NIKHAR' as it cannot do; it has prominently imposed the `Godrej' banner on its wrapping, which is of great importance as has been recognised by the Supreme Court in  M/s S.M. Dyechem Ltd. case (supra). A customer is not likely to buy the Defendant's NIKHAR soap instead of the Plaintiff's KESH NIKHAR cake shampoo, unless he is so careless as not to merit consideration. The word `NIHAR' is so descriptively topical and relevant in the soap business that Courts of Law must be loath and reluctant to grant anyone exclusive user or ownership over it. For all these manifold considerations and reasons I am convinced that a prima facie case has not been made out by the Plaintiff. Even if it be assumed that the Plaintiff is genuinely interested in manufacturing and selling its NIKHAR soap, the Defendant appears to have entered the market first; and even otherwise both products are at their nascent stages so that laissez-faire principles will settle the controversy. I empathise with the Plaintiff. It has been using the trade mark KESH NIKHAR for several decades and is obviously peeved that the Defendant should pick on the word NIKHAR, which the Plaintiff could as easily have chosen and exploited in the market. The Plaintiff may draw solace from the fact that the best ideas are often the first to be imitated.\n",
        "p_37": "20. The Plaintiff's I.A. 6078/2000 under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 is dismissed but with no order as to costs. The Defendant's I.A. 6354/2000 under Order XXXIX Rule 4 is allowed.\n",

        "p_39": "21. These are applications under Order XXXIX Rule 2A filed by the Plaintiff. The allegation is that despite having been served on 22nd June, 2000 with the injunction orders passed by this court, the Defendants have gone ahead for selling their soap under the mark NIKHAR'. An Invoice of Raj & Company for 24 NIKHAR soaps has been filed in which the Buyer is Ramesh Stores, Yusuf Sarai, along with the Cash Memo of the latter for six of these soaps. Apart from these transactions, the Plaintiff has also complained of a newspaper Report in the Economic Times dated 31st July, 2000 which mentions the smart and innovative marketing of NIKHAR soap. In its Reply, the Defendants have clarified that the article was academic and the interview given was not with a view to advertise Godrej Nikhar or overreach the injunction. The Defendant has categorically denied that it had made any sale of Godrej Nikhar after the passing of the injunction. The Defendant has further explained that M/s Raj & Co. are not the exclusive distributors of the Defendant and that their relations are on a principal to principal basis, and that the Defendant's officers have immediately issued instructions/requests to all concerned, not to effect any sales of this product.\n",
        "p_40": "22. In the second applications the Plaintiff has complained that the sales of Godrej Nikhar soap are continuing and that the \"defendant on their e-mail through @ BATCHAT programme and Ezemart.com the computer Network of the Defendant, a Cyber Shop Marketing of the Defendant is still selling and advertising soap under the mark NIKHAR. The said advertisements of the defendant is still being displayed on e-mail/internet and one such display has been made on 12th August, 2000 and 19th August, 2000.\" Printouts have been filed along with Cash Memos/Bills of alleged sales of Godrej Nikhar from sundry shops as also from Cyber Shop Marketing Pvt. Ltd. In its Reply, the Defendant has pleaded that these websites which have been mentioned are not owned by the Defendant and the Defendant has no control over them. It has further been averred by the Defendant that the products of the Defendant sold through these websites are not sourced from the Defendant. Sales of Godrej Nikhar relate the preinjunction stocks released by C & F agents of the Defendant prior to 23rd June, 2000.\n",
        "p_41": "23. The judicial powers of committal for contempt of its orders are to be employed very sparingly, only when it is evident that they have been contumaciously disobeyed or ignored. These powers should be exercised when there is preponderant and abundant evidence that the party has willfully violated or disregarded the orders. In the launch of any product on a wide- spread scale, it would be sanguine to expect that there would not be any stray and unintentional violations of an interdiction against sales thereof. I am satisfied that there is an absence of conclusive proof of any intentional violation of the orders. The Cash Memos filed do not convince me that they are indicative of sales carried out by the Defendant. It is true that the Defendant's webpage carried details/particulars of Godrej Nikhar but I would accept the Defendant's explanation that the webpage was created prior to the issuance of the injunction, and ignore the failure to immediately delete all information pertaining to this product on \nlearning of the orders. This exercise should have been followed, but the unqualified apology together with the remedial action on the facts being brought to the limelight have persuaded me of the inappropriateness of going into the matter any further. For contempt to be made out, there must be a conscious act of disobedience, and not merely a failure to act with full diligence. The existence of reference to Godrej Nikhar had quite possibly escaped the attention of the Defendant. It is not conduct that would necessarily invite initiation of contempt proceedings.\n",

But we  are-going  to\nreaffirm the decision of the Court on the second point.\nUnder  section 435 of the 1898 Code the High Court  had\t the\npower to \"call for and examine the record of any  proceeding\nbefore any inferior Criminal Court 'situate within the local\nlimits\tof  its jurisdiction for the purpose  of  satisfying\nitself\tas to the correctness, legality or propriety of\t any\nfinding, sentence or order recorded or passed. and as to the\nregularity  of any proceedings of such inferior Court\",\t and\nthen to pass the necessary orders in accordance with the law\nengrafted  in  any of the sections  following  section\t435.\nApart  from the revisional power, the High  Court  possessed\nand possesses the inherent powers to be exercised ex  debito\njustitiae  to do the real and the substantial  'justice\t for\nthe administration of which alone Courts exist.\t In  express\nlanguage this power was recognized and saved in section 561A\nof  the\t old Code.  Under section 397(1) of the\t 1973  Code,\nrevisional  power  has been conferred on the High  Court  in\nterms  which are identical to those found in section 435  of\nthe 1898 Code.\tSimilar is the position apropos the inherent\npowers of the High Court.

        "p_14": "As  pointed out in Amar Nath's case (supra) the\t purpose  of\nputting\t a bar on the power of revision in relation  to\t any\ninterlocutory  order passed in an appeal, inquiry, trial  or\nother  proceeding is to bring about expeditious disposal  of\nthe cases finally, More often than not, the revisional power\nof  the\t High Court was resorted to in\trelation  to  inter-\nlocutory   orders  delaying  the  final\t disposal   of\t the\nproceedings.  The Legislature in its wisdom decided to check\nthis  delay by introducing sub-section (2), in section\t397.\nOn  the one hand, a bar has been put in the way of the\tHigh\nCourt  (as also of the Sessions Judge) for exercise  of\t the\nrevisional power in relation to any interlocutory order,  on\nthe  other, the power has been conferred in almost the\tsame\nterms  as  it was in the 1898 Code.  On a plain\t reading  of\nsection\t 482, however, it would follow that nothing  in\t the\nCode,  which  would include subsection (2)  of\tsection\t 397\nalso,  \"shall  be  deemed to limit or  affect  the  inherent\npowers of the High Court\".  But, if we were to say that the\n754\nsaid  bar is not to operate in the exercise of the  inherent\npower  at  all,\t it will be setting at\tnaught\tone  of\t the\nlimitations  imposed  upon the exercise\t of  the  revisional\npowers.\t In such a situation, what is-the harmonious way out\n? In our opinion, a happy solution of this problem would  be\nto  say that the bar provided in sub-section (2) of  section\n397 operates only in exercise of the revisional power of the\nHigh Court, meaning thereby that the High Court will have no\npower  of revision in relation to any  interlocutory  order.\nThen  in  accordance  with  one\t of  the  other\t  principles\nenunciated  above, the inherent power will come\t into  play,\nthere  being no other provision in the Code for the  redress\nof  the grievance of the aggrieved party.  But then, if\t the\norder assailed is purely of an interlocutory character which\ncould  be corrected in exercise of the revisional  power  of\nthe  High  Court under the 1898 Code. the  High\t Court\twill\nrefuse\tto  exercise its inherent power.  But  in  case\t the\nimpugned order clearly brings about a situation which is  an\nabuse  of  the process of the Court or for  the\t purpose  of\nsecuring the ends of justice interference by the High  Court\nis  absolutely necessary, then nothing contained in  section\n397(2)\tcan  limit or affect the exercise  of  the  inherent\npower  by the High Court.  But such cases would be  few\t and\nfar  between.\tThe High Court must  exercise  the  inherent\npower\tvery  sparingly.   One\tsuch  case  would   be\t the\ndesirability  of  the  quashing of,  a\tcriminal  proceeding\ninitiated   illegally,\tvexatiously  or\t as  being   without\njurisdiction.\tTake for example a case where a\t prosecution\nis launched under the Prevention of Corruption Act without a\nsanction.  then\t the trial of the accused  will\t be  without\njurisdiction  and  even after his acquittal a  second  trial\nafter proper sanction will not be barred on the doctrine  of\nAutrefois   Acquit.   Even  assuming,  although\t  we   shall\npresently  show\t that it is not so, that in such a  case  an\norder of the Court taking cognizance or issuing processes is\nan interlocutory order. does it stand to reason to say\tthat\ninherent  power\t of the High Court cannot be  exercised\t for\nstopping  the  criminal\t proceeding as\tearly  as  possible,\ninstead\t of harassing the accused upto the end ? The  answer\nis  obvious  that the bar will not operate  to\tprevent\t the\nabuse of the process of the Court and/or to secure, the ends\nof justice.  The label of the petition filed by an aggrieved\nparty is immaterial.  The High Court can examine the  matter\nin  an\tappropriate  case under its  inherent  powers.\t The\npresent case undoubtedly falls for exercise of the power  of\nthe  High Court in accordance with section 482 of  the\t1973\nCode.  even assuming. although not accepting, that  invoking\nthe revisional power of the High Court is impermissible.\nIn R. P. Kapur v. The State of Punjab (1) Gajendragadkar J..\nas  he\tthen  was, delivering the  judgment  of\t this  Court\npointed out, if we may say so with respect, very  succinctly\nthe  scope of the inherent power of the High Court  for\t the\npurpose of quashing a criminal proceeding.

In dealing with this  class  of\n\t      cases  it\t is important to bear in-  mind\t the\n\t      distinction  between a case where there is  no\n\t      legal  evidence  or where\t there\tis  evidence\n\t      which  is manifestly and clearly\tinconsistent\n\t      with the accusation made and cases where there\n\t      is  legal evidence which on  its\tappreciation\n\t      may  not support the accusation  in  question.\n\t      In exercising its jurisdiction under s.  561-A\n\t      the  High\t Court\twould  not  embark  upon  an\n\t      enquiry as to whether the evidence in question\n\t      is  reliable or not.  That is the function  of\n\t      the trial magistrate, and ordinarily it  would\n\t      not  be open to any party to invoke  the\tHigh\n\t      Court's inherent Jurisdiction and contend that\n\t      on  a reasonable appreciation of the  evidence\n\t      the accusation made against the accused  would\n\t      not be sustained.\"\n",

J.\tand Lopes L. J. Applying the said  test,  almost  on\nfacts  similar to the ones in the instant case, it was\theld\nthat the order in revision passed by the High Court (at that\ntime, there was no bar like section 397 (2) was not a \"final\norder\"\twithin\tthe  meaning  of  section  205\t(1)  of\t the\nGovernment of India Act, 1935.\tIt is to be noticed that the\ntest  laid  down therein was that if the  objection  of\t the\naccused\t succeeded, the proceeding could have ended but\t not\nvice versa.

This  does\t not\nseem to be the intention of the Legislature when it retained\nthe revisional power of the High Court in terms identical to\nthe  one  in the, 1898 Code.  In what cases  then  the\tHigh\nCourt will examine the legality or the propriety of an order\nor  the legality of any proceeding of an  inferior  Criminal\ncourt ? Is it circumscribed to examine only such  proceeding\nwhich  is  brought  for\t its  examination  after  the  final\ndetermination  and wherein no appeal lies ? Such cases\twill\nbe  very  few  and far between.\t It  has  been\tpointed\t out\nrepeatedly, vide, for example, The River Wear  Commissioners\nv.  William Adamson(1) and R. M. D. Chamarbaugwalla  v.\t The\nUnion  of India ( 2) that although the word occurring  in  a\nparticular  statute are plain and unambiguous, they have  to\nbe interpreted in a manner which would fit in the context of\nthe other provisions of the statute and bring about the real\nintention  of  the  legislature.   On  the  one\t hand,\t the\nlegislature  kept  intact the revisional power of  the\tHigh\nCourt  and,  on the other, it put a bar on the\texercise  of\nthat power in relation to any interlocutory order.  In\tsuch\na situation it appears to us that the real intention of\t the\nlegislature was not to equate the expression  \"interlocutory\norder\"\tas  invariably being converse of  the  words  \"final\norder\".\t There may be an order passed during the course of a\nproceeding  which may not be final in the sense\t noticed  in\nKuppuswami's  case  (supra),  but,  yet it  may\t not  be  an\ninterlocutory order-pure or simple.  Some kinds of order may\nfall   in  between  the\t two.\tBy  a  rule  of\t  harmonious\nconstruction,  we, think that the bar in sub-section (2)  of\nsection\t 397 is not meant to be attracted to such  kinds  of\nintermediate  orders.  They may not be final orders for\t the\npurposes  of Article 134 of the Constitution, yet  it  would\nnot be correct to characterise them as merely  interlocutory\norders within the meaning of section 397(2).  It is  neither\nadvisable,  nor possible, to make a catalogue of  orders  to\ndemonstrate which kinds of orders would be merely, purely or\nsimply\tinterlocutory  and which kinds of  orders  would  be\nfinal, and then to prepare an exhaustive list of those types\nof orders which will fall in between the two.  The first two\nkinds are well-known and can be culled out from many decided\ncases.\t We  may, however, indicate that the type  of  order\nwith which we are concerned in this case, even though it may\nnot be final in one sense, is surely not interlocutory so as\nto attract the bar of subsection (2) of section 397.  In our\nopinion it must be taken to be an order of the type  falling\nin the middle course.\n",

He has urged several objections in law so as to assert disentitlement of the plaintiff to the injunction.\n",
        "p_19": "14. The principal submission on behalf of the defendant has been that the plaintiff has failed to disclose the disclaimers given on its registration certificate by the Registrar of Trademarks in its plaint which by itself would disentitle the plaintiff to grant of an injunction. It has further been contended Page 1603 that the defendant has no wordmark registration in the word 'GEMS' and that it has a composite registration in \"Cadbury Gems\". Consequently, by virtue of Section 17 of the Trademark Act, the plaintiff would have no exclusive right in a part of registered trademark. Mr. Bansal further contends that the defendant is using the trademark 'JAMES BOND' which has no similarity to the trademark of the plaintiff. Placing reliance on the pronouncement of the Supreme Court in  American Home Products Corporation v. Mac Laboratories Pvt. Ltd. and Anr. (Para 36 at page 155) and  Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma v. Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories it is urged that the plaintiff has failed to satisfy the legal requirement of establishing trade and reputation of its products under the trademark 'GEMS'. It is further contended that the documents relied upon by the plaintiff establish that the plaintiff's product was sold as Cadbury's Gems and consequently the plaintiff was disentitled to any relief in the present matter.\n",
        "p_20": "15. It is further urged that so far as the claim of injunction in a passing of action is concerned, this Court has to see as to whether the matter which has been added in the packaging of the defendant is sufficient to distinguish the defendant's goods from the plaintiff. Placing reliance on 1988 PTC 39 Johnsons & Johnsons v. Cripteen Hoden and 1996 PTC 16 page 187 Kellogg Co. v. Praveen Kumar Bhadabhai, it is urged by learned Counsel for the defendant that with the additional matter introduced by the defendant on its label, there are sufficient distinguishing features from the plaintiff's label which would disentitle the plaintiff to any injunction against the defendant.\n",
        "p_21": "16. Mr. S.K. Bansal, learned Counsel for the defendant, further submits that the plaintiff has no registration of the pillow pack and label under the Copyright Act, 1957. It has placed no advertisement or invoices relating to this copyright. An oral submission has been made that M/s Nestle is selling a product known as 'Smarties' in a packaging which is identical to the plaintiff. It is contended that for this reason as well, in the light of the pronouncement in 2006 II AD Delhi 89 Colgate Palmolive v. Mr. Patel and Anr. (paras 20, 25, 29, 31 & 42); 1998 PTC (18) 372 Samsonite Corporation v. Vijay Sales (Paras 61 to 65), the plaintiff was not entitled to the injunction if the essential features of the packaging and labels are seen as a whole.\n",
        "p_22": "17. I have heard learned Counsel for the parties at length and given my considered thought to the rival contentions.\n",
        "p_23": "18. My attention has been drawn to the case made out by the plaintiff in the plaint. It has been urged by the plaintiff that the registration vide No. 291026 dated 21st September, 1973 in Class 30 of the label Cadbury Gems has no disclaimer entitling it to maintain the action for infringement of the registered trademark against the defendant. It is further urged that despite there being a disclaimer on the other three registrations of the marks and labels, imposed by the Registrar of Trademarks, the plaintiff is still entitled to maintain a case of passing off against the defendant even in respect of trademarks Page 1604 which have been granted registrations subject to the disclaimer. The instant case, is not a case of identity of the marks, label and packaging. The plaintiff has pleaded that the deceptive similarity, dishonest adoption of the essential features of its trademark, label and packaging by the defendant entitles the plaintiff to protection by injunction in its action for infringement, dishonest passing off and copyright violation by the defendant.\n",
        "p_24": "19. So far as an action for infringement is concerned, it has been repeatedly held by the Apex Court on a comparison of the trademarks of the two parties in case the trademark adopted by the defendant is identical to that of the plaintiff, the plaintiff may not be required to prove anything further. Section 29 of the Trademarks Act, 1999 statutorily mandates so as well. However, when the two marks are not identical, then the plaintiff would be required to establish that the mark used by the defendant so nearly resembles the plaintiff's registered trademark as is likely to deceive or cause confusion in the minds of the consumer public. Ref. : Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma v. Navratna Pharmaceutical Laborities  (Supra) : 1997 PTC (17)(DB) 779 Metropol India (P) Ltd. v. Praveen Industries India (Regd.). The action for infringement is a statutory remedy conferred on the registered proprietor of a registered trademark for the vindication of the exclusive right to use the trademark in relation to these goods.\n",
        "p_25": "20. The principles in this regard were succinctly laid down by the Apex Court in the pronouncement reported at  Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma v. Navratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories (Para 28):\n",
        "p_26": " 28. When once the use by the defendant of the mark which is claimed to infringe the plaintiff's mark is shown to be \"in the course of trade\", the question whether there has been an infringement is to be decided by comparison of the two marks. Where the two marks are not identical, the plaintiff would have to establish that the mark used by the defendant so nearly resembles the plaintiff's registered trade mark as is likely to deceive or cause confusion and in relation to goods in respect of which it is registered. (Vide Section 21). A point has sometimes been raised as to whether the words \"or cause confusion\" introduce any element which is not already covered by the words \"likely to deceive\" and it has sometimes been answered by saying that it is merely an extension of the earlier test and does not add very materially to the concept indicated by the earlier words \"likely to deceive\". But this apart, as the question arises in an action for infringement the onus would be on the plaintiff to establish that the trade mark used by the defendant in the course of trade in the goods in respect of which his mark is registered, is deceptively similar. This has necessarily to be ascertained by a comparison of the two marks - the degree of resemblance which is necessary to exist to cause deception not being capable of definition by laying down objective standards. The persons who would be deceived are of course, the purchasers of the goods and it is the likelihood of their being deceived that is the subject of consideration. The resemblance may be phonetic visual or in the basic idea represented by the plaintiff's Page 1605 mark. The purpose of the comparison is for determining whether the essential features of the plaintiff's trademark are to be found in that used by the defendant. The identification of the essential features of the mark is in essence a question of fact and depends on the judgment of the Court based on the evidence led before it as regards the usage of the trade. It should, however, be borne in mind that the object of the enquiry in ultimate analysis is whether the mark used by the defendant as a whole is deceptively similar to that of the registered mark of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_27": "21. In a case of infringement of trademark, the plaintiff may establish that the plaintiff's trademark is identical with or so nearly resembles the plaintiff's work either visually or phonetically or otherwise, that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion in relation to the case in respect of which the plaintiff got his mark registered. The requirement that the plaintiff has to satisfy in order to make out a case of infringement of its mark by the defendant have been succinctly laid down by the Division Bench of this Court in its pronouncement reported at 2nd 1973 I Delhi 393 Atlas Cycle Industries Ltd. v. Hind Cycles Limited wherein the court held thus:\n",
        "p_28": " Therefore, the aforesaid requirement in (b) may be made out by the plaintiff by showing that the defendant's mark is identical with or so nearly resembles the plaintiff's mark either visually, phonetically or otherwise that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion in relation to the goods in respect of which the plaintiff got his mark registered. In other words, if the essential features of the trade mark of the plaintiff have been adopted by the defendant, the fact that there are some additional features in the defendant's mark which show marked differences is immaterial in an action for infringement. An action for passing off, on the other hand, is in substance an action in common law for actual or probable passing of by the defendant of his own goods a those of the plaintiff. In such an action, the use by the defendant of the trade mark of the plaintiff as such is not essential. The plaintiff has only to show that the similarity of the defendant's mark or goods is such that the defendant can pass off his goods as those of the plaintiff. The defendant may escape liability in an action for passing off if he can show that his mark or goods, besides the essential features which are sufficient to distinguish the same from that of the plaintiff. Thus, while in an action for infringement of a registered trade mark the plaintiff has to establish either an use of his registered trade mark as such or of an identical mark or of a deceptively similar mark by the defendant, he has to establish in an action for passing off that the defendant's mark or goods are such that the defendant can pass off his goods as those of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_29": "22. An action based on passing off is a common law remedy which in essence is an action for deceit, that is, a passing off by a person of his own goods as those of another. This is also the gist of an action for infringement of a trademark which is a statutory remedy conferred on the registered proprietor of a registered trademark for the vindication of the exclusive right to the use of the trademark in relation to those goods. Such a right is statutorily recognised Page 1606 under Section 28 of the Trademarks Act, 1999. The use by the defendant of the trademark of the plaintiff may be the sine qua non in the case of an action for infringement while it is not an essential feature of an action for passing off. Infringement and passing off may coincide in a case where the evidence in respect of passing off consists merely of the colourable use of the plaintiff's registered trademark by the defendant. Beyond this, the correspondence between the two action ceases. If the similarity between the plaintiff's and the defendant's mark is so close either visually, phonetically or otherwise so that the court reaches the conclusion that there is an imitation no further evidence is required to establish that the plaintiff's rights are violative in the action for infringement. Thus, if the essential features of the trademark of the plaintiff have been adopted by the defendant, the fact that the getup, packing and other writing or marks on the goods or on the packets in which the defendant offers his goods for sale show marked differences or indicate clearly a trade origin different from that of a registered proprietor of the mark, would be immaterial for the case of infringement of the trademark. The liability of the defendant for such infringement may be absolute. In the case of passing off, the defendant may escape liability if he can show that the added material is sufficient to distinguish his goods from those of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_30": "23. The plaintiff is aggrieved by the action of the defendant in adopting and selling in a packaging which is a pillow pack and is deceptively similar to the plaintiff's packaging. It would thus be consequently appropriate to consider the principles laid down in judicial pronouncements relating to an action for passing off based on trade dress and in legal texts on trademark. It has been observed by Kerly in the \"Law of Trademarks\" (12th Edition 1986, in para 16.67) that it is possible for imitation of get up alone to amount to passing off. It was also observed that it is also usually true in some degree that a trader's goods are recognised by their general appearance, or 'get up'. Accordingly, the resemblance or 'get up' is not uncommonly an ingredient in passing off action. Get up alone to distinguish goods is seldom relied upon by traders who rely upon similarity of tradenames and word trademarks.\n",
        "p_31": "24. The case of the plaintiff so far as its complaint against the defendant in respect of the infringement on account of the copying of essential features of the plaintiff's packaging as also passing off its goods as those of the plaintiff requires a comparison of the packaging of the defendant against the plaintiff's pillow pack.\n",
        "p_32": "The packaging of the defendant is not identical to that of the plaintiff. As per the law laid down in Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma v. Navratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories (supra), the tests for the infringement action and dishonest passing off claim would remain the same.\n",
        "p_33": "25. The plaintiff's pillow packs which have been placed on record have a blue background with 'GEMS' written in bold white italicized letters in a script which is not uniform. The word 'GEMS' is written against a chocolate brown background with a blue outline in an oval formation in the centre of the pack. An impression of small diversely coloured round chocolate button like tablets have been strewn around the word 'GEMS'. It has been pointed out Page 1607 that the chocolate tablet impressions are in fact an image of the products which are contained inside the packaging which are of identical round shape and form and have diverse and attractive colour coatings over the chocolate inside. The colour combination of the tablets as contained in the pillow pack and which has been printed on the pillow pack are red, yellow, green and mauve. The plaintiff has displayed full tablets as well as half cut tablets to represent the chocolate which is contained therein. The visual impression which is created on the pillow pack and the packaging of the plaintiff is that of an explosion of chocolate tablets in the middle and the tablets flying out from its centre. White lines around the brown oval in the middle add to the creation of such a impression.\n",
        "p_34": "26. The defendant's pillow pack is not only of the same size as that of the plaintiff but is in the same blue background as that of the plaintiff. The plaintiff's pack has a brown oval at the centre, while the defendant has placed brown colour in a diamond shape. The plaintiff has displayed the origin of the product that is the name of the manufacturer as Cadbury's on the top left corner of the packet. The defendant has placed its name identically at the top left corner. The brown oval on the plaintiff's pack is bordered by a purple oval while the brown diamond on the defendant pillow pack is also bordered with the purple border. The plaintiff has written the word 'GEMS' in white colour. The defendant has used an identical white for writing 'JAMES BOND'. Even the scripting is identical. The plaintiff scripting of the word 'GEMS' is not uniform. The defendant has also placed 'JAMES BOND' in a script which is not uniform. Just as the plaintiff, the defendant has also created a visual impression of an explosion in blue colour in the middle with lines emanating from the centre and tablets flying out there from. The colour combination of the tablets is similar to that of the plaintiffs while the defendant has also placed half tablets showing the chocolate centres just as those of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_35": "27. From a bare perusal of the two pillow packs, it would appear that the same are of similar size and that every essential features of the plaintiff's pillow pack is to be found in the packaging of the product of the defendant. The only difference which is to be found is in the fact that while the plaintiff pillows pack displays the manufacturer as Cadbury, the defendant's displays the manufacturer as Neeraj. While the plaintiff has displayed the product as 'GEMS', the defendant has displayed the same as 'JAMES BOND'.\n",
        "p_36": "28. Thus the essential features of the pillow pack of the plaintiff have been adopted by the defendant in its packaging. The products are sold in small pouches or pillow pack of identical size and shape. The concept or idea which has been conceptualized by the plaintiff of an explosion of chocolate tablets emanating from the central brown oval circumscribed by the blue oval have been copied in totality by the defendant. The defendant has also placed identical multicoloured chocolate tablets as well as displayed half cut tablets showing chocolate centered in the same manner as have been displayed by the plaintiff on its packaging.\n",
        "p_37": "29. It is well settled that the classification of goods in an action for passing off where the goods may be the same, similar or different, is wholly irrelevant. Page 1608 Ref : 1997 PTC 17 (DB) 779 entitled Metropol India (P) Ltd. v. Praveen Industries India (Regd.) para 18. In the instant case the goods of the plaintiff and the defendant are the same.\n",
        "p_38": "30. I find that the principles which apply to a consideration of as to whether the plaintiff has made a prima facie case of the defendant's dishonestly attempting to trade upon the plaintiff's goodwill and adopted such name or label, have been succinctly and aptly laid down by the court of Appeal in the judgment rendered in Slazenger & Sons v. Feltham & Co. (2) RPC 1889 6 531 where the court held thus:\n",
        "p_39": " One must exercise one's common sense, and if you are driven to the conclusion that what is intended to be done is to deceive if possible, I do not think it is stretchng the imagination very much to credit the man with occasional success or possible success. Why should we be astute to say that he cannot succeed in doing that which he is straining every nerve to do?\n",
        "p_40": "31. Holding that it is the points of similarity which have to be given greater attention to than those of dissimilarity in 22 RPC 273 Munday v. Carey, it was held thus:\n",
        "p_41": " ...where you see dishonesty, then even though the similarity were less than it is here, you ought, I think, to pay great attention to the items of similarity, and less to the items of dissimilarity.\n",
        "p_42": "32. It would be also useful to consider the principles which were laid down in 1996 RPC 697 Harrods Ltd. v. Harrodian School Limited wherein it was held that the deception is the gist of the tort of passing off and it is not necessary for a plaintiff to establish that the defendant consciously intended to deceive the public if that is the probable result of his conduct, nevertheless, the question why the defendant chose to adopt a particular name or get up is always highly relevant. It is a question which calls for an answer.\n",
        "p_43": "33. Placing reliance on these judgments a Division Bench of this Court in its pronouncement reported at 1997 PTC (17)(DB) 779 Metropol India (P) Ltd. v. Praveen Industries India (Regd.), the plaintiff had a trademark 'CLEANZO' and had complained that the defendant had deceptively brought into the marked a similar product under the mark 'CLEANJO' and that the product was being sold in tins of identical size, background, colour scheme, lay out and get up with the same pictorial devices, though in a changed arrangement and order. The learned Single Judge had permitted the defendant to manufacture and sell its products under the name, style and trademark 'PRAVEEN CLEANJO' with the rider that they will not write the word cleanjo and in owl shape or in any other shape which may be deceptively similar to the manner in which the plaintiff is writing its trademark. Both parties had appealed against the order. In this case the Division Bench had held that classification of the good was irrelevant so far as the claim of passing off is concerned. Placing reliance on the aforenoticed judgment, the Division Bench had noticed that the learned Single Judge had rightly remarked that it was for the defendant to have shown as to how and in what manner for his product, the same photographer and the CLEANJO, which is not a word available in the dictionary was used. \"CLENZO\" is not available in the dictionary. Page 1609 Prima facie the plaintiff was a prior user of the mark and that the defendant started using the same match later. There being no answer to these questions, the defendant was restrained from using in any manner the trademark 'CLEANZO' in any form whatsoever on its products.\n",
        "p_44": "34. In the Kellog Co. v. Praveen Kumar Bhadabhai 1996 PTC 16 187 (Supra), the court was of the view that the prominence given to the name of the manufacturer overshadowed the other similarities in get up. It was noticed that the plaintiff had displayed the word Kellogs in bold letters on its carton in such a manner which could not escape notice by any buyer. The court noticed that the purchasers of the products of the parties belong to the middle class or the upper middle class and above who were fairly educated in English and are able to distinguish Kellogs and what is not Kellogs. The court came to a conclusion that viewed as a whole, the trade dress, that is the packaging of the parties, was different and there was no possibility of confusion amongst the class of purchasers of the cornflakes being sold by the parties. On these principles, injunction was refused to the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_45": "35. The defendant has placed strong reliance on the Division Bench pronouncement of this Court reported in 1988 PTC 39 Johnsons & Johnsons and Anr. v. Cripteen Hoden India Pvt. Ltd and Anr. In this case after closely examining the two packagings in question, the court had arrived at a conclusion on the facts and material laid before the court that the trademark as adopted by the defendant and the packaging of the product of the plaintiff and the defendant were different from each other and there was no resemblance between the two packings. On this factual finding, injunction was refused.\n",
        "p_46": "36. From the several judicial pronouncements placed before this Court it is crystal clear that a real test is whether the consuming public would be confused or misled by the get up into thinking that the product of the defendant was really the plaintiff's similar product. The applicable principles were succinctly laid down by Lord Halsbury in Schweppes Ltd. v. Gibbens 1905 (22) RPC 601, 606. In this case, the appellant was selling soda water in bottles. The respondent subsequently sold soda water in bottles with label which was somewhat similar to that of the appellant. However, while the appellant's bottles showed Schweppes Soda Water the respondents contained the name Gibbens Soda Water. In this case, it was held by the House of Lords that a fraudulent intent on the part of the respondent cannot be presumed inspite of the similarities in the bottles, labels, colour and medallion because the distinguishing feature of the name adopted by the defendant showed that they had no intention to deceive the purchaser. In this matter, it was observed by Lord Halsbury that \"I can quite understand a case in which, although colourably a defendant has introduced his own name, yet the nature of the wrapping up, the nature of the packing itself, or in this case, the shape of the bottle, may all have been so closely imitated that the mere introduction of some distinctive mark, to which no ordinary observer would have applied his mind, will not get rid of obvious intention to pass off one's goods of as the other; but to apply the proposition to this case appears to me to be a little short of ridiculous\". It was so observed as the name of Page 1610 Gibbens' was so plainly written on the face of the label and was in the very place where 'Schweppes' was on the bottle of the appellant. Consequently the court held that there was no intention to deceive. Lord Halsbury laid the principles thus.\n",
        "p_47": "whether in selling the bottle a person is likely to be deceived by the resemblance of the one thing to the other; and if a person is so careless that he does not look, and does not...treat the label fairly' but takes the bottle without sufficient consideration and without reading what is written very plainly indeed upon the face of the label on which the trader has placed his own name, then you certainly cannot say he is deceived.... The whole question in these cases is whether the thing - taken in its entirety, looking at the whole thing - is such that in the ordinary course of things a person with reasonable apprehension and with proper eyesight would be deceived.\n",
        "p_48": "This guidance has been followed and applied ever since in get up cases including in : J.B. Williams Co. v. H. Bronnley & Co. Ltd.(1909) 26 R.P.C. 765, 771, per Cozens Hardy M.R.; Jones Brothers Ltd. v. Anglo-American Optical Co. (1912) 29 R.P.C. 361, 366, per Cozens Hardy M.R.; Smith's Potato Crisps Ltd. v. Paige Potato Crisps Ltd. (1928) 45 R.P.C. 132, 146, per Lord Hanworth M.R., Sargant L.J., at p. 149 and Lawrence L.J., at p. 151; John Haig & Co. Ltd. v. Forth Blending Co. Ltd.

        "p_49": "37. In 1978 RPC 635 (PC) Colgate - Palmolive Ltd. v. K.F. Pattron, the plaintiff was selling toothpaste as 'Colgate' while the defendant adopted the trademark 'Fringate'. The plaintiff was using packages with colours red, white and dark blue while the respondent also used red, white and blue. In this case, it was held that the defendant borrowed features from the plaintiffs packaging, tubes and labels and that the ordinary purchaser of normal memory was not to be expected to examine the goods keeping them side by side, and the get up would cause confusion. The name used by the defendant was also found to be deceptively similar and the court applied the question of failing in imperfect memory of the customer because the purchaser could be a person who would not be able to discern whether the toothpaste was 'Colgate' or 'Fringate'.\n",
        "p_50": "38. So far as confectionery items in the nature of sweets are concerned, I find that the pronouncement reported at (1959) RPC 355 Tayener Rutledge Ltd. v. Specters Ltd. indubitably would be instructive. Both parties sold sweets which were called \"fruit drops\" in decorated tins. The fruit drops were sold under the names 'Tayener fruit flavour drops' and 'Specter fruit flavour drops' respectively. However, the court found that if the box in which they were sold, was examined, the trade dress was too prominent and the names were not that prominent. The pictures of the sweets on the top of the boxes was so similar and was spread over the entire face of the box. As a result, it was held that this was a case of deliberate copying and offending the plaintiff's copyright. It was also held that there was infringement of the registered trademark and that a person with imperfect memory could be easily misled Page 1611 by the arrangement of the picture of the sweets on the top of the box. On these findings, the injunction was granted.\n",
        "p_51": "39. In Monday v. Carey (1905) 22 RPC 273, in the appellant's mark, there was an ace of clubs' with the word 'clubs' upon bottles which were sold with the label 'Club Black Enamel'. The defendant sold their product likewise with 'ace of spades' and the label \"Hub Black Enamel\" it was held by the court 'hub' and 'club' were similar and likely to create confusion. Here injunction was granted on the ground of fraudulent get up of the defendant's product also.\n",
        "p_52": "40. Mr. S.K. Bansasl, learned Counsel for the defendant has also placed strong reliance on the pronouncement of the learned Single Judge of this Court reported at 1998 PTC (18) 372 Samsonite Corporation v. Vijay Sales. In this case, the court on facts, arrived at a conclusion that the plaintiffs had not established any distinctive trade dress at all and that the colour, shape and other features referred to by the plaintiff are quite common. It was further held that by merely looking at the products of the plaintiff and the defendant, it was possible to easily distinguish the same and that the colour alone could not be the sole factor for arriving at a conclusion of passing off in favor of the plaintiff. In the facts of the case, the court had declined the prayer for injunction.\n",

Before this court, the product is chocolate tablets sold in packaging valued as Rupees One only. Certainly the considerations which would require to be gone into examination of the suitcase as against chocolate tablets would be different.\n",
        "p_72": "42. In yet another case reported at AIR 1972 SCR 1359 Parle Products (P). Ltd. v. J.P. & Co., Mysore the plaintiff was the manufacturer of biscuits and confectionery and owner of certain registered trademarks. One of them was the word \"Gluco\" used on their half pound biscuit packet. Another registered trademark of theirs was the wrapper with its colour scheme, general set up and entire colloconation of words registered under the Trademarks Act, 1940. They had filed an action for infringement of their registered trademark against the defendant on the allegation that they discovered in March, 1961 that Page 1613 the defendants were manufacturing, selling and offering for sale biscuits in a wrapper which according to them was deceptively similar to their registered trademark. The trial and the appellate court held against the plaintiff. In the appeal before the apex Court, the court placed reliance on its earlier pronouncement in Durgadutt v. Navratra Laboratories (supra) and in Kerly's Law of Trademarks at Trade (9th Edition paragraph 838) and held thus:\n",
        "p_73": "Two marks, when placed side by side, may exhibit many and various differences yet the main idea left on the mind by both may be the same. A person acquainted with one mark, and not having the two side by side for comparison, might well be deceived, if the goods were allowed to be impressed with the second mark, into a belief that he was dealing with goods which bore the same mark as that with which he was acquainted. Thus, for example, a mark may represent a game of football; another mark may show players in a different dress, and in very different positions, and yet the idea conveyed by each might be simply a game of football. It would be too much to expect that persons dealing with trademarked goods, and relying, as they frequently do, upon marks, should be able to remember the exact details of the marks upon the goods with which they are in the habit of dealing. Marks are remembered rather by general impressions or by some significant detail than by any photographic recollection of the whole. More-over, variations in detail might well be supposed by customers to have been made by the owners of the trademark they are already acquainted with for reasons of their own.\n",
        "p_74": "It is therefore clear that in order to come to the conclusion, whether one mark is deceptively similar to another, the broad and essential features of the two are to be considered they should not be placed side by side to find out if there are any differences in the design and if so, whether they are of such character as to prevent one design from being mistaken for the other. It would be enough if the impugned mark bears such an overall similarity to the registered mark as would be likely to mislead a person usually dealing with one to accept the other if offered to him. In this case we find that the packets are practically of the same size, the colour scheme of the two wrappers is almost the same; the design on both though not identical bears such a close resemblance that one can easily be mistaken for the other. The essential features of both are that there is a girl with one arm raised and carrying something in the other with a cow or cows near her and hens or chickens in the foreground. In the background there is a farm house with a fence the word \"Gluco Biscuits\" in one and \"Glucose Biscuits\" on the other occupy a prominent place at the top with a good deal of similarity between the two writings. Anyone in our opinion who has a look at one of the packets today may easily mistake the other if shown on another day as being the same article which he had seen before. If one was not careful enough to note the peculiar features of the wrapper on the plaintiffs' goods, he might easily mistake the defendants' wrapper for the plaintiffs' if shown to him some time after he had seen the plaintiffs\". After all, an ordinary purchaser is not gifted with the powers of observation of a Sherlock Page 1614 Homes. We have therefore no doubt that the defendants' wrapper is deceptively similar to the plaintiffs' which was registered.\n",
        "p_75": "43. This matter deserves to be considered from another aspect as well. So far as commercial products are concerned, it is equally well settled that what has to be seen is not that there is not a possibility of confusion but that the resemblance is such that there is a reasonable probability of deception. Courts have extensively dealt with the impact of the defendant's action on different classes of consumers. There may be the more careful or discerning purchaser or another who goes by general impressions. In AIR 1943 Lahore 196 Modi Sugar Mills Limited v. Tata Oil Mills Ltd., the Privy Council approving the test laid down by Niamat Ullah J. in Thomas Bear and Sons (India) Ltd. v. Pravag Narain  observed that \"in the judging of the probability of deception, the test is not whether the ignorant the thoughtless, or the incautious purchaser is likely to be misled, but we have to consider the average purchaser buying with ordinary caution.\" It is necessary to bear in mind that in infringement of trade marks in pharmaceutical goods, injunctions has been issued based on the possibility of confusion.\n",
        "p_76": "44. The principle in this behalf was further elucidated by the Division Bench. Placing reliance on James Chadwick & Bros. Ltd. v. The National Sewing Thread Co. Ltd. , Chagla CJ and Bhagwati; referring to the words \"likely to deceive or cause confusion\" in Section 10 of the Trade Marks Act, 1940, observed at page 152 as follows:\n",
        "p_77": " Now in deciding whether a particular trade mark is likely to deceive or cause confusion, it is not sufficient merely to compare it with the trade mark which is already registered and whose proprietor is offering opposition to the registration of the former trade mark. What is important is to find out what is the distinguishing or essential feature of the trade mark already registered and what is the main feature of the main idea underlying that trade mark, and if it is found that the trade mark whose registration is sought contains the same distinguishing or essential feature or conveys the same idea, then ordinarily the Registrar would be right if he came to the conclusion that the trade mark should not be registered. The real question is as to how a purchaser who must be looked upon as an average man of ordinary intelligence, would react to a particular trademark, what association he would form by looking at the trademark, and in what respect he would connect the trade mark with the goods which he would be purchasing. It is impossible to accept that a man looking at a trade mark would take in every single feature of the trademark. The question would be, what would he normally retain in his mind after looking at the trade mark? What would be the salient feature of the trade mark which in future would lead him to associate the particular goods with that trademark?\n",
        "p_78": "The court had thereafter culled out the principles which would apply hereunder:\n",
        "p_79": " In an action for an alleged infringement of a registered trade mark, it has first to be seen whether the impugned mark of the defendant is Page 1615 identical with the registered mark of the plaintiff. If the mark is found to be identical, no further question arises, and it has to be held that there was infringement. If the mark of the defendant is not identical, it has to be seen whether the mark of the defendant is deceptively similar in the sense that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion in relation to goods in respect of which the plaintiff got his mark registered. For that purpose, the two marks have to be compared, \"not by placing them side by side, but by asking itself whether having due regard to relevant surrounding circumstances, the defendant's mark as used is similar to the plaintiff's mark as it would be remembered by persons possessed of an average memory with its usual imperfections\", and it has then to be determined whether the defendant's mark is likely to deceive or cause confusion for such determination, the distinguishing or essential features (and not every detail) of the two marks and the main idea, if any, underlying the two marks which a purchaser of average intelligence and imperfect memory would retain in his mind after seeing the marks, have to be noticed. It has then to be seen whether they are broadly the same or there is an overall similarity or resemblance, and whether the resemblance or similarity is such that there is a reasonable probability of deception or confusion. In doing so, the approach has to be from the point of view of purchaser of average intelligence and imperfect memory or recollection, and not an ignorant, thoughtless and incautious purchaser. In an action for passing off, the test for deceptive similarity, i.e. as to the likelihood of confusion or deception arising from similarity of the marks of the get up, packing etc. is practically the same as in an action for infringement vide Edwards v. Dennis (1885) 30 Ch. D 454 471(9) Lambert and Butler Ltd. v. Good body (1902) 19 R.P.C. 377, 383 (10) Addley Bourne v. Swan & Edgar Ltd; (1903) R.P.C. 105, 117 (11) and Tavener Rut Ledge Ltd. v. Specters Ltd. (1959) R.P.C. 355, 360 (12), except that it has also to be seen whether the defendant's mark or the get up, packing, etc. of his goods has besides the essential features of the plaintiff's mark or goods, any additional features which distinguish it from the plaintiff mark or goods, and whether it is likely of reasonably probable that the defendant can pass off his goods as those of the plaintiff to a purchaser of average intelligence and imperfect memory or recollection.\n",
        "p_80": "45. The defendant has adopted a pillow pack which is almost identical to that of the plaintiff. To a person of even average intelligence and imperfect recollection, the overall structural and phonetic similarity as also the similarity of the concept and idea in the two marks is reasonably likely to cause a confusion between them.\n",
        "p_81": "46. There is yet another aspect to this matter. The price of each pillow pack is not very high. From the pillow pack of the defendant, it would appear that the product is being sold for Rs. 1 only. Thus the purchaser would spend scanty time in examination of the product in question or the brand which appears on it. It is not a matter of a well planned purchase. Confectionery of this size would have a fair degree of spontaneity which would render it easily possible for vendor to pass off the products of the defendants as if they were products of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_82": "Page 1616\n \n\n",
        "p_83": "47. Before this court, the plaintiff has given figures of the sales of its products and also sales of the chocolate tablets which have been sold under the mark 'GEMS' by it. According to the plaint, the approximate sales promotion figures of the goods sold under the trademark GEMS in India for the last five years commencing from the year 2000. The sales of this product under the trademark GEMS have grown from Rs. 339.4 million in 2000 to Rs. 497.4 millions in the year 2004. The plaintiff has also stated that it has spent Rs. 12.5 millions on sales promotional activities in the year 2000 which expenditure has grown to Rs. 22.8 millions in the year 2004. So far as the sales figures for the brand Cadbury Gems for the year 2000 to 2005 are concerned, the plaintiffs have placed a certificate issued by Mr. Neeraj Anand, Chartered Accountant from M/s Niraj Anand & Co. who had certified that from the records and documents maintained by Cadbury India Limited, the sales figures for the brand Cadbury Gems for the years 2000 was to the tune of Rs. 38 crores in the year 2000 which has increased to Rs. 61 crores in the year 2005. So far as the volume of the sales of Cadbury Gems during this period is concerned, the same has grown from 1.31 tonnes in the year 2000 to 2716 tonnes in the year 2005.\n",
        "p_84": "My attention has also been drawn to the annual reports of Cadbury India Limited for the years 2000-2002. In the annual report for the year 2000 of Cadbury India Limited, it has been noticed that the product 'GEMS' continued to drive the market with a lot of special promotional offers and product give aways to kids. The product and the label have also been prominently displayed in the annual report for the year 2001 and thereafter till 2005.\n",
        "p_85": "Therefore, the plaintiff has placed on record material not only with regard to the sales of all products of the plaintiff but also of the chocolates tablets under the trade mark 'Gems' as well as the volume of such sales. The plaintiff has also placed the details of the voluminous expenditure incurred on promotional activities undertaken by it. This documentation is certainly prima facie evidence of the popularity of the plaintiff's products, its reputation in the market and attached goodwill.\n",
        "p_86": "48. In the instant case a consumer would generally recollect the wrapper of the plaintiff and the image of chocolate tablets exploding from the centre of the multi coloured chocolate tablets exploding from the centre of the blue coloured pack, some of which have the centres showing. The packaging adopted by the defendant is also pillow pack which is identical in size, shape, colours and get up and conveys the same idea. The intention of the defendant in copying the same is clearly dishonest and intended to ride on the goodwill, reputation and popularity of the plaintiff's products entitling the plaintiff to sustain its passing off action against the defendant. The defendant is prima facie also violating thereby the copyright of the plaintiff in the artistic work of plaintiff's packaging.\n",
        "p_87": "49. It is trite that the resemblance between the trademark and the labels may be phonetic, visual or in the basic idea represented by the plaintiff's mark. It is equally well settled that the comparison which has to be conducted by the court is for determining whether the essential features of the plaintiff's Page 1617 trademark are to be found in that use by the defendant. It is the identification of such essential features of the mark on which depends the judgment of the court based on the material placed before it.\n",
        "p_88": "50. In the present case, the plaintiff has based its case not only on a plea of dishonest adoption of a packaging which was similar to that of the plaintiff but also urged that adoption of the trademark \"JAMES BOND\" was actionable as infringement of the plaintiff's trademark. For these submissions, I find that the pronouncement reported at  Amritdhara Pharmacy v. Satya Deo Gupta, throws valuable light on the issues raised. In this case, the question was whether the trade name \"Lakshmandhara\" was likely to deceive the public or cause confusion to trade in view of the trade name \"Amritdhara\" which had already been registered as a trade name. The Supreme Court referring to the earlier decision in Corn Products Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food Products Ltd. , held that the overall similarity of the two composite words must be considered, that the question has to be approached from the point of view of a man of average intelligence and imperfect recollection, and that to such a man the overall structural and phonetic similarity of the two names \"Amritdhara\" and \"Lakshmandhara\" was likely to deceive or cause confusion. In the Amritdhara case supra, the court has held thus:\n",
        "p_89": " As we said in Corn Products Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food Products Ltd.  the question has to be approached from the point of view of a man of average intelligence and imperfect recollection. To such a man the overall structural and phonetic similarity of the two names \"Amritdhara\" and \"Lakshmandhara\" is, in our opinion, likely to deceive or cause confusion. We must consider the overall similarity of the two composite words \"Amritdhara\" and \"Lakshmandhara\". We do not think that the learned Judges of the High Court were right in saying that no Indian would mistake one for the other. An unwary purchaser of average intelligence and imperfect recollection would not, as the High Court supposed, slot the name into its component parts and consider the etymological meaning thereof or even consider the meaning of the composite words as 'current of nectar' or 'current of Lakshman'. He would go more by the overall structural and phonetic similarity and the nature of the medicine he has previously purchased, or has been told about, or about which has otherwise learnt and which he wants to purchase.... We are aware that the admission of a mark is not to be refused, because usually stupid people, \"fools or idiots\", may be deceived. A critical comparison of the two names may disclose some points of the two names may disclose some points of difference but an unwary purchaser of average intelligence and imperfect recollection would be deceived by the overall similarity of the two names having regard to the nature of the medicine he is looking for with a somewhat vague recollection that he had purchased a similar medicine on a previous occasion with a similar name.\n",
        "p_90": "Page 1618\n \n\n",
        "p_91": "51. An objection has been taken by the learned Counsel for the defendant that the plaintiff has registration in the trade mark 'CADBURY GEMS' as a whole and that it cannot claim any exclusive rights in the word 'GEMS' independent of the word 'CADBURYS'. In this behalf, it would be useful to consider certain binding judicial precedents wherein the court had occasion to consider similar objections.\n",
        "p_92": "In  K.R. Chinna Krishna Chettiar v. Sri Ambal and Co. and Anr. the plaintiff had urged that the trademark 'Sri Andal' being adopted by the defendant was deceptively similar to the trademark 'Sri Ambal' of the plaintiff and an injunction was prayed for. It was held by the court that there was striking similarity and affinity of sound between the words 'Andal' and 'Ambal'. The court held that though there was no visual resemblance between the two marks but ocular comparison is not always the decisive test. The resemblance between the two marks must be considered with reference to the ear as well as eye. The name Andal does not cease to be deceptively similar because it is used in conjunction with a pictorial device. The court placed reliance on the observations of the court in De Cordova v. Vick Chemical Co. 68 RPC 103, in which Vick Chemical Coy were the proprietors of the registered trademark consisting of the word 'Vaporub' and another registered trademark consisting of a design of which the words 'Vick Vaporub Salve' formed a part. The defendants had advertised their ointment as 'Karsote Vapour Rub'. It was held that the defendants had infringed the registered marks. In this case, Lord Radcliffe said \"...a mark is infringed by another trader if, even without using the whole of it upon or in connection with his goods, he uses one or more of its essential features\".\n",
        "p_93": "The court considered the realities of the fact that even though 'Sri Andal' and 'Sri Ambal' were two divinities and that the pictorial devices on the goods of the respondent were different, however, it could not be lose track of the fact that the customers of the plaintiff were persons of religious denominations other than Hindus whose business was not confined to South of India where the people may know the difference between the two divinities. The trademarks had no direct reference to the character and quality of snuff and consequently, the customers would have a recollection of only the essential features. The court was therefore persuaded to grant an injunction in favor of the plaintiff against the use of the trademark by the defendant.\n",
        "p_94": "52. In a Division Bench pronouncement of the Madras High Court reported at 2006 (32) PTC 434 (Madras) (DB) Devi Pesticides Pvt. Ltd. v. Shiv Agro Chemicals Industries, the plaintiff had claimed exclusive proprietorship over the trademark BOOMPLUS and BOOM FLOWER, an injunction was prayed against the defendant who was selling its goods by use of the trademark SUPERBOOM. The defendant's trademark SUPERBOOM was an unregistered mark. It was also noticed that phonetic similarity would constitute trademark Page 1619 infringement and that the users of the products of the parties being illiterate farmers and the common man, it was held that an ordinary average person would not be able to make out the difference between the plaintiff's goods and the defendant's goods. Placing reliance on Section 29(5) of the Trademark Act, it was held that the statutory provisions make it clear that even if a part of the registered trademark is used by the defendant, it would amount to infringement. In this case, BOOM was an essential part of the registered trademark of the plaintiff which was incorporated in the defendant's trademark.\n",
        "p_95": "53. The courts have also protected rights of a trader who is claiming proprietary rights over numeral trademarks. In 2003 (27) PTC 63 (Delhi) Shaw Wallace & Co. Ltd. and Anr. v. Superior Industries Ltd., the plaintiff had urged that the defendant's trademark 'HAYWARDS 5000' was an illegal infringement of its registered trademark 'HAYAWARDS 5000 SUPER STRONG BEER'. It was primarily urged that the use of the numeral 5000 by the defendant was with the intention of cashing in on the reputation of the plaintiff acquired in the business which it was conducting under its registered trademark of which 5000 was an essential part. Reiterating the test laid down in the judicial pronouncements afore-noticed, apart from regard being had to the relevant surroundings, the consensus in order to assess as to whether the defendant's mark is similar to the plaintiff, the court had emphasised the imperfect memory of an average consumer. In this behalf, it was urged that in an action for infringement, for the success by the plaintiff, he need not prove that the whole of his registered trademark has been copied. He can also succeed, if, he shows that the mark used by the defendant is similar to the mark of the plaintiff as it would be remembered by persons possessed of an average memory with its usual imperfection or that its essential particulars or the distinguishing or essential feature has been copies.\n",
        "p_96": "54. To the same effect was the pronouncement rendered by the learned Single Judge in AIR 1987 Delhi 312 Vrajlal Manilal & Co. v. N.S. Bidi Co. and Anr.\n",
        "p_97": "55. In the light of the principles laid down, the objection of the defendant is certainly misconceived, it has to be held that the plaintiff is entitled to maintain the claim in respect of the word 'GEMS'.\n",
        "p_98": "56. In the instant case, this Court is concerned with the sale of small chocolate tablets which have hard coating of different colours. The plaintiff has defined the products in issue as \"chocolate and confectionery\". It is undisptued that these products are sold over the counter through general merchants and shops of all kinds and magnitude. The purchaser of such goods range from literate, to semi-literate to completely illiterate people and children. The consumer of these goods would undoubtedly be in a large segment, children who are not discerning and would be indiscriminate in their purchasing. A purchasing public would to a large extent be a population which is unable to read the English language. The plaintiff has placed extensive figures of the voluminous sales of this product effected by it in order to evidence the popularity of this brand of its products.\n",
        "p_99": "Page 1620\n \n\n",
        "p_100": "57. The plaintiff is selling the product under the trademark 'GEMS'. The defendant has adopted the trademark 'JAMES BOND'. 'GEMS' and 'JAMES' are not words which have originated in any Indian language. Both are English words and when pronounced by an Englishman, may be distinct or different. However, the pronunciation of these words by the English or an educated Indian with good English diction may not be the same as the pronunciation or comprehension of an illiterate or a semi literate person in our country. The intonation and the emphasis on the vowels in the English language words when spoken by persons from different parts of the country also varies. Even the shopkeepers who are storing the products of the plaintiff and the defendant may not necessarily be literate and well versed in diction or pronunciation. The variation in the pronunciation between the 'GEMS' and 'JAMES' is to be found in the emphasis laid to the vowel \"e\" in 'GEMS' and \"a\" in 'JAMES'. The variation is extremely slight and capable of being easily overlooked. Learned Counsel for the plaintiff has also pointed out that when scripted in Devnagiri, the two words are written identically.\n",
        "p_101": "It is nobody's case that the products are purchased by any written description or writing or that customers would spell out the words to the shopkeeper.\n",
        "p_102": "There is good possibility that the consumer believes that 'James' is a variation of 'Gems' effected by the manufacturer itself.\n",
        "p_103": "58. In the light of the foregoing discussion, I have no hesitation in holding that the phonetic similarity between GEMS and JAMES is such as would capable of causing deception in the minds of this consuming public and causing confusion between the products of the defendant being associated with the products of the plaintiff. It has to be so held when the question of deciding similarity between the two marks is approached from the point of view of a man of average intelligence and of imperfect recollection.\n",
        "p_104": "59. The plaintiff has pointed out that it had set up a campaign in order to promote sales of gems under the name and style of 'JAMES BOND' in respect of which it has even a registered copyright. The defendant is stated to have adopted the name JAMES BOND only thereafter.\n",
        "p_105": "The plaintiff has averred that this character in respect of which it has copyright registration, has been extensively used by the plaintiff for promotion of its gems branded products.\n",
        "p_106": "The defendant has rendered no explanation at all as to why it has adopted the trademark 'JAMES BOND' in relation to its products and in the afore noticed background, the only conclusion to be derived there from is the dishonest effort of the defendant to ride on the plaintiff's reputation and goodwill in its products sold under the trademark gems and in respect of which it had undertaken the campaign 'JAMES BOND'.\n",
        "p_107": "60. The persons who would be deceived by the resemblance are the purchasers of the goods and it is the likelihood of their being deceived that has to be the subject matter of consideration. There is no hard and fast rule with regard to the degree of resemblance which is necessary to exist to cause deception and it is not possible to define the same or lay down parameters or objectives standards as to what would constitute deception to entitle a plaintiff to an Page 1621 injunction in an infringement action. The resemblance may be phonetic, visual or in the basic idea represented in the plaintiff's mark. The comparison which is to be conducted by the court is for the purposes of determining whether the essential features of the plaintiff's trademark are to be found in that used by the defendant. It is well settled that the identification of the essential features of the mark or label is in fact an essence a question of fact that depends on the judgment of the court based on the evidence lead before it as regards the usage of the trade. The object of the enquiry in the ultimate analysis is as to whether the mark used by the defendant as a whole as deceptively similar to that of the registered mark of the plaintiff. The test of likelihood of confusion or deception arising from similarity of marks is the same for infringement action as well as for a passing off action Ref :  Ruston & Hornbi Limited v. Zamindara Engineering Co.\n",
        "p_108": "61. The defendant has claimed that it has been in the trade and business of confectioneries for the last 50 years and has adopted the trademark/label in the year 1979 and for this reason also no injunction should be granted. A continuous use since then has been claimed. However, no documentation in respect of the adoption of such mark or label or sales there under has been placed before the court. The plaintiff has urged that it learnt the acts of the defendant which have been complained of in the plaint, only in the year 2005. My attention has been drawn to the documents filed by the defendants. I find that earliest document which has been filed by the defendant is only of the year 2002. Even in the documents filed, there is nothing to evidence the extent of sales in terms of either volume or of any value. The defendants have placed certain bills on record which relate to the period between 2002 to 2004 wherein some sales of a product by the name JAMES BOND have been reflected. The defendant has placed reliance on its application made on 9th August, 2002 to the Registrar of Trademarks which has been placed before this court. In this application it has been stated that it is in business since 1979. However, such bald claim is unsupported by any documentary or other evidence prima facie does not inspire any confidence.\n",
        "p_109": "62. Mr. C.M. Lall, learned Counsel for the plaintiff, has urged that even assuming that the case set up by the defendant so far as the period of its use is accepted, would not impact the consequence of the infringement of the trademark and copyright and the plaintiff is entitled to the injunction. I find that in the pronouncement reported at 2004 (28) PTC 121 (SC) Midas Hygiene Industries P. Ltd. and Anr. v. Sudhir Bhatia and Ors. it was held by the court thus:\n",
        "p_110": " 5. The law on the subject is well settled. In cases of infringement either of Trade Mark or of Copyright normally an injunction must follow. Mere delay in bringing action is not sufficient to defeat grant of injunction in such cases. The grant of injunction also becomes necessary if it prima facie appears that the adoption of the Mark was itself dishonest.\n",
        "p_111": "Page 1622\n \n\n",
        "p_112": "63. This issue had also fallen for consideration before this Court in the pronouncement reported at 1989 PTC 61 Hindustan Pencils Pvt. Ltd. v. India Stationery Products Co. and Anr. wherein the court succinctly laid down the principles thus:\n",
        "p_113": "29. It would appear to be difficult to accept that relief of temporary injunction should not be granted, because of the delay on the part of the plaintiff, even though the court feels, at that point of time, that ultimately permanent injunction will have to be granted.\n",
        "p_114": "30. Even though there may be some doubt as to whether laches or acquiescence can deny the relief of a permanent injunction, judicial opinion has been consistent in holding that if the defendant acts fraudulently with the knowledge that he is violating the plaintiff's rights then in that case, even if there is an inordinate delay on the part of the plaintiff in taking action against the defendant, the relief of injunction is not denied. The defense of laches or inordinate delay is a defense in equity. In equity both the parties must come to the Court with clean hands. An equitable defense can be put up by a party who has acted fairly and honestly. A person who is guilty of violating the law or infringing or usurping somebody else's right cannot claim the continued misuse of the usurped right. It was observed by Romer, J. in the matter of an application brought by J.R. Parkington and Coy. Ltd., 63 R.P.C. 171 at page 181 that \"in my judgment, the circumstances which attend the adoption of a trade mark in the first instance are of considerable importance when one comes to consider whether the use of that mark has or has not been a honest user. If the user in its inception was tainted it would be difficult in most cases to purify it subsequently\". It was further noted by the learned Judge in that case that he could not regard the equitable relief will be afforded only to that party who is not guilty of a fraud and whose conduct shows that there had been, on his part, an honest concurrent user of the mark in question. If a party, for no apparent or a valid an reason, adopts, with or without modifications, a mark belonging to another, whether registered or not, it will be difficult for that party to avoid an order of injunction because the 'Court may rightly assume that such adoption of the mark by the party was not an honest one. The Court would be justified in concluding that the defendant, in such an action, wanted to cash in on the plaintiff's name and reputation and that was the sole, primary or the real motive of the defendant adopting such a mark. Even if, in such a case, there may be an inordinate delay on the part of the plaintiff in bringing a suit for injunction, the application of the plaintiff for an interim injunction cannot be dismissed on the ground that the defendant has been using the mark for a number of years. Dealing with this aspect Harry D. Nims in his \"The Law of Unfair Competition and Trade-Marks\", Fourth Edition, volume Two at page 1282 noticed as follows:\n",
        "p_115": "Where infringement is deliberate and willful and the defendant acts fraudulently with knowledge that he is violating plaintiff's rights, essential elements of estoppel are lacking and in such a case the protection of plaintiff's rights by injunctive relief never is properly Page 1623 denied. \"The doctrine of estoppel can only be invoked to promote fair dealings.\"\n",
        "p_116": "31. It would appear to me that where there is an honest concurrent user by the defendant then inordinate delay or laches may defeat the claim of damages or rendition of accounts but the relief of injunction should not be refused. This so because it is the interest of the general public, which is the third party for such cases, which has to be kept in mind. In the case of inordinate delay or laches, as distinguished from the case of an acquiescence, the main prejudice which may be caused to the defendant is that by reasons of the plaintiff not acting at an earlier point of time the defendant has been able to establish his business by using the infringing mark. Inordinate delay or laches may be there because the plaintiff may not be aware of the infringement by the defendant or the plaintiff may consider such infringement by the defendant as not being serious enough to hurt the plaintiff's business. Nevertheless, if the Court comes to the conclusion that prejudice is likely to be caused to the general public who may be mislead into buying the goods manufactured by the defendant thinking them to be the goods of the plaintiff then an injunction must be issued. The Court may, in appropriate cases, allow some time to the defendants to sell off their existing stock but an injunction should not be denied.\n",
        "p_117": "64. The principle which thus applies to consideration of a plaintiff's application for injunction based on trademark infringement is premised on the public interest in addition to the loss and damage which may result to the plaintiff by the offending acts of the defendant.\n",
        "p_118": "65. It now becomes necessary to consider the oral submissions on behalf of the defendant that no trademark rights or significance is attached to the word 'GEMS' and the device of tablets strewn around it, and that this word is not a trademark and is descriptive and generic in nature which is common to the trade and business of confectionery.\n",
        "p_119": "It would be useful to notice the dictionary meaning of the word 'gem' also. I find that the New Webster's Dictionary and Thesaurus of the English Language (Lexicon Publications, Inc., 1971) defines the expression 'gem' as follows:\n",
        "p_120": " a precious stone especially when cut and polished for ornament; an engraved precious or semi-precious stone; something treasured particularly, the gem of the collection; someone who ought to be treasured; a work of art that is small and exquisite and; an old size of type, between brillient and diamond.\n",
        "p_121": "Again, the New Oxford American Dictionary (1st Edition) defines gem as precious or semi-precious stone especially when cut and polished or engraved; a person or thing considered to be outstandingly good or special in some respect; used in names of brilliantly coloured humming birds.\n",
        "p_122": "The Columbia Encyclopedia (Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, published by Columbia University Press) defines gem as \"commonly, a mineral or organic substance, cut and polished and used as an ornament. Gems also used as seals (items of assurance) and as talismans (goodluck charms)\".\n",
        "p_123": "Page 1624\n \n\nThe word gem, therefore, is certainly not descriptive of chocolates or sugar coated chocolates manufactured by any party.\n",
        "p_124": "66. It has been urged that the entire colour combination, get up, lay out and trade dress is commonly used by the confectionery industry and no monopoly or exclusive rights can be claimed over the same in the lay out, trade dress and device. In this behalf, during the course of arguments, learned Counsel for the defendant has handed over a copy of the trade dress of a product sold by M/s Nestle's as 'SMARTIES' urging that the same is identical to that of the plaintiff. I find that in the written statement, the defendant has drawn no similarity so far as the products sold as SMARTIES is concerned. The same has been handed over only during the course of submissions. This document has not even filed in record in accordance with law. Therefore as per established procedure such plea deserves to be rejected outright. However, I find that even as per the principles laid down in  Corn Products Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food Products Ltd., the Apex Court had clearly observed in para 13 that before a person can seek to derive assistance for the success of his application from the presence of number of marks having one or common features which occur in it mark, he has to prove that these marks had acquired a reputation by user in the market. There is no pleading or documentation placed on record by the defendant before this Court so far as the Nestle's mark is concerned to evidence extensive user or reputation acquired by it consequently in my view nothing material in the present case can turn on this plea.\n",
        "p_125": "67. The main plank of the defendant's submission has been that the plaintiff has not disclosed the disclaimers by the registrar of trademark on the trademark registration granted to it. Reliance has been placed on the judicial pronouncement reported at 2000 PTC 326 Om Prakash Gupta v. Praveen Kumar in this behalf.\n",
        "p_126": "68. There is no dispute that the registration of the plaintiff which have been granted to the plaintiff bearing No. 249360 on 20th May, 1968 in Class 30 for CADBURY MILK CHOCOLATES GEMS '(Word)' contained the disclaimer on the exclusive right to use 'GEMS'. On the registration bearing No. 249841, there is an additional disclaimer regarding the use the device of tablets. However, it is undisputed that the plaintiff No. 1 has a registration dated 21st September, 1973 in respect of 'CADBURY's GEMS' Label bearing No. 291026 in Class 30 on which there is no such disclaimer. I find force in the submissions of the plaintiff that by this registration alone, the plaintiff is entitled to maintain an action for infringement of trademark against the defendant if it establishes that the defendant is dishonestly using a mark which is similar to the plaintiff's registered mark.\n",
        "p_127": "69. So far as the disclaimer is concerned the purpose of such a disclaimer on a registration certificate has fallen for judicial interpretation and consideration before the Supreme Court. In its pronouncement reported at  Registrar of Trademark v. Ashok Chandra Rakhit, on the issue the Apex Court held thus:\n",
        "p_128": "Page 1625\n  \n\n",
        "p_129": "8. The third thing to note is that the avowed purpose of the section is not to confer any direct benefit on the rival traders or the general public but to define the rights of the proprietor under the registration. The registration of a trade mark confers substantial advantages on its proprietor as will appear from the sections grouped together in Chapter IV under the heading \"Effect of Registration\". It is however a notorious fact that there is a tendency on the part of some proprietors to get the operation of their trade marks expanded beyond their legitimate bounds. An illustration of an attempt of this kind is to be found in In re Smokeless Powder Co.'s Trade Mark 1892-1 Ch 590 (F).\n",
        "p_130": "Temptation has even led some proprietors to make an exaggerated claim to the exclusive of parts or matters contained in their trademarks in spite of the fact that they had expressly disclaimed the exclusive use of those parts or matters. Reference may be made to Greers Ltd. v. Pearman Corder Ltd. 1922-39 RPC 406 (G), commonly called the \"Banquet\" case. The real purpose of requiring a disclaimer is to define the rights of the proprietor under the registration so as to minimise, even if it cannot wholly eliminate, the possibility of extravagant and unauthorised claims being made on the score of registration of the trademarks.\n",
        "p_131": "So far as the disclaimer is concerned, it was pointed out in the above case that the proviso to Section 17 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 specifically states that the common law remedy would be available to a plaintiff who is entitled to bring a passing off action based on prior user of the trademark which has been granted registration subject to the disclaimer.\n",
        "p_132": "In this behalf, it would be appropriate to consider the provision of Section 17 of the Act of 1958 in extenso which reads thus:\n",
        "p_133": "17. Registration of trade marks subject to disclaimer:\n",
        "p_134": "If a trade mark-\n",
        "p_135": "(a) contains any part\n \n\n",
        "p_136": "(i) which is not the subject of a separate application the proprietor for registration as a trade mark; or\n \n\n",
        "p_137": "(ii) which is not separately registered by the proprietor as a trade mark; or\n \n\n",
        "p_138": "(b) contains any matter which is common to the trade or is otherwise of a non-distinctive character; the tribunal, in deciding whether the trade mark shall be entered or shall remain on the register, may require, as a condition of its being on the register, that the proprietor shall either disclaim any right to the exclusive use of such part or of all or any portion of such matter, as the case may be, to the exclusive use of which the tribunal holds him not to be entitled, or make such other disclaimer as the tribunal may consider necessary for the purpose of defining the rights of the proprietor under the registration:\n",
        "p_139": "Provided that no disclaimer shall affect any rights of the proprietor of a trade mark except such as arise out of the registration of the trade mark in respect of which the disclaimer is made.\n",
        "p_140": "Page 1626\n \n\n",
        "p_141": "70. The registrations of the trademark were granted to the plaintiffs under the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958.\n",
        "p_142": "71. The Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 has been replaced by the Trademarks Act, 1999 and there is a statutory provision incorporated by way of Section 18, application for registration which reads thus:\n",
        "p_143": "Section 18.\n",
        "p_144": "Application for registration. - (1) Any person claiming to be the proprietor of a trade mark used or proposed to be used by him, who is desirous of registering it, shall apply in writing to the Registrar in the prescribed manner for the registration of his trade mark.\n",
        "p_145": "(2) A single application may be made for registration of a trade mark for different classes of goods and services and fee payable therefore shall be in respect of each such class of goods or services.\n",
        "p_146": "(3) Every application under Sub-section (1) shall be filed in the office of the Trade Marks Registry within whose territorial limits the principal place of business in India of the applicant or in the case of joint applicants the principal place of business in India of the applicant whose name is first mentioned in the application as having a place of business in India, is situate:\n",
        "p_147": "Provided that where the applicant or any of the joint applicants does not carry on business in India, the application shall be filed in the office of the Trade Marks Registry within whose territorial limits the place mentioned in the address for service in India as disclosed in the application, is situate.\n",
        "p_148": "(4) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Registry may refuse the application or may accept it absolutely or subject to such amendments, modifications, conditions or limitations, if any, as he may think fit.\n",
        "p_149": "(5) In the case of a refusal or conditional acceptance of an application, the Registrar shall record in writing the grounds for such refusal or conditional acceptance and the materials used by him in arriving at his decision.\n",
        "p_150": "A reading of this statute shows that the expression disclaimer has been removed from the statute. However, the Registrar has been conferred the power to put such conditions or limitations for grant of the registration under Section 18(4) of the statute as it may deem fit in the facts and circumstances of the case.\n",
        "p_151": "72. My attention has been drawn to Registrar of Trademark v. Ashok Chandra Rakhit (supra) wherein the court was required to consider the question of the impact of a disclaimer and a trademark registration and the court had held thus:\n",
        "p_152": "9. The last feature of the section is its proviso. That proviso preserves in fact any right which the proprietor may otherwise under any other law have in relation to the mark or any part thereof. The disclaimer is only for the purposes of the Act. It does not affect the rights of the proprietor except such as arise out of registration. That is to say, the special advantages which the Act goes to the proprietor by reason of the Page 1627 registration of his trademark do not extend to the parts or matters which he disclaims. In short, the disclaimed parts or matters are not within the protection of the statute.\n",
        "p_153": "That circumstance, however, does not mean that the proprietor's rights, if any, with respect to those parts or matters would not be protected otherwise than under the Act. If the proprietor has acquired any right by long user of those parts or matters in connection with goods manufactured or sold by him or proof of the necessary facts, prevent an infringement of his rights by a passing off action or a prosecution under the Indian Penal Code Disclaimer does not affect those rights in any way.\n",
        "p_154": "73. By virtue of Section 27 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, a person has been conferred a statutory right of protection of its registered trademark. At the same time every person has a legal remedy for the protection of its common law rights in a trademark which has acquired distinctiveness by virtue of extensive and prolonged use; promotional activity and has goodwill and reputation attached to it. For this reason Section 17 of the Trademark & Merchandise Marks Act of 1958 statutorily prohibited the impact of the disclaimer when it stipulated that the disclaimer shall not affect the rights of trademark proprietor except those which arose out of the registration.\n",
        "p_155": "In my view, the new act i.e. the Trademarks Act, 1999 also does not in any manner impact the common law rights and remedies of the proprietor of a trademark which are not related to or arise out of any statutory registration of the trademark. The spirit, intendment and purpose of the Trademark legislation is to protection of the trader and consumer against dishonest adoption of another's well known trademark with the intention of capitalising on the attached reputation and goodwill or dishonest adoption of a trademark which is deceptively similar to the well known trademark. Certainly any other interpretation of the new Act would run counter to the basic intendment of the law.\n",
        "p_156": "The view I have taken is fortified by the expansion given under the Act of 1999. As per Section 27 of the earlier statutory provisions, provided passing off action only in respect of goods. Under the new act, passing off action has been made statutorily available to a person against another person for passing off goods or services as the goods of another person or as services provided by another person.\n",
        "p_157": "The impact of the disclaimer on a registration certificate is that a person is precluded from bringing an infringement action in respect of the trade mark registration. The statute did not prohibit in any manner the right given to a person to bring a passing off action in respect of a trade mark which though registered, but contains a disclaimer with regard to any portion thereof.\n",
        "p_158": "74. I find that Section 27(2) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 contains a non-obstante clause to the effect that nothing contained in the statute shall be deemed to effect the right of any person to bring an action against any person for passing off its goods as those of another. For this reason as well, the plaintiff cannot be precluded from maintaining a passing off action in respect of the trade marks which though registered, contain a disclaimer.\n",
        "p_159": "Page 1628\n \n\n",
        "p_160": "75. Another question which arises for consideration relates to the impact of the new Act on a registration with the disclaimer under the earlier law which was applicable at the time of the registration. No submissions have been addressed on this important issue which is left open for adjudication.\n",
        "p_161": "76. In the instant case, the plaintiff has relied on not only the registrations with the disclaimers but also on the fact that it has been using the trademark for the considerable period in the packaging which has been placed on record and its products have acquired distinctiveness by such trademark and by sale under such name and such packaging which is prima facie evidenced from the figures of sales placed before this court.\n",
        "p_162": "In this view of the matter, the principles laid down by the Apex Court would apply to the instant case as well.\n",
        "p_163": "77. I also find that the reliance placed by the defendant on the pronouncement of the learned Single Judge of this Court in Om Prakash Gupta v. Parveen Kumar and Anr. 2000 PTC 326 in the present case is also wholly misplaced. In this case the defendant has neither pleaded nor placed the documents on record which would have evidenced the disclaimer in the registration. The court also arrived at a conclusion that the trademark, infringement whereof is pleaded by the plaintiff, stood abandoned by the plaintiff itself for twenty years during which period, the defendant has commenced its business under the trademark without any objection from the plaintiffs. In the facts of the case, it was held that the plaintiff had abandoned the trademark and could not have asserted exclusive right against the defendants. The court consequently held that the plaintiff had not only concealed the material facts and documents but had made misrepresentation of facts and thereby misused the process of the court by fraudulent means. It was in this background that the injunction was denied to the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_164": "78. In the instant case, the plaintiff have placed reliance on the registration for the label granted to plaintiff No. 1 by way of registration certificate No. 291026 on the 21st September, 1973 which stands renewed till 21st September, 2008. This registration is not subject to a disclaimer. On the basis of this registration alone, the plaintiff was entitled to maintain the present suit on the allegations which have been laid against the defendant.\n",
        "p_165": "79. Even otherwise, I find that though the plaintiff has not specifically mentioned the disclaimer which has been imposed upon the plaintiff by the Registrar of Trademark on two of the registrations, however, the certificates issued by the Registrar of Trademark have been placed before this court. On these facts, I am of the view that the plaintiff cannot be non-suited on grounds of concealment of material facts and documents from this Court especially when it had a registration in respect of which there was no disclaimer.\n",
        "p_166": "80. The plaintiff who is a registered proprietor of a trademark by virtue of Section 21 of the Trademark Act of the certificate No. 291026 dated 21st September, 1973 in the 'CADBURY GEMS' label without any disclaimer. The plaintiff thus has a statutory remedy in the event of the use by the defendant of said mark or a colorable imitation thereof. This Court has arrived at a conclusion that the defendant's mark is phonetically close to an essential part of the plaintiff's trademark. The defendant has also adopted every essential Page 1629 feature of the label of the plaintiff and adopted a trademark which is deceptively similar to the plaintiff's trademark. Consequently, any points of difference or additional material adopted by the defendant would have no bearing so far as the case of infringement of the plaintiff's trademark by the defendant is concerned. Further, a purchaser of the product would not ask for 'Cadbury Gems' or 'James Bond'. While effecting a purchase the product of the plaintiff would be popularly asked for as 'Gems'. The defendant has adopted James which is undoubtedly phonetically similar to the plaintiff's trademark 'Gems' which is an essential part of the plaintiff's registered trademark.\n",
        "p_167": "81. In the light of the above, it is well settled that in cases of infringement of registered trademark or copyright normally the injunction must follow. Section 29 of the Trademark Act, 1999 mandate that in the case of similarity of name and identity of product, the plaintiff would be entitled to an injunction. I have prima facie arrived at a finding the mark JAMES BOND by the defendant was by itself dishonest and that the defendant has infringed the trademark of the plaintiff and its adoption. The defendant has also infringed the copyright of the plaintiff in its packaging. This case is consequently a fit case where interim injunction deserves to be granted.\n",
        "p_168": "82. The plaintiff has also asserted violation of its common law rights inasmuch as the defendant has adopted the get up, packing and similar writings and marking on the pillow packs. Mere display of a trade origin which is different from that of the plaintiff is not sufficient to distinguish the defendant's label from that of the plaintiff and may be immaterial having regard to the nature of the product.\n",
        "p_169": "In the light of the foregoing discussion, prima facie I find that the packaging adopted by the defendant is so similar to the plaintiff's case that there is every likelihood of the same deceiving unawary purchasers that the goods acts which they were purchasing were those of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_170": "In the light of this discussion, I have no hesitation in holding that the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case of dishonest passing off by the defendant of his goods as those of the plaintiff entitling it to grant of interlocutory injunction.\n",
        "p_171": "Accordingly, the defendants, its proprietors, partners, directors, servants, agents, distributors, franchisees, representatives and assigns are hereby restrained from using the trade mark JAMES and/or JAMES BOND and/or any other trade mark deceptively or confusingly similar to the plaintiff's registered trade mark GEMS or in any other manner infringing the registered trade mark GEMS of the plaintiffs and using the pillow-packs attached as annexure B to the plaint or any other packaging whatsoever which is deceptively or confusingly similar to the pillow-packs of the plaintiffs attached as annexure A to the plaint.\n",
        "p_172": "The defendants, its proprietors, partners, directors, servants, agents, distributors, franchisees, representatives and assigns are also restrained from passing off their goods of the plaintiff and from substantially reproducing any material form the copyright in the artistic work of the pillow-packs which has been annexed to the plaint.\n",
        "p_173": "This application is allowed in the above terms.\n"

It is the case of the \nservice providers (who are for the purposes of convenience \nreferred to in this judgment as \"petitioners\" irrespective of \nthe capacity in which they are arraigned in the several \nmatters before us) that there is no sale transaction involved \nand that the attempt of the several States to levy tax on the \nprovision of mobile phone facilities by them to subscribers \nwas constitutionally incompetent.

The Division Bench of the \nKerala High Court considered a situation where the State \nSales Tax Authorities sought to include the value of \nactivation charges in the sale price of the SIM (Subscribers \nIdentification Module) Card on the sale of which sales tax \nwas admittedly payable and had been paid. At the same \ntime  the Central Government sought to include the cost of \nthe SIM Card in the service tax which was also admittedly \npayable and had been paid by the service provider for the \nservice of activation of the SIM Card.   The High Court held \nthat the transaction of sale of a SIM Card included its \nactivation and that therefore the activation charges formed \npart of the consideration and could be subjected to sales tax \nunder the Kerala General Sales Tax Act.  At the same time \nthe selling of the SIM Card and the process of activation \nwere both services provided by the Mobile Cellular \nTelephone Companies to the subscribers and fell within the \ndefinition of taxable services as defined in sections 65(72)(b) \nof the Finance Act, 1994.

Janapada  \nSabha (1963) Supp.1 SCR 172 (referred to hereafter as \nAmalgamated Coalfields No.(2)), the issue was whether the \ndoctrine of res judicata applied to writ petitions filed under \nArticle 226 or to petitions under Article 32.  The Court \nnoted that the judicial view was that even petitions filed \nunder Article 32 were subject to the general principle of res \njudicata.  The Court then considered whether the principle \nwould apply to tax cases when the earlier decision was in \nrespect of a different period and said:-\n\"In a sense, the liability to pay tax from year to \nyear is a separate and distinct liability; it is \nbased on a different cause of action from year to \nyear, and if any points of fact or law are \nconsidered in determining the liability for a given \nyear, they can generally be deemed to have been \nconsidered and decided in a collateral and \nincidental way.\"\n",

That, however, is a matter on \nwhich it is unnecessary for us to pronounce a \ndefinite opinion in the present case.  In this \nconnection, it would be relevant to add that even \nif a direct decision of this Court on a point of law \ndoes not operate as res judicata  in a dispute for \na subsequent year, such a decision would, under \nArt. 141, have a binding effect not only on the \nparties to it, but also on all courts in India as a \nprecedent in which the law is declared by this \nCourt.  The question about the applicability of res \njudicata  to such a decision would thus be a \nmatter of merely academic significance\". \n(Emphasis ours)\n\nAfter refraining from expressing any final opinion on \nthe applicability of res judicata to assessment orders for \nsuccessive years, the Court was quite unequivocal in \nexpressing an opinion on the applicability of the principles \nof constructive res judicata.  \n",

The special leave petition was also dismissed.  The \nsame order of assessment was challenged by filing a second \nwrit petition before the High Court.  This was also \ndismissed by the High Court. The question, before this \nCourt was whether it was open to the appellant to challenge \nthe validity of the same order of assessment twice by two \nconsecutive writ petitions under Article 226.  The Court \nacknowledged that in regard to the orders of assessment for \ndifferent years, the position may be different and said:-\n",
        "p_23": "\"Even if the said orders are passed under the \nsame provisions of law, it may theoretically be \nopen to the party to contend that the liability \nbeing recurring from year to year, the cause of \naction is not the same; and so, even if a citizen's \npetition challenging the order of assessment \npassed against him for one year is rejected, it \nmay be open  to him to challenge a similar \nassessment order passed for the next year.  In \nthat case, the court may ultimately adopt the \nsame view which had been adopted on the earlier \noccasion; but if a new ground  is urged, the court \nmay have to consider it on the merits, because, \nstrictly speaking the principle of res judicata may \nnot apply to such a case.  That, in fact, is the \neffect of the decision of this Court in the \nAmalgamated Coalfields Ltd. and Anr. V. The \nJanapada Sabha, Chhindwara (1963) Supp.1 \nSCR.172..In our opinion, the said \ngeneral observations must be read in the light of \nthe important fact that the order which was \nchallenged in the second writ petition was in \nrelation to a different period and not for the same \nperiod as was covered  by the earlier petition.\"\n",
        "p_24": "But as far as a challenge to the same assessment \norder is concerned, it was held:-\n",

That clearly is opposed to \nconsiderations of public policy on which res \njudicata  is based and would mean harassment \nand hardship to the opponent.  Besides, if such a \ncourse is allowed to be adopted, the doctrine of \nfinality of judgments pronounced by this Court \nwould also be materially affected.

        "p_30": "The decisions cited have uniformly held that res \njudicata does not apply in matters pertaining to tax for \ndifferent assessment years because res judicata applies to \ndebar Courts from entertaining issues on the same cause of \naction whereas the cause of action for each assessment year \nis distinct. The Courts will generally adopt an earlier \npronouncement of the law or a conclusion of fact unless \nthere is a new ground urged or a material change in the \nfactual position. The reason why Courts have held parties to \nthe opinion expressed in a decision in one assessment year \nto the same opinion in a subsequent year is not because of \nany principle of res judicata but because of the theory of \nprecedent or the precedential value of the earlier \npronouncement.  Where facts and law in a subsequent \nassessment year are the same, no authority whether quasi \njudicial or judicial can generally be permitted to take a \ndifferent view.  This mandate is subject only to the usual \ngateways of distinguishing the earlier decision or where the \nearlier decision is per incuriam.  However, these are fetters \nonly on a coordinate bench which, failing the possibility of \navailing of either of these gateways, may yet differ with the \nview expressed and refer the matter to a bench of superior \nstrength or in some cases to a bench of superior \njurisdiction.\n",
        "p_31": "       In our opinion, the preliminary objection raised by the \nState of U.P. therefore, rests on a faulty premise. The \ncontention of the petitioners/appellants in these matters is \nnot that the decision in State of U.P.  vs.  U.O.I (supra) for \nthat assessment year should be set aside, but that it should \nbe overruled as an authority or precedent. Therefore, the \ndecisions in  Devi Lal Modi vs. Sales Tax Officer  (supra) \nand in Hurra vs Hurra (supra) are not germane.\n A decision can be set aside in the same lis on a prayer \nfor review or an application for recall or Under Art. 32 in the \npeculiar circumstances mentioned in Hurra vs. Hurra.   As \nwe have said overruling of a decision takes place in a \nsubsequent lis where the precedential value of the decision \nis called in question.  No one can dispute that in our \njudicial system it is open to a Court of superior jurisdiction \nor strength before which a decision of a Bench of lower \nstrength is cited as an authority, to overrule it.  This \noverruling would not operate to upset the binding nature of \nthe decision on the parties to an earlier lis in that lis, for \nwhom the principle of res judicata  would continue to \noperate. But in tax cases relating to a subsequent year  \ninvolving the same issue as an earlier year, the court can \ndiffer from the view expressed if the case is  distinguishable \nor per incuriam. The decision in State of U.P. vs. Union of \nIndia  related to the year 1988. Admittedly, the present \ndispute relates to a subsequent period.  Here a coordinate \nBench has referred the matter to a Larger Bench.  This \nBench being of superior strength, we can, if we so find,  \ndeclare that the earlier decision does not represent the law.    \nNone of the decisions cited by the State of U.P. are \nauthorities for the proposition that we cannot, in the \ncircumstances of this case, do so.  This preliminary \nobjection of the State of  U.P. is therefore rejected.\nComing now to the merits of the case, the petitioners \ncontended that the service providers are licencees under \nSection 4 of the Telegraph Act, 1885 and provide \n'telecommunication services' as provided under Section 2(k) \nunder the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act, 1997.  \nService tax is imposed on them under the Finance Act, 1994 \non the basis of the tariff realised from the subscribers.  \nThey further contended that in providing such service there \nis in fact no 'sales' effected by the service providers and that \nthe States do not have the legislative competence to impose \nsales tax on the rendition of telecommunication services.  \nArticle 366 (29A) which extended the definition of 'sale' in \nthe Constitution did not apply to the transaction in \nquestion.  Clause (d) of Article 366(29-A) relied upon by the \nrespondents contemplates  a transfer of a legal right to use \ngoods.  According to the petitioners there is no transfer of \nany legal right by the service providers nor any delivery of \nany goods which may be covered under the Telegraph Act, \n1885 as the same is barred and prohibited in terms of the \nlicence granted to service providers under Section 4 of that \nAct.  It is submitted without a delivery of goods, there could \nbe no transfer of any right to use those goods as \ncontemplated under Article 366(29-A)(d).  It is the \npetitioners' case that the decision in State of U.P. Vs.  \nUnion of India  (supra)  was erroneous not only because it \nheld that the telephone connection and all other accessories \nwhich gives access to the telephone exchange with or \nwithout instruments are goods but also because there was \nin fact no transfer of any of these equipment to a \nsubscriber.  The predominant element and intention in the \ntransaction was one of service and not of sale.   It is \nsubmitted that taxing telecommunication services as a \ndeemed sale under Entry 54 of List II would be violative of \nArticle 286 of the Constitution as the same involves \nconnecting subscribers throughout the territories of India \nwithout any regard to State boundaries.\n  On the interpretation of Article 366(29A) it was \nsubmitted that the fiction in one clause could not be read in \nto the other.  It is said that the disintegration of composite \ntransactions has to be specifically enabled by the \nConstitution and that it was not within the competence of \nState legislation to divide a composite transaction \notherwise.  It is also submitted that the language of clause \n",
        "p_32": "(d) was distinct from the language used in clause (b) of \nClause 29A of Article 366.  Our attention was drawn to the \nabsence of the use of the word \"involved\" in the former sub \nclause.  It is emphasized that there must be goods of which \nthe right to transfer is covered by sub clause (d) of clause \n29A of Article 366.  It is contended that there was no \ntransfer of any right to use any goods and the parties never \nintended for such transfer.  It is submitted that the court \nshould apply the standard of the ordinary man for deciding \nwhether the transaction in question was a contract for \nservice or for transfer of a right to use deemed goods.  The \nobligation of the service provider is merely to transmit voice \nand the subscriber was not interested in stipulating as to \nhow the voice/data is to be conveyed to the other end.  It is \nfor the service provider to choose the medium as it thinks \nfit.  The SIM card was not goods it merely enables \nactivation.\n",
        "p_33": "According to the petitioners prior to the 46th \namendment composite contracts were not exigible to States \nsales tax under Entry 54, List II.  The legal fiction created in \nArticle 366(29A) provided for specific composite contracts to \nbe subjected to sales tax.  Therefore, even after the 46th \namendment other transactions had been held not to be \nsales.  Reliance has been placed on the Everest Copiers vs. \nState of Tamil Nadu (1996) 5 SCC 390, Rainbow vs, \nState of Madhya Pradesh (2000) 2 SCC 385 and  \nHindustan Aeronautics vs. State of Karnataka (1984) 1 \nSCC 707.  It was contended in addition that the restrictions \nregarding the States inability to tax interstate sales  would \ncontinue to apply.  Furthermore, the activity of providing \nthe connection involved the use of instruments embedded to \nthe earth or attached to what is embedded in the earth and \ntherefore was immoveable property and outside the scope of \nsales tax. Thus there were no goods nor any transfer of any \ngoods involved in the activity. \n",
        "p_34": "\tIt is pointed out that none of the States could contend \nthat telecommunication was not a service.  It was submitted \nthat the service did not allow for transfer of right to use \ngoods.  There was no transfer of control or equipments at \nany stage.  It is submitted that what the service providers \nprovide was a means of communication and what was \ntransferred was the sounds of the message or signals which \nwere generated by the subscribers themselves.  It is further \nsubmitted that the SIM card was merely an identification \ndevice for granting access and was a means to access \nservices.  \n",
        "p_35": "\tThe service providers in the appeal from the decision of \nKerala High Court have submitted that the High Court had \nnot appreciated  the facts .  The service providers had \nimported the SIM cards and sold them to franchises who \nthen sold them to the subscribers.  It is submitted that the \nauthorities had wrongly proceeded on the basis that there \nwas a sale of SIM cards by the service providers to the \nsubscribers.  It is pointed out that the sale was factually \nand legally distinct from the activity of giving the connection \nor activation of the SIM cards.  The decision of the Kerala \nHigh Court has also been impugned on the ground that it \noverlooked inter alia questions of competence raised by the \npetitioners, the explanation to the definition of turnover as \nwell as the ratio of Gannon Dunkerley and misapplied the \naspect theory.  \n",
        "p_36": "        As we have noted earlier, the Union of India has \nsupported the service providers and contended that the \ntransaction in question was only \"service\".\n",
        "p_37": "     It has been argued on behalf of the State of Uttar \nPradesh that the writ petition had been filed by BSNL \nchallenging Sections 2(h) and 3F of the U.P. Trade Tax Act, \n1948.  The challenge was expressly given up and therefore \nthe petition was not maintainable.  It was also submitted \nthat there were different factual scenarios as a result of \nwhich the possible outcome of a particular assessment \ncould not be predicted and it was not appropriate to \nintervene under Article 32.  According to the State, no \nfundamental right was allegedly infringed.  It is contended \nthat the Central Government has the exclusive monopoly \nover \"telegraphs\" under the Telegraph Act, 1985.  A \n\"telegraph\" as defined in that Act would cover the \ntransactions in question.  In granting permission to the \nservice providers by the issue of licence, there was transfer \nof the right to use the telegraph which right was further \ngiven to the subscribers in a transaction which would be \ncovered by Article 366(29A)(d).  On the interpretation of \nArticle 366(29A) it has been submitted that prior to the  \nintroduction of 92C in List I, the residuary entry could not \nbe relied upon in view of the specific entry in Entry 54 of \nList II. It has been submitted inter alia that delivery of the \ngoods was not necessary for the purpose of transferring the \nright to use and this had been held in the decision of this \nCourt in 20th Century Finance Corporation Ltd. and Anr. \nv. State of Maharashtra (2000) 6 SCC 12. It is submitted \nthat in any event different aspects of a given transaction \ncan fall within the legislative competence of two legislatures \nand both would have the power to tax that aspect.  It is \nsubmitted that the question whether the goods were \nmoveable or immoveable property as well as the question \nwhether the tax was being levied on inter state sales or not \nwere all matters of assessment and that the judgment in \nState of U.P. vs. Union of India should be affirmed. \nIn addition, it has  been submitted for the respondents \nthat the expression \"telephone\" and \"telephony\" do not \nnecessarily include the factor of service. A subscriber makes \nuse of the telephone system as a matter of right and is \ncapable of asserting that right even against the \nGovernment. The subscriber's right to use his telephone \nline is to the exclusion of every other person and to that \nextent the right of the Government/service providers stands \ndenuded. The right is based on contract and is in addition \nto the right to the service provided by the service providers.  \nThe SIM Card operates as key for access to the telephone \nsystem or network and symbolizes the right of participation \nby a subscriber in the telephone system.  These are two \ndistinct transactions, one as the transferree of the legal \nright to use the telephone and the other of a contract of \nservice. These are two different aspects, each attracting a \ndifferent tax.  Service is only one of the purposes for which \nthe transfer or deemed sale is made by the Government.  \nThe Government may among other rights also allow the \nlicencee to give telephone connection as its agent or act as a \nservice provider for the establishment, maintenance and \nworking of the telephone system.  The use of the words \"any \ngoods\" in sub-clause (d) of (29A) of Article  366 according to \nthe respondents showed that the goods need not necessarily \nhave been transferred  by the transferor.  No delivery was in \nfact required under sub-clause (d). It is further emphasised \nthat sub-clause (d) also use the words \"for any purpose\".  \nThis could include the purpose of service. In any event, it is \nsubmitted, the meaning and scope of sub-clause (d) in \nArticle 366 (29A) cannot be limited on account of the fact \nthat a transaction may have been described  as a service in \nany legislative enactment or contract or licence.   Similarly, \nthe expression \"goods\" had a very wide and comprehensive \nmeaning and assuming delivery is necessary would include \nthe entire telephone system as well as telephone appliances, \ninstruments, materials, towers, exchanges, etc.  The means, \nnamely the electrical or electro magnetic means of energy \nwill also form parts of the goods. It is further submitted that \nwhether in any particular case the telephone system \nincluded machines or apparatus fixed to the ground was a \nquestion of fact to be decided in an individual case during \nthe assessment proceedings. Countering  the submission \nthat the sales would be inter state sales, it is submitted that \nthe situs of the taxable event under the Sales Tax Act would \nbe where the transfer of the right takes place between the \nservice providers and the subscribers.  This was also a \nquestion which would vary from case to case and would \nhave to be ultimately factually decided by an assessment \nauthority.  According to the respondents, apart from the \ntransfer aspect of the transaction being isolated as an \nindependent taxable  event from the aspect of service, \nultimately the question whether there was any splitting up \nof a composite transaction  was also to be determined \nduring assessment proceedings.\n",
        "p_38": "It was submitted that the mere fact that the Union was \nlevying tax on certain taxable services could not be used to \ndeny the State's powers to tax the objects/provisions in the \nservice.  Therefore, the State's powers must be read \nharmoniously with the Union's power and it is only when \nsuch reconciliation is impossible that the primacy should be \ngiven to the non obstante clause under Article 248(1).  \nAlternatively it was submitted that the theory of aspect \nwould apply so that what was service in one aspect was a \nsale in the other. It was also submitted that because in sub-\nclauses (b) and (f) of Clause (29A) of Article 366 the tax on a  \ncomponent in a transaction of works is permissible, it \ncannot be assumed that in sub-clause (d) tax could not be \nimposed on an element of the sale component of that \ntransaction. The sub-clause has no words or limitations \nand must be read as broadly as the language permitted.  It \nwas submitted that the test of dominant object of a \ncomposite works contract was no longer relevant after the \n46th Constitutional Amendment. It was submitted that the \nservice providers transfer the right to use  radio frequency \nchannel to a subscriber for a specific duration and thus \nhave effected a deemed sale of goods under Article 366 (29A)\n",
        "p_39": "(d).\n",
        "p_40": "These broadly speaking are the respective contentions \nand in our opinion, the issues which arise for consideration \nin these matters are:-\n",

        "p_42": "B)\tis there any transfer of any right to use any \ngoods by providing access or telephone \nconnection by the telephone service provider \nto a subscriber ?\n",
        "p_43": "C)\tis the nature of the transaction involved in \nproviding telephone connection a composite \ncontract of service and sale? If so, is it \npossible for the States to tax the sale \nelement?\n",
        "p_44": "D)\tIf the providing of a telephone connection \ninvolves sale is such sale an inter state one?\n",
        "p_45": "E)\tWould the \"aspect theory\" be applicable to the \ntransaction enabling the States to levy sales \ntax on the same transaction in respect of \nwhich the Union Government levies service \ntax.\n",
        "p_46": "     Before taking up the issues for decision seriatim, it is \nnecessary for us to deal with the two further preliminary \nobjections raised by the respondents on the merits.  \nRegarding the first of such objections that the writ petitions \nhave become infructuous - it may be true that in relation to \nthe U.P. Trade Tax Act,1948, the challenge to Section 2(h) \nand 3F which have basically re-produced Article 366(29A) \nhas not been pressed by the petitioners.  What has been \nargued however, is for a construction of Article 366(29A) \nparticularly, clause (d) thereof.  That construction, if \naccepted by the Court, would be sufficient to grant the \npetitioners the relief claimed.  The issue of interpretation of \nArticle 366(29A) is, therefore, a live one.  \nThe second objection was that the writ petitions under \nArticle 32 were not maintainable. The writ petitions raised \nquestions relating to the competence of the States to levy \nsales tax on telecommunication service.  This is not an \nissue which could have been raised and decided by the \nassessing authorities.   If the State Legislatures are \nincompetent to levy the tax, it would not only be an \narbitrary exercise of power by the State authorities in \nviolation of Article 14, it would also constitute an \nunreasonable restriction upon the right of the service \nproviders to carry on trade under Article 19(1)(g).  (See \nBengal Immunity Company V. State of Bihar 1955 (2) \nSCR 603; Himmatlal Harilal Mehta V. State of Madras \n1954 SCR 1122.)  We are consequently unable to accept \neither of these contentions of the respondents. \nTo answer the questions formulated by us, it is \nnecessary to delve briefly into the legal history of Art. 366 \n(29A). Prior to the 46th Amendment, composite contracts \nsuch as works contracts, hire-purchase contacts and \ncatering contracts were not assessable as contracts for sale \nof goods. The   locus classicus  holding  the field was State \nof Madras V. Gannon Dunkerley & Co. IX STC 353 (SC). \nThere this Court held that the words \"sale of goods\" in \nEntry 48 of List II, Schedule VII to the Government of India \nAct, 1935 did not cover the sale sought to be taxed by the \nState Government under the Madras General Sales Tax Act, \n1939.  The classical concept of sale was held to apply to the \nentry in the legislative list in that there had to be three \nessential components to constitute a transaction of sale--  \nnamely, (i) an agreement to transfer title (ii) supported by \nconsideration, and (iii) an actual transfer of title in the \ngoods. In the absence of any one of these elements it was \nheld that there was no sale.  Therefore, a contract under \nwhich a contractor agreed to set up a building would not be \na contract for sale. It was one contract, entire and \nindivisible and there was no separate agreement for sale of \ngoods justifying the levy of sales tax by the provincial \nlegislatures. \"Under the law, therefore, there cannot be an \nagreement relating to one kind of property and a sale as \nregards another\". Parties could have provided for two \nindependent agreements, one relating to the labour and \nwork involved in the execution of the work and erection of \nthe building and the second relating to the sale of the \nmaterial used in the building in which case the latter would \nbe an agreement to sell and the supply of materials \nthereunder, a sale. Where there was no such separation, \nthe contract was a composite one. It was not classifiable as \na sale.  The Court accepted the submission of the assessee \nthat the expression \"sale of goods\" was, at the time when \nthe Government of India Act, 1935 was enacted, a term of \nwell recognized legal import in the general law relating to \nsale of goods and must be interpreted in Entry 48 in List II \nof Schedule VII of the 1935 Act  as having the same \nmeaning as in the Sale of Goods Act, 1930.  According to \nthis decision if the words \"sale of goods\" have to be \ninterpreted in their legal sense, that sense can only be what \nit has in the law relating to sale of goods. To use the \nlanguage of the Court:\n",

(1967) XX STC 115 had to consider a \nsituation where the Sales Tax Authorities had held that \nthough the transaction was described as a lease for 49 \nyears, the assessee had effected a sale of the negative print \nof a picture for a consideration and therefore the \ntransaction was liable to sales tax under the Madras \nGeneral Sales Tax Act, 1959. The Court set aside the \ndemand holding that the transaction did not connote a sale \nat all and it was therefore not liable to sales tax. \nThe problem relating to the power of States to levy tax \non the sale of goods was then referred to the Law \nCommission by the Government of India.  The Law \nCommission submitted its report in 1974 on a \nconsideration of the scope of the levy of sales tax by State \nGovernments in respect of works contracts, hire purchase \ntransactions and also  the transfer of controlled \ncommodities by virtue of statutory orders. The Law \nCommission noted that these transactions resembled sales \nin substance  and suggested three drafting devices for \nconferring the power of taxing these transactions on the \nStates viz.\n",

        "p_55": "          The Commission preferred the last alternative.\n Recommendation (c) of the Law Commission to amend \nArticle 366 by expanding the definition of sale to include the \ntransactions negatived by Courts, was accepted by the \nGovernment. The Constitution (46th Amendment) Bill 1981, \nwhich was subsequently enacted as the Constitution 46th \nAmendment Act 1982 set out the background in which the \namendment to Article 366 (29A) of the Constitution was \namended.  Having noted the various decisions of the \nSupreme Court as well as of the High Courts excluding \ncertain transactions from the scope of sale for the purpose \nof levy of sales tax, it was said that the position had \nresulted in scope for avoidance of tax in various ways. In \nthe circumstances, it was considered desirable to put the \nmatter beyond any doubt.  Article 366 was therefore \namended by inserting a definition of \"tax on the sale or \npurchase of goods\" in Clause (29A). The definition  reads:\n\"[(29-A) \"tax on the sale or purchase of \ngoods\" includes \n\t\n",
        "p_56": "(a)\ta tax on the transfer, otherwise \nthan in pursuance of a contract, \nof property in any goods for \ncash, deferred payment or \nother valuable consideration;\n",

        "p_58": "(c)\ta tax on the delivery of goods \non hire-purchase or any system \nof payment by instalments;\n",
        "p_59": "(d)\ta tax on the transfer of the right \nto use any goods for any \npurpose (whether or not for a \nspecified period) for cash, \ndeferred payment or other \nvaluable consideration;\n",

        "p_62": "  Clause (a) covers a situation where the consensual \nelement is lacking.  This normally takes place in an \ninvoluntary sale.  Clause (b) covers cases relating to works \ncontracts.  This was the particular fact situation which the \nCourt was faced with in Gannon Dunkerley and which the \nCourt had held was not a sale. The effect in law of a transfer \nof property in goods involved in the execution of the works \ncontract was by this amendment deemed to be a sale.  To \nthat extent the decision in Gannon Dunkerley was directly \novercome.  Clause (c) deals with hire purchase where the \ntitle to the goods is not transferred.  Yet by fiction of law, it \nis treated as a sale.  Similarly the title to the goods under \nClause (d) remains with the transferor who only transfers \nthe right to use the goods to the purchaser.  In other words, \ncontrary to A.V. Meiyappan's decision a lease of a negative \nprint of a picture would be a sale. Clause (e) covers cases \nwhich in law may not have amounted to sale because the \nmember of an incorporated association would have in a \nsense begun both the supplier and the recipient of the \nsupply of goods. Now such transactions are deemed sales. \nClause (f) pertains to contracts which had been held not to \namount to sale in State of Punjab vs. M/s. Associated \nHotels of India Ltd. (supra).  That decision has by this \nclause been effectively legislatively invalidated.   \nAll the clauses of Article 366 (29A) serve to bring \ntransactions where one or more of the essential ingredients \nof a sale as defined in the Sale of Goods Act 1930 are \nabsent, within the ambit of purchase and sales for the \npurposes of levy of sales tax. To this extent only is the \nprinciple enunciated in Gannon Dunkerly limited.  The \namendment especially allows specific composite contracts \nviz. works contracts (Clause (b)), hire purchase contracts \n(Clause (c)), catering contracts (Clause (e)) by legal fiction to \nbe divisible contracts where the sale element could be \nisolated and be subjected to sales tax.\n",
        "p_63": "   Gannon Dunkerley survived the 46th  Constitutional \nAmendment in two respects.  First with regard to the \ndefinition of 'sale' for the purposes of the Constitution in \ngeneral and for the purposes of Entry 54 of List II in \nparticular except to the extent that the clauses in \nArt.366(29A) operate. By introducing separate categories of \n'deemed sales',  the meaning of the word 'goods' was not \naltered.    Thus the definitions of the composite elements of \na sale such as intention of the parties, goods, delivery etc. \nwould continue to be defined according to known legal \nconnotations. This does not mean that the content of the \nconcepts remain static. Courts must move with the times.   \nBut the 46th Amendment does not give a licence  for \nexample to assume that a transaction is a sale  and then to \nlook around for what could be the goods. The word \"goods\" \nhas not been altered by the 46th Amendment. That \ningredient of a sale continues to have the same definition. \nThe second respect in which Gannon Dunkerley has \nsurvived is with reference to the dominant nature test to be \napplied to a composite transaction not covered by Article \n366(29A). Transactions which are mutant sales are limited \nto the clauses of Article 366(29A).  All other transactions \nwould have to qualify as sales within the meaning of Sales \nof Goods Act 1930 for the purpose of levy of sales tax.\nOf all the different kinds of composite transactions the \ndrafters of the 46th Amendment chose three specific \nsituations, a works contract, a hire purchase contract and a \ncatering contract to bring within the fiction of a deemed \nsale.  Of these three, the first and third involve a kind of \nservice and sale at the same time.  Apart from these two \ncases where splitting of the service and supply has been \nConstitutionally permitted in clauses (b) and (g) of Clause \n29A of Art. 366, there is no other service which has been \npermitted to be so split.  For example the clauses of Art. \n366(29A) do not cover hospital services.  Therefore, if during \nthe treatment of a patient in a hospital, he or she is given a \npill,  can the sales tax authorities tax the transaction as a \nsale?  Doctors, lawyers and other professionals render \nservice in the course of which can it be said that there is a \nsale of goods when a doctor writes out and hands over a \nprescription or a lawyer drafts a document and delivers it to \nhis/her client?  Strictly speaking with the payment of fees, \nconsideration does pass from the patient or client to the \ndoctor or lawyer for the documents in both cases.\n\tThe reason why these services do not involve a sale for \nthe purposes of Entry 54 of List II is, as we see it, for \nreasons ultimately attributable to the principles enunciated \nin Gannon Dunkerley's case, namely, if there is an \ninstrument of contract which may be composite in form in \nany case other than the exceptions in Article 366(29-A), \nunless the transaction in truth represents two distinct and \nseparate contracts and is discernible  as such, then the \nState would not have the power to separate the agreement \nto sell from the agreement to render service, and impose tax \non the sale. The test therefore for composite contracts other \nthan those mentioned in Article 366 (29A) continues to be - \ndid the parties have in mind or intend  separate rights \narising out of the sale of goods.  If there was no such \nintention there is no sale even if the contract could be \ndisintegrated. The test for deciding whether  a contract falls \ninto one category or the other is to as what is 'the substance \nof the contract . We will, for the want of a better phrase, call \nthis the dominant nature test.\n",

This division of \ncontract under the amended law can be \nmade only if the works contract  involved a \ndominant intention to transfer the property \nin goods and not in contracts where the \ntransfer in property takes place as an \nincident of contract of \nservice..What is pertinent to \nascertain in this connection is what was \nthe dominant intention of the \ncontractOn facts as we have noticed \nthat the work done by the photographer \nwhich as held by this Court in STO vs. \nB.C.

        "p_70": "Article 366(12) has defined the word \"goods\" for the \npurpose of the Constitution as including \"all materials, \ncommodities, and articles\".  The word \"goods\" has also been \ndefined in Section 2(7) of the Sales of Goods Act, 1930 as \nmeaning \"every kind of movable property other than \nactionable claims and money; and includes stock and \nshares, growing crops, grass, and things attached to or \nforming part of the land which are agreed to be severed \nbefore sale or under the contract of sale.\"  The U.P.

        "p_71": "\"every kind or class of movable property and \nincludes all material commodities and articles \ninvolved in the execution of a works contract, and \ngrowing crops, grass, trees and things attached \nto or fastened to anything permanently attached \nto the earth which under the contract of sale are \nagreed to be severed but does not include \nactionable claims, stocks, shares, securities or \npostal stationery sold by the Postal Department.'\n\tThe State Sales Tax legislations have, subject to minor \nvariations, adopted substantially a similar definition of \n\"goods\" for the purpose of  their Sales Tax Acts.  There have \nbeen several decisions of this Court on the interpretation of \nthe word 'goods' in the context of different State sales tax \nenactments. One of the such decisions was the case of \nAnraj V. Government of Tamil Nadu (1986) 1 SCC 414 in \nwhich the question was whether sale of a lottery ticket was \na sale of goods for the purpose of Entry 54 of List II.  This \nCourt held that the sale of a lottery ticket  confers on the \npurchaser thereof two rights, (a) right to participate in the \ndraw and, (b) a right to claim a prize contingent upon his \nbeing successful in the draw.  It was held that the first was \na right \"in praesenti\" and the second a contingent right.    It \nwas concluded that of these  two rights the right to \nparticipate in a draw was \"goods\" for the purpose of levying \nsales tax.  The decision was followed by a Bench of three \nJudges in the case of  Vikas Sales Corporation V. \nCommissioner of Commercial Tax (1996) 4 SCC 733  to \nhold that REP licences/Exim scrips were goods on the sale \nof which sales tax could be levied.  Both the decisions were \ndoubted in the case of Sunrise Associates V. Government \nof NCT of New Delhi (2000) 10 SCC 420  In that case, the \nCourt formed a prima facie opinion that the decision in \nAnraj required re-consideration on the view that  the only \nright of the purchaser of a lottery ticket is to take a chance \nof winning the prize and that there was no good reason to \nsplit the transaction of the sale of a lottery ticket into the \nacquisition of (i) the right to participate in the lottery draw \nand (ii) right to win the prize depending on chance.  \n\tThe judgment in that decision is awaited.  For the time \nbeing, we will assume that an incorporeal right is 'goods',\nIn fact the question whether 'goods' for the purpose of \nsales tax may be intangible or incorporeal need not detain \nus. In Associated Cement Companies Ltd. Vs. \nCommissioner of Customs (2001)4 SCC 593, the value of \ndrawings was added to their cost since they contained and \nformed part of the technical know-how which was part of a \ntechnical collaboration between the  importer of the  \ndrawings and their exporter.

The inspiration for the  argument \nhas been derived from the provisions of the Indian \nTelegraph Act, 1885 which defines telegraph  as meaning:\n\"telegraph' means any appliance, instrument, \nmaterial or apparatus used or capable of use for \ntransmission or reception of signs, signals, \nwritings, images and sound or intelligence of any \nnature by wire, visual or other electro-magnetic \nemissions, Radio waves or Hertzian waves, \ngalvanic, electric or magnetic means.;\n",

        "p_78": "\"telegraph line\" means a wire or wires used for \nthe purpose of a telegraph, with any casing, \ncoating, tube or pipe enclosing the same, and any \nappliances and apparatus connected therewith \nfor the purpose of fixing or insulating the same.\n",
        "p_79": "Section 4 of the 1885 Act gives exclusive privilege in \nrespect of telecommunication and the power to grant \nlicences to the Central Government.  Pursuant to such \npower, licences have been granted to service providers.  \nAccording to the service providers in terms of their licence \nno further transfer of the rights to use the telegraph could \nbe affected by them.  Therefore, what was provided was a \nservice by the utilization of the telegraph licenced to the \nservice providers for the benefit of the subscribers. \nWe will proceed on the basis that incorporeal rights \nmay be goods for the purposes of levying sales tax.  \nAssuming it to be so, the question is whether these electro \nmagnetic waves can fulfill the criteria laid down in Tata \nConsultancy  for goods.

There are still plenty of \nanalog signals around, however, and they will \nprobably never become totally extinct.\nExcept for DC signals such as telegraph and \nbaseband, all signal carriers have a definable \nfrequency or frequencies.

        "p_90": "\"Handing over of possession is not sine qua non \nof completing the transfer of the right to use any \ngoods,  as was held by a Constitution Bench of \nthis Court in 20th Century Finance Corpn. Ltd. \nV. State of Maharashtra (2000) 6 SCC 12.   \n",
        "p_91": "Once  DoT connects the telephone line of the \nassigned number of the subscriber to the area \nexchange, access to other telephones is \nestablished.  There cannot be denial of the fact \nthat giving such an access would complete the \ntransfer of the right to use the goods\".\n",
        "p_92": "With respect,  the decision in 20th Century  Finance \nCorporation Limited Vs. State of Maharashtra, cannot be \ncited as authority for the proposition that delivery of \npossession of the goods is not a necessary concomitant for \ncompleting a transaction of sale  for the purposes of Article \n366 (29A) (d) of the Constitution.  In that decision the Court \nhad to determine where the taxable event for the purposes \nof sales tax took place in the context of sub-clause (d) of \nArticle 366 (29A).  Some States had levied tax on the \ntransfer of the right to use goods on the location of goods at \nthe time of their use irrespective of the place where the \nagreement for such transfer  of right to use such goods was \nmade. Other States levied tax upon delivery of the goods in \nthe State pursuant to agreements of transfer while some \nother States levied tax on deemed sales on the premise that \nthe agreement for transfer of the right to use had been \nexecuted within that State (vide paragraph 2 of the \njudgment as reported).  This Court upheld the third view \nnamely merely that the transfer of the right to use took \nplace where the agreements were executed.  In these \ncircumstances the Court said that:-\n",
        "p_93": " \"No authority of this Court has been shown on \nbehalf of respondents that there would be no \ncompleted transfer of right to use goods unless the \ngoods are delivered. Thus, the delivery of goods \ncannot constitute a basis for levy of tax on the \ntransfer of right to use any goods. We are, \ntherefore, of the view that where the goods are in \nexistence, the taxable event on the transfer of the \nright to use goods occurs when a contract is \nexecuted between the lessor and the lessee and \nsitus of sale of such a deemed sale would be the \nplace where the contract in respect thereof is \nexecuted. Thus, where goods to be transferred are \navailable and a written contract, is executed \nbetween the parties, it is at that point situs of \ntaxable event on the transfer of right to use goods \nwould occur and situs of sale of such a transaction \nwould be the place where the contract is executed.  \n",
        "p_94": "\t\t\t\t\t(emphasis ours)\n\nIn determining the situs of the transfer of the right to \nuse the goods, the Court did not say that delivery of the \ngoods was inessential for the purposes of  completing the \ntransfer of the right to use.  The emphasized portions in the \nquoted passage  evidences that the goods must be available \nwhen the transfer of the right to use the goods take place.  \nThe Court also recognized that for oral contracts the situs of \nthe transfer may be where the goods are delivered  (see para \n26 of the judgment)  \nIn our opinion, the essence of the  right under Article \n366 (29A) (d) is that it relates to user of goods. It may be \nthat the actual delivery of the goods  is not necessary for \neffecting the transfer of the right to use the goods but the \ngoods must be available at the time of transfer must be \ndeliverable and delivered at some stage.  It is assumed, at \nthe time of execution of any agreement to transfer the right \nto use, that the goods are available and deliverable. If the \ngoods, or what is claimed to be goods by the respondents, \nare not deliverable at all by the service providers to the \nsubscribers, the question of the right to use those goods, \nwould not arise.\n",
        "p_95": "In State of of Andhra Pradesh and Anr. Vs. Rastriya \nIspat Nigam Ltd. (2003) 3 SCC 214, it was claimed by the \nSales Tax Authorities that the transaction by which the \nowner of certain machinery had made them available to the \ncontractors was a sale.  The Court rejected the submission \nsaying that:-\n",
        "p_96": "\"the transaction did not involve transfer of right \nto use the machinery in favour of contractors. \nThe effective control of the machinery even while \nthe machinery was in use of the contractor was \nthat of the respondent Company; the contractor \nwas not free to make use of the machinery for the \nworks other than the project work of the \nrespondent or .(para 4 page 315)\n\nBut in the case of Agrawal Brothers Vs.

        "p_97": "(d) of Clause 29-A of Article 366. What is noteworthy is that \nin both the cases there were goods in existence which were \ndelivered to the contractors for their use.  In one case there \nwas no intention to transfer the right to use while in the \nother there was. \n",
        "p_98": "But if there are no deliverable goods in existence as in \nthis case, there is no transfer of user at all.  Providing \naccess or telephone connection does not put the subscriber \nin possession of the electromagnetic waves any more than a \ntoll collector puts a road or bridge into the possession of the \ntoll payer by lifting a toll gate.  Ofcourse the toll payer will \nuse the road or bridge in one sense.  But the distinction \nwith  a sale of goods is that the user would be of the thing \nor goods delivered.  The delivery may not be simultaneous \nwith the transfer of the right to use.  But the goods must be \nin existence and deliverable when the right is sought to be \ntransferred.\n",
        "p_99": "Therefore whether goods are incorporeal or corporeal, \ntangible or intangible, they must be deliverable.  To the \nextent that the decision in State of U.P. Vs. Union of India  \nheld otherwise, it was, in our humble opinion erroneous.\nIt has been held in Builders Association of India Vs. \nUnion of India (1989) 2 SCC 645 that the clauses in \nArticle 366 (29A) do not amount to a separate entry in List \nII of the 7th Schedule to the Constitution enabling the States \nto levy tax on sales and purchase independent of Entry 54 \nthereof.(see also Larsen & Toubro Ltd. Vs. Union of India \n(1993) 1 SCC 365, 383).  Article 366 (29A) as introduced \nby the 46th Amendment not being equivalent to a separate \nentry in List II is subject to the same limitations as Entry 54 \nof that List. At the time of amending Article 366, Article 286 \nwas also amended by the introduction of clause (3) which \nreads as:- \n",
        "p_100": "\"(3) Any law of a State shall, in so far as it \nimposes, or authorizes the imposition of:-\n",
        "p_101": "(a)\ta tax on the sale or purchase of goods \ndeclared by Parliament by law to be of \nspecial importance in inter-State trade or \ncommerce;\n",
        "p_102": "(b)\ta tax on the sale or purchase of goods, being \na tax of the nature referred to in sub-clause \n",
        "p_103": "(b), sub-clause (c) or sub-clause (d) of clause \n(29A) of article 366, be subjected to such \nrestrictions and conditions in regard to the \nsystem of levy, rates and other incidents of \nthe tax as Parliament may by law specify.\"\n",
        "p_104": "          Therefore the deemed sales included in Entry 54 List \nII would also be subject to the limitations of Art. 286, Art. \n366(29-A).\n",
        "p_105": "           Being aware of the dangers of allowing the residuary \npowers Parliament under Entry 97 of List I to swamp the \nlegislative entries in the State list, we have interpreted \nEntry 54, List II together with Article 366 (29A) without \nwhittling down the interpretation by referring to the \nresiduary provision.  Having completed the exercise, we now \nturn our attention to the latter.\n",
        "p_106": "  In 1994, service tax was introduced by Parliament \nunder Chapter V of the Finance Act, 1994 with reference to \nits residuary power under Entry 97 List I of the Seventh \nSchedule to the Constitution.  Under the 1994 Act, 'taxable \nservices' which were subject to levy of service tax were \ndefined. Several different services were included in the \ndefinition. Section 65(16)(b) included service provided to a \nsubscriber by the telegraph authority in relation to a \ntelephone connection with effect from the coming into force \nof the 1994 as a taxable service. Under Section 66, tax was \nimposed at the rate of five percent of the value of the \ntaxable services provided to any person by the person \nresponsible for collecting the service tax.  The value of the \ntaxable service in relation to a telephone connection \nprovided to the subscribers, was to be the gross total \namount received by the telegraph authority from the \nsubscribers.  The 1994 Act was amended from time to time \nby extending the meaning of taxable service.  We are \nconcerned with two amendments, one made in 2002 and \nthe other in 2003.  By Section 149(90)(b) of the Finance Act, \n2002, service to a subscriber by a telephone authority was \ncontinued as a taxable service.  \"Telegraph\" was defined in \nSection 149(92) as having the same meaning assigned to it \nin clause (1) of Section 3 of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885.  \n\"Telegraph authority\" was defined incorporating the \ndefinition of the phrase Section 3(6) of the 1885 Act and \nincluded \"a person who has been granted a licence under \nthe first proviso in Section 4(1) of that Act.  The liability of \nservice providers to service tax was continued under Section \n159(105)(110) (b) and (111) of the Finance Act, 2003.  The \ndefinition of subscriber was added in sub section (104) as \nmeaning \"a person to whom any service of a telephone \nconnection or a facsimile (Fax) or a leased circuit or a pager \nor a telegraph or telex has been provided by a telegraph \nauthority\".  Finally in 2003, List II of the Seventh Schedule \nto the Constitution was amended by including taxes on \nservice under Entry 92C. By this time there were about 100 \ntaxable services including the service of a telephone \nconnection. The question is - is the sale element is each of \nthese several services and in particular the service of a \ntelephone connection taxable by the States?\nAs we have said Art. 366(29A) has no doubt served to \nextend the meaning of the word 'sale' to the extent stated \nbut no further.  We cannot presume that the Constitutional \nAmendment was loosely drawn and  must proceed on the \nbasis that the parameters of 'sale' were carefully defined. \nBut having said that, it is sufficient for the purposes of this \njudgment to find, as we do, that a telephone service is \nnothing but a service.  There is no sales element apart from \nthe obvious one relating to the hand set if any.  That and \nany other accessory supplied by the service provider in our \nopinion  remain to be taxed under the State Sales Tax Laws. \nWe have given the reasons earlier why we have reached this \nconclusion.   \n",
        "p_107": "This brings us to the decision of the Kerala High Court \nin Escotel.\n",
        "p_108": "In that case Escotel was admittedly engaged in selling \ncellular telephone instruments, SIM cards and other \naccessories and was also paying Central Sales Tax and \nSales Tax under the Kerala General Sales Tax Act, 1963 as \napplicable.  The question was one of the valuation of these \ngoods.  State Sales Tax Authorities had sought to include \nthe activation charges in the cost of the SIM card.  It is \ncontended by Escotel that the activation was part of the \nservice on which service tax was being paid and could not \nbe included within the purview of the sale.  The Kerala High \nCourt also dealt with the case of BPL,  a service provider.  \nAccording to BPL, it did not sell cellular telephones.  As far \nas SIM cards were concerned, it was submitted that they \nhad no sale value.  A SIM card merely represented a means \nof the access and identified the subscribers.  This was part \nof the service of a telephone connection.  The Court rejected \nthis submission finding that the SIM card was \"goods\" \nwithin the definition of the word in the State Sales Tax Act. \nIt is not possible for this Court to opine finally on the \nissue.  What a SIM card represents is ultimately a question \nof fact as has been correctly submitted by the States. In \ndetermining the issue, however  the Assessing Authorities \nwill have to keep in mind the following principles:  If the \nSIM Card is not sold by the assessee to the subscribers but \nis merely part of the services rendered by the service \nproviders, then a SIM card cannot be charged separately to \nsales tax.  It would depend ultimately upon the intention of \nthe parties.  If the parties intended that the SIM card would \nbe a separate object of sale, it would be open to the Sales \nTax Authorities to levy sales tax thereon. There is \ninsufficient material on the basis of which we can reach a \ndecision.  However we emphasise that if the sale of a SIM \ncard is merely incidental to the service being provided and \nonly facilitates the identification of the subscribers, their \ncredit and other details, it would not be assessable to sales \ntax.  In our opinion the High Court ought not to have finally \ndetermined the issue.  In any event, the High Court erred in \nincluding the cost of the service in the value of the SIM card \nby relying on the aspects doctrine.  That doctrine merely \ndeals with legislative competence. As has been succinctly \nstated in Federation of Hotel & Restaurant Association \nof India Vs. Union of India (1989) 3 SCC 634- \"subjects \nwhich in one aspect and for one purpose fall within the \npower of a particular legislature  may in another aspect and \nfor another purpose fall within another legislative power. \nThey might be overlapping; but the overlapping must be in \nlaw. The same transaction may involve two or more taxable \nevents in its different aspects. But the fact that there is \noverlapping does not detract from the distinctiveness of the \naspects\".  No one denies the legislative competence of States \nto levy sales tax on sales provided that the necessary \nconcomitants of a sale are present in the transaction and \nthe sale is  distinctly discernible in the transaction. \nThis does not however allow State to entrench upon \nthe Union list and tax services by including the cost of such \nservice in the value of the goods. Even in those composite \ncontracts which are by legal fiction deemed to be divisible \nunder Art. 366(29A), the value of the goods involved in the \nexecution of the whole transaction cannot be assessed to \nSales Tax.  As was said in Larsen & Toubro Vs. Union of \nIndia(supra):-\n",
        "p_109": "\"The cost of establishment of the contractor which \nis relatable to supply of labour and services \ncannot be included in the value of the goods \ninvolved in the execution of a contract and the \ncost of establishment which is relatable to supply \nof materials involved in the execution of the works \ncontract only can be included in the value of the \ngoods\".\n",
        "p_110": "For the same reason the Centre cannot include the \nvalue of the SIM cards, if they are found ultimately to be \ngoods, in the cost of the service. As was held by us in \nGujarat Ambuja Cements Ltd. Vs. Union of India (2005) \n4 SCC 214,228.\n",
        "p_111": "\"This mutual exclusivity which has been \nreflected in Article 246(1) means that \ntaxing entries must be construed so as to \nmaintain exclusivity.  Although generally \nspeaking, a liberal interpretation must be \ngiven to taxing entries, this would not \nbring within its purview a tax on subject-\nmatter which a fair reading of the entry \ndoes not cover.  If in substance, the \nstatute is not referable to a field given to \nthe State, the Court will not by any \nprinciple of interpretation allow a statute \nnot covered by it to intrude upon this \nfield.\"\n",
        "p_112": " We will therefore have to allow the appeals filed by \nBPL in Civil Appeal Nos. 3329-30 of 2002 and Escotel in \nCivil Appeal No.2408 of 2002 and remand the matter to the \nSales Tax Authorities concerned for determination of the \nissue relating to SIM Cards in the light of the observations \ncontained in this judgment.\n",
        "p_113": "As far as the question whether providing of a telephone \nconnection involves interstate sales, now that it has been \nclarified that electromagnetic waves or radio frequencies are \nnot goods, the issue is really academic. \nFor the reasons aforesaid, we answer  the questions \nformulated by us earlier in the following manner:\nA)\tGoods do not include electromagnetic waves or \nradio frequencies for the purpose of Article \n366(29A)(d).  The goods in telecommunication \nare limited to the handsets supplied by the \nservice provider.  As far as the SIM cards are \nconcerned, the issue is left for determination \nby the Assessing Authorities.\n",
        "p_114": "B)\tThere may be a transfer of right to use goods \nas defined in answer to the previous question \nby giving a telephone connection.\n",
        "p_115": "C)\tThe nature of the transaction involved in \nproviding the telephone connection may be a \ncomposite contract of service and sale.  It is \npossible for the State to tax the sale element \nprovided there is a discernible sale and only to \nthe extent relatable to such sale.\n",
        "p_116": "D)\tThe issue is left unanswered.\n",
        "p_117": "E)\tThe aspect theory would not apply to enable \nthe value of the services to be included in the \nsale of goods or the price of goods in the value \nof the service. \n",

The plaintiff has filed this suit to restrain the defendants from using, manufacturing, selling, offering for sale and/or advertising or dealing in any manner by themselves, their servants, agents, distributors and stockists in any medicinal or pharmaceutical preparations in any form bearing the trade marks TOCILLIN', 'CEFTIN' and 'TREX' or any other trade marks which are deceptively similar to or are a deceptive variation of the plaintiffs marks 'CELIN', 'CEFTUM' and TROX'.\n",

Plaintiff No. 2, Glaxo SmithKline Pharmaceutical Ltd., is a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913. The plaintiffs manufacture and carry on business inter alia in medicinal, pharmaceutical and veterinary preparations. The defendants carry on a similar business.\n",
        "p_4": "3. It is not necessary for me to decide the plaintiffs case regarding its trade mark CEFTUM as Mr. Tulzapurkar stated that the defendants do not intend to and shall not use the mark CEFTIN.\n",
        "p_5": "4. The plaintiffs case is that plaintiff No. 1 is the registered proprietor of the trade mark 'CELIN' in respect of medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations in class 5. The registration is valid upto 14 September 2006. The preparations under the trade mark 'CELIN' are manufactured and sold in the nature of drops and tablets. The plaintiffs claim to have incurred considerable promotional expenses in relation to the products sold under the said trade mark. The preparations are sold in every State in India. As a result thereof they claim that the word mark 'CELIN' is associated by the medical profession, chemists and the public with the plaintiffs exclusively.\n",
        "p_6": "5. On 25th January 1993 the defendants applied for registration of the trade mark 'TOCILLIN' for pharmaceutical preparations in class 5. The application was advertised in the Trade Marks Journal dated 16th June 2001. Plaintiff No. 1 opposed the application by filing a notice of opposition at the trade marks registry based on its registered trade mark 'CELIN'.\n",

It was originally registered in the name of British Drug House. Ltd. British Drug House Ltd. was amalgamated with plaintiff No. 2. By virtue of the amalgamation order dated 26 July 1968 passed by this Court the trade mark TROX was transferred to plaintiff No. 2. Applications have been made by the plaintiffs to bring on record the change in the name of the proprietor of the said mark.\n",

        "p_10": "Plaintiff No. 2 introduced its pharmaceutical preparations under the trade mark TROX in the year 1974 in India. It introduced veterinary preparations under the trade mark TROX on 7th January 2000. The sales of the plaintiffs products under the trade mark TROX in the year 2000 was Rs. 94,00,000 and in the year 2001, Rs. 95,00,000. Plaintiff No. 2 has also incurred considerable promotional expenses in relation to its products sold under the trade mark TROX. On 25th February 2002 plaintiff No. 2 filed an application for registration of the trade mark TROX in respect of pharmaceutical and veterinary preparations in class 5 and claiming user since 1974 agreed for the association of the new application with the registered trade mark No. 194383 i.e. the aforesaid registration dated 8th February 1960. The preparations of plaintiff No. 2 bearing the trade mark TROX are sold in every State in India. The plaintiffs contend that as a result of the large and extensive sales of their products bearing the trade mark TROX and the promotional expenses incurred by them, the members of the medical profession, chemists and the public associate the word mark TROX with plaintiff No. 2 exclusively.\n",
        "p_11": "8. The plaintiffs reputation in its mark TROX is established. Its user of the same over the years and the extent of its user has not been seriously controverted.\n",
        "p_12": "9. Judging the marks as a matter of first impression and applying the test of an ordinary person with average intelligence and an imperfect recollection the case must be answered in the plaintiffs favour. If the two marks TROX and TREX are seen as a whole there is no doubt whatsoever that there is a likelihood of confusion in view of the deceptive similarity between the two. The substitution of the letter 'O' with the letter 'E' makes no difference. The two marks are visually and phonetically almost identical. There is a very high possibility of a mispronunciation leading a person to mistake one mark for the other. A perfect pronunciation, a clear enunciation of the words may indicate the difference. But words such as these are not always so pronounced. Moreover it is useful to mention, as has been noticed in several decisions, that words tend not to be properly enunciated and in particular the ending of words is often slurred. Even if either of the marks is pronounced correctly there is an equally high possibility of the person hearing the same to mistake one for the other. Indeed the likelihood of confusion or deception is so apparent and 6bvious that I find it: unnecessary to enter into any detailed consideration of the law on this aspect. As far as these marks are concerned it is not even necessary for the plaintiff to rely upon the well established principle that public interest would support lesser degree of proof showing the confusing similarity in the case of trade marks in respect of medicinal products as against non-medicinal products. It will suffice, in this regard, to merely refer to the judgment of the Supreme Court in Cadila Health Care Ltd. v. Cadila Pharmaceutical Ltd., .\n",
        "p_13": "10. I have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the essential features of the plaintiffs trade mark have been adopted by the defendant. There is a high probability that persons familiar with only one of the marks would mistake one product for the other when confronted with it. The doctrine of wonderment would clearly apply to these marks. Moreover, the products of the plaintiffs and of the defendants relate to medicinal preparations. The possibility therefore of confusion and deception is enhanced.\n",
        "p_14": "11. Considering the nature of the defendants mark I have little hesitation in coming to the conclusion that it has sought to take advantage of the reputation and goodwill acquired by the plaintiffs marks. The defendant has thereby infringed the plaintiffs mark. The defendant is also guilty of passing off its business as that of the plaintiffs business and trade. There is also clearly a likelihood of the plaintiffs suffering damages in the event of the defendants products being of an inferior quality. As held by this Court in Podar Tyres Ltd. v. Bedrock Sales Corporation, , any act or omission of the defendants would have a repercussion on the credit, reputation and goodwill of the plaintiffs.\n",
        "p_15": "12. Mr. Tulzapurkar submitted that the defendants mark is derived from the active ingredient of the drug methotrexate. He submitted that the plaintiffs products sold under the trade mark TROX is a veterinary drug whereas the defendants products sold under the trade marks TREX is an anti-cancer drug for human consumption in an indictable from. Hence, he contended, there can be no confusion as far as the two products are concerned. I am unable to accept the submission.\n",
        "p_16": "13. Mr. Daruwalla, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the plaintiffs, relied upon the judgment in UNIVER Trade Mark, 1993 RPC 239, It was an appeal in the matter of an application to register the trade mark UNIVER which was refused by the registrar of trade marks and came before the court by way of appeal. The applicant applied for registration of the trade mark UNIVER in respect of pharmaceutical preparations- The goods applied for related to cardio-vascular preparations. The applicants were prepared to further qualify that the same would be used only for treating humans and would be supplied only if prescribed by a registered medical practitioner. Objection was taken to the application on the ground that the mark conflicted with the mark UNIVET which was registered for veterinary preparations and substances, disinfectants (other than for laying or absorbing dust) for veterinary use. The proprietors of the cited mark were willing to voluntarily part-cancel their goods leaving only: \"veterinary preparations and substances, all being for sale wholesale to veterinary surgeons.\" The registrar therefore proceeded on the assumption that the comparison of goods was between these restricted lists.\n",
        "p_17": "It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the trade channels would be entirely and completely separate having regard in particular to the applicant's willingness to restrict their goods to supply only by doctors prescription. It is important to note that evidence was filed in support of this submission. One of the affiants stated that with the then current level of good pharmacy practice he believed that there could never be any danger to public health arising out of confusion at any level of a trade channel such that pharmaceutical products for human use and a veterinary product, both with a similar name, might be interchanged. The registrar held that the evidence did not satisfy him that his original concern about the scope for confusion at the wholesale link in the trade channel was misplaced. He observed that the qualified statement persuaded him to err on the side of caution and held: \"I do not believed it should be left to\" good pharmacy practice\" to act as a safety net where lives may be endangered.\" It is further important to note that in that case the impugned mark was in fact in use and there was no suggestion that any trouble had arisen from its use. The registrar in refusing registration relied upon the following observations made by Lloyd Jacob J. in Harker Stagg Ltd.'s Trade Mark, (1953) 70 RPC 205 at 210:-\n",
        "p_18": " \".... if there were, or is, any reasonable ground for supposing that by reason of their similarity confusion or deception is likely to arise, the fact that they are used in relation to a pharmaceutical preparation is, perhaps, all the more reason for seeing that the public are protected from the consequences of deception and confusion.\"\n",
        "p_19": "These observations were pressed into service in the case where the rival marks were used for veterinary preparations and medicinal preparations for human consumption. The decision and the reliance upon the aforesaid observations were affirmed by the court in the appeal.\n",
        "p_20": "14. The reliance upon the decision is well founded. In the case before me the defendants have not even attempted to demonstrate in any manner that there is no possibility of a pharmaceutical product for human use being confused with a veterinary product, in the course of marketing. A discussion on the disastrous effects caused by any confusion leading a person or an animal to take one drug instead of the other is unnecessary. The confusion may occur not only if the nature of the drugs is different but also due to the different dosages that may be prescribed for human beings and animals. The consequences are obvious.\n",
        "p_21": "15. Mr. Tulzapurkar submitted that the judgment in the UNIVER case would not assist the plaintiff as that was a case of registration where the onus is on the applicant. However both are medicinal products. The marks are deceptively similar. It was therefore for the defendants to satisfy the court that there was no possibility of confusion arising from a mix-up in the trade channels. Let me put the plaintiffs case, which in this respect really concerns the interests of the public in general, at its lowest. Apart from an argument of Mr. Tulzapurkar's which I shall deal with next, there is nothing to suggest that there is no possibility of the trade channels being mixed up. If so, in matters such as these it is, again to say the least, advisable that a court errs on the side of caution-especially at the interlocutory stage. In so doing I would grant the injunction.\n",
        "p_22": "16. Mr. Tulzapurkar further submitted that the plaintiffs themselves sold products for human consumption as well as veterinary products under the same trade mark, TROX. This therefore belied the plaintiffs contention that there could be confusion, deception or any harmful effects as a result of the mark being used by the defendants for its products. If the plaintiffs can successfully and safely use TROX for both, veterinary products and products for human consumption, there is no reason why the use of the mark TREX by the defendant for its products would be unsafe. The argument, though at first blush attractive, is unfounded. In this regard I am entirely in agreement with the following observations of the registrar in the Univer case:-\n",
        "p_23": " \"The agent prays in aid the fact that the registrar will allow the same mark to be used by the same company on both veterinary and pharmaceutical goods. Of course he does as there is nothing in the law to prevent it, nor in my view, is there any need to be. The company will have total control over marketing their goods and it would be commercial suicide to allow the slightest chance of error. That is not the position where different companies are involved. Who takes responsibility?\"\n",
        "p_24": "There is not even a suggestion, by the defendant, that the plaintiffs have not or may not take care to ensure that their medicinal preparations for veterinary use and for human consumption have been or are likely to be mixed up by the plaintiffs for any reason whatever. It would indeed be highly improbable that a manufacturer of such medicinal preparations would not ensure that the trade channels are not mixed-up. No useful purpose could possibly be served by their neglecting to do so. No such safeguard is shown to exist where different manufacturers are involved. None have been suggested before me.\n",
        "p_25": "There of course always remains the additional aspect in this case that the plaintiffs before me have made no concession as did the proprietor of the mark UNIVET. The plaintiffs here apply the mark TROX both, to products for human consumption and for veterinary use.\n",
        "p_26": "17. Even assuming that confusion arising from the trade channels being mixed up in respect of the same manufacturers goods under the same trade mark for human consumption and for veterinary purposes, is possible the same would not entitle another manufacturer to add to the confusion or deception. The remedy may then well be to prevent the manufacturer from causing such confusion.\n",
        "p_27": "18. This then brings me to the plaintiffs case regarding the trade mark 'CELIN' and 'TOCILLIN'. Mr. Tulzapurkar fairly did not deny that 'CELIN' is an invented word. It is not necessary therefore to refer to the authorities relied upon by Mr. Daruwalla in support of his submission that 'CELIN' is an invented word. Nor did Mr. Tulzapurkar deny the fact that the plaintiffs have a considerable reputation in this mark. It is not necessary therefore for me to deal with the evidence in this regard.\n",
        "p_28": "19. There is no visual similarity between the two marks. No doubt the letter 'I' after the letter 'C in the mark TOCILLIN' instead of the letter 'E' in the mark 'CELIN' would make no difference. However the letters 'TO' which precede the letters 'CILIN' ensure that there is no visual similarity between the two marks. When judged by the eye alone they are quite obviously different, distinguishable and there is no real danger of one being confused with the other. I say so even presuming that a prescription is written in a doctor's notoriously bad handwriting. I do not see how a person reading the two marks can mistake one for the other. I am unable therefore to agree with Mr. Daruwalla's submission that on a doctor's prescription stating \"2 -'CELIN'\" or 'Two-celin' prescribing the plaintiffs products, the defendants product 'TOCILLIN' is likely to be sold by the chemist and bought by unwary purchasers.\n",
        "p_29": "The only question is whether the marks are phonetically similar. The answer does not admit of a simple yes or no.\n",
        "p_30": "20. If the person speaking the word and the person hearing it are aware that it is but one word, I would rule out the possibility of any phonetic similarity. The letters 'TO' ensure this. This would be so irrespective of the manner in which the word mark 'TOCILLIN' is pronounced. The letters 'TO' could be pronounced as 'two' followed by the word 'cillin'. In other words it could be pronounced as 'twocillin'. It may also be pronounced as 'tochcillin' or 'toecillin'. Whichever way it is pronounced, phonetically it would clearly be different from the pronunciation of the plaintiffs word mark 'CELIN'. I am supported in this view by a principle enunciated in a judgment of a Division Bench of this Court cited by Mr. Tulzapurkar in the case of Juhann A. Wulfing v. I and P Laboratories Ltd., AIR 1984 Bombay 283 where it was held:-\n",
        "p_31": " \"... \"The first syllable of a word mark is generally the most important\" as there is a \"tendency of persons using the English language to slur the termination of words\". (Kerley's Law of Trade Marks, 11th edition p 416). In Re. Bayer Products, (1947) 64 RPC 125, it was held that \"Diasil\" and \"Alacil\" were not deceptively similar or likely to cause confusion. Where the first two syllables arc different, there is little likelihood of confusion. So was it observed by the Division Bench of the Madras High Court in Mount Mettur v. Ortha Corporation,  while holding, that UTOGYNOL and OR-THOGYNOL were not deceptively similar.\"\n",
        "p_32": "The commentary in Kerley is based on a long line of cases. It would be useful to refer to the case of London Lubricants - (1925) 42 RPC 264 where the Court of Appeal observed at p. 279:-\n",
        "p_33": " \"But the tendency of persons using the English language to slur the termination of words also has the effect necessarily that the beginning of words is accentuated in comparison, and, in my judgment, the first syllable of a word is, as a rule, far the most important for the purpose of distinction.\"\n",
        "p_34": "21. I accept therefore, Mr. Tulzapurkar's submission that the letters 'CILLIN' being preceded by the letters 'TO' negates the possibility of any phonetic confusion leading to the word 'TOCILLIN' being mistaken for the word 'CELIN' and vice-versa. There is nothing that persuades me to presume or even think that the syllable 'TO' will be dropped or slurred over in ordinary use. In fact the distinctiveness of the syllable 'TO' and its place as a prefix to the word mark 'TOCILLIN' would tend to it being accentuated. This of course is provided, as I have said earlier, that the person who utters the word mark and the person who hears it are aware that it is but one word. The matter however does not rest therefor, it may not always be so and the matter therefore always not so simple.\n",
        "p_35": "22. It is the nature of the prefix 'TO' and the nature of the products to which the mark is applied, medicinal products that may be sold in quantities exceeding one, and not the mere existence of a prefix that is relevant. Let me explain. The nature of the prefix can suggest the numeral 2. It is not unknown that doctors often prescribed drugs on the telephone. Nor is it unknown that patients order drugs from the pharmacist on the telephone. They also order drugs across the counter without a prescription. It is not inconceivable that if the defendant's product, TOCILLIN', is prescribed the person to whom it is prescribed may hear or understand it as two of the plaintiffs products sold under the mark 'CELIN'. Conversely if two of the plaintiffs products sold under the mark 'CELIN' are prescribed it is not inconceivable that the person hearing it may understand it to mean the defendant's product 'TOCILLIN'. The possibility of confusion cannot therefore be ruled out. The Supreme Court in Cadila's case, cited with approval the observation of the House of Lords in Aristoc Ltd. v. Rysta Ltd., (1945 (62) RPC 65 at p 72) that the court must be careful to make allowance for careless pronunciation and speech on the part not only of the person seeking to buy under the trade description, but also of the shop assistant ministering to that persons wants. I venture to add a circumstance justifying this need for caution at least in our country. Being available even without a prescription it is not always that the persons who are prescribed the medicine themselves purchase it. They often delegated that duty to another. This can only compound the confusion caused by careless pronunciation. The plaintiff must therefore succeed in its case for infringement.\n",
        "p_36": "23. Added to this is the fact that we are dealing here with medicinal products. The consequences of any confusion can be drastic. It is obvious that a person prescribed the plaintiffs vitamin C product would be adversely affected if by reason of any confusion he were to consume the defendants antibiotic drug sold under the mark 'TOCILLIN'. A person prescribed the defendants antibiotic drug sold under the mark 'TOCILLIN' may or may not be adversely affected merely by mistakenly consuming the plaintiffs vitamin C products. In other words the vitamin C itself may not be harmful to a person prescribed antibiotics consuming it. Adverse consequences can however also result by the patient not consuming the antibiotic drug which he ought to. The adverse effects by consuming a wrong drug are not limited to cases where the wrong drug itself has an adverse effect on the patient. The adverse effect can also arise from the patient not consuming the drug that is prescribed.\n",
        "p_37": "24; It would be clear from the above discussion that my conclusion that the mark 'TOCILLIN' is deceptively similar to the mark 'CELIN' and can cause confusion is based essentially on the fact that the products are not necessarily prescribed or sold in quantities not exceeding one. Indeed normally if not invariably, more than one capsule/item would be sold. They are not cars, cameras, computers or such other items which people normally buy only one of. The effect of a prefix would therefore necessarily have to be decided depending on the nature of the product and the nature of the prefix. It is the nature of the products and the nature and the effect of the syllable 'TO' that prefixes the word CILLIN that have led me to the conclusion of there being a probability of confusion despite my finding that the word CILLIN follows a distinctive prefix.\n",
        "p_38": "25. In this view of the matter Mr. Tulzapurkar's reliance upon a judgment of the Delhi High Court in E.R. Squibb & Sons Inc. v. Curwel India Ltd.,  is of no assistance to him. The rival marks there were Curechlor and 'Reclor'. It was held that the former mark was not deceptively similar to the latter. However, the prefix 'Cur' is different from the prefix in the present case. It is not a numeral and therefore did not connote a quantum which the prefix 'TO' in this case does. The case is therefore distinguishable on facts.\n",
        "p_39": "26. Mr. Daruwalla placed strong reliance upon the judgment of a learned single Judge of this Court (S.J. Kapadia, J.) in the case of American Home Products Corporation and Anr. v. Lupin Laboratories Ltd., 1996 IPLR 61. The rival marks were ROLAC and TOROLAC, the former being a registered trade mark of the plaintiffs. The facts of this case are indeed very similar to the facts of the judgment. It is necessary therefore to set out the reasons given by the learned Judge for granting the injunction. They read as under:-\n",
        "p_40": " \"Applying the tests laid down by the Supreme Court to the facts of the present case, I find considerable merit in the contentions advanced on behalf of the plaintiffs on the question of applying the tests to ascertain deceptive similarity between the two marks. In the present case, 1 am at an interim stage. At this stage, the question is whether the use of the mark TOROLAC infringes the registered trade mark ROLAC. Firstly it may be noted that the mark ROLAC has been registered in the year 1986. The said registration was given adequate publicity. It was advertised in the Trade Marks Journal No. 953 dated 16 February 1989. Secondly, the word ROLAC is an invented word which is very important in the matters of deciding whether infringement has resulted or not. It is not an ordinary or a generic word like COLA which can be used with another word which is known to the trade like COCA-COLA or PEPSI-COLA. Thirdly we are dealing with medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations. The preparation of the plaintiffs has a therapeutic value whereas preparation of the defendants has an analgesic effect. Plaintiffs have filed a detailed affidavit to indicate the disastrous consequences which may flow if there is a mix-up in the matter of consumption of the two preparations. It is pointed out in paragraph 17 of the plaint that TOROLAC being an analgesic will not be of any therapeutic use for patients of acidity who will not get symptomatic relief. On the contrary, the patient's condition could worsen because TOROLAC contains toxic potentials and side effects. It is pointed out that the patients who continue to take TOROLAC thinking that it is ROLAC would take, on an average, eight tablets per day against, recommendation of oral dosage of 10 mg every six hours which could lead to disastrous consequences and damage the health of the patients suffering from peptic ulcer. It is also pointed out that even in patients with less severe symptoms of acidity there is every chance of the symptoms getting aggravated and, therefore, the consequences would be disastrous. Fourthly it is pointed out that the entire trade mark TOROLAC has been borrowed and adopted by merely prefixing it with the two letters 'TO' which clearly indicates that even on first impression, the essential features of both marks are deceptively similar and it constitutes coloured imitation or nearing resemblance. In the circumstances, probable confusion cannot be ruled out. It is well settled that when considering the infringement of a registered trade mark, it is important to bear in mind the difference between the test for infringement and the test in passing off action. In a passing off action, the courts look to see whether there is misrepresentation whereas in infringement matters, it is important to note that the Trade Mark Act gives to the proprietor, an exclusive right to the use of the mark which will be infringed in the case of identical marks and, in the case of similar marks, even though there is no misrepresentation, infringement can still take place. The statute law relating to infringement of trade marks is based on certain fundamental ideas which may be common to the law relating to passing off, but it differs in two particular aspects, namely, the use of trade mark is one of the methods of passing off and secondly, the statutory protection in the case of registered trade mark is absolute in the sense that once a mark is shown to offend, the user of it cannot escape by showing something outside the actual mark itself. Therefore, infringement takes place, not merely by exact imitation, but by the use of the mark sold nearly resembling the registered mark as likely to be deceptive (see 1941 (58) RPC 147 at page 161). The above test is also laid down in several judgments of the Supreme Court. In the present case, there is resemblance between ROLAC and TOROLAC. The said resemblance is structural as well as visual and phonetic. The sound of one resembles the sound of the other on first impression. Fifthly, it is also important to bear in mind that if a patient who knows only one word has imperfect recollection of the said word, he is likely to be deceived or confused when he purchases the medicine. No patient goes to the chemist for purchase of both the medicines ROLAC and TOROLAC. He will go for one of them and he may not recollect the other in which event, is likely to be deceived or confused which may lead to disastrous consequences. In the above circumstances, the doctrine of wonderment is also applicable to the facts of the present case. In the present case, I do not find any merit in the contentions of the defendants that the word TORO will make a difference. There is also no merit in the contention of the defendants that the word TORO is emphatic because in such cases meticulous comparison of the two words, letter by letter and syllable by syllable pronounced with the clarity to be expected from a teacher of elocution is not possible. In such cases, the courts have laid down a very important test which, to my mind, applies in this case viz., to make allowance for imperfect recollection and the effect of careless pronunciation and speech on the part of the patient and also on the part of the chemist. Therefore, it is the judicial year that is decisive and the conclusion must be based on the surrounding circumstances. Applying the above text, in the present case, I am satisfied that the plaintiffs have raised a serious contention which requires consideration. It is not possible for the defendants to contend that serious consideration of the facts is not involved at the trial of the suit, particularly when the two marks are confusingly similar. They are close in sound and site. A person who only knows ROLAC and who has an imperfect recollection will be deceived and confused if the chemist gave him TOROLAC and vice-versa. In the circumstances, I find merit in the contentions advanced on behalf of the plaintiffs with regard to deceptive similarity between the two medical preparations which may lead to disastrous consequences, as stated herein above.\"\n",
        "p_41": "27. The facts are in many respects similar to the facts in the present case. The prefix in both the cases viz., the letters 'TO' are the same. I am however satisfied basing my decision on the reasoning adopted by me earlier. As pointed out by Mr. Tulzapurkar, one of the differences between the case in American Home Products and the present case is that the word ROWLAC is a totally invented word whereas the word 'CELIN' is part of a generic term. Moreover it is a well-established principle, reiterated in American Home Products, that every case depends on its own facts and the value of authorities lies not so much in the actual decision as in the tests applied for determining what is likely to deceive or cause confusion. I do not read the decision as having laid down as a rule that in every case the mere existence of a prefix or even the mere existence of the letters 'TO' as a prefix to a registered mark would lead to infringement. The judgment on this aspect is therefore not binding as a precedent in all cases where a trade mark is prefixed with the letters 'TO'. On the other hand in  Johann A. Wulfing v. I & P Laboratories Ltd. (supra) the Division Bench, accepting the passage from Kerley, laid down as a principle that the first syllable of a word of mark is generally the most important. The judgment was not brought to the notice of the learned Judge in American Home Products. Mr. Daruwalla was unable to effectively controvert the submission. It is by applying this principle among others that I have come to the conclusion that there is no phonetic similarity between the marks CELIN and TOCILLIN save as I have already discussed.\n",
        "p_42": "28. Mr. Tulzapurkar submitted that 'TOCILLIN' can only be sold on a doctor's description. This fact he submitted ought to weigh in the defendant's favour. I am unable to agree. A long line of decisions resting with the judgment of the Supreme Court in Cadila's case negates this contention. Considering the nature of the products in the present case and my above findings, the fact that the defendants products under the mark TOCILLIN' can be sold only on a doctor's prescription is virtually of no importance.\n",
        "p_43": "29. The defendants explanation for the adoption of the mark TOCILLIN' does not inspire confidence either, at least at this stage. In paragraph 21 of the affidavit in reply it is contended that the word 'TOCILLIN' denotes that the drug has two active ingredients namely ampicillin and cloxacillin and that the mark had therefore been coined/derived to indicate that two ingredients were present in the compound. As rightly pointed out by Mr. Daruwalla, if that were true the prefix would have been the letters 'TWO' and not 'TO'. Prima-facie I am not inclined to accept the defendants explanation for adopting the mark TOCILLIN'.\n",
        "p_44": "30. In view of this conclusion Mr. Tulzapurkar's submission based on the series theory may not carry him far. In any event there really is no evidence produced by the defendants to support the series argument. Apart from averments to the effect that there are various marks in the market derived/coined in this manner, there is no evidence to establish the plaintiffs case even prima-fade on the series argument. The plaintiffs in their rejoinder denied the averments and put the defendants to the proof thereof. Despite the same the defendant did not produce any proof. Mr. Daruwalla objected to Mr. Tulzapurkar relying upon the Indian Pharmaceutical Guide on the ground that the defendant had not relied upon the same. In view thereof Mr. Tulzapurkar fairly did not pursue the reliance upon the same. He however relied upon various judgments in support of this argument. In view of the absence of any proof in this regard the judgments are of no assistance to him.\n",
        "p_45": "31. Recently in Pidilite Industries Ltd. v. S.M. Associates and Ors., 2003 (2) LJSOFT (URC) 4- I rejected the contention that though at the trial proof of extensive use of the series of marks is required, at the interim stage it is not. It was contended in that case on behalf of the defendants that the decision of the Supreme Court in Com Products v. Shangrila Food Products,  can be of no assistance as that was in the proceeding at the final hearing of the suit. The Supreme Court held that the principle clearly requires that the marks comprising the common element should be in fairly extensive use. It was further held that the series of marks containing the common element or elements therefore only assist the applicant when these marks are in extensive use in the market. The onus of proving such user is on the applicant who wants to rely on those marks. After dealing with various judgments on the aspect I rejected the submission that at the prima facie stage it is enough to show mere user and that it is not necessary for the defendant to show the extent of user. One of the judgments on which Mr. Tulzapurkar placed reliance was a judgment of a learned Single Judge of this Court in Reckitt & Coleman of India Ltd. v. Medicross Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd., 1994 IPLR 31. Mr. Tulzapurkar also relied upon an unreported judgment of a learned Single Judge of this Court in Kopran Chemical Co. Ltd. v. Sigma Laboratories, (Notice of Motion No. 1309 of 1990 in Suit No. 1308 of 1990) which in turn referred to the judgment in Reckitt & Calman's case. Paragraphs 56 to 60 of my judgment read as under:-\n",
        "p_46": "56. Faced with this situation, Dr. Shivade submitted that the judgment in Com Products can be of no assistance as that was in a proceeding at the final hearing of the suit. In support of his contention, he relied upon a judgment of a learned Single Judge of this Court in Reckitt & Coleman of India Ltd. v. Medicross Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd., 1994 IPLR 31. In that case the Plaintiff was a registered proprietor of a trade mark DISPRIN. The Defendants sold their medicinal products under the mark MEDISPRIN. Dismissing the Plaintiffs application for injunction to prevent infringement and passing off, N.D. Vyas, J. (as he then was) held in paragraph 13 as under:\n",
        "p_47": " \"13. It was next submitted by Mr. Tulzapurkar, relying on the decision of the Supreme Court in Corn Products Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food Products Ltd., that it was defendants submission that their mark contained a common element because of their drug containing Aspirin and that there were series of marks in extensive use in the market and; therefore, the onus of proving such extensive user was on defendants who wanted to rely on such marks. This onus, according to Mr. Tulzapurkar, is not discharged. Mr. Patel, in reply, submitted that the said decision which requires evidence of use of the marks having common prefix was rendered on and would be applicable to a matter decided on final hearing after evidence is led. Thus, according to him at the interim stage it would be prima facie sufficient to show that marks with suffix \"Sprin\" are in use with reference to Indian Pharmaceutical Guide and that in the instant case the defendants were not merely referring to, the marks on the Trade Mark Register but to marks of products which are in use as indicated in the said Guide. I see considerable force in Mr. Patel's submission. Prima facie, I am satisfied that several products containing Aspirin and having their trade marks with a suffix of \"Sprin\" are in use. Moreover, the fact of such products marketed under such marks is not disputed. In these circumstances, I reject Mr. Tuizapurkar's submission.\"\n",
        "p_48": "57. I am unable to accept the submission that the ratio consisted of accepting the submission on behalf of the Defendant that the judgment of the Supreme Court in Com Products would only be applicable to a matter decided at the final hearing after evidence is led. The above extract itself indicates that the learned Judge accepted as sufficient at the interim stage, the evidence produced before him to establish prima-facie that several marks with the suffix \"Sprin\" were in fact in use. It is difficult to read the judgment as having held that though at the trial proof of extensive use of the series of marks is required at the interim stage it is not.\n",
        "p_49": "58. The fallacy of this submission lies in the misconception that the issue to be proved is different at different stages of legal proceedings. Whatever the stage of the proceedings, the issue to be proved or the content of the proof remains the same. It is the level of proof that varies depending on whether the order sought is at the interim stage or at the final hearing.\n",
        "p_50": "The judgment in Com Products requires the Defendant to prove that the marks must be not merely in use but in \"extensive use\". Thus, even in interim proceedings, it is not sufficient merely for the Defendant to show prima-facie that there is some user of the marks. There must be prima facie evidence to show extensive use. At the final hearing of the suit the level of proof required is higher - the matter requiring to be proved viz. \"extensive or substantial use\" remaining the same.\n",
        "p_51": "For instance, in a given case, a Defendant may well establish conclusively in interlocutory proceedings that there was actual use of the marks in the market. He would thus have fulfilled the first requirement viz. actual use. He may however candidly admit that the extent of use is minimal. The Defendant could not in such circumstances resist an injunction on the series argument contending that at the interim stage the extent of use is not material.\n",
        "p_52": "59. A Division Bench of this Court in Schering Corporation & Ors. v. Kilitch Co. (Pharma) Pvt. Ltd., 1994 IPLR 1, had occasion, also at the interlocutory stage, to consider this question in similar circumstances. The judgment was delivered before the judgment in Reckitt & Coleman case. The judgment is relevant on facts as well as on law. At page 8 the Division Bench held as under :-\n",
        "p_53": " \"One final point requires consideration. According to the Defendants Affidavit-in-reply, there was a number of similar dermatology products in the market ending with the suffix Derm. Six such products are enumerated in paragraph 6 of the said Affidavit-in-reply. It was suggested, which suggestion appears to have appealed to the learned single Judge, that Curoderm and Qriderm were in the market and that these marks are also very similar to Quadriderm, The argument was that if the Plaintiffs have not objected to these two marks the Plaintiffs are disentitled from objecting to ar at any rate securing interim relief against the Defendants mark Coriderm. We find no substance in the plea. Apart from producing tubes and cartons and some bills the Defendants have not shown the extent of/the sales of these products. Indeed, at the most it can be assumed that two similar products are in the market in January 1990. That will not, in our opinion, non-suit the Plaintiffs or disentitle them to interim relief against the Defendant.\"\n",
        "p_54": "60. Thus, even if I were to accept Dr. Shinade's, interpretation of the judgment in Reckitt & Coleman's case I must hold that the same is not good law in view of the judgment in Schering Corporation and Anr. v. Kilitch Co. (Pharma) Pvt. Ltd., 1994 IPLR 1 (DB) 61.\"\n",
        "p_55": "32. Mr. Tulzapurkar also relied upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in Roche & Co. v. G. Manners and Co., . However that case is distinguishable on facts. The marks in question in the case were, on behalf of the appellant \"PROTOVIT\" and on behalf of the respondent \"DROPOVIT\". The appellant had applied for rectification of the register by removal therefrom the respondents mark on the ground that it so nearly resembled its mark as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion. The Supreme Court accepted the case stated in the affidavits of the defendant indicating that the letters \"VIT\" were a well-known abbreviation used in the pharmaceutical trade to denote vitamin preparations. The Supreme Court further observed that even an average customer would know that in respect of vitamin preparations the word \"VIT\" occurs in a large number of trade marks and because of this he would naturally be on his guard and take special care against making a mistake. The Supreme Court held that it was apparent that the terminal syllable \"VIT\" in the two marks is both descriptive and common to the trade and that if greater regard is paid to the uncommon element in these two words it is difficult to hold that one will be mistaken for or confused with the other. The argument based on the principle of series was thus accepted as on facts the plaintiff had established its case.\n",
        "p_56": "33. Similarly an unreported judgment of a learned single Judge of this Court in this case of Lupin Laboratories Ltd. v.  Nicholas Piramai India Ltd., (Notice of Motion No. 239 of 1998 in Snit No. 4646 of 1997) relied upon by Mr. Tulzapurkar is of no assistance to him as even there the learned Judge came to the conclusion on the facts of the case. The plaintiffs mark was \"TERF\". The marks which according to plaintiff infringed their rights were \"TER2\", \"TER3\" and \"TER4\". The learned Judge found that there were many drugs used for the same purpose having in their names the word \"TERF\". Moreover, the defendants had been marketing their drugs under the said marks for about four years.\n",
        "p_57": "34. For the same reason, neither is the reliance by Mr. Tulzapurkar on the judgment of a learned single Judge of the Calcutta High Court in Griffon Laboratories Pvt. Ltd. v. Indian National Drug and Co. Pvt. Ltd., 1987 IPLR 9 well founded. The plaintiffs mark there Was SORBILINE and it sought to restrain the defendant from using the mark SORBITONE. It was found that the basic ingredient was SOR-BITOL. It was also found that with the prefix SORBI several medicines were being manufactured and in respect of one of them at least the plaintiff had not raised any grievance. The court therefore came to the conclusion that the manufacture of medicine with the prefix SORBE or SORBI was common in the medical world. Apart from that the defendant had already been using the marks for about six years before the suit was filed. It was inter-alia for these reasons that the Court held that the defendants mark will not and cannot cause deception or confusion among the public.\n",
        "p_58": "35. Mr. Daruwalla's reliance upon a judgment of the Chancery Division in Stuart Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. Rona Laboratories Ltd., 1981 Fleet Street Reports 20 - in answer to the above judgment is however not appropriate. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants mark SORBISLO infringed its mark SORBITRATE. Mr. Daruwalla obviously referred to this judgment in view of the similarity of the marks in both the cases and the fact that in this case the plaintiffs succeeded in obtaining an injunction. But the injunction was granted for altogether different reasons. The series argument was also rejected for different reasons. It appears that it was rejected as it was found that in England the prefix SORBI was used only by the plaintiffs and the defendants so far as the field of preparation of the drugs for the treatment therein was concerned. It is not that the plaintiff succeeded in obtaining an injunction despite the defendant having established its case on the series theory.\n",
        "p_59": "36. In this case there is no evidence of the nature or to the extent required to sustain a defence on the series argument. I see no reason to take a different view in the present case from the one that I took in the Pidilite case. In the circumstances, I would reject Mr. Tulzapurkar's submission based on the series argument.\n",
        "p_60": "37. The Registrar shall however decide the proceedings before him between the parties in respect of the said marks on merits. The defendant shall be at liberty to produce such evidence as it may desire in the proceedings.\n",
        "p_61": "38. In the circumstances the Notice of Motion is made absolute in terms of prayers (a) to (f). There shall be no orders as to costs.\n"

According to the plaintiff, the word 'Mahindra'\nis not only a registered trade mark but forms the dominant and significant\npart of the plaintiff and other companies of the group. The companies\ncarrying the name 'Mahindra' are engaged in industrial and trading\nactivities in multiple fields such as manufacture of cars, jeeps, tractors,\nmotor spare parts, farming equipments, chemicals, hotels, real estate,\nexports, computer software and computer systems, etc. The annual turnover\nof the plaintiff and some of its group companies exceeds Rs. 3, 000 crore.\nThe annual expenditure for advertisements and market development for sales\npromotion by the plaintiff and its group of companies is about Rs. 9 crore.\nThe plaintiff has averred that the name and trade mark of 'Mahindra' is\nextremely popular in India and is associated with the products and services\nof the plaintiff. It was further averred that the Mahindra group of\ncompanies have a nation-wide network of selling and distributing agents.\nThe name and trade mark \"Mahindra\" is prominently used and displayed on all\nits products and also promotional materials. On account of high quality of\nthe products manufactured and sold by the plaintiff, as also high quality\nof products and services of other group companies, the plaintiff asserts,\nthat the name and trade mark of 'Mahindra' have come to be known\nexclusively with the plaintiff and its group of companies and have acquired\ntremendous reputation and goodwill among members of public throughout the\nworld including India. The further case pleaded by the plaintiff is that in\nor about August 1996, it came across a prospectus of the defendant in\nrespect of its public issue and for the first time the plaintiff then came\nto know about the existence of the defendant and its corporate name. The\nname of the defendant is almost the same as that of the plaintiff with the\nonly difference in spelling by substituting 'e' for 'i' in 'Mahindra'. It\nis the contention of the plaintiff that the words are phonetically,\nvisually and structurally almost identical and in any event deceptively\nsimilar. In the prospectus of the defendant the words \"Mahendra and\nMahendra\" are more prominently written than the rest of the names.\nAccording to the plaintiff the defendant wishes and intends to fraudulently\nand wrongfully deceive members of the public into believing that the\ndefendant is the associate of the plaintiff or in some way connected with\nthe plaintiff and to trade on the reputation of the plaintiff. The\nplaintiff apprehends that by the use of name/words deceptively similar to\nthat of the plaintiff's name as its corporate name the intention of the\ndefendant is to pass-off or likely to pass-off and to enable others to\npass-off its business and products as those of the plaintiff. It is the\ncontention of the plaintiff that the defendant by use of the said words is\ntrading on the goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff.The plaintiff in\nthe notice issued on 28th August, 1996 had called upon the defendant to\nchange its name. It had also moved the Securities and Exchange Board of\nIndia and various stock exchanges in the country drawing their attention to\nthe fact that the defendant was using a deceptively similar corporate name\nas that of the plaintiff and to take appropriate action against the\ndefendant. The defendant, in its reply to the said notice, took the plea\nthat it has used the name of 'Mahendra' honestly and the allegations made\nby the plaintiff that it has dishonestly adopted the said name and style is\nmisconceived. Thereafter, the plaintiff filed the suit.\n",
        "p_23": "The defendant, the appellant herein, contested the notice by filing a reply\naffidavit, filed by one Mulchand alias Mahendra G. Parwani in which it was\nstated, inter alia, that the deponent is better known as 'Mahendrabhai' in\nthe trade circle and he resides in 'Mahendra House' named after him. He has\nbeen filing income returns in the name of Mahendra G. Parwani. In the year\n1974 he started his sole proprietary business in Prantija District of\nGujarat in the name of 'Mahendra Radio House'. After about four years, he\nalong with his two brothers started a partnership firm in the name of\n'Mahendra & Mahendra Seeds Company'. According to the deponent, his\nnephew's name is also 'Mahendra' and that is how the partnership firm came\nto be named as Mahendra & Mahendra Seeds Company. The defendant further\naverred that on 1st of January, 1982 the said partnership of Mahendra &\nMahendra Seeds Company was incorporated as Pvt. Ltd. company in the name of\n'Mahendra & Mahendra Seeds Pvt. Ltd.' having its office at 7, Ellora\nCommercial Centre, Opposite GPO, Ahmedabad. Another proprietary firm by the\nname 'Mahendra Music & Electronics' was started by the defendant's family\nin the year 1983 and the same was registered under the Sales Tax Act also.\nIt is the further case of the defendant that in the year 1994 the said\nMulchand (alias Mahendrabhai G. Parwani) along with his brothers Trikambhai\nParvani and Dayalbhai Parwani, incorporated a company by the name of\n'Mahendra & Mahendra Paper Mills Ltd.'. According to the defendant, the\nwords 'Mahendra & Mahendra' was a continuation of their business name which\nthey have been using continuously for various businesses since the year\n1974. That the public issue was opened on 25th July, 1996 and the same\nremained open till 6th August, 1996 and despite wide advertisement by the\ndefendant and best efforts, the defendant could not even manage to get 100\nper cent subscription and the allegation by the plaintiff that defendant\nhas been using plaintiff's goodwill is wholly misconceived. The defendant\nalso stated that the name 'Mahendra' is a household name in Gujarat and\nthere are several businesses being carried on in the said name throughout\nGujarat. The defendant further stated that its products are, in no way\nsimilar to the products and businesses of the plaintiff. The business\ncarried on by the defendant does not overlap with the business of any of\nthe companies enlisted by the plaintiff. The defendant pleads that it has a\nreputation of its own in the name of 'Mahendra & Mahendra' and cannot\nderive any benefit by the name which is alleged to be similar to that of\nthe plaintiff. The assertion of the plaintiff that the trade mark\n'Mahindra' and/or 'Mahindra & Mahindra' have come to be identified with the\nplaintiff or the plaintiff's group of companies in any manner, has been\ndenied by the defendant. The defendant has also denied that the name of its\ncompany can be said to be deceptively similar to that of the plaintiff. The\nplea of passing-off or likelihood of passing-off of trade or business of\nthe plaintiff has been denied. The defendant has also set up the plea that\nthe balance of convenience is not in favour of the plaintiff nor the\nplaintiff would suffer irreparable loss in case the injunction is not\ngranted.On consideration of the petition for interim injunction filed by\nthe plaintiff, the learned Single Judge in para 14 of his order issued the\nfollowing directions :\n",
        "p_24": "'Accordingly, during the pendency of the suit interim injunction in terms\nof prayers (a), (b) and (c) shall remain operative. Prayers (a), (b) and\n",

The relevant\nportion of the order reads :\n",
        "p_29": ".\n",
        "p_30": "Hence, this appeal by the defendant.\n",
        "p_31": "The main thrust of the submissions of Shri P. N. Misra, learned senior\ncounsel for the appellant, was that the present case is not an action for\ninfringement of trade mark but it is an action in passing-off the business\nand services. In the absence of any similarity of the goods manufactured or\nsold by the parties the tests of deception or confusion amongst the\nconsumers does not arise. According to Shri Misra, the action in passing-\noff is not to be considered in the abstract sense; it has to be judged on\nthe facts and circumstances of the case. The learned counsel contended that\nthe defendant has been doing business since 1974 using the trade name\n\"Mahendra\" in a wide range of products. Therefore, the claim of exclusive\nuser of the name made by the plaintiff does not arise, at least not at the\ninterlocutory stage, as it depends on evidence to be led in the suit. The\nlearned counsel further submitted that while judging the plea of passing-\noff, the test to be applied is probability and not mere possibility of\nconfusion or deception. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case,\nthe learned senior counsel submitted, that grant of interim injunction in\nfavour of the plaintiff was not warranted; the Division Bench of the High\nCourt should have set aside the order passed by the learned Single Judge\nand vacated the interim order of injunction.Per contra, Shri R. F. Nariman,\nlearned senior counsel for the respondent, contended that the order of\ninterim injunction passed by the learned Single Judge is based on well\nrecognised principles of law which have been aptly applied to the case in\nhand. Shri Nariman further contended that on a bare perusal of the\nprospectus issued by Mahendra & Mahendra Paper Mills Ltd. it is manifest\nthat the defendant is trying to utilise the tremendous popularity and\ngoodwill associated with the plaintiff's name 'Mahindra and Mahindra' in\nthe trade circles. According to him, any man of average intelligence and\nimperfect recollection is likely to get an impression that the defendant is\none of the associated companies of the 'Mahindra and Mahindra' group. The\nfurther contention of the learned counsel was that whatever amount was\ncollected by the defendant from sale of shares of the company to investors\nwas due to the deceptively similar name given to the defendant company. It\nwas the further submission of the learned counsel for the respondent that\nthe business activity of the defendant company has not yet commenced. The\nlearned counsel contended that the plaintiff successfully established a\nstrong prima facie case in its favour and in the circumstances denial of\norder of interim injunction will result in irreparable loss and injury in\nits trade and business. In the submission of Shri Nariman, the learned\nSingle Judge rightly passed the order of interim injunction and the\nDivision Bench was justified in declining to interfere with the said order.\n",
        "p_32": "In section 105, clause (c), of the Act it is laid down, inter alia, that no\nsuit for passing-off arising out of the use by the defendant of any trade\nmark which is identical with or deceptively similar to the plaintiff's\ntrade mark, whether registered or unregistered, shall be instituted in any\ncourt inferior to a District Court having jurisdiction to try the\nsuit.Section 106 in which is enumerated the reliefs available in an action\nfor infringement or for passing-off provides in clause (c) of sub-section\n(2) that :\n",
        "p_33": "The question that arises for determination in this case is, whether, on the\nfacts and circumstances of the case, the High Court committed an error in\ngranting the plaintiff's prayer for interim injunction.\n",
        "p_34": "This question has been considered by different High Courts and this court\nin umpteen cases from time to time. On analysis of the principles laid down\nin the decisions, certain recognised parameters relating to the matter have\nemerged. Without intending to be exhaustive some of the principles which\nare accepted as well settled may be stated, thus, that whether there is a\nlikelihood of deception or confusion arising is a matter for decision by\nthe court, and no witness is entitled to say whether the mark is likely to\ndeceive or to cause confusion; that all factors which are likely to create\nor allay deception or confusion must be considered in combination; that\nbroadly speaking, factors creating confusion would be, for example, the\nnature of the market itself, the class of customers, the extent of the\nreputation, the trade channels, the existence of any connection in course\nof trade, and others.This court, in the case of Corn Products Refining Co.\nv. Shangrila Food Products Ltd. 1960 (1) SCR 968, observed that :\n",
        "p_35": ". This court further observed that in order that a trade mark may acquire a\nreputation among buyers, it is not necessary that they should know who the\nmanufacturer of the goods is. It is no answer to an opposition to an\napplication for registration to say that there is a number of marks having\none or more common features which occur in the proposed mark unless it is\nproved that these marks had by user acquired a reputation in the market.\n",
        "p_36": "In the case of Wander Ltd. v. Antox India (P.) Ltd. 1990 Supp(SCC) 727, a\nbench of three learned Judges considered the question of grant of\ninterlocutory injunction under order 39, rule 1, Code of Civil Procedure,\n1908 in a case under section 29(2) of the Act and section 55 of the Copy\nRight Act, 1957 and held as follows :\n",
        "p_37": "The interlocutory remedy is intended to preserve in status quo, the rights\nof parties which may appear of a prima facie case. The court also, in\nrestraining a defendant from exercising what he considers his legal right\nbut what the plaintiff would like to be prevented, puts into the scales, as\na relevant consideration whether the defendant has yet to commence his\nenterprise or whether he has already been doing so in which latter case\nconsiderations somewhat different from those that apply to a case where the\ndefendant is yet to commence his enterprise, are attracted. ...\n",
        "p_38": "The appeals before the Division Bench were against the exercise of\ndiscretion by the Single Judge. In such appeals, the appellate court will\nnot interfere with the exercise of discretion except where the discretion\nhas been shown to have been exercised arbitrarily, or capriciously or\nperversely or where the court had ignored the settled principles of law\nregulating grant or refusal of interlocutory injunctions. An appeal against\nexercise of discretion is said to be an appeal on principle. Appellate\ncourt will not reassess the material and seek to reach a conclusion\ndifferent from the one reached by the court below if the one reached by\nthat court was reasonably possible on the material. The appellate court\nwould normally not be justified in interfering with the exercise of\ndiscretion under appeal solely on the ground that if it had considered the\nmatter at the trial stage it would have come to a contrary conclusion. If\nthe discretion has been exercised by the trial court reasonably and in a\njudicial manner the fact that the appellate court would have taken a\ndifferent view may not justify interference with the trial court's exercise\nof discretion. After referring to these principles, Gajendragadkar, J. in\nPrinters (Mysore) (P.) Ltd. v. Pothan Joseph 1960 (3) SCR 713 :\n",
        "p_39": "In the case of S.M. Dyechem Ltd. v. Cadbury (India) Ltd. 2000 (5) SCC 573,\nthis court formulated the point whether the plaintiff had made out a case\nfor grant of temporary injunction treating the suit as a \"passing-off\"\naction, the relative strength of the case was in the plaintiff's favour ?\nReferring to a number of decisions of this court and courts in England,\nthis court made the following observations :\n",
        "p_40": "'Here the point is in relation to relative strength of the parties on the\nquestion of \"passing-off\". As discussed under Point 5, the proof of\nresemblance or similarity in case of passing off and infringement are\ndifferent. In a passing-off action, additions, get-up or trade-dress might\nbe relevant to enable the defendant to escape. In National Sewing Thread\nCo. Ltd. v. James Chadwick & Bros. Ltd. 1948 AIR(Mad) 481, the passing-off\naction failed. But thereafter James Chadwick Co. succeeded in an appeal\narising out of the registration proceedings and the said judgment was\nconfirmed by this court in National Sewing Thread Co. Ltd. v. James\nChadwick & Bros. Ltd. 1953 AIR(SC) 357. It was held that the judgment in\nthe passing-off case could not be relied upon by the opposite side in\nlatter registration proceedings.\n",
        "p_41": "In the same tone, Halsbury (Trade Marks) 4th edn., 1984, vol. 48, para 187)\nsays that in a passing-off action the\n\n    \"degree of similarity of the name, mark or other features concerned is\n    important but not necessarily decisive, so that an action for\n    infringement of a registered trade mark may succeed on the same facts\n    where a passing-off action fails or vice versa\"\n",
        "p_42": ". As to vice versa, Kerly says (para 16.12), an infringement action may\nfail where the plaintiff cannot prove registration or that its registration\nextends to the goods or to all the goods in question or because the\nregistration is invalid and yet the plaintiff may show that by imitating\nthe mark or otherwise, the defendant has done what is calculated to pass-\noff his goods as those of the plaintiff.In Schweppes Ltd. v. Gibbens 1905\n22 RPC 601 (HL), Lord Halsbury said, while dealing with a passing-off\naction that\n\n    \"the whole question in these cases is whether the thing - taken in its\n    entirety, looking at the whole thing - is such that in the ordinary\n    course of things a person with reasonable comprehension and with proper\n    insight would be deceived\"\n",
        "p_43": ".'\n\nIn a recent decision in the case of Cadila Health Care Ltd. v. Cadila\nPharmaceuticals Ltd. 2001 (5) SCC 73, a bench of three learned Judges,\nsummed up the position of law regarding tests to determine a passing-off\naction, with the following observations :\n",
        "p_44": "'We are unable to agree with the aforesaid observations in Dyechem case,\n2000 (5) SCC 573. As far as this court is concerned, the decision in the\nlast four decades have clearly laid down that what has to be seen in the\ncase of a passing-off action is the similarity between the competing marks\nand to determine whether there is likelihood of deception or causing\nconfusion. This is evident from the decisions of this court in the cases of\nNational Sewing Thread Co. Ltd. case 1953 AIR(SC) 35, Corn Products\nRefining Co. case 1960 AIR(SC) 142, Amritdhara Pharmacy case 1963 AIR(SC)\n449, Durga Dutt Sharma case 1965 AIR(SC) 980, and Hoffman-La Roche & Co.\nLtd. case 1969 (2) SCC 716. Having come to the conclusion, in our opinion\nincorrectly, that the difference in essential features is relevant, this\ncourt in Dyechem case sought to examine the difference in the two marks\n\"PICNIK\" and \"PICNIC\". It applied three tests, they being : (1) is there\nany special aspect of the common feature which has been copied ? (2) mode\nin which the parts are put together differently, i.e., whether\ndissimilarity of the part or parts is enough to make the whole thing\ndissimilar, and (3) whether, when there are common elements, should one not\npay more regard to the parts which are not common, while at the same time\nnot disregarding the common parts ? In examining the marks, keeping the\naforesaid three tests in mind, it came to the conclusion, seeing the manner\nin which the two words were written and the peculiarity of the script and\nconcluded (at SCC p. 597, para 39) that \" the above three dissimilarities\nhave to be given more importance than the phonetic similarity or the\nsimilarity in the use of the word PICNIC for PIKNIK. ...Broadly stated, in\nan action for passing-off on the basis of unregistered trade mark generally\nfor deciding the question of deceptive similarity the following factors are\nto be considered :\n",
        "p_45": "(a) The nature of the marks, i.e., whether the marks are word marks or\nlabel marks or composite marks, i.e., both words and label works.\n",
        "p_46": "(b) The degree of resembleness between the marks, phonetically similar and\nhence similar in idea.\n",
        "p_47": "(c) The nature of the goods in respect of which they are used as trade\nmarks.\n",
        "p_48": "(d) The similarity in the nature, character and performance of the goods of\nthe rival traders.\n",
        "p_49": "(e) The class of purchasers who are likely to buy the goods bearing the\nmarks they require, on their education and intelligence and a degree of\ncare they are likely to exercise in purchasing and/or using the goods.\n",
        "p_50": "(f) The mode of purchasing the goods or placing orders for the goods.\n",
        "p_51": "(g) Any other surrounding circumstances which may be relevant in the extent\nof dissimilarity between the competing marks.\n",
        "p_52": "Weightage to be given to each of the aforesaid factors depending upon facts\nof each case and the same weightage cannot be given to each factor in every\ncase.\n",
        "p_53": "The trial court will now decide the suit keeping in view the observations\nmade in this judgment. No order as to costs. Appeal disposed of.'\n\nThe Bombay High Court in Sunder Parmanand Lalwani v. Caltex (India) Ltd.\n1969 AIR(Bom) 24 (V 56 C 5), held that a large number of persons, if they\nsaw or heard about the mark \"Caltex\" in connection with the applicant's\nwatches, would be led to think that the watches were in some way connected\nwith the opponents who were dealing in petrol and various oil products with\nthe Caltex mark, or they would at least wonder whether they were in any way\nconnected with the opponents'. The court considered the factors which tend\nto show that there was a likelihood of creating deception or confusion.In\nthe case of Bata India Ltd. v. Pyare Lal & Co. 1985 AIR(All) 242,\nconsidering the plea of passing-off or enabling others to pass-off\nmattresses, sofa cushions and other articles associating them with the name\nof 'Bata' in any manner or form, held that 'the plaintiffs had cause of\naction for instituting the proceeding for passing off. The plaintiff had\nmade out a case of issuance of an interim order of injunction in respect of\nthe user of the name \"Bata\" to any of their products by the defendants'.\nThe High Court further observed that 'the word \"Bata\" was well known in the\nmarket and the user of such a name is likely to cause not only deception in\nthe mind of an ordinary customer but may also cause injury to the\nplaintiff-company. The fact that the plaintiff was not producing foam was\nnot enough to hold that there could be no passing-off action in respect of\nthe user of the name \"Bata\" to the products marketed by the defendants is\nindicative of their intent.'\n\nBombay High Court in the case of Kirloskar Diesel Recon (P.) Ltd. v.\nKirloskar Proprietary Ltd. 1966 AIR(Bom) 149, considered the scope of\ngranting injunction in a suit for infringement of a trade mark under\nsection 106 of the Act by the use of the mark 'Kirloskar', held :\n",
        "p_54": "'The principle of balance of convenience applies when the scales are evenly\nbalanced. The existence of 1st appellant in each appeal is very recent\nwhereas the existence of the respondents belonging to \"Kirloskar group of\ncompanies\" has been for over a period of 50 years. On their own showing,\nthe appellants are not using the word \"Kirloskar\" as trade mark but as part\nof trading style whereas the respondents have not only acquired\ndistinctiveness and goodwill in the word \"Kirloskar\" but it is even the\nregistered trade mark of the 1st respondent. There is sufficient evidence\non record to show that the huge business is carried by \"Kirloskar group of\ncompanies\".There is nothing on record to show the extent of the business of\nthe appellants. The 2nd appellant has throughout been aware about the\nbusiness reputation of the respondents and efforts of the respondents in\nprotecting their rights in the trade marks as also of preventing others to\nuse the word \"Kirloskar\" as a part of the trading name or trading style. By\nextant of the interim injunction in favour of the respondents, the\nappellants are not prevented from carrying on business without the word\n\"Kirloskar\" forming part of the corporate name of the 1st appellant in each\nappeal. In the facts of the case, the respondents' reputation is likely to\nbe adversely affected if the appellants are not prevented from using names\nof the 1st appellant in each appeal. In the facts of the case, the balance\nof convenience is not in favour of the appellants. ...\n",
        "p_55": "The real question in each case is whether there is as a result of\nmisrepresentation a real likelihood of confusion or deception of the public\nand consequent damage to the plaintiff. The focus is shifted from the\nexternal objective test of making comparison of activities of parties to\nthe state of mind of public in deciding whether it will be confused. With\nthe passage of time and reputation acquired, the trade mark \"Kirloskar\" has\nacquired the secondary meaning and has become almost a household word. The\njudgments relied upon by Mr. Kane pertain to the cases of one type of\nbusiness and not where variety of businesses have been carried by the\nplaintiff and defendants in the instant case. The business activities of\nthe respondents vary from pin to piano as borne out from the object clauses\nof the memorandum of association of the respondents. The appellants have\nstill to commence their business activities but as mentioned in the\nmemorandum of association of 1st appellant in each appeal, some of the\nobject clauses therein overlap with the activities of respondents and more\nparticularly of respondents Nos. 6 and 7.'Judging the case in hand on\ntouchstone of the principles laid down in the aforementioned decided cases,\nit is clear that the plaintiff has been using the word 'Mahindra' and\n'Mahindra & Mahindra' in its companies/business concerns for a long span of\ntime extending over five decades. The name has acquired a distinctiveness\nand a secondary meaning in the business or trade circles. People have come\nto associate the name 'Mahindra' with a certain standard of goods and\nservices. Any attempt by another person to use the name in business and\ntrade circles is likely to and in probability will create an impression of\na connection with the plaintiff's group of companies. Such user may also\naffect the plaintiff prejudicially in its business and trading activities.\nUndoubtedly, the question whether the plaintiffs' claim of 'passing-off\naction' against the defendant will be accepted or not has to be decided by\nthe court after evidence is led in the suit. Even so for the limited\npurpose of considering the prayer for interlocutory injunction which is\nintended for maintenance of status quo, the trial court rightly held that\nthe plaintiff has established a prima facie case and irreparable prejudice\nin its favour which calls for passing an order of interim injunction\nrestraining the defendant-company which is yet to commence its business\nfrom utilising the name of 'Mahendra' or 'Mahendra & Mahendra' for the\npurpose of its trade and business. Therefore, the Division Bench of the\nHigh Court cannot be faulted for confirming the order of injunction passed\nby the learned Single Judge.\n",
        "p_56": "On the discussions made in the preceding paras and for the reasons noted\ntherein, the orders passed by the High Court do not call for interference.\nIt is needless to say that the observations made in this judgment are only\nin relation to the interim order. Therefore, the appeal is dismissed with\ncosts. Hearing fee assessed at Rs. 15, 000.\n"

Thereupon, the Assessing Authority viz., the Deputy Commercial Tax Officer,  proceeded on the basis that there was a transfer of incorporeal goods, which is taxable under the Sales Tax Act and consequently, passed orders of revised assessment, holding that the sale consideration of Rs.7,26,835/- received by the assessee was taxable at 5% and levied tax. The assessee preferred an appeal before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, who accepted the claim of the assessee that the amount received was only a Royalty which could not be called as sale consideration and held that the reassessment was not proper.  The Joint Commissioner took up the matter under his purview in suo motu revision and, placing reliance on a ruling reported in 61 S.T.C.P. 165, held that the transfer of trade-mark right is a sale of incorporeal goods for consideration and therefore, the amount received is taxable under the TNGST Act.

To facilitate the execution of work by the contractors with the use of sophisticated machinery, the petitioner had undertaken to supply the machinery to the contractors for the purpose of being used in the execution of the contracted works of the petitioner and received charges for the same.

The Court, in that case, considered in extenso the terms 'goods', 'property', 'movable property' and 'immovable property'. After referring to the various definitions and also the dictionaries, the Court observed that the wordings also commonly used to denote everything which is the subject of ownership, corporeal or incorporeal, tangible or intangible, visible or invisible, real or personal and everything that has an extendable value or which goes to make wealth or estate. Referring to the Jowitt's Dictionary of English Law (Sweet & Maxwell Limited, 1977), the Court observed as under:-\n",
        "p_25": " \" This definition also shows that the expression signifies 'things and rights considered as having a money value'.  Even incorporeal rights like trade marks, copyrights, patents or rights in personam capable of transfer or transmission, such as debts, are also included in its ambit.\" \n",

        "p_28": "C. Volume 112 STC 370 (Commissioner of Sales Tax v. Duke & Sons Pvt. Ltd.). \n",
        "p_29": "In that case, there was an agreement between Duke & Sons Private Limited and M/s.Salstar Foods & Beverages Ltd. on 6th September, 1985. The latter was permitted to use the trade-mark of the assessee on the bottles of beverages manufactured by them in Maharashtra and to market the same under the trade mark of the assessee. The assessee charged royalty for the use of its trade marks at the rate specified in the agreement. With a view to ascertaining its liability to pay tax under the Maharashtra Sales Tax on the Transfer of the Right to use any Goods for Any Purpose Act, 1985, on the amount of royalty received by it, the assessee applied to the Additional Commissioner of Sales Tax for determination of the question whether it was liable to pay tax on the amount of Royalty received by it for the transfer of the right to use its trade mark under the 1985 Act. The Tribunal held that it did not amount to transfer of right to use trade mark by the assessee to its customers and no tax could be levied on the Royalty received by the assessee. The Revenue applied for Reference of the question of law arising therefrom to the High Court. Before the High Court, the Revenue submitted that the Tribunal was at fault, while the assessee contended that there was no transfer of right to use the trade mark and placed reliance on the ruling by the Supreme court in the case of Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd. (cited supra). The Bombay High Court held as follows:-\n",
        "p_30": "  \" 'Trade mark' has been defined in section 2(1)(v) of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 to mean a mark used in relation to goods for the purpose of indicating a connection in the course of trade between the goods and some person having the right, either as a proprietor or as registered user, to use the mark whether with or without any indication of the identity of that person. ..... The manner of transfer of the right to use the goods to the transferee would depend upon the nature of the goods. For transfer of right to use a trade mark, permission in writing as required by law may be enough. In case of tangible property, handing over of the property to the transferee may be essential for the use thereof. All that will depend upon the nature of the goods. Take for instance, transfer of right to use machinery. The right to use the machinery cannot be transferred by transferor to the transferee without transfer of control over it. The case before the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd. v. Commercial Tax Officer  was a case of transfer of right to use machinery. It was in that context, the above decision came to be rendered. But the position in case of trade mark is different. For transferring the right to use the trade mark, it is not necessary to hand over the trade mark to the transferee or give control or possession of trade mark to him. It can be done merely by authorising the transferee to use the same in the manner required by the law as has been done in the present case. The right to use the trade mark can be transferred simultaneously to any number of persons. The decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd. v. Commercial Tax Officer  has no application to the transfer of right to use a trade mark.\"  \n",
        "p_31": "In the present case, it has to be pointed out that this is also a case of transfer of a trade mark and that here also the assessee retains his right to use it himself so also to transfer such a right to others. The Revenue's claim that this ruling fully supports its stand has to be sustained.\n",
        "p_32": "D. Volume 113 Sales Tax Cases 317 (Aggarwal Brothers V. State of Haryana). \n",
        "p_33": "The assessee hired shuttering to builders and contractors who use it in the course of construction of buildings. On the hire charges received, sales tax was sought to be imposed. A writ petition was filed to quash the assessment orders. On behalf of the Revenue, it was contended that the customers were in effective control of the shuttering during the periods it remained in their possession and therefore, there was a transfer of right to use the shuttering. In the said Judgment, the Court pointed out the legal position as under:-\n",
        "p_34": "\" The said Act defines \"sale\" to mean the transfer of property in goods for cash or deferred payment or other valuable consideration and includes the 'transfer of the right to use any goods for any purpose (whether or not for a specified period) for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration'. Such transfer of the right to use goods for consideration is 'deemed' to be a sale. The provision expressly speaks of 'transfer of the right to use goods' and not of transfer of goods. There is, therefore, no merit in the submission that to be a deemed sale within the meaning of the abovementioned provision of the said Act there must be a legal transfer of goods or that the transaction must be like a lease.\n",
        "p_35": "Where there is a transfer of a right to use goods for consideration, the requirement of the abovementioned provision of the said Act is satisfied and there is deemed to be a sale. In the instant case, the assessees owned shuttering. They transferred the shuttering for consideration to builders and building contractors for use in the construction of buildings. There can, therefore, be no doubt that the requirements of a deemed sale within the meaning of the abovementioned provision of the said Act are satisfied.\" \n",
        "p_36": "Thus, the Court held that the hire charges were taxable under the Act. The learned counsel for the Revenue has rightly placed reliance on this ruling.\n",
        "p_37": "E. Volume 119 Sales Tax Cases 182 (20th Century Finance Corporation Limited v. State of Maharashtra).\n",
        "p_38": "In that case, the Supreme Court ruled that taxable event is the transfer of the right to use the goods regardless of when or whether the goods are delivered for use and what is required is that the goods should be in existence so that they may be used. The Supreme Court also held that, also of no relevance to the deemed sale is where the goods are delivered for use pursuant to the transfer of the right to use them, though it may be that in the case of an oral or implied transfer of the right to use goods, it is effected by the delivery of the goods. \n",
        "p_39": "F. Volume 130 STC Page 1 (State of Uttar Pradesh and another vs. Union of India and another).\n",
        "p_40": "In that case, the Supreme Court, pointing out the various Rulings which are to the effect that Electricity also falls within the meaning of 'goods', held that the Department of Telecommunications is a 'dealer', which collects rental for the supply of transfer of use of telephonic connection, which is compendiously called 'service' and the supply of the telephone satisfies the requirements of a 'transfer of the right to use the goods' within the meaning of 'sale' and the Department also receives the consideration and therefore, the Department is liable to pay the sales tax. The Supreme Court observed that even if a subscriber uses his own telephone, that would not make any difference. The Court ruled as under:-\n",
        "p_41": "\" Before taking up the other contentions, we may conveniently dispose of a short point--ambit of the definition of the term 'goods'--quoted above. It is defined in very wide terms so as to bring in both tangible and intangible objects. It takes in its fold every kind or class of movables, including all material commodities and articles involved in the execution of a works contract, and growing crops, grass, trees and things attached to or fastened to anything permanently attached to the earth which under the contract of sale are agreed to be severed but excluding actionable claims, stocks, shares, securities or postal stationery sold by the Postal Department. \n",
        "p_42": "..... ..... ...... ....\n",
        "p_43": "It is true that under the Rules, referred to above, as service, a number is allotted, an instrument/apparatus and other appliances are installed at the premises of a subscriber and the same are connected with the area exchange to enable him to have access to the whole system, to dial and to receive calls. In our view, it makes no difference whether any subscriber replaces instrument of the DoT with his own instrument because the most important thing is the connection of the subscriber's telephone number with the area exchange and that was provided by the DoT. In so far as the contention of giving possession or control of the whole system of exchange is concerned, which is said to comprise mostly of immovable property, it needs to be borne in mind that handing over of the possession is not sine qua non of completing the transfer of the right to use any goods.\" \n",
        "p_44": "The definition given for the term 'goods' in U.P. Trade Tax Act (Section 2(d)) and the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act (Section 2(j)) are practically the same. \n",
        "p_45": "8. Coming to the facts of the present case, the petitioner/assessee permitted M/s.Muthu Agencies to use their trade mark in the course of trade at the rates specified therein for various items during a particular period. Of course, it retained the liberty to make use of the Trade Mark in the event of the licensor starting to manufacture the products.  Equally, it retained the liberty to grant lincence to any other individual person or company to use the trade marks. Trade mark is the property right and it exclusively belongs to the party who has registered it. Such a right is an intangible or incorporeal goods, which can be merchandised by the registered owners. As pointed out by the Supreme Court, the words 'goods' is defined in very wide terms so as to bring in both tangible and intangible objects. General Clauses Act would explain movable property as property of every description except immovable property. Trade mark right is intangible goods, which can be subject matter of transfer. As already pointed out, M/s.Muthu Agencies was granted permission to use the trade mark without any restriction whatsoever for a particular period. Consequently, it can only be taken as transfer of a right to use and not a mere right to enjoy. Simply because the assessee retained the right for himself to use the trade mark and reserved the right to grant  permission to others to use the trade mark, it would not take away the character of the transaction as one of transfer of a right to use. That being so, this Court has to only hold that the order of the Tamil Nadu Taxation Special Tribunal, Chennai, confirming the order of the Joint Commissioner-III (SMR), Chepauk, is well in order.\n",

        "p_3": "1. The plaintiff filed the instant suit under Sections 134 and 135 of Trademark Act, 1999 as well as under Section 51 of Indian Copyrights Act seeking permanent injunction against the defendant alleging therein that the defendant was infringing the trademark and logo of the plaintiff viz 'Marc'.\n",
        "p_4": "2. It is submitted by the plaintiff that the plaintiff conceived and coined word 'Marc' and started using it as its trademark as well as logo since 1981 and developed the goodwill and reputation under the above trademark and logo. The plaintiff had become the owner of the trademark and logo because of exclusive use and the goods of the plaintiff bearing this trademark were distributed in major parts of the country. The plaintiff's trademark/logo 'Marc' was duly registered under the Trademark Act under No. 420735B in Class '9' and under No. 420736 in Class '1' and 420737B in Class '7' on 16.4.1984. The trademark was registered in respect of the goods under Class '7', '9' and '11'. The trademark was renewed from time to time and the registration was still valid. By virtue of the registration of this trademark in favor of the plaintiff and by way of long use, the plaintiff had exclusive right over the trademark within the meaning of Section 28 and 29 of the Trademark Act and the plaintiff filed number of applications for registration of the trademark in different classes. The plaintiff has been advertising and promoting this trademark through different means and has given wide publicity to this trademark through newspapers, trade literatures and trade hoardings. The plaintiff also gave its sale figures starting from 1981-82. The total annual sale figure during 1981-82 was Rs. 9,75,822/- and the sale figures for 2003-2004 was Rs. 14,65,02,583/-. There has been gradual increase in the sales from 1981 to 2004 It is stated that the plaintiff was using highest standards of business and quality and the trademark/logo 'Marc' of the plaintiff has become distinctive indicative of the plaintiff and the plaintiff's goods and business. It is alleged that defendant No. 1 and their authorized dealers were using the trademark/logo 'Marc' in an identical and deceptively similar manner as being used by the plaintiff with the same get up and make up for the goods like electrical switches and accessories. Both plaintiff's and the defendants' goods and business were same or similar and they are dealing with same line of business in the market. The trademark of the defendant was bound to cause deception and confusion in the normal course of business activities of the plaintiff. The defendants adopted the trademark/logo 'Marc' out of greed with a view to take advantage of the goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff and to create a confusion amongst the market and the consumers. The trademark adopted by the defendants amounted to indulgence in unfair trade and competition and was a dishonest, tainted and ill-motivated. The defendants were trying to cash in on the reputation and goodwill of the plaintiff and in turn were damaging the reputation of the plaintiff. The defendants were guilty of infringement of the trademark and logo of the plaintiff and were also passing off of their goods as those of the plaintiff thereby the defendants were violating not only the rights under the Trademark Act, 1999 but also common law rights of the plaintiff. Due to the activities of the defendants, the plaintiff was suffering tremendously in the business and goodwill and intending buyers were being deceived. The plaintiff came across the goods of the defendants towards the end of March 2005 being imitating trademark and the plaintiff inquired in the market at its level that the defendant had started commercially using the trademark only recently and the defendants were carrying their activities in a clandestine and deceitful manner. It is alleged that the defendants were not issuing any formal bills or invoices.\n",
        "p_5": "3. In the application under Order 39 Rule 1 and 2 CPC, the plaintiff sought ad interim injunction against the defendants restraining them from using the trademark /logo 'Marc' or any other trademark or logo identical or deceptively similar to that of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_6": "4. In written statement filed by the defendants, the defendants claimed that the plaintiff was manufacturing certain electrical accessories and gadgets under the Trademark 'Marc' whereas the defendant No. 1 was using the trademark in respect of switches, sockets, holders, three pin plugs etc. The trademark of the defendant No. 1 was entirely different in writing, style, get up, layout, logo and colour combination from that of the plaintiff. There was no infringement of the trademark of the plaintiff, neither action for passing off of the goods was maintainable. The documents filed by the plaintiff show that the plaintiff was manufacturer of water heaters and was marketing fans under the trade names like Usha, Innova etc. The defendants were neither manufacturing nor marketing electrical accessories as the one being marketed by the plaintiff, therefore, no passing off action lies against the defendants. It is further submitted that the plaintiff had no right or title to sue the defendants since the trademark 'Marc' was registered in the name of the defendant under Number 1012263 in Class '9' since April 2001 in a different artistic style get up and lay out, which was entirely different from that of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was neither manufacturing nor marketing electrical accessories like switches, holders, distribution boxes etc, being manufactured by the defendants and the goods of the plaintiff and defendants were altogether different. It is further submitted that the word 'Marc' being used by the plaintiff as well as by the defendants was not an invented or coined word and it was only a mis-spelt form of the original word 'mark' and word 'Marc' is in common use by several manufacturers in respect of the electrical and electronic appliances/goods and plaintiff cannot claim to be the sole proprietor of the word 'Marc'. The defendant had applied for trademark 'Marc' for electrical switches, holders, sockets etc in Class '9' on 28.5.2001. The defendant received examiner 's report on 21st September 2002. The defendant filed application of user and the application of the defendant was advertised in Trademark Journal Mega-14 dated 25.10.2003. There was no opposition to the registration by the plaintiff or anyone else within the meaning or scope of Section 21 of the Trademark Act and, therefore, defendant became the registered owner of the trademark 'Marc' for the goods being manufactured by the defendants within the meaning of Section 28. The plaintiff had no exclusive right to use the word 'Marc' in respect of the goods to that of the plaintiff. All allegations made by the plaintiff against the defendants were denied. It was denied that the defendant was selling the goods without valid invoices and vouchers or that the defendants were infringing the trademark and logo of the plaintiff or passing off its goods as that of the plaintiff. It is submitted that the defendants were manufacturing their goods as per ISI standard and were registered with ISI. They were manufacturing the standard quality products and they have a stake in the quality of the goods and the trademark 'Marc' in respect of the goods they were manufacturing. The defendant No. 1 has been exclusively and uninterruptedly using the trademark and logo 'Marc' since April 2001 and the claim of the plaintiff was false.\n",
        "p_7": "5. The defendants also filed a counter claim against the plaintiff giving same facts and praying an injunction against the plaintiff that the plaintiff be restrained from using the trademark and logo 'Marc' in respect of the goods like electrical switches, plugs, electrical holders, change over, distribution boxes etc. with trademark 'Marc'. Similarly an application under Order 39 Rule 1 and 2 has been made by the defendants for permanent injunction has been made in the counterclaim.\n",
        "p_8": "6. I have perused the documents filed by the both parties. The documents filed by the plaintiff would show that the plaintiff was using the word 'Marc' for ceiling fans, exhaust fans, wall mounted fans, water heaters, oil heaters and room heaters. The entire trade literatures of the plaintiff is in respect of these items only. The plaintiff has also filed the defendant's catalogue in respect of switches which show that the defendant was using the trademark 'Marc' for electrical switches, plugs, etc. In the registration certificate filed by the plaintiff, different items for which it got the trademark registered are given and these items are plugs, pressure cookers, milk cookers, table lamp, electrical fans, bulb holders, lighting fixtures and fittings installation, Florance tube etc. However, except for geysers, room heaters, oil heater, fans, literature of invoices of no other item has been placed on record being marketed or manufactured by the plaintiff. The defendant, on the other hand, has placed on record its own trade literatures and packing materials in respect of the goods being manufactured by it and the defendant is manufacturing electrical switches, cut outs, plugs, holders, change overs, regulators, sockets, tubes strips etc. The defendant has also placed on record the registration of trademark 'Marc' under Class '9' for its goods. It has also placed on record the other documents showing that the trademark 'Marc' was not a coined word and was a commonly used word by several other companies and manufacturers. A search from ROC has been placed on record showing that at least 54 companies were having the word 'Marc' as their first trade name coupled with other names and words. The plaintiff has also placed on record Internet search in respect of the use of word 'Marc' by other manufacturers and there are several manufacturers who use word 'Marc' either as a trade name or as logo or as trademark in respect of different goods. He has placed the list of at least 20 such manufacturers who were using the trademark/logo of trade name 'Marc' for various goods.\n",
        "p_9": "7. It is argued by counsel for the plaintiff that the plaintiff company M/s Marc Enterprise Private Limited was using the trademark/logo 'Marc' for last 25 years and has earned goodwill and reputation. The trademark of the plaintiff was registered with the Registrar even for those items which were being manufactured by the defendant and since the plaintiff was a registered proprietor of the trademark, the subsequent registration of the trademark obtained by defendant, does not give a right to the defendant to use the trademark 'Marc' for similar or same goods. The plaintiff was manufacturing electrical appliances and the goods being manufactured by the defendant were also electrical items and there was every possibility that the consumer would consider that the goods manufactured by the defendant were goods of the plaintiff. The plaintiff being the registered proprietor of the trademark has exclusive right to use the trademark in respect of the goods and services in respect of which the trademark was registered.\n",
        "p_10": "8. On the other hand, counsel for the defendant has argued that the plaintiff was not manufacturing any of the items being manufactured by the defendant. The plaintiff has not placed on record a single document showing that it has sold switches, holders, switch overs, plugs, sockets etc. and all invoices and documents placed on record are in respect of electrical appliances like heaters, fans etc. Since the trademark of the defendant was also registered, the plaintiff cannot claim any exclusive right to restrain the defendant from using the trademark 'Marc' for its own goods. It has also been submitted that the visual representation of the trademark by the defendant was entirely different to that of the plaintiff qua colour scheme and other aspects are also quite different.\n",
        "p_11": "9. A comparison of the trade literatures placed on record by the plaintiff with that of the defendant would show that the defendant is not copying the style and trademark of the plaintiff. While in case of plaintiff, all the letters are of same height and written in a plain simple and bold manner and there is a circle before word 'Marc' wherein word 'M' is made at the bottom of the circle in an artistic manner. The literatures of the defendant shows that the defendant has used the word 'Marc' in an altogether different manner. The first and last word are of the same height and in between the two words 'a' and 'r' are half the size and width and above that is a 'thunder' sign and the words 'tm' are written above the word 'c'. There is no circle before 'marc' The trade literatures also shows that defendant has shown only those items which are being manufactured by the defendant like electrical switches, sockets, switch over, regulators etc. There is no similarity either qua colour combination or visual representation of the two marks. The plea of the plaintiff that the defendant was copying its logo and had also copied the colour combination, colour scheme, is prima facie baseless.\n",
        "p_12": "10. It is an undisputed fact that the defendant was also a registered proprietor of the trademark 'Marc' and it was being used by defendant for different goods. In P.M. Diesels Pvt. Ltd. v. Thakural Mechanical Works, PTC (Supp.) (2) 863 (Del.), this Court, inter alia, observed as under:\n",
        "p_13": "15. In the present case the plaintiff is the registered proprietor of the trademark 'Field Marshal', in respect of diesel oil engines or parts thereof. The defendants, on the other hand, are also the registered proprietor of the trademark 'Field Marshal', but in respect of centrifugal pumps etc. Inasmuch as both the plaintiff and the defendants are the registered proprietors of the trademark which are identical, namely 'Field Marshal' the provisions of Section 28(3) of the Act would be applicable to the present case. By virtue of this provision, the exclusive right to use the trademark 'Field Marshal', shall not be deemed to have been acquired either by the plaintiff or by the defendant as against each other, but both the plaintiff as well as the defendant have otherwise the same rights as against other persons as they would have if they were the sole proprietors. Section 28(3) therefore, protects the proprietory rights of both the plaintiff as well as the defendant. They would be entitled to take action against anyone, if the trademark is infringed, but neither the plaintiff nor the defendant are entitled to take action against each other because both of them are registered proprietors of identical trademark, though in respect of different types of goods.\n",
        "p_14": "16. Learned Counsel for the plaintiff sought to reply upon a decision in the case of the Valentine Extract Company Limited (1901 (18) RPC 175) so as to contend that an injunction can be issued restraining the registered owner of a trademark from using the said mark. The head note of the said report reads as follows:\n",
        "p_15": "V, in 1897, registered three Trademark, each consisting of the word\n \n\n'Valtine' for all goods in Classes 3 and 42, and in Class 43 for beer and spirits, and purported to assign them to a Limited Company formed to carry on the business of meat extract manufacturer, with his good will, if any. Another Company obtained an injunction restraining the Limited Company from selling meat extract or meat juice under the name 'Valtine' and subsequently moved to remove the marks from the Register of Trade Marks, the grounds of the application being that at the date of the assignment V. had no goodwill to assign, that the marks were deceptive, and had not been used except for meat extract. An Order was made moving the marks from the Register with costs.\n",
        "p_16": "17. In my opinion, the aforesaid decision can be of no assistance to the plaintiff. Firstly, Mr. Justice Farewell of the Chancery Division had no occasion to consider or deal with a provision similar to Sections 28 and 31 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. The submission of Mr. Anand, learned Counsel for the defendant is that in fact the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act applicable in England at that time did not contain a provision similar to Sections 28 and 31 of the Indian Act. Secondly, no contention was raised before the Court in Valentine's case that an injunction cannot be granted restraining the registered owner from using the trademark.\n",
        "p_17": "11. In Jindal Industries Limited v. Nirmal Steel Tubes Pvt. Ltd. 1995 PTC 75 this Court refused to issue injunction against the defendant having trademark 'Nirmal' shown across the map of India in oval shape whereas the trademark of the plaintiff was 'Jindal' written across the map of India in Oval shape, since defendant was registered owner of trademark.\n",

This Court held that no injunction would lie against the appellant since the appellant was holding a registered trademark in its name and the remedy available to the respondent was to have the trademark cancelled.\n",
        "p_19": "13. The plea of the plaintiff is that the plaintiff was the registered proprietor of trademark in Class '9', through the defendant was also a registered proprietor of same trademark for Class '9', but since the plaintiff's trademark was registered earlier in time, the defendant should be restrained from manufacturing the goods. If the plaintiff had been manufacturing the same items as were being manufactured by the defendant, the plaintiff would have a case. In the instant case, however, plaintiff is not manufacturing the goods which were being manufactured by the defendant. Even if the plaintiff has got the trademark registered for a class of items, the plaintiff was not using this trademark for the goods which were being manufactured by the defendant and the defendant, therefore, cannot be restrained from being using the trademark 'Marc' for the goods manufactured by it.\n",
        "p_20": "14. In Sona Spices Pvt. Ltd. v. Soongachi Tea Industries Pvt. Ltd. 2007 (34) PTC 91(Del.) the plaintiff was the owner of registered trademark 'Sona' in Class '30' but was using it for spices only whereas the defendant was also registered trademark owner of trademark 'Sona' in respect of class '30' and was using it for Tea and other beverages. The trademark of the plaintiff was registered in October, 1980. The trademark of defendant was registered in respect of Tea in June 1983. The plaintiff contended that it was prior user of trademark 'Sona' and has commenced its business sometime in 1975 and defendant was passing off its tea as that of the plaintiff. This Court observed that plaintiff has not made out a prima facie case for interference even though plaintiff may be entitled to say that its user of trademark 'Sona' can extend beyond spices such as tea but the plaintiff has not utilized its trademark for manufacture of tea, prior to 1993 while the defendant was manufacturing the tea much prior to 1993 i.e. since 1978-79 and was user of trademark 'Sona' in respect of Tea. The plaintiff had taken no steps to protect its interests in respect of trademark 'Sona' regarding manufacture and sale of tea. The Court, therefore, held that there was no case in favor of the plaintiff and refused to grant injunction to the plaintiff against the use of the trademark 'Sona' by defendant.\n",
        "p_21": "15. In Canon Kabushiki Kaisha v. B. Mahajan and Ors 2007 (35) PTC 265(Del) the applicant sought interim injunction against the trademark and copyrights of mark 'Canon' used for imaging equipments and information systems alleging that defendant was using the trademark 'canon' for similar style and get up in goods consisting of nuts, bolts and fasteners etc. This Court observed that while considering the action of passing off, the Court has to keep in mind if there was likelihood of even in the minds of the customers. If there was dissimilarity in the goods and services, the possibility of confusion and suspicion would normally be less. This Court also observed that the plaintiff in fact has not used its registered trademark in respect of the goods falling in Class '6' and '20' and, therefore, there seems to be no force in the defendants submission that the registration obtained by the plaintiff is liable to be taken off the register under Section 47 of the Trademarks Act because of its use. The defendants had been using the trademark 'canon' as part of their trademark since 1995 for fasteners, nut, bolts and the application of the defendant was also advertised in trademarks journals based on users. The defendant had also participating in various exhibitions and openly using the the mark 'canon' as part of their trade name and style and the plaintiffs did not even claim to have objected to the same. The Court refused to issue interim injunction in favor of the plaintiff. This Court also observed that a large number of entities world over were apparently using the mark 'canon' as part of their style and trademarks. Thus, the mark 'canon' was not distinctive of plaintiff's goods world over.\n",
        "p_22": "16. In Vishnudas trading as Vishnudas Kishendas v. Vazir Sultan Tobacco Co. Ltd. 1996 PTC (16) 512 (SC) the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as under:\n",
        "p_23": " In our view, if a trader or manufacturer actually trades in or manufactures only one or some of the articles coming under a broad classification and such trader or manufacturer has no bona fide intention to trade in or manufacture other goods or articles which also fall under the said broad classification, such trader or manufacturer should not be permitted to enjoy monopoly in respect of all the articles which may come under such broad classification and by that process preclude the other traders of manufacturers to get registration or separate and distinct goods which may also be grouped under the broad classification. If registration has been given generally in respect of all the articles coming under the broad classification and if it is established that the trader or manufacturer who got such registration had not intended to use any other article except and articles being used by such trader or manufacturer, the registration of such trader is liable to be rectified by limiting the ambit of registration and confining such registration to the specific article or articles which really concern the trader or manufacturer enjoying the registration made in his favor. In our view, if rectification in such circumstances is not allowed, the trader or manufacturer by virtue of earlier registration will be permitted to enjoy the mischief of trafficking in trade mark. Looking to the Scheme of the registration of trade mark as envisaged in the Trade Mark Act and the Rules framed there under, it appears to us that registration of a trademark cannot be held to be absolute, perpetual and invariable under all circumstances.\n",
        "p_24": "17. I find that the plaintiff has failed to show that it has a prima facie case that the defendant was copying its trademark and logo. The style and logo of circle with 'M' was not at all there in the literature of defendant and trademark 'MARC' was also written in different style and manner. The defendant was neither marketing nor manufacturing the goods being marketed/manufactured by the plaintiff. The defendant was registered proprietor of the trademark 'MARC' for the goods being manufactured by it. The word 'MARC' was not a coined word or invention of the plaintiff. It was and is being extensively used world over as a trade name, a trade style and as a first name of the company.\n",
        "p_25": "18. In view of above scenario, I find that no case is made out for issuing injunction either against the plaintiff or against the defendants from using the trademark/logo 'MARC'. It is further directed that in all their literatures, the plaintiff and defendants shall write the name of the company prominently to indicate as to who was the manufacturer of the goods and on packing materials both plaintiff and defendants shall write the name of the company/manufacturer so that the customers know who is the manufacturer.\n",
        "p_26": "19. With above directions, both the applications stand disposed of. No orders as to costs.\n",

        "p_3": "1. The plaintiff has filed the present suit seeking the reliefs for permanent injunction against the defendant from infringement of its registered trademark in the expression 'Infosys' and from passing off the goods of the defendants as if they were those of the plaintiffs and an order of delivery up of the infringing material by the defendants as well as a claim for damages to the tune of Rs. 20 lakhs and an order for rendition of accounts of profits illegally earned by the defendants. On 28th September, 2005 an ex-parte injunction was granted in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants prohibiting defendant No.1, its assigns, employees, servants, dealers, retailers and all persons acting on their behalf from using \"Infosys\" as a part of their trade name or corporate name, either with or without any prefix or suffix which amounts to infringement of the plaintiffs' trademark.\n",
        "p_4": "2. Summons were directed to be issued for service of the defendants in the suits. Summons sent through registered covers by the Registry to defendant Nos. 1, 3, 4 & 5 for hearing fixed on 22nd February, 2006 were returned with the reports of refusal of service while defendant Nos. 2, 3 and 4 were served with the summons by ordinary process. In these circumstances, the defendants were proceeded against ex-parte by an order of this Court passed on 18th April, 2006 and the plaintiff was required to file its ex-parte evidence by way of affidavit.\n",
        "p_5": "3. The plaintiff has filed its evidence by way of an affidavit of Shri Parveen Biswas, a constituted attorney of the plaintiff. In this view of the matter, for the purposes of adjudication on the present case, only the facts averred by the plaintiff in the plaint and proved by way of affidavit by way of evidence are required to be considered.\n",
        "p_6": "4. The facts established on record show that the plaintiff was incorporated as a Company under the Companies Act, 1956 on 2nd July, 1981 as 'Infosys Consultants Pvt. Ltd.' in the State of Maharashtra. The plaintiff shifted its base to Karnataka in the year 1992 and changed its claim to 'Infosys Technologies Pvt. Ltd.' on 21st April, 1992. Subsequently, the name was further changed to Infosys Technologies Ltd. on 2nd of June, 1992 when the plaintiff became a public company. The expression 'Infosys' at all material times was and still is the key, essential prominent and principal part of the corporate and trade name of the plaintiff since its inception in the year 1981.\n",
        "p_7": "Page 0393\n \n\n",
        "p_8": "5. Shri Parveen Biswas, who has signed and verified the plaint and instituted the present suit has been authorised by a resolution of the Plaintiff-Company.\n",
        "p_9": "6. The expression \"Infosys\" as a trademark/service mark has been proved to have been registered by the plaintiff in various classes in over 20 countries. In India, the trademark has been registered towards various categories of goods since 15th July, 1987, which include computer stationery, computer manuals, printed matter for computer instructions, teaching material, computer hardware, computer inter faces, peripherals, electronic telex interfaces, computer software, stationery, manuals, brochures, printted matters, instructional and teaching material. It also has registrations for computer hardware, data modules, motion control devices, warehouse management systems, customers service management systems as used in banks, automatic teller machines, computerised interactive machines, all being goods in class 0-9. Besides this, the plaintiff has registrations of the trademark from different dates in the year 1999 in various goods in Classes 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 23, 24, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 33 of the Trademark Act.\n",
        "p_10": "7. The plaintiff has also proved the validity of the registrations which are stated to have been renewed from time to time and are subsisting and in force in favor of the plaintiff even at present.\n",
        "p_11": "8. The expression 'Infosys' was coined by the plaintiff so as to distinguish its business, trade identity and goods/services from others. Extensive use of this expression has been made since inception and because of its inherent distinguishable ability and extensive use, undoubtedly the same has became distinctive of the plaintiff in the eyes of the consumers as also the trade and industry, in India and abroad. The plaintiff, though headquartered in Bangalore, has operations in different parts of the world. It has 33 state of the art development centres located all over the world. In India the plaintiff has development centres in Bangalore, Pune, Bhvneshwar, Chennai, Hyderabad, Mysore, Mangalore and Tiruananthapuram while it has proximity development centres in the United States and United Kingdom. The plaintiff is mainly engaged in the business of IT services, IT solutions, consulting and business process management. For this purpose, its activities include designing enterprises, architecture enterprise data and information security, software production development, customerised software development etc. The plaintiff offers its services and solutions across different industry segments, which, inter alia, include the banking capital market, insurance healthcare, life sciences, automobiles, aerospace resource energies and utilities, discrete manufacturing communication service providers etc. The success of the plaintiff is indicated by its listing in the leading bourses of the country as well as the Nasdack, the US Stock Exchange for technology driven companies.\n",
        "p_12": "9. The plaintiff has adequately established on record that the expression 'infosys' due to substantial continued, extensive and open use since 1981 i.e. for over two decades, combined with the quality of goods/services offered under this trademark and name that by extensive sales promotional efforts has become distinctive of the plaintiff in the eyes of the consumers. The Page 0394 plaintiff also acquired the exclusive right to use the trademark `Infosys' by virtue of the abovenoticed registrations under the provisions of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 and the corresponding provisions of the Trademarks Act, 1999.\n",
        "p_13": "10. This trademark and name, because of the wide spread use and association with quality products and services emanating from the plaintiff, has acquired a high degree of selling power thereby becoming a target for commercial infringers intending to create on the goodwill and reputation connected with the mark for their own benefit, by deceiving consumers as regards the source and origin of the goods and services. The plaintiff has also established that it has made applications for registration of the mark 'Infosys' in various service classes including classes 35, 37, 38 and 42 under the Trademarks Act, 1999.\n",
        "p_14": "11. Several steps have been necessitated to protect the exclusivity of the mark 'Infosys' by the plaintiff, which has issued caution notices over the years in newspapers and journals having wide circulation including the Business Line, Business World, Business Today, Economic Times, TC Quest, Data Quest, Spazat, India Today, Outlook, Business Standard, Jetwings and Economic Times. These notices have been published over the years including in 1996, 1999, 2000 and 2004. Undoubtedly, the plaintiff has taken an active interest in protecting its intellectual property rights in the trademark/service mark 'Infosys'.\n",
        "p_15": "12. The plaintiff has also established that it has made expenditure to the tune of Rs. 392.12 crores towards sales promotional marketing expenses and brand building expenses in the fiscal year 2004-05 alone and that it has established an enviable reputation and goodwill in the market not only nationally but on an international level as well. The consumers invariably associate the mark 'Infosys' to that of the plaintiff's goods and services and the same is associated with the trade identity of the plaintiff which has made the mark distinctive of the plaintiff in the eyes of the consumers in India and globally.\n",
        "p_16": "14. In or around September, 2004, the plaintiff discovered that the defendants were using 'Infosys' as a prominent part of their business name/tradename and domain name. They were running a computer training institute for students, in the name and style of 'Park College and Engineering Technology' and were involved in the business of, inter alia, data processing and data conversion work/commercial venture.\n",
        "p_17": "15. The defendant No. 1-M/s. Park Infosys is a data conversion/data processing division/centre engaged in the business of imparting computer education to engineer students in this institution and is in a business similar to that of the plaintiff. The defendants No. 2, 3, 4 & 5 are the Managing Committee Members of the defendant No.1. The products and services of the defendants relate to computer related products and services and are directly relatable to the plaintiff's business.\n",
        "p_18": "16. In this view of the matter, the plaintiff immediately caused a legal notice to be issued through its trademark attorney M/s. D.P. Ahuja & Company on the 15th October, 2004 requiring the defendants to cease and desist from all and any further use, anywhere and in any manner whatsoever of the Page 0395 trademark/trade identity 'Infosys' or any other deceptively similar mark. In their reply dated 3rd November, 2004, the defendants submitted that they have prefixed 'Infosys' to the name 'Park' in computer related matters and hence they have not in any way infringed the rights of the plaintiff. The plaintiff again issued a final legal notice to the defendants on 16th December, 2004, of course, denying the contentions of the defendants and reiterating its requisition as contained in the earlier notice of 15th October, 2004.\n",
        "p_19": "17. As the defendants failed to respond to this notice, the plaintiff was of the impression that it had abided by the notice demand. However, in a survey conducted in June, 2005 by the plaintiff, it found that defendants were still using the expression 'Infosys' as a prominent part of their tradename and business address and thereby continued to derive benefit from the plaintiff's goodwill and reputation. Since the defendants had refused to seize and desist from the use of the expression 'Infosys', the present suit has been filed seeking the aforenoticed relief. No written statement has been filed and the assertions of the plaintiff have remained unrebutted and undisputed on record. The plaintiff has established that consumers and traders associate the mark 'Infosys' with the business/goods/services of the plaintiff and none else. By their action in using the trade mark 'infosys' on their goods and services as a part of their trademark and corporate name, the defendants have caused confusion and deception in the market amongst the trade and public at large to the effect that the goods and services of the defendants originate from or have a trade connection, approval or association with the plaintiff. This action is certainly a misrepresentation which would constitute the tort of passing of the goods/business of the defendants as those of the plaintiff's.\n",
        "p_20": "18. The plaintiff has established that it has proprietary rights in the trademark by virtue of the registrations thereof in accordance with law in its favor. \n",
        "p_21": "19. By virtue of Sections 27 & 28 of the Trademarks Act, 1999, the registered proprietor of a registered trademark gets the exclusive right to use the same in relation to the goods for which it is registered. Re : AIR 1971 SC 898 at 903 National Bell Co. v. Metal Goods Manufacturing Co. AIR 1986 SC 137 at 155 American Home Products v. Mac Laboratories\n",
        "p_22": "20. It enables the proprietor to file a suit for infringement of this right and obtain injunction, damages and other rights against an infringer. Re.:  Durga Dutt Sharma v. N.P. Laboratories AIR 1991 Del 22 Avis International v. Avi Footwear AIR 1986 Delhi 345 Tata Oil Mills v. Wipro Ltd.\n",
        "p_23": "21. The defendants have deliberately and with malafide intentions used the trademark/name 'Infosys' to trade upon the goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff. The adoption by the defendants of the mark 'Infosys' as part of their trade name/business name/trading style and as a trademark/domain name/Email address has been done with a view to deceive the public at large so as to misappropriate the reputation and goodwill of the plaintiff. The mark and name adopted by the defendants is phonetically, visually and Page 0396 structurally similar to that of the plaintiff. The defendants have blatantly and dishonestly committed acts of infringement of the registered trademarks of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_24": "22. The plaintiff has also established and proved on record the various steps taken by it against other persons who were so infringing its proprietary rights and passing of the goods as those of the plaintiff's. The plaintiff has successfully filed service, legal actions and orders and prohobitory orders of restraint have been passed against several persons who have conducted themselves as the defendants in the instant case.\n",
        "p_25": "23. It now becomes necessary to examine the relief to which the plaintiff may be entitled. In a case similar to the instant case, M/s. Intel Corporation had filed CS (OS) 1333/2005 in this Court. In the judgment entitled Intel Corporation v. Dinakarn Nayyar and Ors. rendered on 24th April, 2006, the Court noticed that the plaintiff was aggrieved by the use of a deceptively similar trademark to its trademark 'Intel' by the defendant. The defendant was using the trademark 'ArtIntel'. The plaintiff claimed to have carried out pioneering work in computer technology and have been using 'Intel' as its corporate name and as name of its product since 1968. Their trademark was also registered in India for various classes of computers. The Court held that though the word 'Art Intel' is one word, while pronouncing, it gets spoken up into two parts i.e. 'Art' & 'Intel'. The mark 'Intel' of the plaintiff is well known and the obvious use of word 'Intel' by the defendant was with the object of deceiving the public that it has some connection with the mark of the plaintiff 'Intel' and to take advantage of the goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff. The Court also noticed that the chances of such deception increase when the product range is the same or similar. In this view of the matter, the Court held that the plaintiff was entitled to a decree of permanent prohibitory injunction and delivery up.\n",
        "p_26": "24. In  Lakshmikant V Patel v. Chetan Bhat Shah, the business was being carried out under the name Mukta Jiwan Colur Lab. The abbreviation QSS (Quick Service Station) was added as a prefix. It was held that the same did not make any difference to the tradename as 'QSS' was merely an adjective - pre-fix to the tradename.\n",
        "p_27": "25. In the case of AIR 1974 Delhi 12 Kedar Nath v. M.P. the prefix Vijay was added to the trademark Sudarshan Dhoop. The Court found the prefix to be inconspicuous and held that the use of the same with prefix would cause deception to the unwary purchaser.\n",
        "p_28": "26. In the instant case, the plaintiff has established that the defendants are using 'Infosys' as a prominent part of their business and tradename. They have only pre-fixed 'Infosys' with the word \"Park\". \n",
        "p_29": "27. The trade mark 'Infosys' is certainly associated distinctively with the business and trade of the plaintiff. The pre-fix by the defendant of the word Page 0397 \"Park\" before the trademark 'Infosys' is certainly of no significance in as much as the word 'Infosys' is distinctive of the business and trade of the plaintiff. There can be no manner of doubt that use by the defendant is likely to result in confusion and the same has propensity of diverting customers and business of the plaintiff to the defendant. It is well settled that honesty and fairplay are required to be the basic policies in business and trading and no person has any right to carry on his business in such a way as would lead the public into believing that the goods or services belonging to someone else are his or associated therewith. The service range of the defendant is also similar to that of the plaintiff. In this view of the matter, I am of the considered view that the plaintiff is entitled to a decree for injunction as prayed for.\n",
        "p_30": "28. It is an undisputed fact that the plaintiff is the registered proprietor of the trade mark 'Infosys' which is duly registered in India bearing Nos. 484837, 475267 and 475269. The plaintiff has exclusive rights in this trade mark. The defendant is clearly guilty of infringement of the trademark of the plaintiff and it is not entitled to use the same either as a trade mark or as a tradename or as a part thereof.\n",
        "p_31": "29. The plaintiff in the present case has also prayed for damages to the extent of Rs. 20,00,000/-.\n",
        "p_32": "30. In the affidavit which has been filed before this Court by Shri Parveen Biswas, in support of the plaintiff, it is submitted that the profits earned by the defendants by misappropriating the goodwill and reputation as well as on account of business divergence are the loss suffered by the plaintiff. It is submitted that the plaintiff has no access to the accounts of the defendants and thus it is not possible to assess the profits made by the defendants. A prayer is thus made for damages to be awarded against the defendants in favor of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_33": "31. Shri Parveen Biswas in para 12.1 of his affidavit has given details of both the worldwide revenue earned and the expenses incurred by the plaintiff on advertisements and promotional activities. In the last 10 fiscal years, the plaintiff has earned a worldwide revenue from Rs. 28.9 crores in 1993 to Rs. 6859.66 Crores between 2004-2005. During this period the expenditure on advertisement and promotional activities of the plaintiff has gone up from Rs. 22.66 lacs in 1993-94 to Rs. 3,91212.00 lakhs between 2004-05.\n",
        "p_34": "32. Undoubtedly, assessment of damages has to be based on cogent evidence which is placed on record. The most material evidence which would enable a court to arrive at a fair assessment of the gains which have accrued to a defendant by the acts complained of, would be a true and fair rendition of accounts by a defendant who is engaged in the acts of infringement. However, a defendant who is indulging in such illegal activity would obviously not maintain correct accounts and in any case would not place the material in respect thereof before the court. Therefore, it is left to the court to ascertain the probable level of sales of the defendant by other modes.\n",
        "p_35": "33. Various indices have been utilised by the courts in assessing the extent of sales of the defendant.\n",
        "p_36": "Page 0398\n \n\n",
        "p_37": "34. Reference can usefully be made to another pronouncement of this Court in  entitled Microsoft Corporation v. Yogesh Popat and Anr. In a suit by the plaintiff praying for a decree of prohibitory injunction, an order for delivery up to the plaintiff of the counterfeit/unlicensed copies of the plaintiff's software and other infringing material and for an order for rendition of accounts of profits illegally earned by the defendant by reasons of infringement of plaintiff's copyright including compensatory damages and a decree in the sum of the amount so ascertained, the Court has to consider the evidence led by the plaintiff. The defendant had opted to remain ex-parte and did not contest the suit. The Court noticed that the evidence on record established hard disc piracy by the defendants who were pirating software of the plaintiff and loading the same on the hard disc of computers sold by them without permission from the plaintiffs. Based on the popularity of the computer software of the plaintiff, the Court adopted an assumptive process whereby it based financial loss to the plaintiff on assumption of sale of 100 computers each year, which were loaded with pirated software. On such assumption, the Court arrived at a computation of loss of profits in the sum of Rs. 19.75 lacs. In this background, the Court decreed the suit in terms of the prayers in the plaint and awarded compensation/damages against the defendants in the sum of Rs. 19.75 lacs with interest @ 9% per annum from the date of decree till payment.\n",
        "p_38": "35. There are certain cases as the present where even this material is not available inasmuch as the defendant is not actually selling goods. The present case is one such matter. The plaintiff has not placed any document evidencing the sale of any item by the defendant nor is there any record of the fees or charges which the defendant is charging for the services being provided while carrying on its business activities under the name complained of in the present cases. Even such instances have been the matter of adjudication by courts. In these cases, the courts have arrived at an assessment of probable losses which may have enured to the plaintiff by an assessment of the sales figures of the plaintiff. In such cases, the courts have relied upon the sales figure of the plaintiff which were established on record.\n",
        "p_39": "36. In this behalf, reference can be made to the decision in CS (OS) No. 1385/2005 entitled The Heels v. V.K. Abrol and Anr. reported at the plaintiff had claimed damages for a sum of Rs. 21 lacs on grounds of infringement of trade mark by the defendant. The defendant opted to stay away from the proceedings. In these circumstances, the Court noticed thus:\n",
        "p_40": "11. This Court has taken a view that where a defendant deliberately stays away from the proceedings with the result that an enquiry into the accounts of the defendant for determination of damages cannot take place, the plaintiff cannot be deprived of the claim for damages as that would amount to a premium on the conduct of such defendant. The result would be that parties who appear before the court and contest the matter would be liable to damages while the parties who choose to stay away from the court after having infringed the right of the plaintiff, would go scotfree. This position cannot be acceptable.\n",
        "p_41": "Page 0399\n \n\n",
        "p_42": "12. No doubt it is not possible to give an exact figure of damages on the basis of actual loss, but certain token amounts on the basis of the sales of the plaintiff can certainly be made. The plaintiff is unnecessarily dragged into litigation and the defendants must bear consequences thereof. In fact in such a case both compensatory and punitive damages ought to be granted apart from the costs incurred by the plaintiff on such litigation. In view of the given sales figure of the plaintiff, I consider it appropriate to grant a decree of damages in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants for a sum of Rs 3 lakh apart from costs of the suit.\n",
        "p_43": "Thus the Court has awarded damages in favor of the plaintiff based on the sales of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_44": "37. In the judgment dated 8th May, 2006 rendered in CS(OS) 1528/2003 entitled Hindustan Pencils Ltd. v. Aparna Enamel Industries reported at 2006 (131) DLT 65, the plaintiff had filed a suit for permanent injunction as well as damages against the defendant on allegations of infringement of its trade mark and copyright as well as deceptive passing off by the defendant in respect of the plaintiff's trademarks 'Natraj' and 'Apsara'. Defendants were only seeking to make a difference by spelling 'Nataraj' as spelt by the plaintiff as 'Natraj'. The Court on consideration of the matter passed a decree of permanent injunction prohibiting the defendant from using the offending trademarks 'Natraj' and 'Apsara'.\n",
        "p_45": "38. So far as damages are concerned, the defendant had stayed away from the judicial proceedings and consequently enquiry into the accounts of the defendant for determination of damages could not take place. The Court held that if this was to follow as a result of the defendants remaining ex-parte, it would amount to \"a premium on the conduct of such defendant\". The observations of the Court on the aspect of damages are pertinent and read thus:\n",
        "p_46": " 11. The last aspect to be considered is the question of damages. This Court has already taken a view in Hero Honda Motors Ltd. v. Shree Assuramji Scooters , that even if the defendant stays away from the judicial proceedings, the plaintiff cannot be deprived of the claim for damages. This is so since the result of the defendant staying away from the judicial proceedings is that any inquiry into the accounts of the defendant for determination of damages cannot take place and a view to the contrary would amount to a premium on the conduct of such defendant. The result would be that parties who appear before the Court and contest the matter would be liable to damages while parties who choose to stay away from the Court after having infringed the right of the plaintiff would go scot-free. This position cannot be acceptable. No doubt it is not possible to give an exact figure of damages on the basis of actual loss, but certain token amounts on the basis of sales of the plaintiff can certainly be assessed. The plaintiff has unnecessarily been dragged into litigation and the defendant must bear the consequences thereof. I Page 0400 am of the considered view that taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case, the plaintiff is also entitled for a decree of damages against the defendants for a sum of Rs. 1 lakh apart from the cots of the suit. Decree sheet be drawn up accordingly.\n",
        "p_47": "Courts have also been of the view in the face of their being inadequate material on record, however, notional damages deserve to be awarded, bearing in mind the flagrancy of the infringement by the defendant.\n",
        "p_48": "39. The defendants have been in this business in any case since September, 2004.\n",
        "p_49": "40. In this behalf, the plaintiff has proved on record as Exhibit P-5, the reply received from the Advocate of the defendant which is dated 3rd November, 2004 in which the defendants have admitted that they are doing computer related services under the name and style of 'Park Infosys' for the past several years. In computer related matters, the defendants have prefixed 'Infosys' with the word 'Park' even as per the Exhibit P-5. The defendants have opted not to contest the suit despite service of summons.\n",
        "p_50": "41. In an action for infringement of trademark, the profits made by the defendant cannot always be the true criterion of the damages awardable to the plaintiff as the defendant's gain may not always be proportionate to the plaintiff's loss. However, it is trite that the plaintiff's loss or the defendant's gain will not be assumed in the absence of proof. The plaintiff is required to prove some distinct damage from the infringement of his trademark by defendant. The effect of the infringing acts of the defendant may be evidenced by diminishing of the quantum of goods sold by the plaintiff for the reason that the defendant took away the plaintiff's customers. The defendant may also impact the plaintiff's customers. The defendant may also impact the plaintiff's business by causing him to sell its products at a lower price. In either event, there would be a reduction in either the total volume of the plaintiff's business or lowering in the percentage increase of business as compared to the previous years. Thus the measure of damage suffered by the plaintiff is to be found by an assessment of the profits the plaintiff would have made if the offending article had not been introduced by the defendant in the market or if the defendant had not undertaken the illegal activities complained of by the plaintiff. Accordingly, the plaintiff is held to be entitled to the decree of injunction as well as an order for delivery up forthwith of all goods and stationery bearing the trademark or capable of reproducing the trade mark. These facts have to be proved by the evidence on record either relating to the business of the defendants or which could be assessed from a decline in the business of the plaintiff on account of the activities of the defendant which could be gathered from the figures of sales over the period of time during which the plaintiff has continued with the activities complained of and an assertion of such loss by the plaintiff in its evidence.\n",
        "p_51": "42. Upon a consideration of the plaint and the affidavit by way of the evidence filed before this court, I find that the plaintiff has failed to prove either the profits derived by the defendant from its illegal activities or such sales record to establish the loss which has resulted to the plaintiff by establishing a decline in the value of its business or a fall in the percentage increase in the Page 0401 business as compared to preceding years. The only material which has been placed by the plaintiff on record is the value of its international sales over different years. Bald figures without even an assertion of loss or diminution in business and without any submission in this behalf do not establish the essential features noticed above which would have entitled the plaintiff to damages. Therefore, while holding that the defendants cannot be permitted to continue with its illegal activities, however, I find that no award of damages can be made in favor of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_52": "43. I, therefore, hereby pass a decree for permanent prohibitory injunction restraining the defendants, their assigns, dealers, retailers etc. from manufacturing, marketing, advertising directly or indirectly or dealing in goods/services using as a trademark or as part of trademark or domain name or otherwise trading under the mark or trade name 'Infosys' or any other mark or name deceptively similar thereto where the expression 'infosys' is used by itself or as a part of any other mark/name, or doing any act whereby it would infringe on the rights of the plaintiff under the registered trademarks bearing nos.475267 and 484837.\n",

        "p_3": "1. The question that arises for consideration in the present application under Order 39 Rules 1 & 2, CPC is whether the plaintiff is entitled to an interim order of injunction, inter alia, restraining the defendant from using the mark 'EVIT' in respect of its pharmaceutical products. The plaintiff's case is that the defendant's trademark 'EVIT' is deceptively similar to the plaintiff's registered trademark 'ZEVIT'.\n",
        "p_4": "2. The plaintiff's trademark 'ZEVIT' is registered under Registration No. 452526 on 16.04.1986 in respect of pharmaceuticals, veterinary and sanitary preparations and substances. The original registration was in the name of Eskayef Ltd. The name of that company was changed to Smithkline Beecham Pharmaceuticals (India) Ltd in the year 1994. By a Deed of Assignment dated 19.01.1998, the said registered trademark was assigned by the said Smithkline Beecham Pharmaceuticals (India) Ltd in favor of the plaintiff. It is the plaintiff's case that the trademark 'ZEVIT' is an invented word having no dictionary meaning and thus has the highest degree of distinctiveness connoting the plaintiffs goods exclusively. According to the plaintiff, the trademark 'ZEVIT' has been used by the plaintiff continuously, regularly and without any hindrance for the last number of years. A sample of the product was annexed as Annexure-B. It indicates that the plaintiff's product 'ZEVIT' is a formulation which contains Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate, Vitamins B1, B2, B6, B12, Nicotinamide, Calcium Pantothenate and Vitamin C. Essentially, it is a vitamin formulation.\n",
        "p_5": "3. It is alleged in the plaint that sometime in November, 2002, the plaintiff became aware that the defendant was manufacturing, marketing and selling the vitamin capsules under the trademark 'EVIT'.\n",
        "p_6": "4. As per the written statement filed by the defendants, the products marketed by them under the trademark 'EVIT' are nothing but vitamin 'E' tablets. As per the defendants, the product is a single ingredient vitamin drug. The defendants' drugs are allegedly marketed under the trademark 'EVIT' which, Page 2544 according to the defendants, is derived from and adopted to identify the generic name of the drug, namely, 'Vitamin E'. According to the defendants', the suffix 'VIT' is common to the pharmacy trade indicating vitamin preparations.\n",
        "p_7": "5. From these brief facts, it is apparent that the plaintiff is the proprietor of the registered trademark 'ZEVIT'. It is also apparent that the plaintiff has also been continuously using the same. The defendants mark 'EVIT' is not a registered mark. The defendant has been using this mark in respect of its 'Vitamin E' formulations. When this plaint was filed, this Court passed an ex parte ad interim order in favor of the plaintiff on 13.02.2003 injuncting the defendants from manufacturing, selling and offering for sale or advertising or directly or indirectly dealing in pharmaceutical preparations under the trademark 'EVIT'. This ex parte interim order has continued till date. The plaintiff seeks confirmation of this order and the defendants pray for vacation of the same.\n",
        "p_8": "6. The case of the plaintiff is that the registration of a trademark, by virtue of Section 28 of The Trademarks Act, 1999 (hereinafter referred to as 'the said Act') gives to the registered proprietor of the trademark the exclusive right over the trademark in relation to the goods or the services in respect of which the trademark is registered and to obtain relief in respect of infringement of the trademark in the manner provided by the said Act. Infringement of registered trademarks has been specified under Section 29 of the said Act. It is the plaintiff's case that in view of the provisions of Section 29 of the said Act, infringement is established if it can be shown that the infringing trademark is identical or deceptively similar to the registered trademark in such a manner as to render the use of the mark likely to be taken as being used as a trademark. It is further the case of the plaintiff that in terms of Section 31 of the said Act, registration of a trademark is prima facie evidence of its validity. In support of his contention that the registration of a trademark gives valuable rights to its owner/proprietor, the learned Counsel for the plaintiff referred to the following decisions:\n",
        "p_9": "i) National Bell Co. v. Metal Goods Manufacturing Co. (P.) Ltd and Anr. AIR 1971 SC 898;\n",
        "p_10": "ii) American Home Products Corporation v. Mac Laboratories Pvt. Ltd and Anr. ;\n",

        "p_12": "iv) M/s Avis International Ltd v. Avi Footwear Industries and Anr. AIR 1991 Delhi 22. \n",
        "p_13": "7. These decisions need not be examined in detail inasmuch as the position is clear and inescapable that the registration of a trademark gives to the proprietor thereof valuable and exclusive rights as indicated in Section 28 of the said Act. The only question that needs to be considered in the present case is whether the trademark 'ZEVIT' and 'EVIT' are deceptively similar or not. It has been contended by the learned Counsel for the defendant that both the marks can be broken down into two components each. One component Page 2545 is common to both and those are the letters 'VIT'. According to the defendants, this portion, i.e., 'VIT', is common to the trade and is of a generic nature inasmuch as it is normally used for vitamin formulations. Therefore, what needs to be compared are the non-generic parts of the marks. The prefix 'ZE' as used by the plaintiff and the prefix 'E' as used by the defendant. According to the learned Counsel for the defendants, these are dissimilar and cannot be confused for one another. Therefore, ignoring the comparison of the generic portions, there is enough dissimilarity to take the case of the defendants mark out of the expression deceptively similar used in Section 29 of the said Act.\n",
        "p_14": "8. For this proposition, the learned Counsel for the defendants relied upon the case of F. Hoffimann-La Roche and Co. Ltd v. Geoffrey Manners and Co. Pvt. Ltd. . In that case, the Supreme Court was faced with the comparison of the trademarks 'DROPOVIT' and 'PROTOVIT'. In paragraph 12 of the said decision, the Supreme Court observed that in order to decide whether 'DROPOVIT' is deceptively similar to the word 'PROTOVIT' each of the two words must, therefore, be taken as a whole word. According to the Supreme Court, each of the two words consists of eight letters, the last three letters are common, and in the uncommon part the first two are consonants, the next is the same vowel 'o', the next is a consonant and the fifth is again a common vowel 'o'. The Supreme Court further observed that the combined effect of these was to produce an alliteration. The Supreme Court also noted that the affidavits of the appellant indicated that the last three letters 'VIT' is a well-known common abbreviation used in the pharmaceutical trade to denote Vitamin preparations. In this view, the Supreme Court observed that it is apparent that the terminal syllable 'VIT' in the two marks is both descriptive and common to the trade and the Supreme Court further held that if greater regard is paid to the uncommon element in these two words, it is difficult to hold that one will be mistaken for or confused with the other. The Court further held that the letters 'D' and 'P' in 'DROPOVIT' and the corresponding letters 'P' and 'T' in 'PROTOVIT' cannot possibly be slurred over in pronunciation and the words are so dissimilar that there is no reasonable probability of confusion between the words either from the visual or phonetic point of view. The learned Counsel for the defendants placed great reliance on this decision of the Supreme Court to contend that the suffix 'VIT' is (a) generic in nature and used for vitamin formulations; (b) to be ignored for comparing the marks; (c) that the prefixes 'ZE' and 'E' used in the case of the plaintiff's trademark and the defendant's trademark respectively are entirely dissimilar and, therefore, on a comparison of the pre-fixes alone, it cannot be said that the defendant's mark was deceptively similar to the mark used by the plaintiff. A host of other judgments were cited by the counsel for the plaintiff as well as the counsel for the defendants, but I need need examine those judgments as the principles are clear from the aforesaid decision itself. The principles Page 2546 being that the words must be compared as wholes and while comparing the marks, greater regard should be paid to the uncommon element in the two marks and upon such comparison if it is found that the uncommon elements are so dissimilar as cannot be confused with each other, then the conclusion would be that the marks are not deceptively similar. Putting this proposition conversely, it becomes clear that if a comparison of the uncommon elements reveals that there is a likelihood of deception and or similarity and/or confusion, then it can be clearly established that the marks are deceptively similar. Although the learned Counsel for the plaintiff submits that the decision in F. Hoffimann-La Roche and Co. Ltd (supra) would not be applicable to the facts of the present case inasmuch as that was a case concerned with a dispute qua registration, whereas the present case is one of infringement of a registered trademark, I feel that the principles with regard to the question of deceptive similarity are quite well laid out in the said decision of the Supreme court and are equally applicable in relation to an action on infringement. But, the decision in F. Hoffimann-La Roche (supra) does not militate against the plaintiff in the facts of the present case.\n",
        "p_15": "9. Comparing the marks 'ZEVIT' and 'EVIT', I find that the prefixes 'ZE' and 'E' are phonetically quite similar. The suffix 'VIT' is common to both the marks and is, indeed, identical. The marks taken as a whole, therefore, include identical suffixes and quite similar prefixes, therefore, in my view, the inescapable conclusion is that the mark 'EVIT' is deceptively similar to the registered trademark 'ZEVIT' of which the plaintiff is the proprietor. The plaintiff, therefore, has been able to establish a good prima facie case and the balance of convenience is also in its favor. If the order prayed for is not granted, it would suffer irreparable harm and injury.\n",
        "p_16": "10. The defendants have raised a plea of delay, however, I am not much concerned with such a plea inasmuch as the present action is more of one of infringement of a registered trademark than one of passing off where such considerations as delay and acquiescence have relevance.\n",
        "p_17": "11. Accordingly, the ex parte ad interim order dated 13.02.2003 is confirmed till the disposal of the suit.\n",

The plaintiff claims that the test of unsuspecting consumer with average intelligence and imperfect recollection must be applied and if the said test is applied, the consumer is bound to be deceived.

        "p_92": "20. The plaintiff claims that the aforesaid is not a mere co-incidental act, but is a deliberate act of copying in order to deceive the customers and to cause confusion amongst the mind of the said customers. The defendants are, thus, alleged to be attempting to ride piggy back on the reputation and fame of the plaintiff's products and it is not a case of one product being copied, but the entire range itself being copied. The defendants are further alleged to be attempting to utilise the substantial reputation and goodwill of the plaintiff and it is all the more because of the nature of the products where packaging forms an essential and integral part of identification of the products. The defendants' act is alleged to be a misrepresentation in the course of trade so as to cause deception about its origin or at least claim an indirect connection with the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_93": "21. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants' act amount to an attempt to pass off its goods as that of the plaintiff, an act of unfair competition, infringement of copyright of the plaintiff and dilution. The deception is stated to be bound to lead to confusion in passing off of the goods and even if the customer evinces interest in the defendants' products based on its get-up, the same would be 'initial interest confusion', which is also a species of passing off. The aspect of dilution is explained as a consequence of utilisation by the defendants of the plaintiff's goodwill arising from the high quantity of products and sales standards and the act of the defendants would, thus, constitute dilution of the plaintiff's brand-name equity in the products.\n",
        "p_94": "22. The plaintiff has prayed for a decree of permanent injunction in respect of six packages of DIA products in question, which are similar to the LIA products; decree for delivery up; and for damages of Rs. 21,50,000/-.\n",
        "p_95": "23. At the stage of the suit being entertained and summons being issued, the interim relief was granted in favor of the plaintiff and Local Commissioners were appointed, who submitted their reports. The situation on visit to the office of M/s. Divya Incense (India) Pvt. Ltd. at Srirampuram, Bangalore has been explained by the Local Commissioner and it was found that the premises belong to M/s. Keerti Parimala Works, who were manufacturers and suppliers of agarbathi. The said Works also did job work for M/s. Divya Incense. At some stage, M/s. Divya Incense had its office in the premises, but the same was stated to have been subsequently moved to another address at Bangalore at 19/2, 2nd Cross, Robertson Block, Ramachandrapuram, Bangalore. This office of M/s. Divya Incense was also stated to be managed by Mr. Sunder Raj, who was the proprietor of M/s. Keerti Parimala Works. This new premises was also visited by the Local Commissioner. The six brand-names of DIA were manufactured there on job-work basis by M/s. Keerti Parimala Works, who purchased raw agarbathies from M/s. Divya Incense, Bangalore. The goods after packaging were then shipped to M/s. Divya Incense, NOIDA.\n",

        "p_97": "25. The defendants have contested the suit and one of the principal defenses is that the trademark of the defendants is not DIA, but LOTUS DIA. This is compared with the plaintiff's CYCLE brand. It is, thus, claimed that LOTUS DIA is a composite mark and, thus, there is no question of deception. It is also claimed that the word 'LIA' is not a trademark and is being used as only a quality mark. The defendants have claimed to have adopted the trademark LOTUS DIA bona fide during the course of business, which is distinct from the mark of the plaintiff. The word 'DIA' is stated to be an ordinary word used in reference to 'small earthern lamps', which is commonly used on religious occasions.\n",
        "p_98": "26. Insofar as the infringement of copyright is concerned, it is claimed that the trade dress and the artistic features are completely different for the two. The allegation of passing off has been denied and it has been claimed that the plaintiff has, in fact, come with unclean hands before the Court. The defendants claim to have achieved sales worth Rs. 5.75 Lakhs in 2003-2004 and about Rs. 10.15 Lakhs from 01.04.2004 to 0.08.2004. The defendants claim to have engaged the services of an artist at Bangalore to create the copyright and the labels / packaging. It is, thus, stated that the plaintiff is not entitled to any relief of injunction or damages.\n",

        "p_103": "4. Whether the plaintiff is guilty of suppressing material facts and making false statements and to what effect?\n",

On 25.08.2004, learned counsel for the parties agreed that the plaintiff would not claim damages and the defendants would not press the decision on Issue No. 1 relating to the competency of institution of the suit. It was also agreed that the documents filed by both the parties may be read in evidence without formal proof and no oral testimony was required for adjudication of the suit.\n",
        "p_109": "29. Parties were head at length and the matter in question is really one of legal issues to be examined in the context of the documents filed by the respective parties. The findings arrived at on the issues are set out hereinafter.\n",
        "p_110": "Whether the plaintiff is registered partnership firm and the suit is filed and instituted through a competent person and to what effect?\n",
        "p_111": "30. The issue relating to competency of the person to institute the suit has not been pressed by the defendants and it is, thus, not disputed that the suit has been properly instituted. It may be noticed that the details in respect of the partnership firm have also been set out with relevant supporting documents as also the authority of Mr. V. Ganesh, the constituted attorney of the plaintiff vide Power of Attorney dated 06.03.2004 to institute the suit. The issue is, thus, answered in favor of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_112": "Whether the plaintiff is the proprietor both under the statutory and common law of the alleged trademarks and copyrights LIA and artistic works / copyright bearing the same in relation to its alleged products being incense sticks / agarbathies?\n",
        "p_113": "Whether the defendant impugned trademark 'LOTUS DIA' and its artistic features and labels are identical with or deceptively similar to the trademark / copyrights of the plaintiff sued upon amounting to infringement and passing off and to what effect?\n",
        "p_114": "31. Issues No. 2 and 3 have to be dealt with together as they relate to the proprietorship right of the plaintiff as also the allegation of the defendants infringing the right. The plaintiff has claimed that the mark LIA is completely distinctive mark, which is arbitrary in nature and has no meaning. The name LIA is also stated to be extremely uncommon in the agarbathi market. The packaging is stated to have distinctive features and the general colour scheme and lay-out of the package is alleged to have an inalienable association with the plaintiff firm's LIA brand.\n",
        "p_115": "32. The composite effect of the shades used for each fragrance, the labeling, design lay-out as well as the unique price range is claimed to leave an indelible association with the plaintiff's firm's LIA brand. The plaintiff's claim is of ownership and of copyright in the LIA brand as also the ownership and the copyright in the entire get-up, the lay-out and trade dress. The application of the plaintiff before the Trademark Registry is stated to be pending and the plaintiff claims to have acquired goodwill in the mark based on sales figures. In this behalf, the annual turn over figures have been given, which is in the range of Rs. 413.17 Lakhs for the financial year of 2003-2004.\n",
        "p_116": "33. The plaintiff has emphasized the fact that the name DIA is similar to LIA and the word 'DIA' has been chosen with dishonest intention of trading on the goodwill of the plaintiff's LIA. In this behalf, the crucial question would be whether the trade-name under which the defendants are marketing is actually DIA or LOTUS DIA as claimed by the defendant?\n",
        "p_117": "34. Learned counsel for the plaintiff sought to emphasize that the defendants could better have kept the word DIVYA which is the name of the company and the motive behind the name DIA was that phonetically and visually, it was similar to the word LIA. Not much can be made out from the plea of the plaintiff that the defendants have been selling agarbathies under different brand-names since even the plaintiff has admittedly been selling agarbathies under different brand-names.\n",
        "p_118": "35. Learned counsel for the plaintiff contended that the defendants had copied almost all the essential features of the plaintiff's get-up including the colour scheme, logo, text, picture / motif and the use of vernacular scripts on the side of the carton. The details of this as alleged by the plaintiff have already been set out herein-above in the tabular form.\n",
        "p_119": "36. A further plea raised by the plaintiff is based on the allegation against the defendants of attempting to mislead the customers as to the source / origin of the goods. This arises from the allegation made in the plaint as well as in the report of the Local Commissioner, who visited Bangalore, to show that while the business of the defendants was being carried on at U.P. and NOIDA, the use of the scripts of Devnagri, Tamil, Kannada and Telugu was only to give an impression as if the product was of the plaintiff. The address given was also stated to be incorrect.\n",
        "p_120": "37. The allegation of the plaintiff is of identical get-up to confuse the customer in order to ride piggy back on the reputation of the plaintiff. In this behalf, a lot of emphasis has been laid on the fact that the product packaging is an extremely important factor in the consumers' purchase decision as it indicates to the customer not only the factual information about the product, but also an overall brand image. An allegation has also been made of the fact that the defendant has used 'TM' next to its name, which is normally used for reference to pending trademark registration, even though the defendants did not have a pending application for the name DIA at the time of filing of the suit. The significance of the addition of word 'LOTUS' is sought to be diluted in terms of the submissions made by learned counsel for the plaintiff on account of two factors - firstly, the defendants admittedly attempted to file an application for registration of the mark DIA in Class 3 and the application was not for LOTUS DIA and secondly, the primary ingredients of the defendants' mark is DIA and the word 'LOTUS' is an extremely insignificant part of the defendants' logo, get-up and packaging. Thus, merely by adding a prefix, the defendants cannot claim that the essential feature is different. In this behalf, it is also stated that the word 'LOTUS' being a name of the flower is naturally associated with fragrance and is, therefore, descriptive and laudatory in respect of agarbathies and cannot serve as a trademark in relation to agarbathies as its use in this respect is descriptive of character and quality of goods. Thus, the word LOTUS even when used on conjunction with the word DIA, it is the word DIA which remains the essential feature of the mark.\n",
        "p_121": "38. The written synopsis of the plaintiff contain an elaborate list of judgments, but ultimately learned counsel for the plaintiff confined the reference to only some of the judgments on each of the propositions of law, which was arising for adjudication.\n",
        "p_122": "39. The first aspect to be considered, as noticed above, is the impact of the use of the word 'LOTUS' as a prefix to the word 'DIA'. Learned counsel for the plaintiff contended that when two marks have an overall similarity (whether phonetic or visually) and are used in relation to the goods of the same description, then the mere addition of a prefix or suffix is not of much significance as the test is of unwary purchaser of average intelligence and imperfect recollection, who would not split the words into their component parts, but would be deceived by their overall similarity. In this behalf, learned counsel referred to judgment of the Supreme Court in Ruston & Hornsby Ltd. v. The Zamindara Engineering Co.  wherein it was held that in an action of this kind, the test as to the likelihood of confusion or deception arising from similarity of marks is the same both in infringement and passing off actions. Where the mark is identical, in an infringement action, the Court will not enquire whether the infringement is such as is likely to deceive or cause confusion. However, where the alleged infringement consists of using not the exact mark on the register, but something similar to it, the test of infringement is the same as an action for passing off. The Supreme Court was dealing with two words 'RUSTON' and 'RUSTAM'. It was held that the trademark is deceptively similar and the mere fact that the word 'INDIA' is added to the respondent's trademark of 'RUSTAM' is of no consequence and the appellant would be entitled to succeed in the action of infringement of the trademark.\n",
        "p_123": "40. Learned counsel for the plaintiff next referred to judgment of the Supreme Court in Parle Products (P) Ltd. v. J.P. & Co., Mysore, PTC (Suppl) (1) 346 (SC) to advance the proposition that if the overall visual impression from the colour scheme, arrangement of lettering, shape of container, packaging, get-up, trade dress leads to confusion in the minds of the consumer as to the source / origin of the goods and renders the two goods deceptively similar, especially in the case of unwary and gullible customers, it would amount to passing off as well as infringement of the copyright in the packaging and there would be sufficient justification for restraining the defendant. In such cases, proof of actual confusion was not required. It was observed by the Supreme Court as under:-\n",
        "p_124": " \"9. It is therefore clear that in order to come to the conclusion whether one mark is deceptively similar to another, the broad and essential features of the two are to be considered. They should not be placed side by side to find out if there are any differences in the design and if so, whether they are of such character as to prevent one design from being mistaken for the other. It would be enough if the impugned mark bears such an overall similarity to the registered mark as would be likely to mislead a person usually dealing with one to accept the other if offered to him. In this case we find that the packets are practically of the same size, the colour scheme of the two wrappers is almost the same; the design on both though not identical bears such a close resemblance that one can easily be mistaken for the other. The essential features of both are that there is a girl with one arm raised and carrying something in the background there is a farm house with a fence. The word 'Glucose Biscuits' is one and 'Gluco Biscuits' on the other occupy a prominent place at the top with a good deal of similarity between the two writings. Anyone in our opinion who has a look at one of the packets today may easily mistake the other if shown on another day as being the same article which he had seen before. If one was not careful enough to note the peculiar features of the wrapper on the plaintiffs' goods, he might easily mistake the defendants' wrapper for the plaintiffs' if shown to him some time after he had seen the plaintiffs. After all, an ordinary purchaser is not gifted with the powers of observation of a Sherlock Holmes. We have therefore no doubt that the defendants' wrapper is deceptively similar to the plaintiffs' which was registered. We do not think it necessary to refer to the decisions referred to at the bar as in our view each case will have to be judged on its own features and it would be of no use to note on how many points there was similarity and in how many others there was absence of it.\"\n",
        "p_125": "41. Learned counsel for the plaintiff also referred to judgment of Yves St Laurent Parfums and Anr. v. Louden Cosmetics Ltd., 39 IPR 11, which is a judgment of the High Court of New Zealand. Both the parties to the suit were manufacturers of different perfumes and the issue related to the infringement of trademark and passing off of the brand-names of different perfumes. It was observed as under:-\n",
        "p_126": " \"The plaintiffs allege that the defendant has used similar trade marks, get-up or packaging, smell or attributes individually or together or in any combination and have thereby caused the defendant's products to be passed off as and for products of or associated with or originating from or having the endorsement or approval of the plaintiffs. They also allege that the defendant has deceived or caused confusion of the public and by reason of all such conduct has caused and will continue to cause loss to the plaintiffs.\n",
        "p_127": " The law of passing off protects reputation and goodwill by proscribing the misappropriation of it by another's misrepresentation. The proscribed activity involves a misrepresentation made by a person in the course of trade to prospective consumers of the trader's goods or services, such misrepresentation being reasonably foreseeable as injurious to the business or goodwill of another trader and in fact damaging to the goodwill of the trader who sues. The nature of a relevant misrepresentation can vary. Often it takes the form of a representation that the goods being sold by the defendant are a plaintiff's goods. There may, however, be a representation that the goods being sold by the plaintiff are the defendant's goods, the calculated damage being the appropriation by the defendant of customs which would have gone to the plaintiff. An example is found in the case of Bristol Conservatories Ltd. v. Conservatories Custom Built Ltd. (1989) RPC 455. As the essence of the tort is damage to another's business or goodwill by a competitor's misrepresentation, the form of misrepresentation, the way in which it functions, may vary and yet be actionable. It is not necessary for a misrepresentation to be crass. It may be acute and involve a complex of mechanisms of misrepresentation. A representation may operate by invoking a recollection of a plaintiff's intellectual property, and in a number of ways, no single one of which may be compelling but the combination of which is effective. In the contemporary market, where products are advertised and promoted in ways which effectively use the qualities of electronic media, and plainly exploit modern knowledge of psychology and sociology, misrepresentations may relate to distinctive mental images and connotations in which a plaintiff has acquired a proprietary interest.\n",
        "p_128": " \"... the tort is no longer anchored, as in its early nineteenth century formulation, to the name or trade mark of a product or business. It is wide enough to encompass other descriptive material, such as slogans or visual images, which radio, television, or newspaper advertising campaigns can lead the market to associate with a plaintiff's product, provided always that such descriptive material has become part of the goodwill of the product.\n",

Pub Squash Co, supra, at All ER 221c; Slazenger & Sons v. Feltham & Co (1889) 6 RPC 531 at 538. In the present case, there was a deliberate policy of emulation of the names and get-up of designer fragrances and this policy has been practiced for many years. That the policy has generally been successful is an inevitable conclusion. Further, it is not by mere coincidence but a foreseeable consequence of the design policy that retailers should apprehend and exploit the correlation between Constance Carroll's perfumes and the fragrances of the great designer houses.\n",
        "p_131": " I turn now to consider the second cause of action specifically in relation to the respective goods of the plaintiffs and the defendant. I do not think it necessary to add much to the comparisons of names and appearances considered earlier in this judgment.\n",
        "p_132": "Paris / Paradise\n \n\n One need only look from one product to the other to be struck by the similarity which is the product of the nature of the goods (female perfumes), the names, and the combination of dusky pink, black and gold. In my opinion the defendant's product appropriates the goodwill of the plaintiffs by suggesting an association of manufacturing origin between the two; and/or by associating itself with the promotional image of Paris as the fragrance promoted by pink and feminity; and/or by suggesting through the emulation of distinctive colours that Paradise is a less expensive variation of Paris; and/or by implying that the perfume called Paris and the perfume called Paradise are the same but sold by the defendant under the name Paradise; and/or merely by creating the opportunity for confusion in order to exploit it.\n",
        "p_133": " Any or any combination of these mechanisms of appropriation is enough in all the circumstances to entitle the plaintiffs to injunctive relief and damages or compensation. The passing off is achieved by combining a name which has similarities in its initial letters to Paris, the emotional delight evoked by both the words 'Paris' and 'Paradise', the soulfulness of that city and associations with heaven, and the calculated use of the colours of the Paris get-up.\n",
        "p_134": "Kouros/Kosmos\n \n\n In view of the comparisons made earlier in this judgment, the evidence of the eyes, even the contrived election of the initial letter \"K\" for Cosmos, all that need be said is that the defendant's Kosmos is a blatant copy of the get-up of Kouros, with all the same types of appropriation of the goodwill of the plaintiffs as examined in connection with Paris and Paradise above. Kosmos is not impugned in the statement of claim but if it were it would succumb. The plaintiffs are entitled to the injunctive and pecuniary remedies.\n",
        "p_135": "Jazz/Java\n \n\n Here again the plagiarism is obvious and deliberate. There is no association between bold black and white in juxtaposition, including in respect of the letters, with the country people or culture of Java. Nor of course is the design of the Java package random coincidence. The juxtaposition of solid black and white panels, albeit triangular rather than rectangular, combined with the unusual placement by monochromatic contrast, emulates the colours, patterns, letters and general graphical characteristics of the get-up of Jazz and the images which are emphasised in the promotion of it. These has been a deliberate and successful attempt to emulate the distinctively created features and promotional image of Jazz, for the purpose of exploiting and replicated designs and impressions. The plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive and pecuniary remedies for the passing off.\n",

Optimism uses similar colours but its impression cannot reasonably be regarded as Asian or reminiscently Asian in its impression. The Collection 2000 variant, Optimist has leafy depictions reminiscent to a New Zealand eye of Polynesian palms, and the mixture of silver, navy and ochre is hardly evocative of the colours used in Opium. The plaintiffs cannot expect to stifle competition by seeking to preclude any other product which is vaguely but not confusingly similar. In respect of Opium the claim of passing off fails.\"\n",
        "p_137": "42. Learned counsel for the plaintiff contended that this rule apply even if the trade-names are different by reference to the judgment of learned Single Judge of this Court in Colgate Palmolive Company and Anr. v. Anchor Health and Beauty Care Pvt. Ltd., 2003 (27) PTC 478 (Del) wherein it was observed as under:-\n",
        "p_138": "\"52. It is the overall impression that customer gets as to the source and origin of the goods from visual impression of colour-combination, shape of the container, packaging, etc. If illiterate, unwary and gullible customer gets confused as to the source and origin of the goods which he has been using for longer period by way of getting the goods in a container having particular shape, colour combination and get-up, it amounts to passing off. In other words, if the first glance of the article without going into the minute details of the colour combination, get-up or layout appearing on the container and packaging gives the impression as to deceptive or near similarities in respect of these ingredients, it is a case of confusion and amounts to passing off one's own goods as those of the other with a view to encash upon the goodwill and reputation of the latter.\n",
        "p_139": "53. The plaintiffs have succeeded prima facie in showing from the look of trade dress of the two articles, one manufactured by the plaintiff and another by the defendant from the point of view of not only unwary, illiterate customer / servants of the household but semi-literate also as the trademarks. \"Colgate\" and \"Anchor\" are written in English language cannot be distinguished by ordinary customer of a country where bare literacy level is abysmally low. There is every likelihood of confusion as to the source on account of the similarity of substantial portion of the container having particular colour combination and also shape of the container which alone helps in determining the allegations of passing off despite stripes in the same colour or in different colour. The criteria is the overall impression from the look of packaging / container containing the goods and articles that can legitimately injunct its rival. Such an action on the part of infringing party also has an element of unfair competition.\n",
        "p_140": "54. May be, no party can have monopoly over a particular colour but if there is substantial reproduction of the colour combination in the similar order either on the container or packing which over a period has been imprinted upon the minds of customers it certainly is liable to cause not only confusion but also dilution of distinctiveness of colour combination. Colour combination, get-up, layout and size of container is sort of trade dress which involves overall image of the product's features. There is a wide protection against imitation or deceptive similarities of trade dress as trade dress is the soul for identification of the goods as to its source and origin and as such is liable to cause confusion in the minds of unwary customers particularly those who have been using the produce over the long period.\n",
        "p_141": "55. The difference in the style of the words appearing on the container or packing identifying its manufacturers by way of style, colour combination or textures or graphics is certainly significant or relevant for determining the overall imitation of the container but if a product having distinctive colour combination, style, shape and texture has been in the market for decades as in this case it is in the market since 1951 it leads to ineluctable inference of having acquired secondary meaning on account of its reputation and goodwill earned at huge cost.\n",
        "p_142": "56. It is not the diligent or literate or conscious customer who always remain conscious to the quality of goods he has been purchasing which determines an offence of passing off. It is the unwary, illiterate and gullible persons who determine by arriving at a conclusion whether the infringed goods are confusingly similar in colour combination, get-up, layout printed over the container or packing. If it is not so then the offence of passing off will cease to have its existence once the guilty party chooses a different trade name.\"\n",
        "p_143": "43. Learned counsel for the plaintiff further submitted that even if the defendants are not enjoined from using specific colours, they can be enjoined from using them in particular graphic display, which is confusingly similar to the logo format implied by the plaintiff. This plea really arises from the stand of the learned counsel for the defendants that the plaintiff cannot have copyright in specific colours, especially taking into consideration the nature of the product, e.g., incense with fragrance of sandalwood will be required to have a trade dress of sandalwood. In this behalf, learned counsel referred to judgment of the Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit of U.S. in Vision Sports Inc. v. Melville Corporation, 12 USPQ 2d 1740. In the said case, a judgment of the Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit in Cf. Chevron Chem. Co. v. Voluntary Purchasing Groups, Inc., 21 USPQ 904 was quoted with approval where it was observed as under:-\n",

        "p_145": "44. Another interesting observation made in the said judgment of Vision Sports Inc.'s case (supra) relates to the finding that a conscious imitation supports presumption that similarity will cause customer confusion. Likelihood of confusion in the trade dress context is evaluated by reference to the same factors used in the ordinary trademark context; strength of the trade dress, similarity between plaintiff's and defendant's trade dress, evidence of actual confusion, marketing channels used, type of goods and likely degree of purchaser care, and the defendant's intent in selecting its trade dress, The likelihood of confusion determination in trade dress cases must be made in the light of 'the total effect of the defendant's product and package on the eye of the ordinary purchaser'.\n",
        "p_146": "45. Learned counsel also advanced the proposition that while second comer will not be barred from making and selling the same product as the first comer, the second comer is under an obligation to name and dress his product in such a manner as to avoid all likely confusion. In this behalf, learned counsel referred to judgment of the Court of Appeals, Second Circuit in Harold F. Ritchie, Inc. v. Chesebrough-Pond's, Inc., 126 USPQ 310 where it was specifically observed that as under:-\n",
        "p_147": " \"Second comer has duty to so name and dress his product as to avoid all likelihood of consumers confusing it with product of first comer; although second comer may endeavor to capture first comer's market, he must do this by giving his product a name and dress descriptive and fanciful in its own right and selling it on its own merit, not by confusing public into mistakenly purchasing his product for competitor's; second comer must create reputation of his own and not trade on goodwill of another product already established at considerable cost and risk; important in determining whether second comer's entrance into market creates possible confusion is any evidence of conscious imitation of first comer's product.\n",
        "p_148": " In determining whether there is confusing similarity, court should consider names of products in conjunction with similarity of presentation of products with respect to their design and general appearance, containers, tubes, price, size, smell and other nonfunctional aspects; admittedly there is nothing to prevent second comer from selling identical product of the first comer, providing second comer so names and dresses its product as to avoid all likely confusion; test has not been met where not only was there conscious imitation, but also actual confusion resulted from similarity of name and dress.\"\n",

        "p_150": "47. Learned counsel for the defendants, on the other hand, has referred to the fact that the mark of the plaintiff is still unregistered. It is, thus, contended that the action can only be one of passing off. In this behalf, learned counsel has referred to judgment of the Apex Court in American Home Products Corporation v. Mac Laboratories Pvt. Ltd. and Anr.,  where in 36, it was observed that the proprietor of an unregistered trademark whose mark is unauthorisedly used by another cannot sue for infringement of such trademark and his remedy only lies in bringing up of passing off action even though the same is an inconvenient remedy as compared to infringement action. This is so since in a passing off action, the plaintiff will have to prove that his mark has by user acquired such reputation as to become distinctive of the plaintiff's goods so that if it is used in relation to any goods of the kind dealt with by the plaintiff, it will be understood by the trade and public as meaning that the goods are the plaintiff's goods.\n",
        "p_151": "48. It was, thus, contended by learned counsel for the defendants that once the parameters of a passing off action are considered, the defendants in any case are entitled to escape liability if they can show that the added matter is sufficient to distinguish their goods from those of the plaintiff. In this behalf, learned counsel has referred to judgment of the Apex Court in Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma v. Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories,  where it was observed in para 28 as under:-\n",
        "p_152": " \"28. The other ground of objection that the findings are inconsistent really proceeds on an error in appreciating the basic differences between the causes of action and right to relief in suits for passing off and for infringement of a registered trade mark and in equating the essentials of a passing off action with those in respect of an action complaining of an infringement of a registered trade mark. We have already pointed out that the suit by the respondent complained both of an invasion of a statutory right under Section 21 in respect of a registered trade mark and also of a passing off by the use of the same mark. The finding in favor of the appellant to which the learned Counsel drew our attention was based upon dissimilarity of the packing in which the goods of the two parties were vended, the difference in the physical appearance of the two packets by reason of the variation in their colour and other features and their general getup together with the circumstances that the name and address of the manufactory of the appellant was prominently displayed on his packets and these features were also set out for negativing the respondent's claim that the appellant had passed off his goods as those of the respondent. These matters which are of the essence of the cause of action for relief on the ground of passing off play but a limited role in an action for infringement of a registered trade mark by the registered proprietor who has a statutory right to that mark and who has a statutory remedy in the event of the use by another of that mark or a colourable imitation thereof. While an action for passing off is a Common Law remedy being in substance an action for deceit, that is, a passing off by a person of his own goods as those of another, that is not the gist of an action for infringement. The action for infringement is a statutory remedy conferred on the registered proprietor of a registered trade mark for the vindication of the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods\" (Vide Section 21 of the Act). The use by the defendant of the trade mark of the plaintiff is to essential in an action for passing off, but is the sine qua non in the case of an action for infringement. No doubt, where the evidence in respect passing off consists merely of the colourable use of a registered trade mark, the essential features of both the actions might coincide in the sense that what would be a colourable imitation of a trade mark in a passing off action would also be such in an action for infringement of the same trade mark. But there the correspondence between the two cases. In an action for infringement, the plaintiff must, no doubt, make out that the use of the defendant's mark is likely to deceive, but where the similarity between the plaintiff's and the defendant's mark is so close either visually, phonetically or otherwise and the Court reaches the conclusion that there is an imitation, no further evidence is required to establish that the plaintiff's rights are violated. Expressed in another way, if the essential features of the trade mark of the plaintiff have been adopted by the defendant, the fact that the get-up packing and other writing or marks on the goods or on the packets in which he offers his goods for sales show marked differences, or indicate clearly a trade origin different from that of the registered proprietor of the mark would be immaterial; whereas in the case of passing off, the defendant may escape liability if he can show that the added matter is sufficient to distinguish his goods from those of the plaintiff.\"\n",
        "p_153": "49. The Division Bench of this Court in Johnson & Johnson and Anr. v. Christine Hoden India (P) Ltd. and Anr., 1988 PTC 39 observed that the main question is not the intention of defendant in using certain words, but the probable effect of such action on minds of the customer. Thus, colour scheme, lettering style, etc. become of significance.\n",
        "p_154": "50. Learned counsel for the defendants also strongly relied on the fact that the mark of the defendants is a composite mark LOTUS DIA and not merely DIA and, thus, the passing off action should be totally ruled out. In this behalf, learned counsel relied upon the judgment of learned Single Judge of this Court in Bharat Hotels Limited v. Unison Hotels Limited 2004 (28) PTC 404 (Del). The matter in issue related to the use of the word 'GRAND' in respect of the hotel industry.\n",

        "p_158": "54. Learned counsel for the defendants submitted that for establishing confusion and deception, overall impact has to be seen in entirety and not parts have to be picked up in isolation. Learned counsel referred to the judgment of Division Bench of this Court in Kellogg Company v. Pravin Kumar Bhadabhai, 1996 PTC (16) 187. The contention of similar get-up or trade dress was held not to be tenable. The dispute related to the plaintiff's sale of cornflake with cartons having the description inscribed as KELLOGG'S CORNFLAKE. The respondent was selling cornflake using a carton more or less similar in size, but with the title AMIS ARISTO CORN FLAKES written just at the place where the appellant's display the words KELLOG'S CORNFLAKE. The important aspect was in relation to the principles to be kept in mind in respect of confusion and deception. The Division Bench came to the conclusion that the principal of fading memory or imperfect recollection should not be pressed too far and the goods in question sold to people belonging to middle class or upper middle class, who are fairly educated, has to be tested accordingly. It was held that there was no chance of deception. The Division Bench in para 10 while dealing with the aspect of trade dress observed as under:-\n",
        "p_159": "\"10. The law relating to 'trade dress' is very clear. Kerly in 'Law of Trade Marks' (12th Ed., 1986, para 16.67) says that it is usually true in some degree that a trader's goods are recognised by their general appearance, or 'get-up'. Accordingly, resemblance or 'get-up' is not uncommonly an ingredient in passing off and it is possible for imitation of get-up alone to amount to passing off. Such cases are rare, since few traders rely on get-up alone to distinguish their goods, so that trade names and word trade marks are ordinary present too;\" and the author says:\n",
        "p_160": " \"and in these days, in this country, a difference in names is enough to warn the public that they are getting one trader's goods and not the others\" (Sapers v. Specters (1953)70 RPC 173).\"\n",
        "p_161": "55. In paras 15 to 23 of the judgment, the Division Bench referred to the judgment of the House of Lords in Schweppes Ltd. v. Gibbens, (1905) 22 R.P.C. 601 as under:-\n",
        "p_162": "\"15. In Schewappers Ltd. v. Gibbens (1905) 22 RPC, the appellant was selling Soda Water in bottles, with a neck label around then, the body of the label bring of chocolate colour with a white border and a red medallion in the centre of the label. The respondents, subsequently, sold soda water in bottles with a somewhat similar neck lable round them in some colour and with a central red medallion. However, appellants' labels showed 'Scheweppe's soda water' printed on them in white characters while respondents' contained the name 'Gibbens Soda Water'. Action by plaintiffs failed. It was held by the House of Lords that a fraudulent intent cannot be presumed in spite of the similarities in the bottles, labels colour and medallion because the distinguishing feature of name adopted by defendants showed that they had no intention to deceive purchasers. Lord Halsbury LC said:\n",
        "p_163": " \"I should have thought if you looked at the two bottles together no human being could have mistaken one for the other. If 'Royal' and 'Flag' were sufficiently distinctive in the case to which the learned counsel called our attention (Payton & Co. v. Snelling Lampard & Co. (17 RPC 628), I should have thought 'Gibbens' and 'Schwappes' are equally impossible to be confounded with each other.\"\n",
        "p_164": "16. Lord Halsbury said it was 'ridiculous' to apply the principle of similarity in trade-dress in such a situation. He said:\n",
        "p_165": " \"I can quite understand a case in which, although colourably a defendant has introduced his own name, yet the nautre of the wrapping up, the nature of the package itself, or, in this case, the share of the bottle, may all have been so closely imitated that the mere introduction of some distinctive mark to which no ordinary observer would have applied his mind, will not get rid of the obvious intention to pass one goods off as the other; but to apply the proposition to this case appears to me to be a little short of ridiculous.\n",
        "p_166": "17. It was held that the name of 'Gibbens' was so plainly placed upon the bottle as it could possibly be and it was in the place where 'Schweppes' was on the bottle of the appellant, and there was no intention to deceive.\n",
        "p_167": "18. The above case also answers the contention of fraudulent intent argued by the appellant's counsel before us. Similar views as to absence of fraudulent intent were expressed in Schwappes Pty Ltd. v. The Pub-squash Co. Ltd. also, to which we have already referred and which came from New South Wales before the Privy Council (1981) RP 429 (PC).\n",
        "p_168": "19. In the present case, in spite of any other close resembleness in the cartons, the name 'AIMS' written prominently on the respondents carton would, in our view, prima facie, as in case before Lord Halsbury show that there was no intention on the part of the defendant to play fraud by misrepresenting his goods as the goods of the applicant. In that very case, Lord Halsbury emphasised the need to see the whole description on the goods as one whole and not the individual features in isolation. He said:\n",
        "p_169": "\"Inasmuch as you and certainly not to impute fraud without proof, you are not to suggest that people are fraudulently committing some commercial trick without sufficient evidence, and I cannot conceive here how anybody could gravely argue that the one thing could be mistaken for the other by anybody who looked as it.\n",
        "p_170": "The whole question is these cases is whether the thing - taken in its entirety, looking at the whole thing, is such that in the ordinary course of things a person with reasonable apprehension and with proper eyesight would be deceived.\"\n",
        "p_171": "20. Thus the above case also lays down that the trade dress or rather the whole thing must be seen in its entirety and not parts in isolation. It is not permissible, therefore, to say that the square on the left side top had a small red nd green border or there was a red band horizontally and defendant's carton if examined from close quarters, showed these features. Viewed as a whole, one can see that the words Kelloggs' and AIMS are prominently displayed on each and therefore there can be no confusion, prima facie.\n",
        "p_172": "21. That brings us finally to the question of the failing memory of the customer. The argument is that customers have short memory and that if the trade dress is similar, the customers are likely to get confused.\n",
        "p_173": "22. It has now been held that there are limitations to the theory of imperfect memory. Halsbury's Laws of England (4th Ed.) (Vol. 8, para 139) says that this principle of imperfect recollection must not be pressed too far. It says:-\n",
        "p_174": " \"The Tribunal must bear in mind that the marks will not normally be seen side by side and guard against the danger that a person seeing the new mark may think that it is the same as one he has seen before, or even that it is a new or associated mark of the proprietor of the formal mark. However, the doctrine of imperfect recollection must not be pressed too far Chappie Ltd. v. Spratt's Patent Ltd. (1954) 71 RPC 455 at 457). Marks are often remembered by general impressions of by same essential feature (De cordova Vick Chemical Co. (1951) 68 RPC 106 (PC) at 289 (on appeal 71 RPC 348, CA).\n",
        "p_175": "23. In fact in Scheweppes Ltd. case above referred to, Lord Halsbury said \"and if a person is so careless that he does not look, and does not, ... treats the label fairly but takes the bottle without sufficient consideration and without reading what is written very plainly indeed up - the face of the label on which the trade has placed his own name, then you certainly cannot say he is deceived - in fact, he does not care which it is. That would be the true interference which I think a person would draw from conduct so described.\"\n",
        "p_176": "56. The defendants also emphasised the fact that the plaintiff was not the owner of the copyright or the labels and cartons under The Copyright Act, 1957 in view of the provisions of Sections 14, 17 and 18 thereof.\n",
        "p_177": "57. The judgment of the Division Bench in Kellogg Company's csae (supra) generated further arguments as to whether it correctly reflected the position of law on this aspect, as referred to by learned counsel for the defendants. This controversy has arisen on account of the fact that the principles laid down in Kellogg Company's case (supra) were based on the dictum of Lord Halsbury in Schweppes Ld.'s case (supra) where in para 23 a reference was made to a customer who was so careless that he does not look and treats the label fairly, but takes the bottle without sufficient consideration and without reading what is written very plainly. Such a customer was held not a person who would form the basis of a test for passing off. Learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that this dictum was a departure from the settled law of the Apex Court in relation to passing off matters that the case of passing off has to be decided on the comparison of broad similarities and the test is always from the point of view of an unwary purchaser. Learned counsel contends that this judgment was impliedly overruled in view of the subsequent judgments of the Supreme Court.\n",
        "p_178": "58. In S.M. Dyechem Ltd. v. Cadbury (India) Ltd. AIR 2000 SC 2114, the dictum of Lord Halsbury was relied upon and it was laid down that in case of an infringement of passing off, the broad dissimilarities need to be compared. The comparing marks were of the plaintiff PICNIK and defendant PICNIC. Injunction was declined. It was observed in para 54 as under:-\n",
        "p_179": " \"53. As to scope of a buyer being deceived, in a passing off action, the following principles have to be borne in mind. Lord Romer, LJ has said in Payton & Co. v. Snelling Lampard & Co., (1990) 17 RPC 48 that it is a misconception to refer to the confusion that can be created upon an ignorant customer. The kind of customer that the Courts ought to think of in these cases is the customer who knows the distinguishing characteristics of the plaintiff's goods, those characteristics which distinguish his goods from other goods in the market so far as relates to general characteristics. If he does not know that, he is not a customer whose views can properly be regarded by the Court. (See the cases quoted in N.S. Thread & Co. v. Chadwick & Bros., AIR 1948 Madras 481, which was a passing off action). In Schweppes's case, Lord Halsbury said,if a person is so careless that he does not look and does not treat the label fairly but takes the bottle without sufficient consideration and without reading what is written very plainly indeed up the face of the label, you cannot say he is deceived.\"\n",
        "p_180": "59. The aforesaid judgment of the Supreme Court in M/s. S.M. Dyechem Ltd.'s case (supra) was reviewed by the Apex Court in Cadila Health Care Ltd. v. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd., . In the said judgment, it was observed as under:-\n",
        "p_181": "\"17. Our attention was drawn to a recent judgment of this Court in S.M. Dyechem Ltd. v. Cadbury (India) Ltd.  where in a passing off action, the plaintiff, which was carrying on the business under the mark of 'Piknik', filed a suit for injunction against the defendant which was using the mark of 'Picnic\" for some other chocolates sold by it. On the allegation that the defendant's mark was deceptively similar, the trial Court had issued an injunction which was reversed by the High Court. On appeal, the decision of the High Court was affirmed. On appeal, the decision of the High Court was affirmed. One of the questions, which this Court considered, was that for grant of temporary injunction, should the Court go by the principle of prima facie case, apart from balance of convenience, or comparative strength of the case of either parties or by finding out if the plaintiff has raised a 'triable issue'. While considering various decisions on the point in issue, this Court rightly concluded at page 591 (of SCC): at p. 2181 of AIR SCW; 2121 of AIR and 1348 of CLC (para 21) as follows:\n",
        "p_182": " \"Broadly, under our law as seen above, it can be said that stress is laid down on common features rather than on differences in essential features, except for a passing reference to a limited extent in one case.\"\n",
        "p_183": "Notwithstanding the aforesaid observations this Court in Dyechem's case (200 AIR SCW 2172: AIR 2000 SC 2144: 2000 CLC 1338) (para 35) (supra) proceeded to observe as follows:-\n",
        "p_184": " \"It appears to us that this Court did not have occasion to decide, as far as we are able to see, an issue where there were also differences in essential features nor to consider the extent to which the differences are to be given importance over similarities. Such a question has arisen in the present case and that is why we have referred to the principles of English Law relating to differences in essential features which principles, in our opinion, are equally applicable in our country.\"\n",
        "p_185": "18. We are unable to agree with the aforesaid observation in Dyechem's case (supra). As far as this Court is concerned, the decisions in the last four decades have clearly laid down that what has to be seen in the case of passing off action is the similarity between the competing marks and to determine whether there is likelihood of deception or causing confusion. This is evident from the decisions of this Court in the cases of National Sewing Thread Co. Ltd.'s case , Com Products Refining Company's case , Amritdhara Pharmacy's case . Durga Dutt Sharma's case , Hoffmann-La Roche and Co. Ltd's case . Having come to the conclusion, in our opinion incorrectly, that the difference in essential features is relevant, this Court in Dyechem's case (supra) sought to examine the difference in the two marks 'Piknik' and 'Picnic'. It applied three tests, they being 1) is there any special aspect of the common feature which has been copied? 2) mode in which the parts are put together differently i.e. whether dissimilarity of the part or parts is enough to make the whole thing dissimilar and 3) whether when there are common elements, should one not pay more regard to the parts which are not common, while at the same time not disregarding the common parts? In examining the marks, keeping the aforesaid three tests in mind, it came to the conclusion, seeing the manner in which the two words were written and the peculiarity of the script and concluded that \"the above three dissimilarities have to be given more importance than the phonetic similarity or the similarity in the use of the word PICNIC for PIKNIK.\n",
        "p_186": "19. With respect, we are unable to agree that the principle of phonetic similarly has to be jettisoned when the manner in which the competing words are written is different and the conclusion so arrived at is clearly contrary to the binding precedent of this Court in Amritdhara's case  where the phonetic similarity was applied by judging the two competing marks. Similarly, in Durga Dutt Sharma's case , it was observed that \"in an action for infringement, the plaintiff must no doubt, make out that the use of the defendant's mark is likely to deceive, but where the similarity between the plaintiff's and the defendant's mark is so close either visually, phonetically or otherwise and the Court reaches the conclusion that there is a imitation, no further evidence is required to establish that the plaintiffs rights are violated.\"\n",
        "p_187": "20. Lastly, in Dyechem's case (2000 AIR SCW 2172: AIR 2000 SC 2114: 2000 CLC 1338) (supra) it was observed in Para 54 (of SCC): (Para 53 of AIR SCW, AIR CLC) as under:-\n",
        "p_188": " \"As to scope of a buyer being deceived, in a passing off action, the following principles have to be borne in mind. Lord Romer, L.J. has said in Payton and Co. v. Shelling, Lampard and Co. (1990) 17 RPC 48 that it is a misconception to refer to the confusion that can be created upon an ignorant customer that the Courts ought to think of in these cases is the customer who knows the distinguishing characteristics of the plaintiff's goods, those characteristics of the plaintiff's goods, those characteristics which distinguish his goods from other goods in the market so far as relates to general characteristics. If he does not know that, he is not a customer whose views can properly be regarded by the Court. (See the cases quoted in N.S. Thread and Co. v. Chadwick and Bros. AIR 1948 Madras 481 which was a passing off action.) In Schweppes Case (1905) 22 RPC 601 (HL) Lord Halsbury said, if a person is so careless that he does not look and does not treat the label fairly but takes the bottle without sufficient consideration and without reading what is written very plainly indeed up the face of the label, you cannot say he is deceived.\"\n",
        "p_189": "These observations appear to us to be contrary to the decision of this Court in Amritdhara's case (AIR 1963 449) (supra) where it was observed that the products will be purchased by both villagers and townfolk, literate as well as illiterate and the question has to be approached from the point of view of a man of average intelligence and imperfect recollection. A trade may relate to goods largely sold to illiterate or badly educated persons. The purchaser in India cannot be equated with a purchaser of goods in England. While we agree that in trade mark matters, it is necessary to go into the question of comparable strength, the decision on merits in Dyechem's case, 2000 AIR SCW 2172: AIR 2000 SC 2114: 2000 CLC 1338) (supra) does not, in our opinion, lay down correct law and we hold accordingly.\"\n",
        "p_190": "60. It was, thus, submitted by the learned counsel that the judgment based on the principle laid down by Lord Halsbury in Schweppes Ld.'s case (supra) would not hold good law in view of the fact that those very principles in Schweppes Ld.'s case (supra) are held not to be applicable in view of reconsideration of the issue in Cadila Health Care Ltd.'s case (supra).\n",
        "p_191": "61. The aforesaid submission is, of course, without prejudice to the stand of the plaintiff's counsel that, in the present case, there is absolute copying of the mark and get-up.\n",
        "p_192": "62. One other aspect, which has to be considered vis-a-vis Kellogg Company's case (supra) as also the issue of the class of purchaser, it was observed as under:-\n",
        "p_193": "\"24. Having dealt with the contention of imperfect memory of the customer, we shall now deal with the class of purchasers, which is also an important factor. Who are the persons who go to purchase 'Kelloggs' Corn flakes? Prima facie, in our opinion, these people belong to a middle-class or upper middle class and above who are fairly educated in English and are able to distinguish 'Kelloggs' and what is not 'Kelloggs'. In American Jurisprudence (2d) (Trade Marks) (Supp) para 19 (page 178) it is said that it is necessary to note the fact:\n",
        "p_194": " \"that customers for fasteners are sophisticated and discerning, that defendant acted with good faith.\"\n",
        "p_195": "25. The case was one where customers were purchasers of fasteners in the automobile industry. (Standard Pressed Steel Co. v. Midwest Chrome Process Co. LDC III (US PU 106\".) Again Kerly, Law of Trademarks (12th ed. 1980) (para 1706) says that:\n",
        "p_196": " \"If the goods are expensive and not of a kind usually selected without deliberation, and the customers generally educated persons, these are all matters to be considered (Pianolist (1906) 23 RPC 774: Claudins Ash v. Invica (1911) 28 RPC 597; 29 RPC 465 (CA) (HL) (dentists), Rysta (1943) 60 RPC 87).\n",
        "p_197": "26. In Pianolist's case (1906) (23) RPC 774 an application was made for the registration as a trade mark of the word 'Neela' for 'piano player, being a musical instrument included in class 9'. Coming to know of this application, the registered proprietors of the trade mark \"Pianole\" who were registered for all goods in class 9, opposed the above application for registration. The Registrar overruled the objection and ordered registration. On appeal, Justice Parker said that having regard to the kind of customers for such goods and the distinction in the names, there was not likely to be any confusion and dismissed the appeal.\n",
        "p_198": "27. If that was so between 'Neole' and 'Pianole', the case of Kellogg's and AIMS, in our prima facie view, presents no difficulty for distinct identification. Parker J. in fact observed in the above case:\n",
        "p_199": " \"Of course, one knows that the persons who buy these articles are generally persons of some education, ... my opinion is, having regard to the nature of the customer, the article in question and the price at which it is likely to be sold, and all the surrounding circumstances, no man of ordinary intelligence is likely to be deceived....\"\n",
        "p_200": "28. We are, on the facts of the case before us, prima facie of the same opinion in regard to Kelloggs and AIMs.\"\n",
        "p_201": "63. I have given a deep thought to these rival contentions.\n",
        "p_202": "64. It would be appropriate to first consider the parameters on which the alleged deception has to be. In this behalf, the judgment in Kellogg Company's case (supra) is extremely relevant. There has been reference made to Schweppes Ld.'s case (supra) to come to the conclusion that if a person is so careless that he does not look and does not treat the label fairly, then he is not the person who would form the basis of the test. There is force in the contention of learned counsel for the plaintiff that the dictum in Kellogg Company's case (supra) to the extent it relied upon Schweppes Ld.'s case (supra) would not hold good in view of the subsequent development of law in M/s. S.M. Dyechem Ltd.'s case (supra) and the review thereof in Cadila Health Care Ltd.'s case (supra), the Apex Court while relying upon the observations in Schweppes Ld.'s case (supra) observed that if the customer does not distinguish the characteristics of the two packings, then he is not a customer whose view can properly be regarded by the Court. However in Cadila Health Care Ltd.'s case (supra), this very aspect was specifically considered. The Apex Court took note of the earlier judgments in this behalf and came to the conclusion that the decisions of the Apex Court in the last four decades preceding clearly laid down that what had to be seen in the case of a passing off action between the competing marks and the likelihood of deception or confusion. The Apex Court found that the principle of phonetic similarity cannot be jettisoned and in determining the test vis-a-vis the person who has to be kept in mind as a customer, the views expressed in Schweppes Ld.'s case (supra) were found to be contrary to the decision of the Apex Court in Amritdhara Pharmacy v. Satya Gupta, .\n",
        "p_203": "65. In Amritdhara Pharmacy's case (supra), the product was examined from the prospect of it being purchased by villagers and townfolk, literate as well as illiterate and, thus, the question has to be approached from the point of view of a man of average intelligence and imperfect recollection. A trade may be related to goods largely sold to illiterate or badly educated persons and the purchaser in India cannot be equated with a purchaser of goods in England.\n",
        "p_204": "66. The aspect, which is important, is the nature of the product. To this extent, apparently the views expressed in Kellogg Company's case (supra) were also based on this nature of product. As noticed above, the class of purchaser purchasing Kellog's Cornflakes were stated to be people belonging to the middle class or the upper middle class who are fairly educated in English. Such category of customers were categorised as sophisticated and discerning. The question remains whether the product in question in the present case being the agarbathies can be categorised as such. In my considered view, the answer would be an emphatic No. The very nature of product is such that it is bought not only by a sophisticate and discerning customer, but people from all walks of life. The use of such fragrance sticks is largely for the purposes of pooja, but it is also used for other purposes of fragrance in the rooms, etc. The average customer is not one who will make a detailed scrutiny colour by colour, mark by mark to find out whether the product is of the plaintiff or the defendants. The profile of the customer will vary from the rich to the poor. It has also to be kept in mind that, in fact, the more discerning and rich customer may not even go to buy such a product himself, but would possibly dispatch the house-help to obtain the same. Thus, the factors which weighed in Kellogg Company's case (supra) would hardly apply to the present case.\n",
        "p_205": "67. It is in view of the aforesaid position that the two products have to be compared. There is some substance in the plea of learned counsel for the defendants that the plaintiff cannot have a monopoly on colours. This is so as in case of an agarbathi with sandal incense, naturally the colour of sandal or the pieces of sandal being shown on the container found form an essential ingredient. Similar position would be with rainbow. Of course, the stand of the plaintiff is that LAVENDER of the defendants is similar to RAINBOW of the plaintiff, while the defendants contend that LAVENDER itself would have a purple tinge of the colour. The NATURE'S GIFT of the plaintiff has a shade of green with a whitish mogra on it. The MOGRA of the defendants is also green with larger number of mogras on it. In this behalf, the contention of the plaintiff is that if mogra is whitish, there was no reason to necessarily adopt the green colour. Similarly, in respect of ROSE, which is of different colours, there was no reason why the defendants should have taken the same pink colour as of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_206": "68. The parameters laid down for such comparison have been set out in judgment of the Apex Court in Parle Products (P) Ltd.'s case (supra) for deciding whether one mark is deceptively similar to another, the broad and essential features of the two have to be considered. They are not to be placed side by side to find out differences in the designs and it would suffice if the mark bears an overall similarity to the mark. As pithily observed, an ordinary purchaser is not gifted with the powers of observation of Sherlock Holmes. However, this principle would not apply to mere colours. Colours are after all only certain hues.\n",
        "p_207": "69. The aspect of copyright in colours have been examined in a recent judgment of learned Single Judge of this Court in IA Nos. 3412/2002 & 4489/2003 IN CS (OS) No. 672/2003 titled 'Colgate Palmolive Co. Limited and Anr. v. Mr. Patel and Anr.' decided on 06.10.2005. The colours in question were red and white colours of COLGATE. It was held that essential features of the plaintiffs' mark were the word 'COLGATE' and red and white colour scheme taken together. In the said case, a reference was made to judgment of the Apex Court in Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma's case (supra) to emphasize that in case of passing off action, the defendant may escape liability if he can show that the added matter is sufficient to distinguish his case from those of the plaintiff. This would be different from the parameters and action for infringement of trademark. An interesting plea raised in Colgate Palmolive Co. Ltd.'s case (supra) was that the judgment in Ruston & Hornsby Ltd.'s case (supra) was per incuriam since the Court did not note its earlier judgment in Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma's case (supra). This plea was negated. Learned Single Judge referred to some judgments of the U.S. Courts in this behalf. It would be useful to refer to the observations made in Colgate Palmolive Co. Ltd.'s case (supra) in some detail. It was observed in the relevant paragraphs as under:-\n",
        "p_208": "\"33. While the law laid down in other common law jurisdictions such as the U.K. and U.S.A. is not binding on this Court but it can nevertheless furnish a useful guide for this Court. At this stage it is profitable to set out the following position of law laid down in Campbell Soup Co. v. Armor & Co. (81 USPQ 430):-\n",
        "p_209": "At para 6 page 432, it was observed that\n  \n\n\"... It is worth the space involved to call attention to just what it is the plaintiff's claim. Their suit here is based solely upon their claimed exclusive right to the use of red and white in packaging their food products. While their registration describes the red over white as a rectangular design, when the colours appear on their packages they appear in the form of an endless band which runs around the entire container. The Campbell red is not the same as the Carnation red. Indeed, the Camation red is not the same on all of its products, according to the sample labels offered in the plaintiff's exhibits. The red used by Armour is a specially blended color. The usual Armour Label is white over red instead of red over white, as the plaintiffs use the colour, but in some cases Armour uses red and white bands vertically.\n",
        "p_210": "What the plaintiffs are really asking for, then, is a right to the exclusive use of labels which are half red and half white for food products. If they may thus monopolize red in all of its shades the next manufacturer may monopolize orange in all its shades and the next yellow in the same way. Obviously, the list of colors will soon run out....\"\n",
        "p_211": "At para [8], it was observed:-\n",
        "p_212": "\"That a man cannot acquire a trade mark by color alone has been stated a good many times in decisions and textbooks ....\"\n",
        "p_213": "\"... When we say that plaintiffs cannot have exclusive right to a trade mark of a red and white label, we are by no means denying their right to acquire a trade mark when the color is combined with other things in a distinctive design. As a matter of fact, the distinctiveness of plaintiff's packages does not depend upon colour alone, although each has been granted registration of a trade mark described in terms of color. Each has its name in one of the color bands in a uniform and specified type of script. Each has a very distinctive design on its label. Carnation has a small bouquet of carnation flowers. Campbell has a medallion of individual design, Armour, too, does not depend upon color alone. It uses different colors with different products and each has the Armour name in an individual type of script accompanied by the star which it says has been the mark of its goods over many years.\n",
        "p_214": "\"In denying the plaintiffs the exclusive use of color alone we are not passing upon the question whether they have acquired trade marks entitled to protection in the sum total of the combinations which make up their respective labels for their goods.\"\n",
        "p_215": "34. In order to counter the position of law laid down in Campbell Soup's case (supra) the plaintiff had relied on the judgment in the case of Master Distributors v. Pako Cororation, 25 USPQ2d 1794, wherein the following position of law was laid down:-\n",
        "p_216": " \"We are not persuaded by the three traditional arguments against protection the color depletion theory, shade confusion, and the functionality doctrine. Nor are we impressed by the argument that \"consistency and predictability\" require a per se prohibition against trademark protection for color alone. We believe that not allowing manufacturers to protect color marks when all the traditional requirements have been met will actually promote inconsistency and confusion.\n",
        "p_217": " Proponents of the color depletion theory assert that there are only a few possible colors a manufacturer can choose for a product, and allowing one manufacturer to monopolize one color \"in all of its shades\" will inhibit competition. Campbell Soup Co. v. Armour & Co.., 175 F.2d 795, 798 [81 USPQ 430] (3rd Cir.), Cert. Denied, 338 U.S. 847 [83 USPQ 543] (1949). We agree that allowing a manufacturer to monopolize red \"in all of its shades\" would deplete the color choices available to other market participants. Allowing a manufacturer who has met all the normal requirements for obtaining trademark protection to protect a specific shade of color, however, is another matter....\"\n",
        "p_218": "35. In my view, this judgment agrees with the Campbell Soup's case (supra) and in fact relates to shades of colours and not a particular colour. Even if this decision is held to take a view contrary to that in Campbell's soup's case (supra), I would prefer the reasoning laid down in Campbell's soup's case as it is more logical and appeals to this Court as it inhibits a chromatic monopoly.\n",

It is matter of common knowledge that covers of books are presented in overall colors and it is clear beyond per adventure that the color green of applicant's goods is not capable of distinguishing applicant's book as to origin from other books having green covers. Further, color is not subject to trademark exclusiveness except in connection with some definite arbitrary symbol or design. See: Life Savers Corporation v. the Curtiss Candy Company, 85 USPQ 440 (CA 7, 1950); Lucien Lelong, Inc. v. Lenel, Inc. et all., 85 USPQ 117 (CA 5, 1950); National Candle Company, Inc. v.

        "p_224": "40. It is also worthwhile to quote Mccarthy on Trademarks where at para 7.44 it was observed as follows:-\n",
        "p_225": "\"Prior to the Supreme Court's 2000 Wal-Mart decision, some had read the Court's Qualitex opinion as not settling the issue of whether a single product color can ever be so unusual as to be \"inherently distinctive\" and hence protectable without proof of secondary meaning. However, in the author's opinion, the Court, albeit not in so many words, said that for this type of trademark or trade dress, a single color per se can never be classified as inherently distinctive and will always require proof of secondary meaning for protection and registration.\n",
        "p_226": "This dispute came to an end when the U.S. Supreme Court in its Wal-Mart decision cleared up once and for all any lingering doubts about the rule in the Qualitex case. In Wal-Mart, the Supreme Court looked back to its previous decision and stated that in Qualitex, it had held that no single color can ever be inherently distinctive. Single color always requires proof of secondary meaning.\"\n",
        "p_227": " Thus, even in the U.S., the position of law is that colours per se cannot be claimed as trade marks. It has been consistently held that colour must combine with other things to acquire a distinctive design which may afford protection to the defendant.\n",

However, most people do agree that some color combinations imply heat and some cold, and that some cannote pleasure and other pain.

Red can be among other things, either a welcome or a warning, conveying either warmth or danger.

Unchallenged, it assigns \"reserved\" to blue, \"active\" to red, and so on. Regardless of the absolute accuracy of these designations, that moods can be evoked and manipulated by our historical and cultural associations with color is certain. Some combinations immediately evoke the 1950s, the military, the Federal period, and a feeling of the baroque. Generally, color can produce an appropriate setting, tone or mood for the subject at hand. This sort of color use is nowhere more powerful than in the theater, opera and ballet. On stage, color is seldom static; and constantly layered and shifting combinations of color and are carefully modulated and controlled can benefit an entire production.

White and red are associated with life activities; black usually indicates death, misfortune or evil, or simply opposition to white's yielding and acceptance and purity.

Furthermore, even though the colour combination of the registered mark indicates red and white, in essence the carton of the plaintiffs for which registration has been granted is entirely in red except the logo in the form of the word 'COLGATE' and other small ancillary words such as the price, quality etc. which are printed in white. It is this placement of small print in white containing the word 'COLGATE' in a small area placed on the back ground in red which contributes to the commercial impact of the plaintiff's carton in the market place and indeed gives exclusivity and distinctiveness to the plaintiff's mark. Thus, the mark COLGATE in white on a red background highlights the plaintiff's product and gives a distinct identity to the combination, and such a combine is certainly entitled to protection from not only passing off, but infringement too. However, I am also of the view that the red and white colour combination per se without the word/mark 'COLGATE' is not entitled to protection from infringement.\n",
        "p_240": "43. Thus, in so far as the plea of infringement of the registered mark of the plaintiffs by the defendant's mark is concerned, I am unable to come to a finding that in view of the aforesaid discussion, the plaintiff's mark can be said to have been infringed by the defendant's mark.\n",
        "p_241": "70. Learned Single Judge also considered the issue of passing off action and referred to judgment of the Apex Court in Cadila Health Care Ltd.'s case (supra) and some other judgments of this Court in paras 40 to 46 as under:-\n",

        "p_253": " \"13. The plaintiff's claim passing of by the defendants of their product as and for the product of the plaintiff's on the basis of copy of the distinctive get-up and colour scheme of the collapsible tubes and the cartons by them. The defendants are not entitled to represent their goods as being the goods of the plaintiffs. The two marks 'Vicco' and 'Cosmo' used by the plaintiffs and defendants respectively are no doubt different and the mark 'Cosmo' by itself is not likely to deceive but the entire get-up and the colour scheme of the tube and carton adopted by the plaintiffs and the defendants are identical in every detail and are likely to confuse and deceive the customer easily. The get-up and the colour scheme of the plaintiffs adopted in every detail by the defendants for their tube and carton cannot be said to have been adopted by the defendants unintentionally. Further the defendants allege that they started selling their product in the carton and tube in question from No. 1977 while the plaintiffs have been selling their product in the said carton and the tube since April, 1975. the suit was originally filed in Feb., 1978 at Bombay and ex-parte injunction was granted on 29th August, 1978. The plaintiffs are prior users of their product in the carton and the tube.\"\n",
        "p_254": "46. It was also held by this Court as under in Colgate Palmolive Co. v. Anchor Health and Beauty Care [2003(27) PTC 478 (Del)]:\n",
        "p_255": " \"54. May be, no party can have monopoly over a particular colour, but if there is substantial reproduction of the colour combination in the similar order either on the container or packing which over a period has been imprinted upon the minds of customers it certainly is liable to cause not only confusion but also dilution of distinctiveness of colour combination. Colour combination, get up, lay out and size of the container is sort of trade dress which involves overall image of the product's features. There is a wide protection against imitation or deceptive similarities of trade dress as trade dress is the soul for identification of the goods as to its source and origin and as such is liable to cause confusion in the mind of the unwary customers particularly, those who have been using the product over a long period.\"\n",
        "p_256": "71. The judgments of the U.S. Courts referred to above including Yves St Laurent Parfums's case (supra), Vision Sports Inc.'s case (supra), Cf. Chevron Chem. Co.'s case (supra), Harold F. Ritchie, Inc.'s case (supra) and Perfect Fit Industries, Inc.'s case (supra) also succinctly deal with the aspect of trademark, get-up and packaging. It is the whole combination which has to be seen to come to the conclusion whether the same would liable to cause confusion to the average customer. Thus, though there may not be any right in any single colour, there can be use of combination of colours coupled with the mark and the manner of arrangement on the box / container, which would be of significance. Thus, in Harold F. Ritchie, Inc.'s case (supra), it was held that the second comer has a duty to so name and dress his product as to avoid all likelihood of confusion amongst the consumers. The important test is whether there is any evidence of conscious imitation of the first comer's product. The plaintiff is certainly the first comer, though there is some dispute about the date/year from which the sales have proceeded. This Court, thus, has to consider the names of the products in conjunction with similarity of presentation of products with respect to the design and general appearance, container, tubes, price, etc. Thus, what is not important is the exclusive use of a particular colour, but the use of colour in a particular graphic display in a logo format, which may cause confusion.\n",
        "p_257": "72. It is in the aforesaid context that a mere prefix or suffix would certainly not suffice, but the mark has to be seen as a whole. The judgments of the Apex Court in Ruston & Hornsby Ltd.'s case (supra) and Parle Products (P) Ltd.'s case (supra) may be usefully referred to for this purpose.\n",
        "p_258": "73. There is no doubt that the word LOTUS is used as a prefix by the defendants. However, what is of significance is the manner of placement of LOTUS. The font is smaller and less significant. The significance is on the word 'DIA'. The font used for writing DIA is similar to the one used in writing LIA. It is similarly underlined in the same style of a curve-line underneath. As stated above, though the word 'LIA' has two dots below the line, it is not that each feature has to be seen with the magnifying glass. It is the overall impact which has to be considered.\n",
        "p_259": "74. Interestingly, defendants have admittedly applied subsequently for registration of the mark DIA and not LOTUS DIA. The essential ingredient feature of the mark is DIA and not LOTUS DIA. It is not just a case of phonetic similarity, a prefix being added, a similar colour scheme, similar packaging with certain endorsement, but all these aspects taken collectively to see the import of the trade dress used by the plaintiff and the defendants. If each individual feature is taken into consideration, maybe there would be some minor differences. However, that is not material.\n",
        "p_260": "75. A perusal of the boxes show that the colour scheme has a pattern, though the colours in its hues may vary slightly. They have a pastel base with softening to whitish towards the centre of the box and again going up to a darker colour. The NATURE'S GIFT LIA has a mogra flower. The defendants have adopted mogra flower to sell the MOGRA incense sticks. Mogra is of a whitish colour and if the object is to give an indication of the nature of incense, it was certainly not necessarily to use only green colour. Similarly, for the rose, it is the pink colour. It is not only an aspect of imitation of one particular colour scheme or fragrance, it is the series of such six packages which has been adopted. In such a case, the object of the defendants itself appears to be to mislead the customer into believing that the product is of the plaintiff or at least has some connection with the product of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_261": "76. The defendants are primarily based in the North, yet they have chosen to inscribe on the side of the box with vernacular scripts of Devnagri, Tamil, Kannada and Telugu in the same pattern. At the cost of repetition, it may be emphasized that this factor alone is not relevant, but is coupled with the other factors discussed above. Even the address indicated of the defendants was not found to be correct, but was given of the person who was doing work for the defendants on job-work basis. The address of the plaintiff was at Mysore while that of the defendants was given at Bangalore.\n",
        "p_262": "77. The overall visual impression from the colour scheme, the arrangement of the mark, the style of writing of the mark, the general get-up and trade dress leads to the conclusion that there is a clear attempt on the part of the defendants to pass off their goods as that of the plaintiff and, thus, the test laid in Parle Products (P) Ltd.'s case (supra) is clearly satisfied. The ingredients of a passing off action have been very succinctly set out in Yves St Laurent Parfums's case (supra), which sets out that a misrepresentation need not to be crass, but may involve a complex mechanism of misrepresentation. Thus, the representation may operate in a number of ways, no single one of which may be compelling but a combination of which is effective. This is the position in the present case. One only needs to look at two products side by side to see the striking similarity in various combination of factors. It is the overall impression that a customer gets to the source and origin of the goods from visual impression of colour combination, packaging and the get-up, which is of relevance and if an unwary and gullible customer gets confused, it amounts to a passing off as set out in Colgate Palmolive Co. Ltd.'s case (supra). No doubt, there is no monopoly in colour combinations, but what is relevant in the present case is that there is substantial reproduction of the colour combination in a similar pattern in each packet and there are similar six series of packets. The defendants being the second comers owed a duty to name and dress their product in such a manner as to avoid all likelihood of consumers confusing it with the product of the first comer [Harold F. Ritchie, Inc.'s case (supra)].\n",
        "p_263": "78. A result of the comparison of six containers shows that there is similarity in colour pattern, phonetic similarity in the trade-name, the use of colours in a particular pattern - whiteness towards the centre and again darker colour at the base and the top, writing on Devnagri and other scripts in a similar fashion, which leaves little doubt about the motive of the defendants. The packaging is identical and so is the pricing. If all these factors are taken into account, I have no doubt that the clear object of the defendants was to deceive the unsuspecting customers, who come from various stratas of society and are not a discerning customers.\n",
        "p_264": "79. The plaintiff has given detailed figures of its sales under this particular brand-name and colour scheme. The artistic work of the plaintiff was registered. The turnover for the range of products for the financial year of 2002-2003 is Rs. 243.67 Lakhs and for the financial year of 2003-2004 is Rs. 413.7 Lakhs. This is duly supported by the Chartered Accounts' certificate. As against this, the defendants claim sales for the financial year of 2003-2004 of Rs. 5.75 Lakhs and for the first five months of the financial year of 2004-2005 of Rs. 10.15 Lakhs.\n",
        "p_265": "80. For all aforesaid reasons, Issues No. 2 and 3 are answered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants.\n",
        "p_266": "81. The aforesaid findings, thus, show that the defendants' packaging is identical or deceptively similar to that of the plaintiff and the defendants are attempting to pass off their product as that of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_267": "ISSUE No. 4:\n",
        "p_268": "Whether the plaintiff is guilty of suppressing material facts and making false statements and to what effect?\n",
        "p_269": "82. Issue No. 4 relates to the claim of the defendants that the plaintiff is guilty of suppression of material facts in respect of the date from which its sales started. No sales figure of 2001 onwards have been given and before the Registering Authority, the application shows sales from 2002. Thus, the claim of user since 2001 has been falsely made. I am of the considered view that nothing much turns on this since the plaintiff is the prior user and figures have been given from 2003-2004 onwards. The plaintiff may have begun the process in 2001 and applied for registration in 2004. Thus, the issue is answered in favor of the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_270": "Whether the defendants have honestly adopted and used his subject matter trademark since 2003 in relation to incense sticks (agarbathies) and to what effect?\n",
        "p_271": "Whether the defendants, in the alternative, are entitled to benefit of honest and concurrent users and to what effect?\n",
        "p_272": "83. Issues No. 5 and 6 are linked since they arise from the claim of defendants having honestly adopted and used his subject matter trademark since 2003 or at least be entitled to benefit of honest concurrent user. The findings arrived at in respect of Issues No. 2 and 3 show that the defendants have, in fact, deliberately attempted to pass off their goods as that of the plaintiff and if all the features are taken together, it is a clear case of deception. Thus, the defense of honest concurrent use can hardly be said to be available to the defendants. Thus, Issues No. 5 and 6 are answered against the defendants.\n",
        "p_273": "Whether the suit is barred by delay, acquiescence, laches, estoppel and waiver?\n",
        "p_274": "84. Issue No. 7 relates to the bar on account of delay, acquiescence, laches, estoppel and waiver. The defendants have really not even advanced any submissions on this aspect. The written synopsis of defendants, in fact, does not even refer to this aspect and even on the facts, such a case can hardly be made out. Thus, the issue is answered against the defendants.\n",
        "p_275": "Relief.\n",
        "p_276": "85. The question now arises as to what is the relief to which the plaintiff would be entitled to in view of the fact that the relief of damages has already been given up. It has to be kept in mind that the defendants are not to be precluded from using a particular colour or a mark, but the total get-up and trade dress of the plaintiff and the defendants being similar, the defendants cannot be permitted to manufacture and sell agarbathies / incense sticks in the packaging as is being done at present.\n",
        "p_277": "86. The plaintiff is, thus, entitled to a decree of permanent injunction against the defendants or anyone acting under the defendants or its retailers, stockists, agents, etc. from in any manner manufacturing or selling agarbathies / incense sticks in the offending packaging under the trade-name DIA and the colour scheme of the packaging or in any manner in packaging, which are substantial reproduction of the packaging of the plaintiff. The decree would, thus, operate in respect of the offending packaging in question or any deceptively similar packaging to that of the plaintiff sold under the trade-name LIA and the manner of the representation of colour schemes in the range of the products.\n",
        "p_278": "87. The plaintiff shall also be entitled to costs.\n",

He has not been able to explain that he gained\n\nknowledge about the presence of the defendant in the market\n\nonly in October, 2009. Why he slept over the matter and idled\n\nover it for such a long period? PRIUS is not the monopoly of the\n\nplaintiff in India. It is not an invented word; the meaning of the\n\nword can be deciphered from the word itself; meaning \"prior to\".\n\nIt finds mention in the english dictionary, how can it then be\n\ntermed as invented or coined? Association of this word and the\n\nsame having acquired a secondary meaning with the plaintiff\n\ncompany has not been established.

Plaintiff has also no business in India. He is\n\nnot recognized in India. His product has not come on the Indian\n\nroad.    Production of his vehicle, due to technical reasons has\n\nnow been suspended. None of the ingredients for continuing of\n\nthe interim injunction in favour of the plaintiff arise.                If\n\ninjunction is allowed to continue, the loss to be suffered by the\n\ndefendant would become irreparable as his business would come\n\nto stand still. In these circumstances, balance of convenience is\n\nalso in favour of the defendant.

R.C. Chopra, J. has very succinctly set out in Time Incorporated's\n      case (supra) that punitive damages are founded on the philosophy of\n      corrective justice. That was the case where the publishers of Time\n      Magazine had come to Court and one of the factors which weighed while\n      awarding punitive damages was that the readers had been sufferers of the\n      infringement of the mark of the plaintiff. The only difference is that in the\n      present case it is the consumer of the products of the plaintiff, who have\n      suffered as a consequence of the infringement of the mark and logo of the\n      plaintiff by the defendant.\n",

The case of Respondent \n\n\nNo.1   is   that   he   is   the   exclusive   owner   of   that   property   whereas   the \n\n\nAppellants very much dispute the same.

In   view   of   these   pleadings   when   this   matter   was   heard \n\n\nbefore the learned Single Judge, he formed an opinion that it was not \n\n\npossible   to   hold   at   that   stage   whether   the   documents   of   powers   of \n\n\n                                              1\n\n\n\nattorney   were   merely   powers   simpliciter   given   by   the   owner   of   the \n\n\nproperty,   or  whether   they  contained  agency  coupled   with  interest  as \n\n\ncontended   by   the   Appellants   herein.

Besides   this,   the   joint   account   in \n\n\nIndian Bank was opened way back in the year 1993 and the amount \n\n\nrealized from the sale of the flats was being deposited therein.

The   Respondent,   on   the   other   hand, \n\n\nsubmitted that this was a fit case to grant the interim mandatory order \n\n\nas  was  granted by  the Division Bench.

The   counsel   for   the \n\n\nRespondents   pointed   out   that   the   mandatory   injunctions   were \n\n\nessential   to   avoid   greater   risk   of   injustice   being   caused   as   held   in \n\n\nFilms Rover International Ltd. v.

The Respondent had prayed for a judgment \n\n\non admission and alternatively an injunction directing the Appellant to \n\n\nimmediately   hand   over   vacant   and   peaceful   possession   of   the   suit \n\n\nproperty.     The   learned   Single   Judge   of   the   Calcutta   High   Court   who \n\n\nheard the interlocutory application, came to the conclusion that he did \n\n\nnot find any reason to pass such an order in view of the fact that the \n\n\nsuit was still pending and granting of such relief would tantamount to a \n\n\ndecree   before   trial.   The   Appellate   Bench,   however,   re-examined   the \n\n\nfacts and observed that the litigation to be a luxury litigation directed \n\n\nthe   Receiver   to   put   the   Respondent/Plaintiff   in   possession.

In   that   matter, \n\n\nAppellant   No.1   being   the   registered   proprietor   of   a   Trade   Mark   had \n\n\nentered   into   an   agreement   with   the   Respondent   permitting   it   to \n\n\nmanufacture   certain   pharmaceutical   product.     On   the   basis   of   that \n\n\narrangement, the respondent applied for the requisite license from the \n\n\nauthorities   concerned.     In   view   the  dispute   between   the   parties,   the \n\n\nAppellant   called   upon   the   Respondent   to   stop   manufacturing   the \n\n\nparticular   product,   and   entered   into   an   arrangement   with   another \n\n\ncompany.

It is\n\nnecessary in the present case due to the fact as the defendants\n\nthemselves have claimed in the Trade Mark Registry on 17.5.2005\n\n(the specific date of user is given). It is also pertinent to mention\n\nhere that when the application of defendant was examined under\n\nRule 37 of the Trade Marks Rules, 2002, at that time, the plaintiff\u201fs\n\ntrade mark PREMIER was already               in existence/pending        for\n\nregistration.   At that time the defendants themselves gave up its\n\nexclusive rights to the use of the mark PREMIUM and accepted the\n\ncondition of the Registrar and disclaimed its registration.\n\n",
        "p_89": "40.         If the defendants got the prior user as claimed in the year\n\n1995 in the present case, then, why the defendants did not claim the\n\nsame user in the Trade Mark Registry in their application No.1594703\n\nin Class 16. It was the most appropriate stage to put their claim of\n\nuser. Even in the second application bearing No.1955501 filed by the\n\n\nCS (OS) No.1672/2011                                          Page 31 of 34\n defendants, the user claimed was 01.10.1999. Therefore, prima facie,\n\nit is clear that the defendants were/are taking inconsistent stand about\n\nthe user at different stages. It has rather created doubt in the mind of\n\nCourt, if at this stage any application for change of user has been filed\n\nin Trade Mark Registry. As discussed, there is no clear, cogent and\n\nundisputed evidence produced by the defendants to show the prior user\n\nclaimed by them. On the other hand, the plaintiff\u201fs documents, like\n\nadvertisements and news report, are available on record from the year\n\n1998 for user claimed by the plaintiff.\n",
        "p_90": "41.          As far as the two affidavits filed by the defendants are\n\nconcerned, both the companies are not in existence any more. The\n\naffidavits   are filed by Ex. Managing Director of Ajit Mayor and\n\nCompany Pvt. Ltd. and Ex. Assistant Manager of M/s. Home Store\n\nIndia Ltd.    These affidavits have been filed by the defendants       in\n\nsupport of claim of longer and prior user and the same cannot be given\n\ndue credence as these affidavits would have to be tested at the time of\n\ntrial. The identity, authority and authenticity of the deponents cannot\n\nbe given due credence at this stage unless they are supported with\n\nsolid evidence.\n",

        "p_92": " 42.        The defendants have challenged the validity of documents\n\nfiled by plaintiff by stating that these cannot be looked into. But, this\n\nCourt is of the view that apart from the documents challenged, there\n\nare large number of other documents available on record which are\n\ncogent and clear evidence of prior user i.e. from the year 1998.\n\n",
        "p_93": "43.         In view of the above, it appears from the record that two\n\nset of packaging are almost similar.       Both marks, PREMIER and\n\nPREMIUM are deceptively similar. The defendants could not have\n\ndesigned their packaging without placing the packaging of the plaintiff.\n\nPrima facie, it is clear that it is a case of violation of vested rights of\n\nthe plaintiff and pirator thereof cannot become rightful owner in any\n\nmanner. Thus, the plaintiff has made out a strong case of injunction.\n\n",
        "p_94": "44.        Under these circumstances, I am of the considered view that\n\nthe plaintiff has been able to make a strong prima facie case for\n\ninfringement of trade mark, copyright and passing off. The balance of\n\nconvenience also lies in favour of the plaintiff and against the\n\ndefendants. Incase the defendants/counter claimant is not stopped from\n\nusing the mark and trade dress in the similar packaging, the plaintiff\n\nwill suffer irreparable loss and injury, which cannot be compensated in\n\n\nCS (OS) No.1672/2011                                       Page 33 of 34\n terms of money.        Therefore, plaintiff\u201fs application, being I.A.\n\nNo.10846/2011 under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2 read with Section\n\n151 CPC, is allowed. The defendants, their dealers, retailers, servants,\n\nagents or any one acting for and on their behalf, are restrained from\n\nusing the trade mark PREMIUM and/or any other trade mark, which is\n\ndeceptively and confusingly similar to the plaintiff\u201fs registered trade\n\nmark PREMIER as well as similar packaging/trade dress amounting to\n\ninfringement of copyright and passing off their goods as that of the\n\nplaintiff in respect of tissues of all kinds, or any other allied and\n\ncognate goods. It is clarified that the finding arrived by this Court\n\nabout the defendants\u201f user is tentative and prima facie view which shall\n\nhave no bearing when the matter would be considered after the trial on\n\nmerit.\n",

        "p_2": " (1) This is an appeal against the order of the learned Single Judge dated October 31, 1994 whereby the application of the respondents (who are plaintiffs in Suit No.1705/94) under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 Civil Procedure Code seeking an ad interim injunction restraining the appellants(defendants in the above said suit) from passing off their goods as that of the respondents was allowed and the appellants were restrained from manufacturing, selling, advertising or in any way using the trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL' in any other trade mark deceptively or confusingly similar to the trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL' in respect of their goods. The appeal arises in the following circumstances:-  \n",
        "p_3": "(2) The first respondent, which is the first plaintiff in the suit, is an American Corporation, organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware, USA. The second respondent, a Company registered in India, is a joint venture company established by the first respondent and a company called Sundram Clayton. A suit was filed by the respondents on 4th August, 1994 against the appellants for permanent injunction, passing off and damages.   \n",
        "p_4": "(3) According to the plaint the first respondent is engaged in the manufacture, sale, distribution and servicing of washing machines under the trade mark WHIRLPOOL. It has, directly or through vs subsidiaries, more than 2000 trade mark registrations all over the world. In India its trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL' was registered on February 22, 1956 in respect of clothes dryers, washers, dishwashers, vacuum. cleaners, air- conditioners, dehumidifers, freezers etc. in Classes 7,9 and 11. The registralions were renewed up to the year 1977 hut despite instructions of the first respondent for renewal of registration in Class 7 and 9, the registrations lapsed due to lack of proper communication with its counsel. Notwithstanding the lapsed registration, the trade mark of the first respondent was used in this country through sale of its washing machines to the U.S. Embassy and U.S. Aid offices in New Delhi and also through advertisements in various publications having a circulation in India. Besides the products of the first respondent were reaching the Indian consumers in a second hand State or through indirect channels. Plaint also refers to the recent liberal economic policy as a result whereof, in the year 1987, it established a .joint venture known as Tvs Whirlpool Ltd.' The respondents thereafter filed 9 applications for registration of trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL' in Classes 7,9 and 11 in respect of their goods including washing machines which arc pending in the Trade Mark Registry  \n\n(4) The plaint also alludes to the fact that the trademark 'WHIRLPOOL' belonging to the first respondent has, acquired global reputation. According to the issue of- July 25, 1994 of 'FORTUNE Global 500' rated the first respondent as the 207th largest Corporation' in the world in terms of sales and the 30th largest Global Corporation dealing in electronic and electrical equipments. It also points out that its name is also included in the 1992 edition of the book 'World Class Business' - a Guide to the 100 Most Powerful Global Corporations,\" by Phillip Mattero. It also claims that as a result of extensive advertising and promotional efforts, its products including washing machines, have acquired immense reputation and the trade, mark ' WHIRLPOOL' is being associated with the goods of the first respondent.   \n",
        "p_5": "(5) On August 6, 1986 a Trust known as 'Chinar. Trust' through its trustees, first and second appellants, applied to the' Registrar of.Trade Marks for registration of trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL' in respect of washing machines. In the application it was claimed that the trademark was being used by it since July 1986. The respondents on coming to know about the application of Chinar Trust from the Mark Journal 945 dated October 16, 1988, filed their opposition on January 16, 1989 under section 21(1) of the Trade & Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 (for short 'the Act'). On September 21, 1989 the 'Chinar Trust' filed their counter slatem.enl. Thereafter on December 5, 1990 the respondents in support of their opposition filed an affidavit of one Lawrence John Kremer dated December 5, 1990. On the other hand, the 'Chinar Trust' filed the affidavit of one Mr. Pradeep Singhal 'dated October 3, 1-991. The respondents in reply filed another affidavit of Lawrence Johit. Kremer dated December 19, 1991. On August 12, 1992 the Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks.al Delhi, howevcr,'dismisse'd the opposition of the respondents and accepted the application of 'M/s.Chinar Trust' inter, alia on the ground that knowledge and reputation of the trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL' in respect of the goods of the first respondent was restricted to special feed class of people in India and the same was not sufficient to determine the likelihood of confusion by the use of trade mark by the applicant. The respondents not being satisfied with the order of the Assistant Registrar, Trade Marks, filed an appeal to this Court under section 109(2) of the Act which came to he admitted on February 1, 1993 and is still pending for disposal. On November 30, 1992 trade name 'WHIRLPOOL' was registered by Trade Marks Registry in favor of the 'Chinar Trust', in accordance with the above said order of the Assistant Registrar. On August 4, 1993 the respondents filed a petition under sections 46 and 56 of the Act for cancellation and removal of trade mark registration issued in favor of the 'Chinar Trust'. Thereafter the respondents came across an advertisement in Hindi Daily Dainik Jagran, Lucknow Edition of July 2, 1994 inserted by Sadhna Electric Company, Chander Nagar Market, Lucknow as principal dealer, of 'WHIRLPOOL' washing. machines, requiring dealers for the said machines. The same advertisement appeared in Hindustan Times (Delhi edition) of July 9, 1994 as well. The advertisement interalia mentioned that 'WHIRLPOOL' was the\" registered trade, mark of the 'Chinar Trust', New Delhi. The second respondent thereafter purchased a. washing machine marketed by the appellants. This machine was examined by an employee of the respondents and found that the product was inferior to the product manufactured by the first respondent. The respondents approached 'Chinar Trust' for settlement of the dispute hut the latter demanded a large sum of money for giving up its claim to the trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL'. The respondents then Filed :i Miil, being Suit'No.17()5/94, from which this appeal arises. In the suit, the learned Single judge by a detailed order granted ad interim injunction restraining the appellants from manufacturing, selling,, advertising or in any way using the word 'WHIRLPOOL' or any other trade mark deceptively or confusingly similar to the trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL' in respect of the goods of the appellants hut at the same time gave liberty to the appellants to move an application under Order 39 Rule 4 Civil Procedure Code for vacation of the order on the basis of any new material consisting of facts, documents and evidence which they were not able to produce before him. However, the appellants without following the course suggested by the learned Single Judge, have filed the present appeal.   \n",
        "p_6": "(6) We have heard learned counsel for the parties at length. Before us the learned counsel for the appellants has urged as follows:-   \n",
        "p_7": "(7) The First respondent abandoned the trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL' by allowing its registration to expire in the year 1977. The respondents did not have any commercial use of the trade mark in India. On the contrary, the appellants had started using the trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL' from 1986,and had also filed an application in the same year for registration of the same in its favor when thcre.was not even an application for registration of the said trade mark by the respondents. 'Chinar Trust' is the only registered proprietor of trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL' in respect of the washing machines etc. The appellants have therefore the exclusive right to use the trade mark in this country. The grant of registration of trade mark on November 30, 1992 with effect from August 6, 1986 gives the appellants exclusive right to use the trade mark under, section 28 of the Act. The effect of injuncting the. appellants from using the trade mark violates section 28(1) of the Act. The order of the learned Single Judge has led to anamolous results. While the appellants who are the proprietors of the trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL' can stop others from using the trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL' they cannot use the same themselves. According to section 28(3) of the Act, two registered proprietors.of the same trade mark cannot restrain one another from using the trade mark.., Therefore even if the first respondent was the registered proprietor of the said trade mark it could not have maintained an action for restraining the appellants from using the trade mark. The lack of registration of the trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL' in favor of the first respondent could not have conferred a higher right than it would have with a registration in its favor. The washing machines manufactured by appellant under trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL' is not being associated with the goods of the respondent but are being identified as the goods of the appellants. The respondents have not sold adequate number of machines in India under the trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL' so as to have acquired any reputation or goodwill in respect of the said trade mark. The respondents were also not entitled to any relief by way of an ad interim injunction in view of delay, acquiescence and laches on their part.  \n",
        "p_8": "(8) On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the ' trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL' is being used by the first respondent from the year 1941. The first respondent has acquired world wide reputation and goodwill in respect of the trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL'. Washing machines sold under the trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL' are being associated by the general public as the goods of the first respondent. The appellants want to reap the benefit of the reputation and goodwill acquired by the first respondent by using the trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL' on their product. The adoption of the mark by the appellants is not honest and bonafide. The learned Single Judge having passed the ad interim order after properly considering the rival claims of both the parlies, the discretion exercised by him cannot be challenged by asking the appellate Court to reassess the material and reach a conclusion defendant from the one reached by him. The discretion has been exercised by the learned Single Judge reasonably and in a judicial manner. As regards the question of delay, acquiscence and laches, the learned Single Judge correctly came to the conclusion that there was no substance in the submission of the learned counsel for the appellants.   \n",
        "p_9": "(9) We will first deal with the main questions which arise for our prima facie determination. They are:-     \n",
        "p_10": " 1)Whether the reputation of trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL' inspect of washing machines of the respondent has travel trans border in India?   \n",
        "p_11": " 2)Whether the respondents, who are not the registered proprietors of trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL' in respect of washing machines, can maintain an action for passing off against the appellants in respect of the use of the same which has been registered in their favor in respect of the same goods?   \n",
        "p_12": "(10) With regard to these questions, the learned Single Judge held that the first respondent was the prior user of trade mark in the market, the question of geographical reasons apart.  \n",
        "p_13": "(11) On material before him, the learned single Judge also came to the conclusion that the first respondent positively made out a case of actual sales by it of 'WHIRLPOOL' products including washing machines in a number of geographical regions around the world. But in so far as India is concerned, it does not make out a case of actual sales in the markets in India, though it has made limited sales to the U.S. Embassy and U.S. Aid office, New Delhi. The learned Single Judge however, found (hat the first respondent had advertised its products under the trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL' including washing machines in the following International Magazines having circulation in India:-    Magazine Issue National Geographic August 1980, February 1983, May 1985, April 1986 and July 1986 Life June 28, 1968. July 18, 1969, . August 1983, September 1983 & May 1985 Fortune June 1957 Redbook July 1986. Ladies Home Journal January 1985, March 1986, April 1986 & July 1986 Woman's Day July 7,1987 House Beautiful August 1985. Better Home & Garden July 1984, April 1986, June 986 and July 1986 Good House keeping October 1983 & April 1985 Family Circle October 21,1986 Bon Appetite November 1983   \n\n(12) The learned Single Judge was further of the opinion that the respondent has acquired trans border reputation in respect of its products including the washing machines hearing the trade name 'WHIRLPOOL' and that reputation has also reached this country.  \n",
        "p_14": "(13) The learned counsel for the appellants assailed the findings of the learned Single Judge in the ground that the first respondent has not made out any case of actual sale of i's product bearing trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL' in India and without actual commercial use of the same it cannot be said to have acquired reputation and good will In this view of the matter, it is urged that the goods of the appellants under the trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL' will not cause any confusion or deception as the trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL' is not associated in the minds of the public with the goods of the first respondent.  \n",
        "p_15": "(14) We have considered the submissions of the learned counsel for the appellants, but we have not been able to persuade ourselves to accept the same.   \n",
        "p_16": "(15) The knowledge and awareness of a trade mark in respect of the goods of a trader is not necessarily restricted only to the people of the country where such goods arc freely available but the knowledge & awareness of the same reaches even the shores of those countries where the goods have not been marketed. When a product is launched and hits the market in one country, the cognizance of the same is also taken by the people in other countries almost at the same time by getting acquainted with it through advertisements in newspapers, magazines, television. video films. cinema etc. even though there may not be availability of the product in those countries because of import restrictions or other factors. In today's world it cannot he said that a product and the trade mark under which it is sold abroad, does not have a reputation or goodwill in countries where it is not available. The knowledge and awareness of it and its critical evaluation & appraisal travels beyond the confines of the geographical area in which it is sold. This has been made possible by development of communication systems which transmit & disseminate the information as soon as it is sent or beamed from one place to another. Satellite Television is a major contributor of the information explosion. Dissemination of knowledge of a trade mark in respect of a product through advertisement in media amounts to use. of the trade mark whether or nol the advertisement is coupled with the actual existence of the product in the market.   \n",
        "p_17": "(16) In M/s J.N.Nichols(Vimto) Limited vs.Rose and Thistle & another 1994 Ptc 83 (para 20), a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court observed that the use of a trade mark docs not necessarily imply actual sale of the goods bearing such a mark. Use can be in any form. Mere advertisement without having even the physical existence of the goods in the market can be said to he a use of the mark. In Consolidated Foods Corporation vs. Brandon & Co. Private Ltd.  it was found . that the petitioner was the proprietor of the trade mark 'Monarch' in respect of its food products in several countries of the world and its products were advertised in American Magazines which had large circulation in several 'countries including this country. Though the goods of the petitioner had not been imported continuously, the petitioner's right to use the trade mark 'Monarch' in this country in preference to the adoption of the mark by the respondent's was recognised on the strength of the advertisement. Accordingly, the order of the Joint Registrar of Trade Marks granting registration of the mark in favor of the latter was set aside by the Bombay High Court, and while doing so it held as under:-    \".......NOT.only that the petitioner corporation's products are widely advertised in American Magazines of common interest, which have a fairly large circulation in this country, hut even these products have been imported into this country though not quite continuously. There can, therefore, be no doubt that the petitioner corporation has a right to the use of the mark 'Monarch' in preference to the respondent company which sought to introduce that mark for the first lime in 1951.\"   \n",
        "p_18": "(17) At another place it was observed, is follows:-    \"........INthis case, however, as I have found that the petitioner corporation was already the sole proprietor of the mark 'Monarch' in respect of its food products in several countries of the world and its products were widely advertised in various American Magazines having a large circulation in different parts of the world including this country and in view of the fact that the petitioner corporation could have without importing any of its food products into this country hearing that mark applied for registration of that mark as proprietor thereof, prior to 1951 before the respondent company started using that mark, it is difficult to hold that the respondent company had started using that mark quite innocently and without any knowledge on its part about the same being widely used by the petitioner corporation on its food products. On the facts of this case and also in the interest of business morality, it is impossible to exercise my discretion under sub-section (3) of Section 12 of the Act and order concurrent registration of the mark 'Monarch' in favor both of the petitioner corporation and the respondent company.\"   \n",
        "p_19": "(18) Similarly the High Court of Australia in the The Seven Up Company vs. O.T. Limited and another (1047) 75 Clr 203 held as follows:    \"........IN my opinion the effect of these cases is that in the absence of fraud it is not unlawful for a trader to become the registered proprietor under the Trade Marks Act of a mark which has been used, however extensively, by another trader as a mark for similar goods in a foreign country, provided the foreign mark has not been used at all in Australia at the date of the application for registration. But the position is different if at that dale the mark has become identified with the goods of the foreign trader in Australia because those goods have been brought into Australia by the foreign trader' himself or by some importer or in some other manner. The court frowns upon any attempt by one trader to appropriate the mark of another trader although that trader is a foreign trader and the mark has only been used hy him in a foreign country. It therefore .seizes upon a very small amount of use of the foreign mark in Australia to hold that it has become identified with and distinctive of the goods of the foreign trader in Australis. It is not then a mark which another leader is entitled to apply to register under the the Trade Marks Act because it is not his properly hut the properly of the foreign trader. The registrar is entitled to refuse to register the mark for such goods. If it has been registered the court may rectify the register on the' ground that the mark is wrongly entered on the register. Further, if at the date of the application for registration, the mark of the foreign trader, although it has not been used in Australia,, has neverthless become associated in the minds of the Australian public with his goods because it has been advertised in publications which have circulated extensively in Australia or in some other manner, the registrar is entitled to refuse to register the mark for such goods because il is likely to deceive. If it has been registered the court may rectify the register on the ground that the mark is wrongly entered on the register.   \n",
        "p_20": "(19) THUS. advertisement of a trade mark of a foreign trader in respect of a product need not he associated with the actual use of the product in order to establish reputation  \n\n(20) In Pioneer Hy-Bred Com Co. vs. Hy-line Chicks Pty. Ltd. 1979 Rpc 410, the appellant, an Australian company had applied on August 1963 for registration of the mark \"HY-LINE\" in New Zealand in respect of live chicken and poultry. Similar trademark in respect of same items had been registered in the United States in the year 1941 in favor of the respondent, an American company. Till August 1963, no sales of poultry had been made either by the Australian company or by the American company in New Zealand because of import restrictions. The Assistant Commissioner of Trade Marks accepted the application of the Australian company for registration of the said. trade mark. Thereupon the American company appealed to the Supreme Court of New Zealand, which reversed the decision of the Assistant Commissioner. Against the decision of the Supreme Court, the Australian company appealed to the High Court of New Zealand. The High Court while upholding the decision of the Supreme Court laid down the test to be applied while deciding whether use in New Zealand of the appellant's trade mark was likely to deceive or cause confusion when the use of the American trade mark in New Zealand was not established,-but only the awareness through advertisement thereof in the concerned New Zealand market of that mark was proved. In this connection it was held as follows:-    \"........IT is the awareness or cognizance of those who are potential buyers in, or otherwise associated with the relevant New Zealand market that is material. If there is a likelihood that they will be deceived or confused as to the origin of goods covered by the applicant's mark, it matters not how they gained the knowledge that gives rise to that deception or confusion.\" \".........But in my view it is-a fair inference from the evidence that many New Zealand poultry men with an interest in improving breeding stocks in New Zealand read overseas magazines to expand their knowledge and that New Zealand poultry men sufficiently interested to subscribe for overseas periodicals had an interest in reading about overseas developments in breeding stock. Not all readers would have read all advertisements in all issues. Having regard to the evidence that the poultry men specifically referred to associated the trade mark HY-LINE with HY-LINE Poultry Farms from reading literature on poultry matters, I think it probable, as did Cooke, J., that many of the other New Zealand subscribers to the journals would have read many of the advertisements in those trade magazines.\"  \n",
        "p_21": "(21) This Court in Apple Computer Inc. vs. Apple Leasing & Industries 1992 (1) Arbitration Law Reporter 93 at 137 while dealing with the question of overseas reputation of a trade mark in respect of a product held as follows:-    \"...........INother words, it is not necessary in the context of the present day circumstances, the free exchange of information and advertising through newspapers, magazines, video, television, movies, freedom of travel between various parts of the world, to insist that a particular plaintiff must carry on business in a jurisdiction before improper use of its name or mark can be restrained by the court. Similarly, I am also in agreement with the view expressed regarding the meaning of goodwill in passing-off cases. In passing- off cases, the main consideration is the likelihood of confusion and consequential injury to the plaintiff, and the need to protect the public from deception, deliberate or otherwise. Where such confusion or deception is prima facie shown to exist, protection should be given by courts to the name or mark or goodwill of the plaintiff. The reason why all traders and manufacturers of goods, and providers of services, wish to protect their name and build up their name is that they want their name or market to have an impact upon anyone who has need of their goods or services. That impact may take diverse forms, but one of them would certainly be that a name or mark would recall to the mind of a potential consumer or user of such services, the source from where the goods originate, or the person who provides the services. This is the impact of advertising and publicity by whatever means including word of mouth, and the build-up of reputation. It would not be right for courts to permit the persons who have spent considerable time, effort, money and energy in building up a name sufficient to have an impact to lose control over such an impact by improper use of the very same or colourably similar name by another unauthorisedly or even dishonestly.\"  \n",
        "p_22": "(22) To the similar effect is the decision of the Bombay High Court in Kamal Trading Co., Bombay and others vs. Gillette U.K.. Limited, Middle Sex, England 1988 Ptc I wherein it was laid down as follows:-    \".........IT is necessary to note that the goodwill is not limited to a particular country because in the present days, the trade is spread all over the world and the goods are transported from one country to another very rapidly and on extensive scale. The goodwill acquired by the manufacturer is not necessarily limited to the country where the goods are freely available because the goods though not available are widely advertised in newspapers, periodicals, magazines and inother medias. The result is that though the goods are not available in the country, the goods and the mark under which they are sold acquires wide reputation. Take for example, the televisions, and Video Cassette Recorders manufactured by National, Sony or other wellknown Japanese Concerns. These televisions and V.C.Rs. are not imported in India and sold in open market, because of trade restrictions, but is it possible even to suggest that the word 'National' or 'Sony has not acquired reputation in this country In our judgment, the goodwill or reputation of goods or marks does not depend upon its availability in a particular country.\"   \n",
        "p_23": "(23) Extra territorial reputation of a mark was also recognised in the matter of Vitamins LD'S Application for Trade Mark, 1956 R.P.C. 1. In that case the respondent applied for registration of mark \"Pabalate\" in respect of pharmaceutical substance. This was opposed by the appellant, an American Corporation, on the ground that the said mark st:)od registered in their favor in various countries and the same was advertised extensively in Medical Journals, which had circulation in the United Kingdom as well. The American Company however, did not have any user of the trade mark in United Kingdom as no sale of the goods had been made under the said mark by them in that country . Despite the lack of user in England it was held that the application of the respondent should not be permitted to proceed having regard to the fact that the advertisements of pharmaceutical substances were reaching in that country In this regard it was observed as follows:-    \"......HAVINGregard to the lad that the evidence discloses a genuine business on the pan of the Appellants in their country of origin, and that advertisements of such are Teaching this country and appearing in libraries or places of reference to which medical men may resort, it seems to me that I am bound to consider the possibility that, with the passage of 'time, some conflict may occur between the use of the mark by the present Respondents and the advertisement and user of the mark overseas by the present Appellants. Having regard to the international character which medicine and the allied sciences have assumed and increasingly assumed over the last two decades, it seems to me that the Court must he particularly careful to see that in exercising its discretion under the Act the public interest is not in any way imperilled. For my part I am not satisfied that, in allowing to he used by manufacturers in this country as a brand name for a pharmaceutical substance a word which is in fad used by an American Corporation in respect of the same material and advertised in journals, which on the evidence are received into this country and referred to, the public interest will he best served .by permitting registration. Accordingly, on both those grounds it seems to me that it is my duly to indicate that in the light ol' the fuller consideration which the mailer has received in this Court the application should not be permitted to proceed.\"   \n",
        "p_24": "(24) At this stage we may refer to the animated cinema characters \"Mickey Mouse\" and \"Minni Mouse\" invented by Walter E. Disney which have become extremely popular. They are known world over. The popularity is acquired mostly through Motion Pictures .which-have great impact on the audience. It was because of this popularity that registration of marks 'Mickey Mouse' and 'Minni Mouse' in rasped of radio receiving sets manufactured by a trader, namely, Radio Corporation Propriety Limited were refused to be registered by the Registrar of Trade Marks even though no registration had been obtained in Australia by the inventor and creator of animated cinema characters in respect of the words 'Mickey Mouse' and ''Minni Mouse' as trade marks. But in Great Britain and other countries the words were registered as trade marks for Motion Pictures. This decision of the Registrar of Trade Marks was upheld by the High Court of Australia in Radio Corporation Proprietary. Ltd. vs. Disney and others. 1937 Clr 448, on the ground that the words were so closely associated . with the respondent/opponent, that their use by the appellant/applicant was calculated to deceive and cause confusion in trade and public mind.The names 'Mickey Mouse' &. 'Minni Mouse' were held to he associated or transfixed in the public mind with the respondent. The world wide fame and popularity of the names 'Mickey Mouse' and 'Minni Mouse' is due to the tremendous impact that films have on the minds of the public. Television has a similar effect on the viewers and so have the advertisements in magazines, periodicals, newspapers etc. having world wide publication. Today advertisements in respect of goods and the trade marks under which they are marketed in one country are taken cognizance of in other countries. Business reputation is gained by the companies even in colonelcies where their product is not used and is merely known through'advertisements.  \n",
        "p_25": "(25) Thus a product und its trade name transcends the physical boundaries of a geographical region and acquires a trans border or overseas or extraterritorial reputation not only though import of goods but also by its advertisement. The knowledge and the awareness of the goods of a foreign trade & its trade mark can be available at a place where goods are not being marketed and consequently not being used. The manner in which or the source from which the knowledge has been acquired is immaterial  \n\n(26) The objection of the appellants based non user of the product of the first respondent under the trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL' in India therefore, does not appeal to us. Besides, it is not a case where the goods of the first respondent have not been imported in this country. The respondents have asserted that the goods under the trademark 'WHIRLPOOL' were imported in India by the American Embassy & U.S Aid office New Delhi.   \n",
        "p_26": "(27) Affidavit of Lawrence John Kremer dated December 5, 1990, Filed by way of evidence in respect of the opposition of the first respondent to the application of the appellants for registration of the trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL', slates that the mark WHIRLPOOL' was adopted and used by allied first respondent in various'eouniries of ' the world since July 1941. It has also been staled in the afl'idavit that: (1) 'the trade inark''WHIRLPOOL' was registered in favor of the First respondent in several countries & {2) the said trade mark is being used hy them in more than 65 countries of the World.

Even advertisement of trade mark without existence of goods in the market is also to be considered as use of the trade mark. It is also not necessary however that the association of plaintiffs mark with his goods should be known all over the country or to every person in the area where it is known best.(See: Fanlder& Co, Ld.vs. O & G. Rushton(1903) 20 Rpc 477) Besides the facts prima facie demonstrable that the first respondent was prior user of the trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL' as it was using the same since 1941, while the appellants themselves claim the adoption thereof from 1986.   \n",
        "p_28": "(29) THUS. we see no reason to differ with the finding of the learned Single Judge that the First respondent acquired trans border reputation in respect of the trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL' and has a right to prefect the invasion thereof.   \n",
        "p_29": "(30) We now proceed to consider the question as to whether the respondents can maintain an action for passing off against' the appellants who are the registered proprietors of the trade mark \"WHIRLPOOL\" in India. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the appellants have an exclusive right to use the trade mark \"WHIRLPOOL\" under section 28(1) of the Act as they arc the registered proprietors of the same.In order to appreciate the submission of the learned counsel, it will be necessary to set out section 28(1) of the Act. This section reads as under:-    \"28(1)Subject to the other provisions of this Act, the registration of a trade mark in Part A or Part B of the register shall, if valid, give to the registered proprietor of the trade mark the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation to the goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered and to obtain relief in respect of infringement of the trade mark in the manner provided by this Act.   \n",
        "p_30": "(31) According to section 28(1) of the Act, registration of a trade mark gives to the registered proprietor thereof exclusive right to use the same in. relation to the goods in respect of which it has been registered. But from the opening words of section 28(1) namely, \"subject to other provisions\" it is clear that the right conferred on a trader is not an indefeasible right as the same is expressly made subject to other provisions of the Act. This is further, made clear by section 27(2) of the Act, which' provides that \" nothing in this Act shall he deemed to affect the right of action against any person for passing off the goods as goods of another person or the remedies in respect thereof.\" Thus it is manifest that Section 28 of the Act and all other provisions come within the '\" 'over riding sway of section 27(2) of the Act. Similarly section 33 of the Act also saves vested rights of a prior user. It lays down that nothing in the Act shall entitle a registered proprietor of a trade mark to interfere with the use of the trade mark by a prior user of the same. Thus the right created by section 28(1) of the Act in favor of a registered proprietor of a trade mark is not an absolute right and is subservient to other provisions of the Act namely sections 27(2), 33 etc. Neither section 28 nor any other provision of the Act bars an action for passing off by. an anterior user of a trade mark against a registered user of the same.- In other words registration of a trade mark does not provide a defense to the proceedings for passing off as under section 27(2) of the Act a prior user of a trade mark can maintain an action for passing off against any subsequent user of an identical trade mark including a registered user thereof. Again this right is not affected by section 31 of the Act, under which the only presumption that follows from registration of a mark is its prima facie evidentiary value about its validity and nothing more. This presumption is not an unrepeatable one & can be displaced. Besides section 31 is not immune to the over-riding effect of section 27(2). Placing reliance on section 28(3) of the Act the I warned counsel for the appellant contended that when two registered proprietors of identical or near similar trade marks cannot be deemed to have acquired exclusive right to the use of any of those trade marks against each other, how can an unregistered user of the trade mark maintain an action for passing off against a registered user of the same mark and seek an injunction restraining him from using it. This argument of the learned counsel seems to stem from a misconception about the real purpose and intent of section 28(3). Actually section 28(3) protects registered proprietor of a trade mark from an infringement action by another registered proprietor of an identical or near similar trade mark. In this regard it will also bo necessary to extract Section 28(3) and section 3()(1)(d) which carries of the intent of section 28(3). These sections read as under:-    \"28(3) Where two or more persons are registered proprietors of trade marks, which are identical with or nearly resemble each other, the exclusive right to the use of any of those trade marks shall not (except so far as their respective rights are subject to any conditions or limitations entered on the register) be deemed to have been acquired by any one of those persons as against any other of those persons medley by registration of the trade, marks but each of those persons has otherwise the same rights as against other persons (not. being registered users using by way of permitted use) as he would have if he were the sole registered proprietor. 30(l)(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this 'Act, the following acts do not constitute an infringement or the 'right to the use of a registered trademark- .........the use of a registered trade mark, being, one of two or more trade marks registered under this Act which are identical or nearly resemble each other, in exercise of the right to the use of that trade mark given by registration under this Act.\" '   \n\n(32) A reading of section 28(3) with section 30(l)(d) shows that the proprietor of a registered trade mark cannot file an infringement action against a proprietor of an identical or a similar trade mark. While sections 28(3) and 30(l)(d) on the one hand deal with the rights of registered proprietors of identical trade marks and bar action of infringement against each other, section 27(2) or the other hand deals with the passing off action. The rights of action under section 27(2) are not affected by section 28(3) and section 30(l)(d). Therefore, registration of a trade mark under the Act would be irrelevant in an action for passing off. Registration of a trade mark in fact docs not confer any new right on the proprietor thereof than what already existed at common law without registration of the mark. The right of goodwill & reputation in a trade mark was recognised at common law even before it was subject of statutory law. Prior to codification of trade mark law there was no provision in India for registration of a trade mark. The right in a trade mark was acquired only by use thereof.This right has not been affected by the Act and is preserved and recognised by sections 27(2) and 33.  \n",
        "p_31": "(33) The law of 'passing off as it has developed, permits an .action against a registered proprietor of a trade mark for its mendacious use for inducing and misleading the consumers into thinking that his goods are the goods.of or are connected with the goods of a prior user of the trade mark. It seems to us that in so far as this Court is 'concerned, this position cannot be disputed in view of thc judgment of the Division Bench in Century Traders vs. Roshan Lal Duggar & Co. 1978, Delhi 250 where, while construing sections 27(2) and 106 of the Act, it was held as follows:-    \"FROM a reading of t\u00f2he above sections it is clear that registration of mark.in the trade mark registry would be irrelevant in an action for passing off. Thus, the law is pretty well settled tt in order to succeed at this stage the appellant had to establish user of the aforesaid mark prior in point of lime than the impugned user by the respondents. The registration of the said mark or similar mark prior in point of lime to user by the appellant is irrelevant in an action for passing off and the mere' presence of the mark in the register maintained by the trade mark registry did not prove its user by the persons in whose names the mark was registered and was irrelevant for the purposes of deciding the application for interim injunction unless evidence had been led or was available of user of the registered trade marks. In our opinion, these clear rules of law were not kept in view by the learned single Judge and led him to, commit an error.\"  \n",
        "p_32": "(34) Again in Consolidated Foods Corporation vs. Brandon & Co.,  similar view finds expression. In this regard it was held as follows:-    \"....,...To summarise, therefore, a trader acquires a right of property in-a distinctive mark merel' by using it upon or in connection with his goods irrespective of the length of such user and the extent of his trade. The trader who adopts such a mark is entitled to protection directly the article having assumed a vendible character is launched upon the market. As between two competitors who are each desirous of adopting such a mark, \"it is, to use familiar language, entirely a question of who gets there first.\" (Gaw Kan Lye v. Saw Kyone Saing, Air 1939 Rang 343 (FB).. Registration under the statute does not confer any new right to the mark claimed or any greater right than what already existed at common law and at equity without registration. It does however, facilitate a remedy which may he enforced and obtained thorough out the Stale and it established the record of facts a fleeting the right to the mark. Registration itself does not create a trade mark. The trade mark exists independently of the registration which merely affords further protection under the statute. Common law rights are left wholly unaffected. Priority in adoption and use of a trade mark is superior to priority in registration.\"   \n",
        "p_33": "(35) Again in M/s .L.D. Malhotra vs. Ropi Industries, a learned single Bench of this Court restated & adopted the principles noticed in Consolidated foods Corporation case (supra). It also referred to the decision of the House of Lords in Gec vs.GE Co. Ltd. 1972 Ah E.R. 517. Drawing upon the aforesaid decisions, it was observed as follows:- .    \"........Now at common law the use of the mark was the only way in which trade mark rights in it could he acquired: Kerly's Trade Mark 10th edition page 245. It is difficult to understand the statutory law relating to trade marks without understanding the state of the common law as it existed before the law was codified. In a recent decision of the House of Lords in Gec v. The Ge Co. Ltd. (1972) 2 All E.R. 507(2) Lord Diplock said: \"The right of property in a trade mark was recognised at common law before it was the subject of any enactment. The 1875 Act did not itself create any right of properly in trade marks. As its title itself indicates and its provision confirm, it simply provided for the registration of trade marks arid spelled out the consequences of registration and non-registration on the proprietory rights of the owner of the trade mark and the remedies available to him for the protection of those proprietary rights. \"The 1875 Act must, therefore, be construed in the light of the common law relating to trade marks in 1875. I use the expression 'common law' to include the doctrines of equity applied in what at I hat time was the separate Court of Chancery. My Lords, it may well be a legitimate criticism of our methods of drafting legislation that in order to ascertain the meaning of an Act of Parliament passed in 1938, it should be necessary not only to consider the legislative history over the previous 63 years but also to engage in what in other systems of law might be regarded a antiquarian research, namely, the state of the common law as it existed before the first Act to alter it was passed nearly 1(X) years ago. But, in my view, the 1938 Act which purports to consolidate our existing law becomes intelligible only when this course, which is a well recognised aid to statutory construction, is adopted.\"  \n",
        "p_34": "(39) Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that since a registered proprietor of a trade mark has an exclusive right to the use thereof under section 28(1) of the Act, even a prior user of the said trade mark cannot be permitted to bring an action for 'passing off against the former & the only remedy of the latter is to move for cancellation of registration under section 56 of the Act. In this regard he relied upon certain decisions including single Bench decisions of this Court namely, M/s.Anil Food Industries vs. M/s Alka Food Industries, 1989 Ptc 129 M/s.P.L.J. & Co. vs. M/s Promilla Industries, 1991 Ptc 233 and P.M.Diesels Pvt. Ltd. vs. Thukral Mechanical Works,.. 1/R 1988 Delhi 282. But the decision of the Division Bench of this Court in Century Traders vs.Roshan Lal Duggar holds the field for this Court insofar as the Question of maintaining passing off action against a registered proprietor of a trade mark is concerned. Learned counsel did not cite any decision of a Division Bench or. larger bench of this court taking a view contrary to the one taken in Century Traders.   \n",
        "p_35": "(40) In M/s Anil Food Industries vs. M/s Alka Food Industries (supra) the trade mark \"Anil\" was registered in favor of both the plaintiff and the defendant in respect of Union Territory of Delhi. Noting this fact, the learned Single Judge held that the question of the defendant being injuncted from using the mark \"Anil\" in respect of the Union Territory of Delhi did not arise. The matter was not considered from the point of view of section 27(2) of the Act. In M/s.P.L.J. & Co. vs. M/s.Promilla Industries (supra) the question whether in a suit for passing off an order of injunction can be passed against the owner of a registered trade mark restraining him from using the said mark, was not decided as it was felt that there was no necessity to decide the same in view of the concession of the defendant that he shall not sell its product in cartons similar to the ones used by the defendant. In P.M.Diesels Pvt. Ltd. vs. Thukral 'Mechanical Works (supra) both plaintiff and the defendant were admitted owners of the trade mark 'Field Marshal'. While the plaintiff was the registered proprietor of trade mark 'Field Marshal' in respect of diesel oil engines or parts thereof, the defendants were the registered proprietors of the trade mark 'Field Marshal' in respect of centrifugal pumps etc. The learned single Judge held that the proprietary rights of both the plaintiff and defendants in respect of their marks were protected under section 28(3) of the Act and neither of them could be restrained from using its mark. A perusal of the judgment shows that the provisions of section 27(2) of the Act were neither considered nor noticed. Besides this was a case which arose under the provisions of section 28(3) of the Act. Therefore, none of these decisions further the case of the appellants.  \n",
        "p_36": "(41) The concept and principle on which passing off action is grounded is that a man is not to sell his own goods under the pretence that they are the goods of another man. A trader needs protection of his right of prior user of a trade mark as the benefit of the name and reputation earned by him cannot be taken advantage of by another trader by copying the mark and getting it registered before he could get the same registered in his favor. We see no reason why a registered owner of a trade mark should be allowed to deceive purchasers into the belief that they are getting the goods of another while they would be buying the goods of the former which they never intended to do. In an action for passing off it should not matter whether misrepresentation or deception has proceeded from a. registered or an unregistered user of a trade mark. He cannot represent his own goods as the goods of some body else. 42. In Delco Engineering Works vs. General Motors Corporation Ilr 1974 Punjab & Haryana series 502 it has been held that an action for passing off is founded on the desirability of preventing commercial immorality or dishonesty by a trader who by using a particular mark, whether registered or unregistered wants to falsely represent that his goods are the goods of some one else so that he can take undue and unfair advantage of the reputation of the other person in the mark. Therefore, it cannot be stated that under section 28 of the Act the statutory right of use acquired by a trader by registration of a mark is a defense to proceedings for passing off initiated by a prior user of the mark. In our opinion the learned Single Judge correctly analysed the decision of the Division Bench in Century Traders vs. Roshan Lal Duggar and we record our respectful approval thereto by holding that there is no statutory bar to a prior user of a trade mark for bringing an action for 'passing off against a registered proprietor thereof. It is also wholly immaterial in an action for passing off that the opposition of the plaintiff to the registration of the mark in favor of the defendant was not accepted. In an action for passing off, it is no defense that the defendant's trade mark is registered and that of the prior user is not so registered.  \n",
        "p_37": "(43) Having regard to the above discussion,the following position emerges. The Courts do not approve of any attempt by one trader to appropriate the mark of another trader,even though that trader may be a foreign trader and mostly uses his mark in respect of the goods available abroad i.e. out side the country where the appropriation of the mark has taken place. As mentioned earlier awareness & knowledge of the mark in the latter country may be because of small trickle of goods in that country or through advertisement. The manner and method by which the knowledge of the mark is acquired by the public is of no consequence & will not matter. Applying this principle & the reasons already stated we have prima facie come to the conclusion that the appellants have acquired reputation & goodwill in respect of its goods bearing trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL' in this country. Even though the appellants have no connection with the respondents, they are using the mark 'WHIRLPOOL' for their products. Prima facie it appears to us that buyers are likely to be deceived or confused as to the origin and source of the goods. They will believe that the product is manufactured by the respondents, an impression not founded in truth. The imitation will pass off as genuine. No one can be permitted to trade by deceiving or misleading the purchasers or to unauthorisedly divert to itself the reputation and goodwill of others. Under section 27(2) an action for passing off against registered user of trade mark is maintainable at the instance of a prior user of the same, similar or identical mark. Since such a remedy is available against the registered user of a trade mark, an interim injunction restraining him to use the mark can also be granted to make the remedy effective.  \n",
        "p_38": "(44) We also do not agree with the submission of learned counsel for the appellants that the respondents are guilty of culpable delay, acquiescence and laches which disentitle the respondents from claiming the relief of injunction. It may be noted that the respondents tiled their opposition to the application of the appellants for registration of the trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL' which was decided on August 12, 1992. Thereafter the respondents also filed an appeal before this Court which is still pending. On August 4, 1994 the present suit was filed against the appellants. Right from the time te respondents came to know about the application for registration of trade mark by the appellants, the former has been contesting the same. It is also not the case of the appellants that they have sold large number of washing mach as over a long period of time. There is no question therefore of any prejudice being caused to the appellants by filing of the suit in the year 1994 by the respondents. If they have not done any appreciable business, they cannot be said to have been adversely effected by the filing of the suit in the year 1994. Delay, if any, without being coupled with prejudice caused to the appellants cannot be a good defense by itself. defense of laches or delay can be set up in equity but it cannot be put forth by some one who has not acted fairly and honestly and has used the trade mark of another person. There is no plausible & convincing explanation by the appellants as to how they came to adopt the mark 'WHIRLPOOL'. In. absence of any satisfactory explanation by the appellants, the adoption of the mark by them cannot prima facie he regarded as honest and plea of delay & laches would be of no avail to them. As regards acquiescence, there is nothing to show that there has been a tacit or express assent by the respondents to the appellant's using the mark. As regards the submission of learned counsel for the appellants that the respondents had abandoned the trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL' and therefore, they cannot maintain the action of passing off, is not well founded. As already seen, the respondents had been using the trade mark 'WHIRLPOOL' world wide and there is no reason to assume that the same was abandoned. Mere fact that the registration was not renewed by them in India after 1977, is no ground to hold that the respondents had abandoned the trade mark.   \n",
        "p_39": "(45) Lastly learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the order of the Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks was binding on the principle of issue estoppel. It has been rightly pointed out by the learned single Judge that the registration of the mark was of no consequence in a passing off action.   \n",
        "p_40": "(46) Learned counsel for the appellant relied on the decision of the Chancery Division in Crown Estate Commissioner vs. Dorset County Council 1991 All E.R. 19, where the question was whether the decision of the Chief Commons Commissioner that certain road verges were not registrable under the Commons Registration Act, 1965 as the same formed part of a highway could be reagitated in proceedings unconnected with the proceedings in which these road verges were excluded from the register of common land. Following the decision of the Commissioner, defendants ceased to make any payments to the plaintiffs in their use of the verges. The plaintiffs brought proceedings for trespass with a view to relit gated the same question, namely, whether the road verges are part of the highway, which the Chief Commons Commissioner decided against them. The Chancery Division of the High Court held that the Commissioner had a statutory jurisdiction to decide whether or not the road verges should be registered as common land and for that purpose it had to determine the question whether or not the land formed part of the highway, which was again a mailer in its jurisdiction. Therefore, it was held that the decision of the Commissioner created an issue estoppel and the same issue was not capable of being relit gated subsequently in the Court. The aforesaid principle is well established but the same has no application in the present case as registration of a mark as a consequence of the proceedings before the authorities under Section 28 of the Act has been expressly made subject to the other provisions thereof. As already noticed. section 27(2) of the Act itself provides for an action for passing off and saves such a right notwithstanding registration of the mark by the Trade Mark Registry. It seems to us that Section 27(2) and 33 are conclusive on the question of maintainability of the suit for passing off and the application of doctrine of issue estoppel in case of this kind will not apply.  \n",
        "p_41": "(47) Having regard to the above discussion, we see no reason to interfere with the discretionary order passed by the learned Single Judge dated October 31, 1994 granting the restraint order. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed but without any order as to costs\n \n\n"

Even in the \nHarappan Civilization marks of trade with foreign countries such as \nMesopotamia and Babylonia were found embossed on articles.  The law of \ntrade marks was formalised with the process of registration which gave \nexclusivity to a trader right to deal in goods using a symbol or mark of \nsome sort to distinguish his goods from similar goods sold by other traders.  \nEven today the grant of a trade mark is an indicator of exclusivity in trade \nunder that mark and this right cannot be transferred.  Only a limited right of \nuser can be granted via licence.\n",
        "p_123": "In The Modern Law of Trade Marks by Christopher Morcom, \nButterworths 1999, it is stated:\n",
        "p_124": "\"The concept of distinguishing goods or services \nof the proprietor from those of others was to be \nfound in the requirements for a mark to be \nregistrable.  Essentially, whatever the wording \nused, a trade mark or a service mark was an \nindication which enabled the goods or services \nfrom a particular source to be indentified and thus \ndistinguished from goods or services from other \nsources.  In adopting a definition of 'trade mark' \nwhich simply describes the function in terms of \ncapability of 'distinguishing the goods or services \nof one undertaking from those of other \nundertakings' the new law is really saying \nprecisely the same thing.\"\n",
        "p_125": " In Gujarat Bottling Co. Ltd. and Others v. Coca Cola Co. and Others \n[(1995) 5 SCC 545], it was held that licensing of trade mark is governed by \ncommon law which is also statutorily permissible provided:\n",
        "p_126": "\" (i) the licensing does not result in causing \nconfusion or deception among the public; (ii) it \ndoes not destroy the distinctiveness of the trade \nmark, that is to say, the trade mark, before the \npublic eye, continues to distinguish the goods \nconnected with the proprietor of the mark from \nthose connected with others; and (iii) a connection \nin the course of trade consistent with the definition \nof trade mark continues to exist between the goods \nand the proprietor of the mark\"\n",
        "p_127": " \tMaking use of another's trade mark is not only a violation of \nbusiness ethics but has also been linked to dishonestly making use of the \ngoodwill and reputation built up and associated with the mark.\n",
        "p_128": " \tIn Laxmikant V. Patel v. Chetanbhai Shah and Another [(2002) 3 \nSCC 65], it was stated:\n",
        "p_129": "\"10. A person may sell his goods or deliver his \nservices such as in case of a profession under a \ntrading name or style. With the lapse of time such \nbusiness or services associated with a person \nacquire a reputation or goodwill which becomes a \nproperty which is protected by courts. A \ncompetitor initiating sale of goods or services in \nthe same name or by imitating that name results in \ninjury to the business of one who has the property \nin that name. The law does not permit any one to \ncarry on his business in such a way as would \npersuade the customers or clients in believing that \nthe goods or services belonging to someone else \nare his or are associated therewith. It does not \nmatter whether the latter person does so \nfraudulently or otherwise. The reasons are two. \nFirstly, honesty and fair play are, and ought to be, \nthe basic policies in the world of business. \nSecondly, when a person adopts or intends to \nadopt a name in connection with his business or \nservices which already belongs to someone else it \nresults in confusion and has propensity of diverting \nthe customers and clients of someone else to \nhimself and thereby resulting in injury.\"\n",
        "p_130": "PURPOSE OF TRADE MARK\n\n \tA trade mark is the property of the manufacturer.  The purpose of a \ntrade mark is to establish a connection between the goods and the source \nthereof which would suggest the quality of goods. If the trade mark is \nregistered, indisputably the user thereof by a person who is not otherwise \nauthorised to do so would constitute infringement.  Section 21 of the 1958 \nAct provides that where an application for registration is filed, the same can \nbe opposed.  Ordinarily under the law and, as noticed hereinbefore, there \ncan only be one mark, one source or one proprietor.  Ordinarily again right \nto user of a trade mark cannot have two origins.  The first respondent herein \nis a rival trader of the appellant-Company.  It did not in law have any right \nto use the said trade mark, save and except by reason of the terms contained \nin the MOU or continuous user.  It is well-settled that when defences in \nregard to right of user are set up, the onus would be on the person who has \ntaken the said plea.  It is equally well-settled that a person cannot use a \nmark which would be deceptively similar to that of the registered trade \nmark.  Registration of trade marks is envisaged to remove any confusion in \nthe minds of the consumers.  If, thus, goods are sold which are produced \nfrom two sources, the same may lead to confusion in the mind of the \nconsumers.  In a given situation, it may also amount to fraud on the public.  \nA proprietor of a registered trade mark indisputably has a statutory right \nthereto.  In the event of such use by any person other than the person in \nwhose name the trade mark is registered, he will have a statutory remedy in \nterms of Section 21 of the 1958 Act.  Ordinarily, therefore, two people are \nnot entitled to the same trade mark, unless there exists an express licence in \nthat behalf.\n",

        "p_133": "\"Thus, the distinction between a trade mark and \na property mark is that whereas the former denotes \nthe manufacture or quality of the goods to which it \nis attached, the latter denotes the ownership in \nthem. In other words, a trade mark concerns the \ngoods themselves, while a property mark concerns \nthe proprietor. A property mark attached to the \nmovable property of a person remains even if part \nof such property goes out of his hands and ceases \nto be his.\"\n",
        "p_134": "In Canon Kabushiki Kaisha v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. [(1999) \nRPC 117], the European Court of Justice emphasised the test of likelihood \nof confusion in the following terms:\n",

That view is also confirmed by the judgment \nof the court in SABEL, in which it held that the \n\"likelihood of confusion mustbe appreciated \nglobally, taking into account all factors relevant to \nthe circumstances of the case\" (at paragraph 22).  \nIt is true that that statement was made in a different \ncontext: the court was there considering the \nquestion whether conceptual similarity of the \nmarks alone could give rise to confusion within the \nmeaning of Article 4(1)(b), in a situation in which \nthe goods in question were clearly the same.  \nHowever, the statement is one of general \napplication.\"\n",

It was required to be construed, even if it was \nobscure to some extent by making attempt to uphold the one which would \nbe in consonance with law and not offend the same.  Quality control by a \nregistered trade holder vis-`-vis the one produced by an unregistered one is \none of the factors which is required to be taken into consideration for the \npurpose of passing an order of injunction.  It is one thing to say that the \nrespondents were permitted to carry on trade but it would be another thing \nsay that they would be entitled to manufacture and market its products \nunder a name which would be deceptively similar to that of the registered \ntrade mark of the appellant.  So long the parties to an arrangement can \ncontinue to carry out their respective businesses without infringing the right \nof another, indisputably the terms thereof must be given effect to.  But the \nmatter would be entirely different when a party who has not been expressly \nauthorised to manufacture the goods in which the Company had been \ncarrying on business under the same name, the respondents under law could \nnot have been permitted to carry on the manufacturing and marketing of \ntheir products under the same name.  In a case of this nature, even a \nmandatory injunction can be granted.  The respondents in the instant case \nhave adopted a part of the appellant's registered trade mark as a part of its \ncorporate name.  They had merely been permitted to trade from seven \noutlets.  In that view of the matter, they had a limited right under the MOU \nand by reason thereof they could not have been permitted to start \nmanufacturing of spices under the name and style of 'Ramdev Masala'.  \nEven under the common law, licence has to be interpreted to subsume the \nlaw and prevent the mischief which is deceptive having regard to the fact \nthat trafficking in trade mark is not permitted.  \n",
        "p_152": " \tIt is true that the respondents have been permitted in terms of the \nMOU to continue their business in the name of the partnership firm and to \nuse the label mark, logo, etc. but the said MOU must be construed in the \nlight of the law operating in the field.  For the said purpose, prima facie, the \ndeeds of retirement are not required to be looked into.  When a right to use \na trade mark is given, such a right can be exercised only in the manner laid \ndown therein.  If in absence of any express licence or agreement to use its \nlabel the respondents use the self-same trade mark, the same would not \nonly lead to confusion but may also cause deception.  Even a common law \nlicence, it is well-settled, cannot result in the dilution of the trade mark.\n",
        "p_153": " \tIn that view of the matter, we are not in a position to subscribe to the \nviews of the learned Trial Judge and the High Court that although the first \nrespondent would be at liberty to carry on the business of manufacture of \nspices, it can use the mark 'Ramdev' only in seven outlets.  It evidently in \nview of the legal position, could do so in respect of the products of the \nappellant alone, which would be evident from the fact that at the relevant \npoint of time, the respondents were not carrying any such business.  The \ndirection of the learned Trial Judge that the respondents should be \nprevented from using the word \"Ramdev Masala\" and their label and \npacking, however, has been over-turned by the High Court on the premise \nthat they are required to observe the statutory requirements under the \nPrevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1955 as also the Standards of \nWeights and Measures Act, 1976.\n",
        "p_154": "NON-OBSTANTE PROVISIONS \n\n\tThe non-obstante nature of a provision although may be of wide \namplitude, the interpretative process thereof must be kept confined to the \nlegislative policy.  A non-obstante clause must be given effect to, to the \nextent the Parliament intended and not beyond the same. [See ICICI Bank \nLtd. v. Sidco Leathers Ltd. & Ors., 2006 (5) SCALE 27]\n\n \tThe question which also escaped the attention of the High Court was \nthat having regard to the non-obstante clause contained in the 1958 Act \nordinarily for any purpose, the trade mark cannot be infringed.  If an \ninfringement of trade mark is established, the onus would be on the \ndefendants to show that he is entitled thereto either by reason of \nacquiescence on the part of the owner of the registered trade mark or he \nhimself has acquired a right thereto.  The Provisions of the Standards of \nWeights and Measures Act or the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act do \nnot confer such right.  Yet again, significantly, a pre-emptive right had been \nconferred in favour of the first respondent which is itself suggestive of the \nfact that the first respondent admitted and acknowledged the right of the \nappellant to the said trade mark.  \n",
        "p_155": " \tIn the MOU, furthermore it was categorically stated that the use of \nthe trade mark was only to the extent of retail sale as on the packages, the \nwords \"not for resale\" were to be printed.  If the parties intended to allow \nthe first respondent herein to manufacture his own products and to market \nthe same by using the name of Ramdev Masala, the question of grant of a \nright to sell only in retail and that also printing the words 'not for resale' \nwould not have arisen.  A manufacturer is not only entitled to sell his own \nproducts in retail but also in wholesale.  It can use any outlet for the said \npurpose whether belonging to it or any other.  It would lead to an anomaly \nif it be held that the first respondent would be permitted not only to sell the \nproducts of the appellant but also its own products under the same trade \nname albeit only from the seven outlets.\n",
        "p_156": " \tBy reason of the said MOU, the respondents are not bound to buy \nany product from the appellant but there is an obligation on the part of the \nappellant to supply the same as otherwise it would lead to closure of \nbusiness of Arvindbhai which would have been the intention of the parties.  \nWhen the parties had settled their disputes, it was expected that the outlets \nwould be utilised for the purposes for which they were meant to be utilised.  \nWhat were the mutual obligations of the parties is a matter which can be \nconsidered only at the trial or in any other appropriate proceeding, but \nprima facie it goes without saying that the first respondent, in any event, \nwas entitled to sell also his own products from the said outlets.  The parties \nfor the said purpose thought of remaining mutually dependent as it was \nstipulated that while also competing with each other they would see to it \nthat by action of one, the other is not harmed at least while exporting the \nmaterials.  It is, thus, not a case where the appellant having taken advantage \nof the terms of the MOU had resiled therefrom and in that view of the \nmatter the principle of estoppel cannot be said to have any application in \nthe instant case.  \n",

The right to manufacture \nmasala and to sell the same with the registered logo, it will bear repetition \nto state, was assigned as far back in 1991.

It was in the peculiar factual background obtaining \ntherein, this Court, referred to the decision of Lord Esher in Pinto v. \nBadman [8 RPC 181] to say that where a distinctive label is registered as a \nwhole such registration cannot possibly give any exclusive statutory right \nto the proprietor of the trade mark to the use of any particular word or name \ncontained therein apart from the mark as a whole.  This Court in the \naforementioned factual backdrop opined:\n\"This, as we have already stated, is not quite \ncorrect, for apart from the practice the Registrar \ndid advert to the other important consideration, \nnamely, that on the evidence before him and the \nstatement of counsel it was quite clear that the \nreason for resisting the disclaimer in this particular \ncase was that the Company thought, erroneously \nno doubt but quite seriously, that the registration of \nthe trade mark as a whole would, in the \ncircumstances of this case, give it a right to the \nexclusive use of the word \"Shree\" as if separately \nand by itself it was also its registered trade mark \nand that it would be easier for it to be successful in \nan infringement action than in a passing off action. \nIt was precisely the possibility of such an \nextravagant and untenable claim that called for a \ndisclaimer for the purpose of defining the rights of \nthe respondent company under the registration\"\n",

It is also \npossible that the defendant may be using the plaintiff's mark, the get up of \nthe defendant's goods may be so different from the get up of the plaintiff's \ngoods and the prices also may be so different that there would be no \nprobability of deception of the public.

While an action for \npassing off is a Common Law remedy being in \nsubstance an action for deceit, that is, a passing off \nby a person of his own goods as those of another, \nthat is not the gist of an action for infringement. \nThe action for infringement is a statutory remedy \nconferred on the registered proprietor of a \nregistered trade mark for the vindication of the \nexclusive right to the use of the trade mark in \nrelation to those goods\" (Vide Section 21 of the \nAct). The use by the defendant of the trade mark of \nthe plaintiff is not essential in an action for passing \noff, but is the sine qua non in the case of an action \nfor infringement. No doubt, where the evidence in \nrespect of passing off consists merely of the \ncolourable use of a registered trade mark, the \nessential features of both the actions might \ncoincide in the sense that what would be a \ncolourable imitation of a trade mark in a passing \noff action would also be such in an action for \ninfringement of the same trade mark\n\n\nIn Poddar Tyres Ltd. v.

However, an interim order as prayed for \ntherein was not granted.  A First Information Report was also lodged \nagainst the respondents by the appellant-Company before the Madhupura \nPolice Station for commission of an alleged offence under Section 63 of the \nCopyright Act and Sections 78 and 79 of the 1958 Act as well as Sections \n417, 420, 419 and 486 of the Indian Penal Code.  An application for \nquashing the said complaint was filed before the Gujarat High Court on \n4.8.1999.  It was dismissed by an order dated 26.10.1999.  A Special Leave \nPetition preferred thereagainst being SLP (Crl.) No. 3900 of 1999 was also \ndismissed by this Court by an order dated 14.12.1999.  In the meanwhile, a \nrectification application was filed by the respondents before the Registrar \nof Trade Mark, Mumbai allegedly stating that the registered trade mark \nbearing No. 447700 was not being used by the plaintiff, it was not entitled \nto continue to claim title thereover or use the same.  Various applications \nwere moreover filed by the respondents herein for rectification of the entry \nin the register in respect of various label marks of the appellant.  The \nappellant thereafter issued a public notice on 17.12.1999 calling upon the \nrespondents to restrain themselves from infringing upon the trade mark of \nthe appellant, in respect whereto a public notice was also issued by the \nrespondents herein on 21.12.1999.  The suit thereafter was filed on \n10.2.2000.  Contention of the respondents in this behalf was that not only in \nterms of the MOU the appellant had been allowed to carry on business \nunder the name and style of 'Ramdev Masala', no immediate step having \nbeen taken after issuance of the public notice dated 15.12.1998 for long \ntime, they were not entitled to obtain an order of injunction.  Delay in some \ncases may defeat equity but the chronology of events noticed hereinbefore \ndo not suggest that the appellant's consciously allowed the respondents to \nuse the trade mark.  \n",

It had to wait for the outcome of various proceedings \npending before different courts.  The respondents having themselves taking \nrecourse to judicial proceedings, as noticed hereinbefore, cannot now be \npermitted to set up the defence of acquiescence on the part of the appellant.  \nIndisputably, in a case of infringement of trade mark, injunction would \nordinarily follow where it is established that the defendant had infringed the \ntrade mark and had not been able to discharge its burden as regard the \ndefence taken by it.\n",

Use by either the registered proprietor \nor a licensee (whether registered or otherwise) will \nprotect the mark from attack on the ground of non-\nuser, but it is essential both that the user maintains \nthe connection of the registered proprietor with the \ngoods and that the use of the mark does not \nbecome otherwise deceptive.  Conversely, \nregistration of a registered user will not save the \nmark if there ceases to be the relevant connection \nin the course of trade with the proprietor or the \nmark otherwise becomes deceptive.\"\n",

        "p_214": " \tOur attention has been drawn to the right of the parties of the second \nand third part of the MOU to carry out export business in the brand name of \n'Ramdev' which, in our opinion, does not advance their case as by reason \nthereof, the appellant-Company had been also conferred right to carry on \nthe export business in the name of 'Ramdev'.\n",

Respondents did not have any right over the trade mark.  They \nin fact, it will bear repetition to state, assigned the same in favour of the \nappellant-Company.  They have assigned the said trade mark and having \nrelinquished their right, Respondents, thus, now cannot fall back on Section \n33 of the 1958 Act.  It may be true that there exists a distinction between a \nsuit in a trade mark action against the whole world and a suit for \nimplementation of division of assets amongst the members of the family. \nBut, after the MOU was entered into the parties having separated ceased to \nbe members of a joint family.

The appellant has raised a triable issue.  The \nsame by itself although may not be sufficient to establish a prima facie case \nbut in view of our findings aforementioned, we are satisfied that the \nappellant has been able to establish existence of a legal right in itself and \nviolation of the registered trade mark on the part of the respondents.

An injunction can also be \ngranted against the respondents to use the corporate name.\n\tRelief by way of interlocutory injunction would be material in a suit \nfor infringement of trade mark.

With the passage of time and reputation \nacquired, the trade mark 'Kirloskar' has acquired \nthe secondary meaning and has become almost a \nhousehold word.

In\n      the year 1999, it adopted the trademark ORZID which is used\n      with respect to the appellant\u201fs pharmaceutical preparations\n      having active ingredient CEFTAZIDINE and the said mark\n      became popular among the medical fraternity. On 06.9.1999,\n      the appellant filed application No.874808 for registration of\n      trade mark ORZID with respect to medical and pharmaceutical\n      preparations.        This application was advertised in the Trade\n      Marks      Journal    No.1291     (S)     dated      13.3.2003         and   got\n      registration of the mark unopposed. The appellant commenced\n      use of the trademark upon goods with effect from May, 1999.\n      It was, thus, claimed that being prior user and prior registered\n      proprietor, the use by any person, an identical or any other\n      mark deceptively similar thereto would amount to infringement\n      of   the    appellant\u201fs    registered         trademark.        As     per   the\n\n\n\nLPA No.679 of 2011                                                 Page 3 of 40\n       respondent, it came to know about the trademark FORZID of\n      the appellant in respect of medicinal and pharmaceutical\n      preparations in September, 2007 which according to the\n      respondent was slavish imitation of the respondent registered\n      trademark. The respondent No.1, thus, filed a civil suit in C.S.\n      No.1027 2007 in the High Court of Madras seeking permanent\n      injunction restraining the appellant to use that trademark\n      which amounted to infringement of registered trade mark and\n      from passing off its goods as that of respondent.          Ex parte\n      injunction was granted on 22.11.2007.          However thereafter,\n      this the respondent filed OA No.187 of 2008 seeking interim\n      injunction against passing off.         While this application was\n      pending adjudication, the respondent also filed the aforesaid\n      application for rectification before the IPAB. In the reply filed\n      by the appellant to the said application, the appellant also\n      claimed to be part of the famous United Group of Companies\n      and is one of the fastest growing companies in the Indian\n      Pharmaceutical Industry, incorporated under the Companies\n      Act, 1956 in the year, 1997 and had established a great\n      reputation     by   adopting   latest   manufacturing    techniques\n      introducing world class quality products, ground braking R & D\n      efforts in association with its foreign counterparts and for\n      setting new standards of customer service.\n",
        "p_4": "4.    The plea of the appellant regarding trademark FORZID was\n      that this trademark was adopted in the year, 2001 and the\n      registration of trademark for its pharmaceutical preparations\n      and obtained registration of the trademark unopposed under\n      No.1144258 dated 18.10.2002.             It was stated that the\n      appellant is continuously and extensively using the same and in\n      the year 2006-07, the sale of goods under this trademark was\n\n\n\nLPA No.679 of 2011                                       Page 4 of 40\n       `229.51 lacs.    According to the appellant, the trademark\n      FORZID is an invented word coined by the appellant. The mark\n      is adopted from the words FORceftaZIDime, where the suffix\n      \u201eZID\u201f was adopted from the word Ceftazidime, which is the\n      medicinal ingredients of the drug and thus and such an\n      adoption ought to have been also protected under Section 35\n      of the Act. Furthermore, several manufacturers of Ceftazidime\n      injections were using trademarks with the suffix \u201eZID\u201f, such as\n      OZID, IZID, INDOZID, KEMZID, MANZID, MEGZID, MYZID,\n      NICZID, etc.     Moreover, the appellant\u201fs product FORZID\n      injection is a Schedule \u201eH\u201f drug, which can be sold only on the\n      written prescription of a registered medical practitioner.     The\n      appellant\u201fs product FORZID is always prescribed by a doctor\n      based on the ailments suffered by a patient and is dispensed\n      with by a qualified druggist and chemist.    This fact was also\n      wrongly not considered in favour of the appellant.\n",
        "p_5": "5.    The appellant had also narrated about the orders passed by the\n      Madras High Court whereby ex parte stay was granted in\n      favour of the respondent was vacated by way of speaking order\n      and the appeal against that order was also dismissed by the\n      Division Bench of the Madras High Court and the plea of delay\n      was taken up.\n",

It held that the trademark FORZID was\n      deceptible similar to the earlier trademark ORZID in respect of\n      some pharmaceutical products.      Position in law was stated,\n      viz., a trademark cannot be registered if it is of such nature as\n      to deceive the public or cause confusion or it is similar with an\n      earlier trade mark and goods covered by the trademark are\n\n\n\nLPA No.679 of 2011                                    Page 5 of 40\n       similar, the IPAB quoted from the judgment of the Supreme\n      Court in Amritdhara Pharmacy Vs.

        "p_7": " 7.    It was also held that the appellant adopted the trademark\n      FORZID with dishonest and mala fide intention and had even\n      set up a false claim of user date. The IPAB also rejected the\n      plea on delay, laches and acquiescence.        Discussion on these\n      aspects is as under:\n",
        "p_8": "8.    Consequently, the rectification application was allowed.\n",
        "p_9": "9.    Before the learned Single Judge, arguments were substantially\n      the same. The learned Single Judge first took up the issue of\n      deceptive similarity between the two competing marks FORZID\n      and ORZID. According to the learned Single Judge, no doubt,\n      the word \u201eZID\u201f which was common to both FORZID and ORZID\n      was     derived    from     active   pharmaceutical      ingredient\n      CEFTAZIDIME. However, while comparing the two trademarks\n      as a whole, it was clear that FORZID is nothing but ORZID\n      prefixed by a soft consonant \u201eF\u201f.     This meant prefixing of the\n      letter \u201eF\u201f failed to distinguish FORZID sufficiently from ORZID\n      so as not to cause deception or confusion in the mind of an\n      average customer holding that the two competing marks were\n      to be compared as a whole which was the rule of dissection of\n      mark is an exception which is not generally permitted, in the\n      present case, IPAB applied a correct test. The learned Single\n      Judge also discussed in detail the principle of law laid down in\n      Cadila Health Care Limited (supra) case, viz., \"more\n      regress    test\"   in     deciding   the   matters     relating    to\n      pharmaceuticals with preparations and observed as under:\n",
        "p_10": "10.   Following dicta from the judgment of the Apex Court in\n      Gujarat Bottling Co. Ltd. and Others Vs. Coca Cola Co.\n      and Others, (1955) 5 SCC 545 also brings home the point\n      candidly:\n",
        "p_11": "11.   Section 11 of the Act becomes significant in the process.            It\n      uses the expression earlier \"trademark\" and not \"earlier\n      registered trademark\".      As per Section 2 (z) (b) of the Act,\n      therefore,     phonetic   similarity   could   be   compared     while\n      examining the case of the confusion. It is for this reason, we\n\n\nLPA No.679 of 2011                                        Page 10 of 40\n       have earlier observed that the arguments proceed on wrong\n      premise.\n",
        "p_12": "12.   Brushing aside the arguments of the learned counsel for the\n      appellant that the respondent could not have successfully\n      asked for rectification, as respondent\u201fs registration was only for\n      a label mark, the learned Single Judge observed that the\n      judgment by the Supreme Court in the case of Ramdev Food\n      Products Ltd. Vs. Arvindbhai Rambhai Patel, AIR 2006 SC\n      3304 was a complete answer to this argument.           The learned\n      Single Judge also rejected the contention of the appellant that\n      in view of orders of the Madras High Court vacating the interim\n      injunction, IPAB has passed the impugned order on the\n      principles of comity of jurisdiction, observed that in forming an\n      opinion at the time of deciding interim injunction only prima\n      facie conclusion is arrived at.\n",
        "p_13": "13.   Dismissing the application for modification preferred by the\n      appellant, vide orders dated 09.9.2011, the learned Single\n      Judge, in the first instance, clarified that the plea of prior\n      permission of the High Court of Madras High Court was not\n      pressed when the writ petition was finally heard.        However,\n      counsel for the appellant had necessitated that this plea be\n      taken on merits as it goes to the root of the matter.       It was\n      noted by the learned Single Judge that when the application for\n      interim injunction was dismissed and ex parte stay vacated by\n      the Madras High Court as far as infringement of trademark\n      ORZID, the appellant thereafter filed application to restrain the\n      appellant from passing off its pharmaceutical preparation using\n      the trade mark FORZID. This application as dismissed by the\n      learned    Single   Judge   on    30.4.2008.   Prior   thereto   on\n      11.3.2008, the respondent filed a rectification application\n\n\n\nLPA No.679 of 2011                                     Page 11 of 40\n       before the IPAB.         Consequently, when the respondent filed\n      appeal before the Division Bench, the rectification application\n      was already pending before the IPAB.           The appellant, at this\n      stage, could not point out to the Division Bench that the\n      rectification application could not have been filed by the\n      respondent before the IPAB to dispose of the rectification\n      application on or before 16.10.2008.          From this, the learned\n      Single Judge has drawn the inference with the appellant\n      accepted       the   maintainability   of   respondent\u201fs   rectification\n      application before the IPAB and in any case, the aforesaid\n      order of the Division Bench amounted to imply permission for\n      the purposes of Section 124 (1)(b)(ii) of the Act. That was a\n      reason, this point was not urged by the IPAB or even before\n      the learned Single Judge in the first instance. Another reason\n      given by the learned Single judge is as under:\n",
        "p_14": "Re:   Maintainability   of  Rectification  Petition  without\n      obtaining specific permission of the Madras High Court\n      under Section 124(1)(b) of the Trademark Act:\n",
        "p_15": "14.   Section 124 of the Act reads as under:\n",
        "p_16": "15.   This provision deals with stay of proceedings in civil suit where\n      validity of registration of trademark is questioned.        However,\n      proceedings for rectification in this behalf are pending before\n      the Registrar or the IPAB, the Court trying the suit shall stay\n      the suit pending final proceedings. If no such proceedings are\n      pending and the Court is satisfied that plea regarding the\n      invalidity of the registration of the plaintiffs or defendants\n      trademark is prima facie tenable, the Court has to first to\n      frame the issue and adjourn the case for a period of three\n      months from the date of the framing of the issue in order to\n      enable   the   party   to   apply   to   the   Appellate   Board    for\n      rectification of the register.   Under sub-section (2) of Section\n      124 of the Act, stay of the suit can be extended until the final\n      disposal of the rectification proceedings. Interpreting this\n      provision, a learned Single Judge of this Court in the case of\n      Astrazeneca UK Ltd. & Anr. Vs. Orchid Chemicals &\n      Pharmaceuticals Ltd., 2006 (32) PTC 733 (Del.) held that\n      application for rectification could not be filed without showing\n      and obtaining prima facie satisfaction of the Court about their\n      plea of the invalidity of the registration of the mark.             The\n      discussion in this behalf is in Paras 28 to 32.             We may\n      reproduce Paras 30 to 32 for out benefit. These paras are as\n      under:\n",
        "p_17": "16.   We may also record that the Gujarat High Court in the case of\n      Patel Field Marshal Agencies Vs. P.M. Diesels Ltd., 1999\n      PTC (19) 718 has taken the same view.             Even the aforesaid\n      view has been upheld by the Division Bench of this Court and\n      the judgment is reported as Astrazeneca UK Limited and\n      Anr. Vs. Orchid Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals Ltd. 2007\n      (34) PTC 469.\n",
        "p_18": "17.   Thus, insofar as this Court is concerned, it has taken the view\n      that the permission under Section 124 (b) of the Act is\n      mandatory and if the proceedings are filed without obtaining\n      such a permission, those would not be maintainable.\n",
        "p_19": "18.   The situation as hand, of course, is not that simple.                  The\n      matter has been complicated because of the reason that the\n      Division Bench of Madras High Court has taken contrary vie in\n      the case of B. Mohamed Yousuff Vs. Prabha Singh\n\n\nLPA No.679 of 2011                                          Page 18 of 40\n       Jaswant Singh, rep. by its Power of Attorney Mr. C.\n      Raghu and Ors., MIPR 2007 (1) 107 holding that neither any\n      such leave of the Court was required nor the Court is to frame\n      issue and record prima facie satisfaction thereupon, before\n      filing application for rectification. Raison d\u201fter for holding this\n      view is explained by the Division Bench of the Madras High\n      Court in the following words:\n",
        "p_20": "19.   In normal circumstances, the answer to be given was simple,\n      viz., this Division Bench is bound by the view taken by the\n      coordinate Bench of this Court and not the Madras High Court.\n      However, the matter becomes complicated because of the\n      reason that the respondent has filed a suit in the Madras High\n      Court. Had the respondent approached the Madras High Court\n      for framing of the issue, recording prima facie view and\n      seeking permission, having regard its own judgment in the\n      aforesaid case, the Court would have said that no such\n      permission is required.       On the other hand, the appellant\n      argues that since circuit Bench of IPAB in Delhi dealt with the\n      rectification application, due compliance of Section 124(b) was\n      mandatory, as this Bench would be bound by the decision of\n      this Court in Astrazeneca UK ltd. And Anr (supra). Learned\n      counsel for the appellant also referred to the reasoned\n      judgment of IPAB with the Circuit Bench sitting in Delhi in the\n      case of Kamadhenu Realtors Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Kamadhenu\n\n\n\nLPA No.679 of 2011                                          Page 20 of 40\n       Ispat Limited & Anr., 2011 (46) PTC 93 (IPAB) where the\n      IPAB followed the decision of this Court in Astrazeneca UK\n      ltd. And Anr (supra).\n",
        "p_21": "20.   Taking into consideration the position mentioned in the\n      preceding paragraph, even when we proceed on the basis that\n      IPAB was bound to follow the Division Bench judgment of this\n      Court, the effect of that would have been to insist the\n      respondent to seek compliance of Section 124(b) of the Act by\n      filing application in the Madras High Court. We have to keep in\n      mind that the suit is pending in Madras High Court and it is\n      only the Madras High Court which would have considered such\n      an application. However, even if such an application has been\n      made by the respondent, the Madras High Court would have\n      held that no such permission is required.         Thus, approaching\n      the Madras High for this reason, before filing the rectification\n      application before IPAB would have been an empty formality.\n      IPAB could not have, therefore, rejected the application on the\n      aforesaid ground as the party cannot be directed to resort to\n      the proceedings which may turn out to be infructuous. Had the\n      case been before some other High Court, position would have\n      been different.     In the facts of this case, therefore, we hold\n      that   the     application   could   not   be   dismissed   as   non-\n      maintainable in the absence of specific permission of the\n      Madras High Court under Section 124(1)(b) of the Trademark\n      Act. This is more so when the plea of prior permission of the\n      High Court of Madras was not even pressed when the writ\n      petition was finally heard.\n",

It was submitted by the learned counsel for the appellant that\n      the respondent No.1\u201fs assertion of claiming statutory rights in\n      the word \"ORZID\" (per se) is contrary to the express mandate\n      of Section 17 of the Trademark Act. Argument proceeded on\n      the basis that the registration of respondent No.1 is in respect\n      of trademark ORZID (label mark) and it is only a label which is\n      protected. Section 17 of the Trademark Act reads as under:\n",
        "p_24": "      However, the learned Single Judge has grossly erred in\n      ignoring an important fact that the Ramdev Food Products\n      Ltd. (supra) was decided under the Trade and Merchandise\n      Marks Act, 1958 which did not have a provision analogous to\n      Section 17 of the Trade Mark Act, 1999.               The distinction\n      between the Ramdev Food Products Ltd. (supra) and cases\n      under Section 17 of the Act has been elaborately dealt with in\n      Aravind Laboratories (supra) from Para 25 to 28 of the said\n      judgment. Observations in Para 27 of the impugned judgment\n      is contrary to law.         Para 27 of the impugned judgment\n      discusses the argument that the label mark of respondent No.1\n      does not confer rights over the word \"ORZID\" to respondent\n      No.1. However, while dealing with this argument, the learned\n      Single Judge wrongly relied upon Ramdev Food Products\n      Ltd. (supra).       The learned Single Judge also wrongly relied\n      upon the case of Registrar of Trade Marks Vs. Ashok\n      Chandra Rakhit, AIR 1955 SC 558.

        "p_26": "25.   The entire arguments are on the wrong premise and it\n      proceeds on the basis of common feature of the two marks\n      suffix \"ZID\" and since the respondent has registration and\n\n\nLPA No.679 of 2011                                         Page 25 of 40\n       trade mark \"ORZID\", it cannot bare a part of it, i.e., \"ZID\".\n      What has been seen in a case like this is as to whether the\n      mark \"FORZID\" is deceptively similar to \"ORZID\". That is the\n      test which is to be applied and in a process, it is to be seen as\n      to whether the two marks are structurally and phonetically\n      similar and would cause deception in the minds of consumers.\n      When we judge the matter from this angle, we find ourselves in\n      agreement with the view taken by IPAB as well as the learned\n      Single Judge. Although the mark \"ORZID\" is a label mark, the\n      word mark \"ORZID\" is an essential feature which has been\n      covered by the registration. Therefore, the learned counsel for\n      the respondent appears to be right in his submission on this\n      aspect, which is predicated on the Supreme Court decision in\n      Ramdev Food Products Ltd.

        "p_30": "28.   Numerous judgments were cited by the learned counsel for the\n      appellant to contend that there was no deceptive similarity\n      between the trade mark \"ORZID\" and trade mark \"FORZID\"\n      which are as follows:\n",
        "p_31": "29.   The learned counsel for the respondent argued to the contrary\n      by submitting that but for the soft consonant \"F\" there is no\n      difference between the rival marks.       The marks ORZID and\n      FORZID are structurally and phonetically similar.       The marks\n      are nearly identical to each other. It is misconception that the\n      marks are not identical merely because the suffix ZID is taken\n      from CEFTAZIDIME.         Learned counsel highlighted that the\n      appellant had taken the trademark of the Respondent No.1 and\n      made a cosmetic change which would not be discernible by the\n      public. He also submitted that it was a mala fide adoption of\n      the mark with a view to encash upon the goodwill and\n      reputation of the respondent No.1, which was clear from the\n      fact that the appellant obtained manufacturing license for the\n      use of trade mark FORZID in march, 2002 and filed an\n      application for registration of the mark on 18.10.2002 under\n      No.1144258 in Class-5. The mark was conceived and adopted\n      by the appellant three years after the adoption and use of the\n      nearly identical mark by the respondent No.1. It was, thus, a\n      mala fide and tainted adoption.\n",
        "p_32": "30.   The law on this aspect, where the Courts are called upon to\n      consider the deceptive similarity between the two marks is\n      firmly engraved in a series of judgments pronounced by the\n      Courts in the last half century or more. Many are cited by the\n      learned counsel for the appellant, note whereof is taken above.\n      Judgment of Supreme Court in the case of Cadila Health Care\n      Limited        (supra),   which   deals   with    pharmaceutical\n\n\n\nLPA No.679 of 2011                                     Page 30 of 40\n       preparations,   is   a   milestone   on   law    relating   to   drugs.\n      Application of the principles laid down in this judgment can be\n      found in scores of subsequent judgments of this Court and\n      other High Courts.       The position which emerges from the\n      reading of all these judgments can be summarized in the\n      following manner:\n",
        "p_33": "            In such case, the central issue is as to whether the\n      defendant\u201fs activities or proposed activities amount to a\n      misrepresentation which is likely to injure the business or\n      goodwill of the plaintiff and cause damage to his business or\n      goodwill. To extend this use to answer this, focus has to be on\n      the aspect as to whether the defendant is making some\n      representation in course of trade to prospective customers\n      which is calculated to injure the business or goodwill of the\n      plaintiff thereby causing damage to him.             In the process,\n      difference between the confusion and deception is to be\n      understood. This difference was explained by Lord Denning in\n      \"Difference: Confusion & Deception\" in the following words:\n",
        "p_34": "31.   While        examining   the    question    of   misrepresentation      or\n      deception, comparison has to be made between the two\n      trademarks as a whole. Rules of Comparison was explained by\n      Justice Parker in the following words:\n",
        "p_35": "32.   Following Rules of Comparison can be culled out from various\n      pronouncements of the Courts from time to time.\n",

        "p_38": "40.   The appellant could not successfully pierce through the\n      approach of the two authorities below, which had taken into\n      consideration of the judgments and the test laid down therein\n      and application of the said test in the facts of the present case.\n      In the present LPA, we do not find any cause to take a different\n      view or interfere with these findings of the fact.\n",
        "p_39": "41.   The orders of the learned Single Judge and the Division bench\n      of the Madras High Court were relied upon by the learned\n      counsel for the appellant to contend that it was already held\n      that there was no deceptive similarity between the appellant\u201fs\n      trademark and that of the respondent No.1. This argument is\n      rightly brushed aside by the learned Single Judge holding that\n      those orders were passed in application for interim injunction.\n      While passing such orders, the Court only takes prima facie\n      view of the matter. IPAB, on the other hand, determined the\n      issue finally on the basis of evidence produced before it and in\n      this final determination it was not bound by the tentative\n      observations     which   deciding   the   application    for   interim\n      injunction under Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil\n      Procedure.     The learned Single Judge has also remarked that\n      the two findings of the learned Single Judge of the Madras High\n      Court, viz., two competing marks were phonetically similar and\n      that the respondent No.1 was a prior registered user, were\n      affirmed by the Division Bench of the Madras High Court.\n",

The only factor which weighed, while taking\n      prima facie view and refusing interim injunction was that the\n      dosage of the two drugs and their respective prices were\n      different. We would like to quote from the following judgment\n      in the case of Baker Hughes Limited Vs. Hiroo Khushalani,\n      [1998 PTC (18) 580] where the facet of likelihood of confusion\n      even by the enlightened public was noticed in the following\n      words:\n",

We are, thus, of the opinion that the impugned judgment of\n      the learned Single Judge does not call for any interference, as\n      none of the arguments of the appellant is convincing enough to\n      shake the correctness thereof.

These\nprovisions were incorporated in order to encourage the  culture  of  use  of\ncheques and enhancing the credibility of the instrument.

For our purpose,  Section  142  of  the  Act  is\nrelevant which reads thus:\n",

It  provides  that  notwithstanding  anything\ncontained in the Code,  no  Court  shall  take  cognizance  of  any  offence\npunishable under Section  138  of  the  Act  except  upon  a  \u201ccomplaint  in\nwriting\u201d made by the payee or as the case may be the holder  in  due  course\nof the cheque.  The important question in the instant case is what is  meant\nby  \u2018complaint  in  writing\u2019.   Whether  complaint  should  be  in   writing\nsimpliciter or complaint being in  writing  requires  signature  below  such\nwriting.\n",
        "p_24": "10)   The object and scope of Sections 138 and  142  of  the  Act  has  been\nconsidered by this Court in Pankajbhai Nagjibhai Patel vs. State of  Gujarat\nand Another, (2001) 2 SCC 595.  In that case,  Judicial  Magistrate  of  the\nFirst Class, after convicting an accused for an offence  under  Section  138\nof the Act sentenced him to imprisonment for six months along  with  a  fine\nof Rs.83,000/-  The conviction and sentence were confirmed by  the  Sessions\nJudge in  appeal  and  the  revision  filed  by  the  convicted  person  was\ndismissed by the High Court.  When the SLP was moved, the  counsel  confined\nhis contention to the question whether a Judicial Magistrate  of  the  First\nClass could have imposed sentence of fine beyond Rs. 5,000/- in view of  the\nlimitation contained in Section 29(2) of the Code.  Learned counsel for  the\nrespondent contended  the  decision  of  this  Court  in  K.  Bhaskaran  vs.\nSankaran Vaidhyan Balan, (1999) 7 SCC  510  to  the  effect  that  power  of\nJudicial Magistrate of First Class is limited in the matter  of  imposing  a\nsentence of fine of Rs. 5,000/- is not correct in view of the  non  obstante\nclause contained in  Section  142  of  the  Act.   After  hearing  both  the\nparties, this Court held that Section 138 of the Act provides punishment  as\nimprisonment for a term which may extend to  one  year  or  fine  which  may\nextend to twice the amount of cheque or with both.   Section  29(2)  of  the\nCode contains limitation for a Magistrate of First Class in  the  matter  of\nimposing fine as a sentence or as part of sentence.  After  quoting  Section\n29(2) of the Code as well  as  Section  142  of  the  Act,  this  Court  has\nconcluded thus:\n",
        "p_25": "      8. Thus, the non obstante limb provided in Section 142 of the  NI  Act\n      is not intended to expand the powers of  a  Magistrate  of  the  First\n      Class beyond what is fixed in Chapter III of  the  Code.  Section  29,\n      which falls within Chapter III of the Code, contains  a  limit  for  a\n      Magistrate of the First Class in the matter of imposing a sentence  as\n      noticed above i.e. if the sentence is imprisonment it shall not exceed\n      3 years and if the sentence is  fine  (even  if  it  is  part  of  the\n      sentence) it shall not exceed Rs 5000.\u201d\n\n\n",

The question in that decision  was  whether  a  complaint\nfiled in the name and on behalf of  the  company  by  its  employee  without\nnecessary authorization  is  maintainable.   After  analyzing  the  relevant\nprovisions and language used in Sections 138 and 142(a)  of  the  Act,  this\nCourt held that such  complaint  is  maintainable  and  held  that  want  of\nauthorization can be rectified even  at  a  subsequent  stage.   This  Court\nfurther clarified that the only eligibility criteria prescribed  by  Section\n142 is that the complaint must be by the payee or the holder in due  course.\n This Court held that this criteria is satisfied as the complaint is in  the\nname and on behalf of the appellant-Company.  It was further held that  even\npresuming, that initially there was no authority, still the company can,  at\nany stage, rectify the defect.  It was further held  that  at  a  subsequent\nstage the company can send a  person  who  is  competent  to  represent  the\ncompany and concluded that the complaint could thus not  have  been  quashed\non this ground.\n",
        "p_27": "12)   It is clear that the non obstante clause has to  be  given  restricted\nmeaning and when the section containing the said clause does  not  refer  to\nany particular provisions which intends to  over  ride  but  refers  to  the\nprovisions of the statute generally, it is not permissible to hold  that  it\nexcludes the whole Act and stands all alone  by  itself.   In  other  words,\nthere requires to be a determination as  to  which  provisions  answers  the\ndescription and  which  does  not.   While  interpreting  the  non  obstante\nclause, the  Court  is  required  to  find  out  the  extent  to  which  the\nlegislature intended to do so and the context  in  which  the  non  obstante\nclause is used.  We have already referred to the definition of complaint  as\nstated in Section 2(d) of the Code which provides that the same needs to  be\nin oral or in writing.  The non obstante clause, when it refers to the  Code\nonly excludes the oral part in such definition.\n",
        "p_28": "13)   According to  us,  the  non  obstante  clause  in  Section  142(a)  is\nrestricted to exclude two things only from the Code i.e.  (a)  exclusion  of\noral complaints and (b) exclusion of  cognizance  on  complaint  by  anybody\nother than the payee or the holder in due course.   Section 190 of the  Code\nprovides that  a  Magistrate  can  take  cognizance  on  a  complaint  which\nconstitutes such an offence irrespective of who had made such  complaint  or\non a police report or upon receiving information from any person other  then\na police officer or upon his own knowledge.  Non obstante  clause,  when  it\nrefers  to  the  core,  restricts  the  power  of  the  Magistrate  to  take\ncognizance only on a complaint by a payee or the holder in  due  course  and\nexcludes the rest of Section 190 of the Code.  In other words, none  of  the\nother provisions of the Code are excluded by the said non  obstante  clause,\nhence, the Magistrate is therefore required to follow  the  procedure  under\nSection 200 of the Code once he has taken the complaint of the  payee/holder\nin due course and  record  statement  of  the  complainant  and  such  other\nwitnesses as  present  at  the  said  date.   Here,  the  Code  specifically\nprovides that the same is required to be signed by the complainant  as  well\nas the witnesses making the statement.  Section 200 of the Code reads thus:\n",
        "p_29": "      Provided further that if the Magistrate makes over the case to another\n      Magistrate under section 192 after examining the complainant  and  the\n      witnesses, the latter Magistrate need not re-examine them.\u201d\n\nMere presentation of the complaint is only the first step and no action  can\nbe taken unless the process of verification  is  complete  and,  thereafter,\nthe Magistrate  has  to  consider  the  statement  on  oath,  that  is,  the\nverification statement under Section 200 and the statement of  any  witness,\nand the Magistrate has to decide  whether  there  is  sufficient  ground  to\nproceed.  It is also relevant to note Section 203 of the  Code  which  reads\nas follows:\n",

        "p_31": "      Every summons issued by a court under this Code shall be  in  writing,\n      in duplicate, signed by the presiding officer of such court or by such\n      other officer as the High Court  may,  from  time  to  time,  by  rule\n      direct, and shall bear the seal of the court.\n",
        "p_32": "      3 70. Form of warrant of arrest and duration.\n",
        "p_33": "      (1) Every warrant of arrest issued by a court under this Code shall be\n      in writing, signed by the presiding officer of such  court  and  shall\n      bear the sea] of the court.\n",
        "p_34": "      (2) Every such warrant shall remain in force until it is cancelled  by\n      the Court which issued it, or until it is executed.\n",
        "p_35": "5 154. Information in cognizable cases.\n",
        "p_36": "      (1)   Every information relating to the  commission  of  a  cognizable\n      offence, if given orally to an officer in charge of a police  station,\n      shall be reduced to writing by him or under his direction, and be read\n      over to the informant; and every such information,  whether  given  in\n      writing or reduced to writing as aforesaid, shall  be  signed  by  the\n      person giving it, and the substance thereof shall be entered in a book\n      to be kept by such officer in such form as the  State  Government  may\n      prescribe in this behalf. \u2026..\n",
        "p_37": "      6 164. Recording of confessions and statements.\n",
        "p_38": "      Xxx xxxx\n      (4) Any such confession shall be recorded in the  manner  provided  in\n      section 281 for recording the examination of  an  accused  person  and\n      shall  be  signed  by  the  person  making  the  confession;  and  the\n      Magistrate shall make a memorandum at the foot of such record  to  the\n      following effect-\n",
        "p_39": "      7 281. Record of examination of accused.\n",
        "p_40": "      (1) Whenever the accused is examined by a Metropolitan Magistrate, the\n      Magistrate shall make a memorandum of the substance of the examination\n      of the accused in the language of the court and such memorandum  shall\n      be signed by the Magistrate and shall form part of the record\u2026..\u201d\n\n\n\n\nA perusal of the above shows that the legislature has  made  it  clear  that\nwherever it  required  a  written  document  to  be  signed,  it  should  be\nmentioned specifically in the section itself, which  is  missing  both  from\nSection 2(d) as well as Section 142.\n",
        "p_41": "14)   The General Clauses Act, 1897 too draws a distinction between  writing\nand signature and defines them separately.  Section 3(56) defines  signature\nand Section 3(65) defines writing which reads thus:\n",
        "p_42": "      56. \"Sign\" with its grammatical variations  and  cognate  expressions,\n      shall, with reference to a person who is unable  to  write  his  name,\n      include,  \"mark\",  with  its   grammatical   variation   and   cognate\n      expressions,\n\n\n",
        "p_43": "      65. Expressions referring to \"writing\" shall be construed as including\n      references to printing, lithography, photography and  other  modes  of\n      representing or reproducing words in a visible form,\u201d\n\nWriting as defined  by  General  Clauses  Act  requires  that  the  same  is\nrepresentation or reproduction of \u201cwords\u201d in a visible  form  and  does  not\nrequire signature.  \u201cSignature\u201d within the meaning  of  \u201cwriting\u201d  would  be\nadding words to the section which the legislature did not contemplate.\n",
        "p_44": "15)   In the case on hand, the complaint was presented in person on June  3,\n1998 and on the direction by the Magistrate, the complaint was  verified  on\nJuly 30, 1998 and duly signed by the authorized officer of  the  Company-the\ncomplainant.  As rightly pointed out by the  Division  Bench,  no  prejudice\nhas  been  caused  to  the  accused  for  non-signing  the  complaint.   The\nstatement made  on  oath  and  signed  by  the  complainant  safeguards  the\ninterest  of  the  accused.   In  view  of  the  same,  we  hold  that   the\nrequirements of Section 142(a)  of  the  Act  is  that  the  complaint  must\nnecessarily be in writing and the complaint can be presented  by  the  payee\nor holder in due course of the cheque and it  need  not  be  signed  by  the\ncomplainant.   In  other  words,  if  the  legislature  intended  that   the\ncomplaint under the Act, apart from being in writing, is  also  required  to\nbe signed by the complainant, the  legislature  would  have  used  different\nlanguage and inserted the same at the appropriate place.   In  our  opinion,\nthe correct interpretation would be that the complaint under Section  142(a)\nof the Act requires to be in writing as at the time  of  taking  cognizance,\nthe Magistrate will examine the complainant on  oath  and  the  verification\nstatement will be signed by the complainant.\n",
        "p_45": "16)   It is the contention of Mr. Bhagwati Prasad,  learned  senior  counsel\nfor the appellant  that  the  limitation  period  expired  on  the  date  of\nverification and the complaint cannot be entertained.  In view of the  above\ndiscussion, we are unable to accept the said contention.\n",
        "p_46": "17)   In Japani Sahoo vs. Chandra Sekhar Mohanty, (2007) 7 SCC 394, in  para\n48, this Court held that \u201cso far as the complainant is  concerned,  as  soon\nas he files a complaint in a competent court of law, he has done  everything\nwhich is required to be done by him at that stage.  Thereafter,  it  is  for\nthe Magistrate to consider the matter to apply  his  mind  and  to  take  an\nappropriate decision of taking cognizance,  issuing  process  or  any  other\naction which the law contemplates\u201d.   This  Court  further  held  that  \u201cthe\ncomplainant  has  no  control  over  those  proceedings\u201d.   Taking  note  of\nSections 468 and 473 of the Code, in para 52, this Court held that \u201cfor  the\npurpose of computing the period of limitation, the  relevant  date  must  be\nconsidered as the date of filing of the  complaint  or  initiating  criminal\nproceedings and not the  date  of  taking  cognizance  by  a  Magistrate  or\nissuance of process by a Court\u201d.\n",
        "p_47": "18)   In the light of the scheme of the Act and various  provisions  of  the\nCode, we fully endorse the above view and hold that  the  crucial  date  for\ncomputing the period of limitation is the date of filing  of  the  complaint\nor initiating criminal proceedings and not the date of taking cognizance  by\nthe Magistrate.  In the case on hand, as pointed out earlier, the  complaint\nwas filed on June 3,  1998  which  is  well  within  the  time  and  on  the\ndirection  of  the  Magistrate,  verification   was   recorded   by   solemn\naffirmation by authorized  representatives  of  the  complainant  and  after\nrecording the statement and securing his signature, the  learned  Magistrate\npassed an order issuing summons against the accused under  Sections  138/142\nof the Act.\n",
        "p_48": "19)   In  the  light  of  the  above  discussion,  taking  note  of  various\nprovisions of the Act and the Code which we have  adverted  above,  we  hold\nthat the complaint under  Section  138  of  the  Act  without  signature  is\nmaintainable when such complaint is verified  by  the  complainant  and  the\nprocess  is  issued  by  the  Magistrate  after   due   verification.    The\nprosecution of  such  complaint  is  maintainable  and  we  agree  with  the\nconclusion  arrived  at  by  the  Division  Bench   of   the   High   Court.\nConsequently, both the appeals fail and are dismissed.\n",
