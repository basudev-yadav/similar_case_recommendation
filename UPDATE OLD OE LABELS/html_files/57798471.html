<p id="p_1">1.       Though at first blush the plot and premise of the Roche Vs. Cipla
dispute appears to be straightforward - Roche claims that on March 31,
1991, it filed an application for grant of patent in USA pertaining to
Erlotinib Hydrochloride, resulting in grant of patent US ‗498 on August 05,
1998. During pendency of its application in USA, on March 13, 1996 it
filed an application in India for grant of patent for the same molecule which
was granted to it vide IN ‗774 on February 23, 2007. The marketable
physical form of the molecule comprised polymorph A and B. Further
research revealed that polymorph B was more thermodynamic and as per
Roche would qualify for enhanced efficacy and thus on November 09, 2000
it applied for grant of patent for polymorph B of Erlotinib Hydrochloride in
USA resulting in grant of patent US ‗221. Similar application filed in India
on February 06, 2002 i.e. DEL ‗507 was rejected. As per Roche, IN ‗774
granted in February 2007 by the Controller of Patents, per Claim No.1,
covered patent rights over Erlotinib Hydrochloride molecule which has
demonstrated breakthrough capabilities as an Epidermal Growth Factor
Receptor (EGFR) inhibitor which spiked survival benefit in cancer including
non-small cell lung cancer (NSLC) patients.
</p><p id="p_2">2.       The issues which were finally debated before us in the appeal had
various hues. The marathon hearings have resulted in both of us having
before us several pages of manuscripts, bearing encouraging and tactful
notes penned by us, as learned counsel Sh.Pravin Anand who appeared for



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">     RFA (OS) Nos.92/2012 &amp; 103/2012                           Page 2 of 106</span>
 Roche and Sh.Arvind Nigam, Sr.Advocate and Ms.Pratibha M.Singh,
Sr.Advocate who appeared for Cipla laboured through the case law, the
provisions of the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_1">Patents Act</a>, 1970 as amended from time to time, the
pleadings of the parties, the various documents exhibited at the trial and the
deposition of the witnesses of the two parties.       We therefore begin by
adequately thanking them in rendering valuable assistance.            We are
especially indebted to them for their uniform generosity and kindness shown
to us with the most heroic reserve of patience in answering one simple but
endlessly repeatedly question : ‗But could you explain that again?'
</p><p id="p_3">3.       The endless labour by learned counsel, apart from making us
understand the nuances of the law of patent, made us aware of something
probably never highlighted about the Carbon atom. In the atomic world it
would be the party animal, latching on to any atom it finds around it,
including itself, and holding tight, forming molecular change - the very trick
of nature necessary to build proteins and DNA.
</p><p id="p_4">4.       Claiming that it was based on media intelligence declaring Cipla's
intention to launch a generic version of Roche's drug based on IN ‗774, in
January 2008, Roche moved this Court on its original side seeking to injunct
Cipla from marketing Erlocip.
</p><p id="p_5">5.       Roche's plea for interim injunction against Cipla was dismissed by a
learned Single Judge of this Court on March 19, 2008, reported as (2008) 37
PTC 71 (<a href="/doc/123231822/" id="a_2">Del) F Hoffman-La Roche v. Cipla Ltd</a>, with a fascinating
characterization of the public interest involved in, and the life-saving nature
of, the drug in question playing a large part in the evaluation of the
imponderables.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">     RFA (OS) Nos.92/2012 &amp; 103/2012                            Page 3 of 106</span>
<p id="p_6"> 6.       Roche's appeal to the Division Bench of this Court against the order
passed by the learned Single Judge was dismissed on April 24, 2009, on the
back of a heavily public interest-centric reading of the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_3">Patents Act</a>, 1970 as
amended from time to time, and a detailed discussion of the relative
affordability of the two drugs to the common man; and the decision is
reported as (2009) 40 PTC 125 (<a href="/doc/123231822/" id="a_4">Del) F Hoffman-La Roche v. Cipla Ltd</a>.
</p><p id="p_7">7.       On the substantive legal issues, the Division Bench felt that Cipla had
done enough to demonstrate a potentially credible challenge to the validity
of IN ‗774, including raising sufficient doubt over whether IN ‗774 had
complied with full disclosure requirements.
</p><p id="p_8">8.       Roche's subsequent agitation of the matter on special leave before the
Supreme Court was also denied. And the case moved to trial.
</p><p id="p_9">9.       The learned Single Judge has answered two main questions in the
impugned decision: first, whether Roche's IN ‗774 patent stands to be
revoked; and second, whether the Cipla's manufacture of Erlocip infringes
Roche's IN ‗774 patent. Other ancillary issues have also been decided to
which we would be adverting to as we move along.
</p><p id="p_10">10.      The decision of the learned Single Judge on the question of the
validity of Roche's IN ‗774 patent has been largely defied by reference to
Cipla's counter-claim in the suit, which contended that IN ‗774 contains no
inventive step. This was for two main reasons - first, Cipla contended that
the closest prior art to IN ‗774 was Example 51 of EP ‗226 (admitted as
prior art in the IN ‗774 specification) and that the two had extremely
materially similar, if not identical, structures. Cipla pointed to the fact that
not only did the IN ‗774 specification fail to disclose how it was inventive
over Example 51 but also that multiple examples cited in IN ‗774 were



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">     RFA (OS) Nos.92/2012 &amp; 103/2012                              Page 4 of 106</span>
 specifically disclosed in EP ‗226, which was compelling evidence that IN
‗774 was more combination and less innovation. Second, Cipla - claimed
that only meaningful difference between IN ‗774 and Example 51 of EP
‗226 - was the substitution of a methyl group with ethynyl at the third meta
(3') position (This was extended in the technical plane by Cipla to say that
EP „226 teaches a methyl/cyano configuration which anticipates the
methyl/ethynyl substitution on account of a property called bioisosterism
(the cyano and ethynyl groups, in this case, are chemically similar and
produce similar biological properties). - a change so minor and so well
anticipated by prior art that it would be obvious to a person skilled in the art
on account of - a minimum of five prior art teachings, all of which
suggested that the methyl/ethynyl substitution could be affected with no
categorical loss of efficacy.
</p><p id="p_11">11.   Roche's rebuttal to the counter-claim is centered on the comparative
efficacy of IN ‗774 versus Example 51 of EP ‗226, which had been mapped
according to inhibitory concentration, a parameter in reference to which the
nearest prior art reference to IN ‗774 was EP ‗851 and IN ‗774 was
inventive over it. Consequently, argued Roche, Example 51 of EP ‗226,
which was not even in the top five nearest references to IN ‗774 in terms of
inhibitory concentration value disclosed by EP ‗226 should not be treated as
the point of departure in the inventive step analysis. EP ‗226 actually
teaches a methyl/ethynyl substitution at the 6, 7 - position and not at the 3'
position and there are several appreciable differences in bond angle, bond
length and bond strength and the type of reaction with EGFR kinase
between methyl and ethynyl group that make the methyl/ethynyl substitution
ostensibly inventive.

<p id="p_12"> 12.   The weighing of these rival contentions by the learned Single Judge is
preceded by an interesting foreword - he states that no special understanding
of inventive step under the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_5">Patent Act</a>, 1970 is necessary qua pharmaceutical
patents, discarding any reliance on any jurisprudential qualifications of
inventive step for pharmaceutical products in other jurisdictions.           The
learned Single Judge has cast the ‗person skilled in the art' as a competent
craftsman and a skilled worker but nothing further; drawing on the decision
of the Supreme Court reported as AIR 1982 SC 1444 Bishwanath Prasad
Radhey Shyam Vs. Hindustan Metal Industries. Beyond this, any further
characterization of the ‗person skilled in the art' drawn from other
jurisdictions is discarded entirely. This, according to the learned Single
Judge is because reliance on foreign jurisprudence is useful only where the
position expressed in such references is consistent with the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_6">Patent Act</a>, 1970.
This reasoning has resulted in the learned Single Judge to refer to precedents
such as the decision of the England and Wales Court of Appeals reported as
2010 RPC 9 Dr.Reddy‟s Laboratories (UK) Ltd. Vs. Eli Lilly &amp; Co. Ltd. to
support the view that the same standard of obviousness is to be applied to
non-pharmaceutical patents.      The learned Single Judge has quoted an
analysis of the judgment from Roughton et al's : The Modern Law of
Patents, thus : ‗.... (the) patentability of selection inventions is a question of
inventive step whereas the EPO predominantly looks at it as a question of
novelty (and simply applies the normal rules for inventive step‟); and
perhaps a little onerously, such reliance is only justified if the consistency is
a consequence of legislative change in India. On this basis, the learned
Single Judge discards virtually all US and European precedent cited before
him on this issue, cases reported as 1972 RPC 346 Technograph Vs. Mill &amp;



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">  RFA (OS) Nos.92/2012 &amp; 103/2012                                 Page 6 of 106</span>
 Rockley, (1985) RPC 59 Windsurfing International Inc. Vs. Tabur Marine
(Great Britain) Ltd., 1972 RPC 457 General Tire &amp; Rubber Co. Vs.
Firestone, 670 F.Supp.2d 359 Daiichi Sankyo Vs. Matrix Laboratories &amp;
Ors., 550 U.S. 398 (2007) KSR International Co. Vs. Teleflex Inc. among
others being prominent among them, as well as the TSM test, stating that it
raises a semi-presumption of validity whereas no such presumption exists
under the Indian law.
</p><p id="p_13">13.      Interestingly, in creating this India-specific inventive step test which
is based on a joint reading of <a href="/doc/217797/" id="a_7">Section 64</a> and <a href="/doc/65643/" id="a_8">Section 2(ja)</a> of the Patent Act,
1970. the learned Single Judge has identified certain ‗essential ingredients‟
of <a href="/doc/65643/" id="a_9">Section 2(ja)</a> which are to be satisfied for any invention to qualify the
threshold of inventive step. These ingredients listed out by the learned
Single Judge are:-
</p>
<p id="p_14">a)       That the said invention involves a technical advancement as compared
to existing knowledge or economic significance or both; and
</p><p id="p_15">b)       That makes the invention non obvious to the persons skilled in art.
</p><p id="p_16">14.      The learned Single Judge interprets this test to posit that : ‗not merely
there should be a technical advancement in the invention but at the same
time, it should not be obvious to the person skilled in art‟ and rules that both
the requirements are to be satisfied conjunctively and that „beyond the said
two ingredients, there is no further ingredient which should be read into in
order to enlarge or limit the scope of the Section.‟
</p><p id="p_17">15.      Further, for reasons not entirely clear, the disavowal as to foreign
jurisprudence is reinforced by the learned Single Judge by placing reliance
on Roughton et al‟s : The Modern Law of Patents to create a matrix of




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">     RFA (OS) Nos.92/2012 &amp; 103/2012                               Page 7 of 106</span>
 material facts required to be shown by a defendant to prove obviousness in a
revocation inquiry :
</p>
<p id="p_18">a.       The selection of the impugned invention is taken from the examples
of the known prior art.
</p><p id="p_19">b.       That the selected invention is not far removed from the known range
illustrated in the example. Rather, the same is closer to the known range.
c.       That the selection area is not on the basis of any purpose of the
inventor and is merely an arbitrary picking up the compound.
</p>
<p id="p_20">16.      The learned Single Judge has held that the first condition is fulfilled
by Cipla but that the other two are not demonstrated by ‗positive evidence';
and although the learned Single Judge finds that Roche also falls short on
the evidentiary threshold with regard to this issue, he concludes that there
was no onus on them to defend a validity challenge. The learned Single
Judge goes on to suggest that Cipla could have ‗clinically' demonstrated
deviation (even via deposition) and that there was no deposition on Cipla's
behalf pointed at establishing the arbitrariness of selection. (We note here
that the deposition on Cipla‟s behalf stated that there was a possibility of the
desired result by a methyl/ethynyl substitution but no guarantee). On the
latter issue, the learned Single Judge has held that the primary test to be used
is     whether   the   selection   reflected   in   the   invention   was   non-
arbitrary/purposeful and that where this is established, it overrides any
‗inspiration' taken from EP ‗226. Roche's case, in his opinion, was further
helped by the teething problems they encountered with their NSLC
prototype drug Geftinib and consequent improvements thereto incorporated




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">     RFA (OS) Nos.92/2012 &amp; 103/2012                              Page 8 of 106</span>
 into Tarceva, which suggested that the relevant improvements had been
purposeful, not arbitrary.
</p><p id="p_21">17.   One last issue urged by Cipla on the validity question was five patent
specifications cited by Cipla to show that methyl/ethynyl substitution was
well known in prior art.      The learned Single Judge disqualifies these
references for two reasons - one, because they were filed after settlement of
issues in the proceedings and did not meet the requirement that they could
not be filed on account of being outside Cipla's knowledge or resources; and
two, since four of the five patents cited pertained to non-quinazoline
derivatives and the one that did - US ‗534 - quotes a 6, 7 methyl/ethynyl
substitution which is inconsequential per se.
</p><p id="p_22">18.   Apart from this, the learned Single Judge also invokes commercial
success of the drug as an attending circumstance in establishing the
purposefulness of the selection and defends his positive evidence standard as
being necessary to avoid a slippery slope of judging competing products on
the basis of superficial structural similarity. On an overall consideration of
factors, the learned Single Judge - holds that Cipla are unable to meet even a
balance of probabilities to establish revocation.
</p><p id="p_23">19.   The second limb of Cipla's counter-claim - a <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_10">Section 3(d)</a> challenge
to the validity of In ‗774 - was born out of the fact that Roche had
unsuccessfully applied for a ‗Polymorph B' form of Erlotinib Hydrochloride
(DEL ‗507), a claim which was rejected by the Controller of Patents in
December 2008 with findings on evergreening, structural similarities
between IN ‗774 and EP 226 and a lack of conclusive comparative clinical
data to prove efficacy. Nevertheless, the learned Single Judge invokes a
‗positive evidence' standard yet again to rule that Cipla failed to show



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">  RFA (OS) Nos.92/2012 &amp; 103/2012                               Page 9 of 106</span>
 enough evidence to sustain a <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_11">Section 3(d)</a> challenge, since it required them
to prove IN ‗774 is the ‗new form of an old substance' (the ‗old substance'
being EP ‗226).     The learned Single Judge rules against Cipla on the
grounds that none of their witnesses deposed to establish that EP ‗226 and
IN ‗774 are either, in essence, the same substance or that the simple
assertion Example 51 of EP ‗226, through further reaction, can result in IN
‗774 is sufficient to establish ‗new form of an old substance' unless proven
to be contrary. Thus, much against his initial desire to avoid importing
presumptions of validity, the learned Single Judge reconciles the rival claims
by holding that the reaction with a new reactant could create a new form of
an old substance in this case but that it had not been proved by Cipla.
Therefore, given that Roche had established sufficient evidence of
difference in efficacy, it was sufficient certainly for it to be inferred that IN
‗774 was not hit by <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_12">Section 3(d)</a> - even though this was not done through
deposition.
</p><p id="p_24">20.   Several subsidiary challenges to IN ‗774 were also raised by Cipla,
which can all be classified as allegations of suppression and concealments
by Roche. All of them barring one under <a href="/doc/879773/" id="a_13">Section 8</a> have been rejected by
the learned Single Judge. <a href="/doc/879773/" id="a_14">Section 8</a> of the Patents Act, 1970 which lays
down disclosure requirements as to all corresponding foreign patent
applications which appears to have become the single most problematic area
of patent practice in India in recent times following the decision of this
Court reported as (2009) 41 PTC 260 (Del) Chemtura Corporation v Union
of India, which laid down a strict threshold of disclosure and also warns that
inadequacy of disclosure would be a ground to seek revocation of a patent
disclosure. Though the learned Single Judge has not referred to Chemtura,



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9"> RFA (OS) Nos.92/2012 &amp; 103/2012                                 Page 10 of 106</span>
 but he has categorically not revoked IN ‗774, despite holding on facts that :
‗... the plaintiffs as patentee has not disclosed the information as required
by the controller as per <a href="/doc/879773/" id="a_15">Section 8</a> of the Act which is evidence upon from the
examination report dated 22.8.2006 and the responses thereto which do not
record the subsequent patent in US „221 which ought to have been
disclosed. Thus the ground of revocation under <a href="/doc/605275/" id="a_16">Section 64(1)(m)</a> is made
out‟. Despite holding that the ground under <a href="/doc/605275/" id="a_17">Section 64(1)(m)</a> is made out,
the learned Single Jude has chosen to exercise positive discretion in Roche's
favour not to revoke the patent by inferring the existence of such discretion
from the presence of the word ‗may' in the Section.
</p><p id="p_25">21.   On the infringement question, armed with a fairly obliquitous
‗positive evidence' standard, the learned Single Judge has cast the onus to
establish infringement on Roche.
</p><p id="p_26">22.   The decision of the learned Single Judge is a bit hazy with regard to
this issue because of the interchangeable reference by the learned Single
Judge - of Erlotinib Hydrochloride and Tarceva as being covered by IN
‗774. However, this is clarified in reference to the relief claimed, which was
for infringement of rights in the drug Tarceva and also claimed an injunction
restraining the manufacturing and marketing Erlocip.
</p><p id="p_27">23.   Cipla's infringement case was based on the claim that IN ‗774 is for a
mix of Polymorphs A and B of Erlotinib Hydrochloride but Tarceva is just
Polymorph B, which corresponds to US ‗221 (and the rejected DEL ‗507).
</p><p id="p_28">24.   In the absence of clinical tests on record by Roche to compare the
constituents of Roche's and Cipla's drugs and specifically whether Roche's
drug corresponded with the Claim 1 of IN ‗774, it is crucial that Roche
merely led evidence to show that Cipla's drug was also Erlotinib



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10"> RFA (OS) Nos.92/2012 &amp; 103/2012                               Page 11 of 106</span>
 Hydrochloride and claimed that manufacture of Polymorph B by Cipla was
sufficient to trigger infringement of Claim 1 of IN ‗774. (Clearly, it flows in
sequitur that any process involved in making Polymorph B would first
involve the preparation of a combination of Polymorphs A and B; even US
‗221 states that Erlotinib Hydrochloride in Polymorph B form results from
re-crystallization of Erlotinib Hydrochloride using different solvents and
temperature conditions).
</p><p id="p_29">25.   The observations of the learned Single Judge on this aspect are in para
213 of the impugned decision which reads thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      ".... No clinical tests have been placed on record either by
      attorney of the plaintiffs or by the expert of the plaintiffs which
      would show and analyzes as to what are the exact constituents
      of the plaintiffs drug Tarceva and the defendant‟s drug
      ERLOCIP more specifically the question whether the same
      corresponds with the Indian Patent in the entirety or whether
      the same are the Polymorphic version B of the suit patent
      compound.      Rather, the plaintiffs attorney has deposed
      everything on the basis of what has been shown in the physical
      form of literature of the drug of the defendant which only
      demonstrates that it contains Erlotinib Hydrochloride.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_30">26.   On this issue, the learned Single Judge has placed significant reliance
on expert testimony of two kinds - first, on X-ray diffraction tests which
establish that Tarceva is Polymorph B alone and second, that the tablet form
of Erlotinib Hydrochloride does not follow directly from the claims in IN
‗774 (on account of the fact that further reactions of the product from IN
‗774 are required to produce Tarceva).

<p id="p_31"> 27.   This has lead the learned Single Judge to a construction of Claim 1 of
IN ‗774 to understand whether it subsumes Polymorph B of Erlotinib
Hydrochloride, which is admittedly Erlocip.
</p><p id="p_32">28.   It is here that the initial confusion (attributed to Roche in the
judgment) - about whether the comparison of Erlocip is to be with Claim 1
of IN ‗774 or with Tarceva - re-surfaces again in the judgment. Two short
passages from this part of the impugned judgment illustrate this:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">      ―... the Court has to test as to whether the impugned product is
      infringing the patented subject matter especially when there is a
      patent claim on the subject and there is a product which may
      not strictly covered within the patent claim but contains
      something else as well in form of variant or reactants.‖ (para
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      228)

</blockquote><p id="p_33">29.   Yet, later on the same page, the words used are :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      ―However, the question remains whether the said test is
      determinative one even in cases where there exists a patented
      claim for a product and another product which may
      substantially contain the patented product but also contain
      some other variants or some other parts in addition to the
      patented article or product‖ (para 230).
</blockquote>
<p id="p_34">30.   Thus, the learned Single Judge treats a patent claim on the subject
matter interchangeably with patent claim for a product which, in the present
case, refer to distinct things - Claim 1 of IN ‗774 and Tarceva respectively.
</p><p id="p_35">31.   Given this misalignment, it is perhaps not surprising that the learned
Single Judge - looks for aids to claim construction outside the claim
specifications. The rationale is explained in para 231 thus : ‗True, it is that
the Court has to strictly follow what is claimed in the invention and compare




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12"> RFA (OS) Nos.92/2012 &amp; 103/2012                                Page 13 of 106</span>
 it with the product which is alleged to the infringing the patent. But the said
rule of construction is not without an exception. There may arise certain
cases where the product which is alleged to be infringing does not
completely corresponds to what has been claimed in the patented invention
of the product. The product may be seemed to be substantially containing
the patented product but also contain some parts or variants other than the
same also. The courts have in those cases developed a different rule of
construction of the patent claim and specification which is a slight departure
from what has been stated by the plaintiffs in the present case.‟ In the
impugned judgment, this takes the form of purposive construction and the
learned Single Judge goes on to adopt the reasoning in the decision reported
as (1982) RPC 153 Catnic Components Ltd. &amp; Anr. Vs. Hill &amp; Smith Ltd.
approach to purposive claim construction, extended to chemical compounds
in the decision reported as 2004 RPC Merck &amp; Co. Inc. Vs. Generic UK Ltd.
(the learned Single Judge also cites with approval the decisions reported as
1990 FSR 181 Improver Corporation &amp; Ors. Vs. Remington Consumer
Products Ltd. &amp; Ors. and (2005) RPC 9 Kirin-Amgen Vs. Hoechst Marion
Roussel on the issue of claim construction), which advocates giving effect to
‗the real purpose for which the product was invented' and explicitly involves
a substituted judgment as to what the real purpose of the product is.
</p><p id="p_36">32.   The other major substantive holding by the learned Single Judge on
this issue is the adoption of Merck's case (supra) style different thresholds
for obviousness in revocation and in claim construction, based on the reason
that an a fortiori determination of whether a variant can be subsumed within
a broad patent claim is bound to be substantively different (and, presumably,
lower) when compared with the obviousness standard in assessing the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13"> RFA (OS) Nos.92/2012 &amp; 103/2012                                Page 14 of 106</span>
 question of further working on an invention that could revoke it in the
future.
</p><p id="p_37">33.    With these yardsticks laid down, the judgment offers some rather
‗constructive feedback' on what Roche could have done (by way of legal
strategy) and some opinions on why they did not do it and while this is
certainly out of kilter in a patent infringement judgment, it does offer some
priceless insight into the reasoning of the learned Single Judge. According
to the learned Single Judge, Roche could have:
</p><p id="p_38">(i)    Demonstrated that Erlocip is not Polymorph B but the same as
corresponds with IN ‗774 (It is unclear as to whether IN ‗774 here refers to
the claim or product; it is assumed that it refers to the product since if it
referred to the claim, it would have been impossible for Roche to prove).
</p><p id="p_39">(ii)   Demonstrated that the distance between Claim 1 in IN ‗774 and
Tarceva is trivial and therefore Claim 1 should be read purposively to cover
Tarceva in its fold (this would include, inter alia, a better articulation of
what is claimed in the compound, what Polymorph B actually is, the
reactants and process involved in getting from Claim 1 to Polymorph B and
proof that Erlotinib Hydrochloride does not change properties/characteristics
in being converted to Polymorph B).
</p><p id="p_40">34.    Further, the learned Single Judge has ventured to observe that the
reason why Roche did not take route (i) is because they realized that the
description in their own US ‗221 effectively knifes IN ‗774. The reason
they did not take route (ii), the learned Single Judge feels, is because they
did not want to lead evidence in an IN ‗774 infringement suit that effectively
knifes their declarations before the USPTO in US ‗221. From this, the
learned Single Judge infers that the distance between Claim 1 in IN ‗774 and



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14"> RFA (OS) Nos.92/2012 &amp; 103/2012                               Page 15 of 106</span>
 Tarceva is rather significant and, vide Catnic's case (supra) and Merck's
case (supra), would materially affect the working of the product.
</p><p id="p_41">35.      This raises the question of whether the impugned judgment ends up
effectively re-ruling on the reasons behind the Controller's 2008 rejection of
DEL ‗507.        The Controller's order categorically held that increased
thermodynamic stability of Polymorph B fell below the <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_18">Section 3(d)</a>
standard of enhanced therapeutic efficacy but, per the analysis of the learned
Single Judge, the steps in getting to DEL ‗507 from IN ‗774 are clearly
consequential if indeed, the comparison is a direct one between IN ‗774 and
DEL ‗507. Indeed, the learned Judge is genuinely skeptical over the
derivative nature of Tarceva qua IN ‗774. He notes in para 277: ‗How the
same can be termed as inconsequential when the same affects the change in
the property or form of the compound by making it solid, re-crystallized and
pure, how the said reactants do not affect the working of the product
materially when as per the plaintiffs own declaration before US patent office
in US‟221, the said reactions as steps make the compound the stable in
form.'
</p><p id="p_42">36.      Ironically, the knife in the back for the IN ‗774 patent is stuck by its
own equivalent US ‗221 specification documents (which clearly attest to
Polymorph B as the sole efficacious commercial manifestation of Erlotinib
Hydrochloride) and by the fact that the very factum of Roche's application
for DEL ‗507 knifes IN ‗774. On the later issue, the learned Single Judge
has held in para 260 as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">         "In absence of the explanation of the said role either as a
         major or minor reactants coupled with the fact that both in
         India as well as in US, the plaintiffs have applied for the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15"> RFA (OS) Nos.92/2012 &amp; 103/2012                                  Page 16 of 106</span>
       patent for the said process and product separately than the
      underlying compound, the purposive construction of the claim
      and the specification of IN‟774 clearly indicates that the said
      plaintiffs did not intend to include the Polymorphic version B
      in the suit patent IN‟774."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_43">37.   This last bit makes almost certain that if Roche had applied for either
IN ‗774 or DEL ‗507 in isolation or, indeed, DEL ‗507 before IN ‗774, the
learned Single Judge would have found that Erlocip infringed Roche's first
patent.
</p><p id="p_44">38.   At the forefront of the attack of Cipla was the argument that
inventions are required to be product specific; where products have to have
commercial manifestation. Hence, it was argued that since infringement is
relatable to „that product‟ which is patented and not to any ‗substance‟ (as
understood in <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_19">Section 3(d)</a> of the Act); thus it is important to analyse
whether „the product‟ that is patented corresponds with ‗the product‟ that is
being sought to be enforced by Roche against CIPLA i.e. „the product‟ that
Cipla is manufacturing.

<p id="p_55"> 40.    In analyzing <a href="/doc/1348840/" id="a_28">Section 2(1)(j)</a> and <a href="/doc/372733/" id="a_29">2(1)(ja)</a>, Ms.Prathiba M.Singh
learned senior counsel argued that since the threshold for qualifying as an
invention comprises the trinity of: (i) novelty, (ii) inventiveness and (iii)
industrial application, it is possible for something to be new, but if it does
not involve an ‗inventive step‟ or have „industrial application‟ it would not
qualify as an invention. However, learned counsel conceded that if a product
or process arrived upon even per chance, is ‗novel' and involves an
‗inventive step' (i.e. is not obvious) and fulfils the requirement of industrial
application then such a product may satisfy the definition of an ‗invention'.
Learned senior counsel argued that <a href="/doc/372733/" id="a_30">Section 2(1)(ja)</a> is an exhaustive
definition comprising the following broad ingredients:</p><pre id="pre_2">

i)     a feature of an ‗invention' (as defined in Section 2(1)(j))

ii)    that involves

<p id="p_58">41.    The condition laid down in <a href="/doc/372733/" id="a_31">Section 2(1)(ja)</a> that any inventive step of
an invention must not be ‗obvious to a person skilled in the art', qualifies
the entire provision. Therefore, any product or process, even if the same
involves an „inventive step' may not satisfy the requirements of the
provision, if the said inventive step is obvious to a person skilled in the art.
Further, even a feature of the invention may qualify as an inventive step, so
long as the remaining conditions of the provisions are fulfilled.

<p id="p_59"> 42.    <a href="/doc/34802049/" id="a_32">Section 2(1)(ac)</a> stipulates that an invention [as defined in <a href="/doc/1348840/" id="a_33">Section
2(1)(j)</a>] is ‗capable of being made or used in an industry'- thereby
necessitating that an invention must have commercial use or manifestation.
Further, even though an alleged invention may not be a final product, the
same will be patentable only if it has some commercial viability. Thus, it is
not the product which is the focus of attention but the actual physical
substance created which has the potential of a commercial manifestation.
<a href="/doc/34802049/" id="a_34">Section 2(1)(ac)</a> is clearly connected with <a href="/doc/564101/" id="a_35">Section 48</a> as it deals with „made‟
or „used‟ as also „new product‟ [through <a href="/doc/1348840/" id="a_36">Section 2(1)(j)</a> by using the term
„invention‟] which are all used in <a href="/doc/564101/" id="a_37">Section 48</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_60">43.    <a href="/doc/1027057/" id="a_38">Section 2(1)(l)</a> defines a „new invention‟ in an exhaustive manner, and
contains the following ingredients:
</p>
<pre id="pre_3">       a)     any invention or technology

       b)     which has not been anticipated by publication

that it does not form part of the state of the art.
</p>
<p id="p_62">44.    While it may be true that the said term has not been used anywhere in
the Act, however, the relevance of the provision lies in the fact that it gives a
flavour of the intention of the Legislature. Further, <a href="/doc/1027057/" id="a_39">Section 2(1)(l)</a> when read
in conjunction with <a href="/doc/1348840/" id="a_40">Section 2(1)(j)</a> also clarifies as to what is considered to

 invention or technology must not have been previously made or used in
India. It specifies two categories viz., in a ‗document' or in „practice'
wherein an invention may have been anticipated which in turn would result
in such invention not being „new‟ and therefore not „novel‟. It further lays
down that the same should not have fallen into the „public domain‟ or form
part of the „state of the art‟.
</p>
<p id="p_63">45.    <a href="/doc/1034619/" id="a_41">Section 2(1)(m)</a> defines the term „patent‟ and ties within itself various
concepts and definitions, and relates to the requirements of <a href="/doc/1348840/" id="a_42">Section 2(1)(j)</a>
and <a href="/doc/372733/" id="a_43">2(1)(ja)</a> as discussed earlier. <a href="/doc/25696672/" id="a_44">Section 2(1)(ta)</a> defines ‗pharmaceutical
substance' as:
</p>
<pre id="pre_4">       a)     a new entity

       b)     that involves one or more inventive steps.

</pre><p id="p_64">46.    The term ‗new entity‟ would obviously relate to a New Chemical
Entity (i.e. new chemical compounds). Once again we note that in the Act
the said term has not been used anywhere, however, the relevance of the
provision lies in the fact it gives a flavour of the intention of the Legislature.
Further, the provision is also relevant owing to the fact that it a specific
definition pertaining to pharmaceuticals.
</p>
<p id="p_65">47.    <a href="/doc/874310/" id="a_45">Section 3</a> is an ‗exclusionary clause'. The present provision was
expanded by way of the <a href="/doc/187742/" id="a_46">Patents (Amendment) Act</a>, 2005. Despite the fact
that „invention‟ is exhaustively defined, the need for an exclusionary
provision obviously arose from the Legislative intent that as a matter of
policy, due to larger considerations, patents would not be granted to those
specified in <a href="/doc/874310/" id="a_47">Section 3</a>. Therefore, <a href="/doc/874310/" id="a_48">Section 3</a> has to be read as an exception to

<p id="p_69"> 50.      The use of the word „considered‟ shows that this is a fiction being
created for the purpose of excluding those inventions which DO NOT show
enhanced efficacy. Sub section (d) of <a href="/doc/874310/" id="a_55">Section 3</a> lays down that the ‗new form
of a known substance‟ which does not result in ‗enhancement of efficacy' or
‗does not differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacy‟ is not an
invention for the purposes of the Act. It is pertinent to note that the
legislature has ‗considered' salts, esters, ethers, polymorphs, metabolites,
pure form, isomers, mixtures of isomers, complexes, combinations and other
derivatives, to be the ‗same substance‟ for the purposes of this provision.
Thus, the conclusion that may be drawn from a reading of <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_56">Section 3(d)</a>
would be as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">      a. A new form is not the same substance.

<p id="p_70">51. <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_58">Section 3(d)</a> is a deeming provision in a legal sense, but in a technical
sense it cannot be presumed that once the patent/patent application for a
new form of a known substance is rejected/abandoned then the said new
form is covered under a prior patent relating to that substance.
</p>
<p id="p_71">52. Ms.Pratibha M.Singh learned Senior Counsel laid particular emphasis
on what she states is the purpose of <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_59">Section 3(d)</a> i.e. to exclude a class of




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22"> RFA (OS) Nos.92/2012 &amp; 103/2012                                   Page 23 of 106</span>
 products from being patented. She argued that any interpretation of <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_60">Section
3(d)</a> which leads to the conclusion that the product being excluded is
actually being granted a patent, is contrary to the legislative intent. Learned
counsel argued that such an interpretation would run contrary to the very
basis for the enactment of <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_61">Section 3(d)</a> and would result in unfair
monopolies which it sought to curb in the first place. Learned counsel laid
emphasis that it is necessary to bear in mind that a patent is granted as a
quid pro quo i.e. monopoly is granted over certain inventions based on the
disclosure made therein by the patentee. Learned counsel argued that
concededly the basic tests of patentability are: novelty, inventive step and
industrial applicability, and these tests are uniform the world over. As per
learned counsel the law in India has provided for a ‗second tier of
qualifying standards‟ by way of <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_62">Section 3(d)</a> and the same has been done
keeping in mind larger considerations of public welfare. As per learned
counsel <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_63">Section 3(d)</a> has been enacted with a view to curb the problem of
evergreening. Therefore, learned counsel argued that the same should not
be utilized as a tool to enhance the ambit of a patent to cover even those
forms which have either been abandoned by the patentee itself or rejected
in India. The status of the law in different jurisdictions CAN NOT change
the facts underlying the said patent documents and the scope thereof was
the contention advanced.

<p id="p_72">53. It has to be noted that the Act uses the words ‗substance‟ and
‗product‟ in a number of provisions without clearly defining the two. Thus,
while interpreting <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_64">Section 3(d)</a> of the Act one has to keep in mind the three
distinct words: (i) new form, (ii) known substance; and (iii) new product




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">RFA (OS) Nos.92/2012 &amp; 103/2012                                 Page 24 of 106</span>
 used in the Section. In the realm of chemistry, a ‗new product‟ would be
any substance resulting from a chemical change. In the realm of chemistry
‗substance' would be: physical matter of which the thing consists or a
matter of a particular kind of chemical composition. Since we are dealing
with inanimate objects, a product or a substance has to be a veritable being.
Philosophically looked, each inanimate object is, by virtue of its
particularity and its limited and determinable form, different from and
opposite to the genus - the particular contradicting the universal, so that the
later does not fulfill itself in the former. When one talks of a substance
being a veritable being, it would mean a real being, in the strict sense by
which is meant the concrete individual thing. The individual thing is the
subject or substance enduring throughout a movement in which it unifies
and holds together the various states and phases of its existence.          To
illustrate this thought with a practical example, a stone is a being seen in a
determinate form. But when chiseled into a statue we say that a new being
(the statue) has come into existence.

<p id="p_73">54. A peep into foreign jurisprudence for guidance on understanding the
terms may be useful.
</p>
<p id="p_74">55. Under the Australian Patents Act 1990, certain pharmaceutical patents
can be granted a patent term extension if specific criteria are met i.e.
whether or not the claims defined ‗one or more pharmaceutical substances
per se‟. The phrase ‗pharmaceutical substance‟ is defined in Schedule 1 of
the Australian Act as:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">     „A substance (including a mixture or compound of substances)
     for therapeutic use whose application (or one of whose
     applications) involves:

      poison, in a human body;

      in vitro diagnosis or in vitro testing".
</blockquote>
<p id="p_75">56.   The term 'therapeutic use' is, in turn, defined in relation to the
definition of 'pharmaceutical substance' as use for the purpose of:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">      (a) preventing, diagnosing, curing or alleviating a disease,
      ailment, defect or injury in persons; or

      ailment‟.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_76">57.   Europe, too offers patent term extensions to pharmaceutical or
„medicinal products' which are defined in <a href="/doc/498442/" id="a_65">Article 1(a)</a> of Council
Regulation (EEC) No 1768/92 as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">      „Any substance or combination of substances presented for

      physiological functions in humans or in animals.‟

</blockquote><p id="p_77">58.   <a href="/doc/1466013/" id="a_66">Article 1 (b)</a> qualifies that patent term extensions will be granted only
to a „product‟ which is defined as:

<p id="p_78">      „the active ingredient or combination of active ingredients of a
      medicinal product‟.

 reveals that a ‗product‟ represents the genus and ‗pharmaceutical substance‟
represents the species, i.e. a product may have an active ingredient but it
may not therapeutic efficacy. Once it acquires therapeutic efficacy, it
qualifies as a pharmaceutical substance.
</p>
<p id="p_80">60.   Now, let us consider the scheme of the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_67">Indian Patent Act</a> to
understand the scope of the various provisions noted above and their
interplay.
</p>
<p id="p_81">61.   <a href="/doc/874310/" id="a_68">Section 3</a> of the Act lays down a threshold for patent eligibility and is
not an exception to <a href="/doc/1348840/" id="a_69">Section 2(1)(j)</a> as urged by learned Senior counsel for
Cipla. <a href="/doc/1348840/" id="a_70">Section 2(1)(j)</a> provides a theoretical definition of an invention while
<a href="/doc/874310/" id="a_71">Section 3</a> illustratively outlines what are not inventions. In other words, for
subject matter that falls outside the scope of <a href="/doc/874310/" id="a_72">Section 3</a>, a qualitative analysis
needs to be employed to ascertain whether it satisfies the conditions of
<a href="/doc/1348840/" id="a_73">Section 2(1)(j)</a>, while for subject matter that falls within the scope of <a href="/doc/874310/" id="a_74">Section
3</a>, an analysis under <a href="/doc/1348840/" id="a_75">Section 2(1)(j)</a> need not be employed as it will be
rejected at the threshold.
</p>
<p id="p_82">62.   Now, <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_76">Section 3(d)</a> assumes that structurally similar derivatives of a
known ‗substance‟ will also be functionally similar and hence ought not to
be patentable. What is of crucial importance is that this is not a provision
that merely bars certain subject matter from patentability. On the contrary, it
provides that if the new form of the known substance is found despite a
structural similarity to demonstrate a better functionality i.e. ‗enhancement
of the known efficacy‟, it would qualify for assessment under <a href="/doc/1348840/" id="a_77">Section 2(1)(j)</a>
as if it were a new product involving an inventive step and it would
thereafter be up to the applicant for the patent to demonstrate the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26"> RFA (OS) Nos.92/2012 &amp; 103/2012                                 Page 27 of 106</span>
 patentability of this substance in accordance with <a href="/doc/1348840/" id="a_78">Sections 2(1)(j)</a> and (ja).
This provision is not a patent term extension or an evergreening provision
but in fact recognizes incremental innovations in pharmaceutical patents.
The use of the words „product‟ and „substance‟ in <a href="/doc/1348840/" id="a_79">Section 2(1)(j)</a> and
<a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_80">Section 3(d)</a> is therefore telling, in that, the legislative intent appears
clearly to demonstrate that all „substances‟ may not qualify as „products'
under the Act, where the latter are only those substances that are patent-
eligible. In fact, <a href="/doc/25696672/" id="a_81">Section 2(1)(ta)</a> provides the bridge between <a href="/doc/874310/" id="a_82">Section 3</a> and
<a href="/doc/1348840/" id="a_83">Section 2(1)(j)</a>, in that, it defines a ‗pharmaceutical substance‟ as ‗any new
entity involving one or more inventive steps'. Thus, the discovery of an
entity or substance may not involve an inventive step. Insofar as there is no
inventive step involved in its formation it is merely a substance even though
its structural form may be hitherto unknown. A new chemical entity (NCE)
that is structurally dissimilar but functionally similar to an existing chemical
entity is thus merely a substance under <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_84">Section 3(d)</a>. If the substance has an
added layer of enhanced efficacy then it would be treated as a ‗new product‟
and would be eligible for assessment under <a href="/doc/1348840/" id="a_85">Section 2(1)(j)</a> to ascertain
whether its formation involved an inventive step. If the new product
involved one or more inventive steps, then it would qualify as a
pharmaceutical substance. Thus, graphically represented, the same would
be:-

</pre><p id="p_83"> 63.        In chemistry, active moiety is a group of atoms forming part of a
molecule. In the case of a pharmaceutical product, the active moiety is that
part of the molecule of an active substance which gives it its therapeutic
effect. Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are the molecular entities
that exert the therapeutic effects of medicines and are biologically active. A
drug substance invariably refers to the API or component present in the drug
product which is solely responsible for producing the effect of the drug on
the body.
</p>
<p id="p_84">64.        A product essentially comprises a substance (active ingredient) or
composition (combination of active ingredients). A product patent protects
the product in any form however it is made, or however it is formulated.
Many different drug products may be marketed with the same active moiety
and the same product can thus have various structural forms. Thus <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_87">Section
3(d)</a> envisages a variety of derivatives of known substances, some
illustrative types could be as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_85"> A compound which is not active in itself but is metabolized in the body
      to    form      an   active   drug   known       as   prodrug.   For    eg.,
      chloramphenicol succinate ester is used as an intravenous prodrug of
      chloramphenicol, because pure chloramphenicol does not dissolve in
      water.
</p><p id="p_86"> A composition (combination of two or more active ingredients or
      combination of a pharmaceutical carrier with a compound not used as a
      drug before).
</p><p id="p_87"> A drug delivery system which is a composition that its constituents
      enable to be administered in a particular way.

<p id="p_88"> 65.   The view which we have taken is in conformity with the law declared
by the Supreme Court in the decision reported as (2013) 6 SCC 1 Novartis
AG Vs. Union of India, in para 88 whereof it was opined as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_21">      "We have so far seen <a href="/doc/1850559/" id="a_88">Section 3(d)</a> as representing
      „patentability‟, a concept distinct and separate from
      „invention‟. But if Clause (d) is isolated from the rest of <a href="/doc/1850559/" id="a_89">Section
      3</a>, and the legislative history behind the incorporation of
      Chapter II in the Patents act, 1970, is disregarded, then it is
      possible to see <a href="/doc/1850559/" id="a_90">Section 3(d)</a> as an extension of the definition of
      "invention" and to link <a href="/doc/1850559/" id="a_91">Section 3(d)</a> with Clauses (j) and (ja) of
      <a href="/doc/325699/" id="a_92">Section 2(1)</a>. In that case, on reading Clauses (j) and (ja) of
      <a href="/doc/325699/" id="a_93">Section 2(1)</a> with <a href="/doc/1850559/" id="a_94">Section 3(d)</a> it would appear that the Act sets
      different standards for qualifying as „inventions‟ things
      belonging to different classes, and for medicines and drugs and
      other chemical substances, the Act sets the invention threshold
      further higher, by virtue of the amendments made in <a href="/doc/1850559/" id="a_95">Section
      3(d)</a> in the year 2005."
</blockquote><p id="p_89">66.   Before we apply the aforenoted legal position to the facts of the
instant case we need to discuss the legal position concerning construction of
claims. In the decision reported as AIR 1969 Bombay 255 FH &amp; B Vs.
Unichem Laboratories it was held that specifications end with claims,
delimiting the monopoly granted by the patent and that the main function of
a Court is to construe the claims without reference to the specification; a
reference to the specification being as an exception if there was an
ambiguity in the claim. Claims must be read as ordinary English sentences
without incorporating into them extracts from body of specification or
changing their meaning by reference to the language used in the body of the
specification. In a recent decision in FAO (OS) No.190/2013 Merck Vs.
Glenmark the Division Bench held that claim construction to determine the
coverage in the suit patent has to be determined objectively on its own terms



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29"> RFA (OS) Nos.92/2012 &amp; 103/2012                                Page 30 of 106</span>
 with regard to the words used by the inventor and the context of the
invention in terms of the knowledge existing in the industry. Abandonment
of an application cannot remove what is patented earlier nor can it include
something that was excluded earlier and that a patent is construed by the
terms used by the inventor and not the inventors subjective intent as to what
was meant to be covered. Merely because an inventor applies for a latter
patent that is already objectively included in a prior patent, but which
inventor subjectively feels needs a separate patent application, doesn't mean
it is to be taken at face value and therefore neither <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_96">Section 3(d)</a> or
abandonment of subsequent patent application can be used to read into terms
of prior application, which has to be construed on its own terms. In the
decision reported as 415 F. 3d 1303 Edward H.Phillips Vs. AWH
Corporation it was held that claims have to be given their ordinary and
general meaning and it would be unjust to the public, as well as would be an
evasion of the law, to construe a claim in a manner different from plain
import of the terms and thus ordinary and customary meaning of the claim
term is the meaning of the term to a Person Of Ordinary Skill in the Art as of
effective date of filing of the patent application. In case of any doubt as to
what a claim means, resort can be had to the specification which will aid in
solving or ascertaining the true intent and meaning of the language
employed in the claims and for which the court can consider patent
prosecution history in order to understand as to how the inventor or the
patent examiner understood the invention. The Court recognized that since
prosecution is an ongoing process, it often lacks clarity of the specification
and thus is less useful for claim construction. The Court also recognizes that
having regard to extrinsic evidence such as inventor testimony, dictionaries



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30"> RFA (OS) Nos.92/2012 &amp; 103/2012                               Page 31 of 106</span>
 and treaties would be permissible but has to be resorted to with caution
because essentially extrinsic evidence is always treated as of lesser
significance in comparison with intrinsic evidence. In the decision reported
as 457 F.3.1284 (United States) Pfizer Vs. Ranbaxy the Court held that the
statements made during prosecution of foreign applications are irrelevant as
they are in response to unique patentability requirements overseas. The
Court also held that the statement made in later unrelated applications
cannot be used to interpret claims of prior patent. In the decision reported as
1995 RPC 255 (UK) Glaverbel SA Vs. British Coal Corp the Court held that
a patent is construed objectively, through the eyes of a skilled addressee.
The Court also held that the whole document must be read together, the
body of specification with the claims. But if claim is clear then monopoly
sought by patentee cannot be extended or cut down by reference to the rest
of the specification and the subsequent conduct is not available to aid the
interpretation of a written document.
</p>
<p id="p_90">67.     For the above conspectus, pithily put, principles of claim construction
could be summarized as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_91">(i)     Claims define the territory or scope of protection (<a href="/doc/1559634/" id="a_97">Section 10(4)</a> (c)
of the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_98">Patents Act</a>, 1970.
</p>
<p id="p_92">(ii)    There is no limit to the number of claims except that after ten claims
there is an additional fee per claim (1st Schedule of the Act).
</p>
<p id="p_93">(iii)   Claims can be independent or dependent.
</p>
<p id="p_94">(iv)    The broad structure of set of claims is an inverted pyramid with the
broadest at the top and the narrowest at the bottom (Manual of Patents
Office - Practice and procedure).
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31"> RFA (OS) Nos.92/2012 &amp; 103/2012                                  Page 32 of 106</span>
<p id="p_95"> (v)    Patent laws of various countries lay down rules for drafting of claims
and these rules are used by Courts while interpreting claims.
</p>
<p id="p_96">(vi)   One rule is that claims are a single sentence defining an invention or
an inventive concept.
</p>
<p id="p_97">(vii) Different claims define different embodiments of same inventive
concept.
</p>
<p id="p_98">(viii) The first claim is a parent or mother claim while remaining claims
are referred to as subsidiary claims.
</p>
<p id="p_99">(ix)   If subsidiary claims contain an independent inventive concept
different from the main claim then the Patent office will insist on the filing
of a divisional application.
</p>
<p id="p_100">(x)    Subject matter of claims can be product, substances, apparatus or
articles; alternatively methods or process for producing said products etc.
They may be formulations, mixtures of various substance including recipes.
Dosage regimes or in some countries methods of use or treatment may also
be claimed.
</p>
<p id="p_101">(xi)   Where claims are ‗dependent' it incorporates by reference
‗everything in the parent claim, and adds some further statement,
limitations or restrictions'.    (Landis on Mechanics of Patent Claim
Drafting).
</p>
<p id="p_102">(xii) Where claims are ‗independent' although relating to the same
inventive concept this implies that the ‗independent claim stands alone,
includes all its necessary limitations, and is not dependent upon and does
not include limitations from any other claim to make it complete .... An




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32"> RFA (OS) Nos.92/2012 &amp; 103/2012                                Page 33 of 106</span>
 independent Claim can be the broadest scope claim. It has fewer limitations
than any dependent claim which is dependent upon it'.             (Landis on
Mechanics of Patent Claim Drafting)

</p><p id="p_103">(xiii) For someone wishing to invalidate a patent the said person must
invalidate each claim separately and independently as it is quite likely that
some claims may be valid even while some are invalid.
</p>
<p id="p_104">(xiv) At the beginning of an infringement action the Courts in the United
States conduct what is known as a ‗Markman hearing' to define the scope
of the claims or to throw light on certain ambiguous terms used in the
claims. Although this is not technically done in India but functionally most
Judges will resort to a similar exercise in trying to understand the scope and
meaning of the claims including its terms.
</p>
<p id="p_105">In the case of (52 F.3d 967 also 517 US 370) Herbert Markman Vs.
Westview the Courts held that an infringement analysis entails two steps:-
</p>
<p id="p_106">(a)   First step is to determine the meaning and scope of the patent claims
asserted to be infringed.
</p>
<p id="p_107">(b)   Second step is to compare the properly construed claim with the
device accused of infringing.
</p>
<p id="p_108">(xv) The parts of the claim include its preamble, transition phrase and the
body. The ‗transition phrase' includes terms like:-
</p>
<p id="p_109">(a)   Comprising;
</p>
<p id="p_110">(b)   Consisting;
</p>
<p id="p_111">(c)   Consisting essentially of;
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33"> RFA (OS) Nos.92/2012 &amp; 103/2012                                Page 34 of 106</span>
<p id="p_112"> (d)   Having;
</p>
<p id="p_113">(e)   Wherein;
</p>
<p id="p_114">(f)   Characterised by;
</p>
<p id="p_115">Of these terms some are open ended, such as ‗comprising' which means
that if the claim contains three elements ‗A', ‗B' and ‗C' it would still be an
infringement for someone to add a fourth element ‗D'.
</p>
<p id="p_116">Further some terms are close ended such as ‗consisting of', i.e. in a claim of
three elements, ‗A', ‗B' and ‗C' a defendant would infringe if he has all
three elements. In case the defendant adds a fourth element ‗D' he would
escape infringement.
</p>
<p id="p_117">(xvi) Each claim has a priority date so that in a group of claims in a
specification you could have multiple priority dates. This only means that
if a patent application with certain priority date and claims was followed by
another application with different claims and different priority dates, then if
they were consolidated or cognate with another application, each claim
would retain the original priority date [<a href="/doc/1200013/" id="a_99">Section 11(1)</a>].
</p>
<p id="p_118">68.   Applying the aforesaid legal position to the facts of the instant case
we find that Claim 1 of the Suit Patent IN ‗774 (the basic patent) which is
relevant for the present proceedings is:-
</p>

                                                          A"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_119">69.   Ms.Pratibha M.Singh, learned Senior counsel for Cipla argued that
the suit patent IN ‗774 discloses Polymorph A+B of Erlotinib
Hydrochloride, whereas Roche has a separate product patent in USA, i.e. US
‗221 for Polymorph B of Erlotinib Hydrochloride. Furthermore, an
application for the grant of Polymorph B of Erlotinib Hydrochloride
(IN/507/Del) was also filed by Roche in India, but the same was rejected.
Thus, learned counsel argued that the very filing of a separate patent
application is indicative of the fact that Polymorph B of Erlotinib
Hydrochloride is a separate invention. Whether the same is patentable or not
in different jurisdictions does not alter the fact that they are separate
inventions was the advanced limb of the argument.        It was urged that
Polymorph B was neither disclosed, enabled or claimed in the first patent in
any jurisdiction and hence something which came into being later cannot be
argued as being retrospectively covered in an earlier patent.       Learned
counsel urged that admittedly Cipla was manufacturing Polymorph B and
therefore it was urged that there cannot be an infringement of IN ‗774.
</p>
<p id="p_120">70.   It is not in dispute that Roche's unsuccessful patent application in
India (DEL ‗507) was indeed for a ‗Polymorph B' form of Erlotinib
Hydrochloride, a claim which was rejected by the Controller of Patents in
December 2008 with observations on ever greening, structural similarities

 between IN ‗774 and DEL ‗507 and a lack of conclusive comparative
clinical data to prove efficacy. We also note that the process claims for
making Polymorph B in DEL ‗507 matured into Patent No. 231102 and only
the product claims pertaining to Polymorph B were refused.

<p id="p_121">71.   However, we find ourselves unable to agree with the arguments of
learned Senior counsel for Cipla on the import of this rejection. As we have
discussed earlier, the purpose of <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_100">Section 3(d)</a> is to encourage incremental
innovation in pharmaceuticals. It lays down a threshold for what subject
matter would qualify as the ‗same‟ or ‗known‟ substance and what would
qualify as a ‗new‟ substance. The purpose of this qualification is that when
something is the same/known substance, then the derivatives of such a
substance as enumerated in the Explanation to <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_101">Section 3(d)</a> would be
covered under the same protection that exists for the known substance
(which could also mean that if the known substance is not covered by a
patent then the derivative would not be covered as well).
</p>
<p id="p_122">72.   By logical extension, if certain subject matter qualifies as a ‗new‟
substance on account of the reasons elaborated in the preceding paragraphs,
then it would be capable of being considered for the grant of a new patent;
separate from the one existing for the known substance. What <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_102">Section 3(d)</a>
certainly does NOT do, is doubly penalize the innovator, which appears to
be the argument advanced by learned senior counsel for Cipla. If          the
argument is to be taken to its logical conclusion, it would mean that a
rejection of a polymorphic version of Roche's existing patented molecule
(i.e. the ‗known substance' in this case) on the anvil of <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_103">Section 3(d)</a> would
also result in effectively permitting all manufacturers of the said polymorph

 from being deemed non-infringers under <a href="/doc/564101/" id="a_104">Section 48</a>. That is in fact not the
import of <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_105">Section 3(d)</a> nor the legislative intent behind the provision.
</p>
<p id="p_123">73.   We understand <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_106">Section 3(d)</a> as a positive provision that in fact
recognizes incremental innovation while cautioning that the incremental
steps may sometimes be so little that the resultant product is no different
from the original. The inherent assumption in this is that an infringement of
the resultant product would therefore be an infringement of the original i.e.
the known substance and by no stretch of imagination can <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_107">Section 3(d)</a> be
interpreted as constituting a defence to infringement.
</p>
<p id="p_124">74.   Hence, while the suit patent covers Erlotinib Hydrochloride (or
polymorphs A+B of the same, if Cipla's contention were to be accepted), the
rejection of the patent application for Polymorph B (DEL ‗507) by the
Indian Patent Office leads to a direct conclusion that there was a lack of
sufficient matter to suggest that Polymorph B qualified as a ‗new product'
for consideration under <a href="/doc/1348840/" id="a_108">Section 2(1)(j)</a> for patentability and should therefore
be regarded for all practical purposes as the old product itself i.e.
Polymorphs A+B.
</p>
<p id="p_125">75.   The matter can be approached from another angle. The suit patent has
two claims of which Claim No.1 is a product patent relating to a new
molecule Erlotinib Hydrochloride.       The ground of anticipation, though
pleaded, was not pressed by Cipla for the reason that the molecule Erlotinib
Hydrochloride was not found in nature nor published in any publication
previous to the priority date. The subject matter of Claim 1 is also not
obvious as it involves an inventive step.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37"> RFA (OS) Nos.92/2012 &amp; 103/2012                                Page 38 of 106</span>
<p id="p_126"> 76.   The complete specification of the suit patent nowhere mentions any
polymorphic form of Erlotinib Hydrochloride and neither is the claim
restricted to any specific polymorphic form.           The chemical structure
describes the manner in which each molecule of the compound exists. Thus,
how many carbon, hydrogen, oxygen or nitrogen atoms exist and how they
are joint to each other is all contained in the chemical structure.
</p>
<p id="p_127">77.   It is an ‗intra'- molecular concept. As opposed to this, the various
molecules may be stacked together in a crystal lattice in a certain
configuration and the said ‗inter'-relationship between the various
molecules results in a certain polymorphic structure. It is possible that a
certain molecule has more than one polymorphic forms which may be
discovered at some future point of time, as was done in the present case.
The present patent does not concern the polymorphic structure or the manner
in which the various molecules are stacked in a relationship with each other.
It is not an ‗inter'-molecular concept but an ‗intra'-molecular concept. It is
a single molecular structure which is protected in the present patent and
therefore, irrespective of which polymorphic form it appears it would have
the same chemical structure as contained in Claim-1 of the suit patent.
</p>
<p id="p_128">78.   This has come out very well in the evidence of the technical experts,
both on the side of the Plaintiff as also the Defendants' expert.
</p>
<p id="p_129">79.   When cross-examined, Defendants' witness Shashi Rekha (DW-2) in
response to the following questions admitted:
</p>
<pre id="pre_6">      "Q.26       Under what circumstance do the polymorphs
      maintain their crystal structure in the body?

       A.    The concept of polymorphic forms is not about how the

      made and how it is delivered to the body.
</p><p id="p_131">      Q.27 In other words within the body they are not different from

</p><p id="p_132">      A.     Yes
      Q.35 Erlotinib Hydrochloride has the same „chemical

      produced?
</p><p id="p_133">      A.     Yes"
</p><p id="p_134">Further the Defendants Expert Witness (DW-3) Dr.Ashwini Nangia has
stated the following in response to the cross examination:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_23">      "Q.48       Is it correct that polymorphism is the ability of a
      chemical substance to exist in more than one crystalline form.
      A.    Yes that is correct I will only add „in the solid state‟ to
      the same definition.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_24">      Q.49 Please see PX 25 from the Court record and confirm that
      all polymorphs of Erlotinib Hydrocholoride have this chemical
      structure?
</blockquote>      A.     Yes"
<p id="p_135">80.    Therefore, it logically follows that Cipla's argument that the
subsequent polymorph related to patent US'690221, which though granted
in USA and its counterpart rejected in India, has relevance is incorrect.
</p>
<p id="p_136">81.   The polymorph or the manner in which the Erlotinib Hydrochloride
molecules are arranged in a crystal lattice was found several years late (in
1999) than the main invention (in 1995). It was then realized that there were
at least two polymorphic forms ‗A' and ‗B'. A method was found to
separate the two and it was also determined that polymorph B has superior
properties to Polymorph A. In the polymorph application, an attempt was




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39"> RFA (OS) Nos.92/2012 &amp; 103/2012                                Page 40 of 106</span>
 made to claim its superiority to the main invention by saying that the main
invention related to a combination of polymorph A and polymorph B.
</p>
<p id="p_137">82.   What was clearly meant by this statement was that the original
compound did not distinguish between polymorphs whereas the improved
invention related to a purer form of Polymorph B with far superior
properties.
</p>
<p id="p_138">83.   However, a closer scrutiny of the polymorph patent also shows that
the properties were physical but not biological properties or therapeutic
properties.   Inside the body the polymorphs have the same chemical
structure and behave the same way biologically or therapeutically as
admitted by the Defendants witness Ms.Shashi Rekha DW-2 in response to
questions:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_25">      "Q.24        Is it therefore correct that the chemical structure
      of polymorphic forms is the same but the difference lies in the

      Q.27 In other words in the body they are not different from one
      another?
</blockquote>      A.      Yes"
<p id="p_139">84.   It is only that a particular polymorphic form may result in better
storage or transportation or manufacture or may have better thermodynamic
stability, etc. These properties are certainly improved but the moot question
is whether this improvement is covered by <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_109">Section 3(d)</a> of the Patents Act
and if so, has the data been supplied to prove enhanced efficacy in the
therapeutic sense.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40"> RFA (OS) Nos.92/2012 &amp; 103/2012                              Page 41 of 106</span>
<p id="p_140"> 85.   If there are polymorphs, which improve only the non-therapeutic
properties, then there may be a difficulty in obtaining a patent for the same
in India. Thus, in the decision reported as (2013) 6 SCC 1 Novartis AG Vs.
Union of India &amp; Ors. it has been held as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_27">      "157. What is „efficacy‟? Efficacy means „the ability to produce
      a desired or intended result‟. Hence, the test of efficacy in the
      context of <a href="/doc/1850559/" id="a_110">Section 3(d)</a> would be different, depending upon the
      result the product under consideration is desired or intended to
      produce. In other words, the test of efficacy would depend upon
      the function, utility or the purpose of the product under
      consideration. Therefore, in the case of a medicine that claims
      to cure a disease, the test of efficacy can only be „therapeutic
      efficacy‟. The question then arises, what would be the
      parameter of therapeutic efficacy and what are the advantages
      and benefits that may be taken into account for determining the
      enhancement of therapeutic efficacy? With regard to the
      genesis of <a href="/doc/1850559/" id="a_111">Section 3(d)</a>, and more particularly the
      circumstances in which <a href="/doc/1850559/" id="a_112">Section 3(d)</a> was amended to make it
      even more constrictive than before, we have no doubt that the
      „therapeutic efficacy‟ of a medicine must be judged strictly and
      narrowly. Our inference that the test of enhanced efficacy in
      case of chemical substances, especially medicine, should
      receive a narrow and strict interpretation is based not only on
      external factors but there are sufficient internal evidence that
      leads to the same view. It may be noted that the text added to
      <a href="/doc/1850559/" id="a_113">Section 3(d)</a> by the 2005 amendment lays down the condition of
      „enhancement of the known efficacy‟. Further, the explanation
      requires the derivative to „differ significantly in properties with
      regard to efficacy‟. What is evident, therefore, is that not all
      advantageous or beneficial properties are relevant, but only
      such properties that directly relate to efficacy, which in case of
      medicine, as seen above, is its therapeutic efficacy.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_28">      158. While dealing with the explanation it must also be kept in
      mind that each of the different forms mentioned in the
      explanation have some properties inherent to that form, e.g.,

       solubility to a salt and hygroscopicity to a polymorph. These
      forms, unless they differ significantly in property with regard to
      efficacy, are expressly excluded from the definition of
      „invention‟. Hence, the mere change of form with properties
      inherent to that form would not qualify as „enhancement of
      efficacy‟ of a known substance. In other words, the explanation
      is meant to indicate what is not to be considered as therapeutic
      efficacy."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_141">86.   It is for this reason that the Indian polymorphic patent application
IN/PCT/2002/00507/DEL was partly rejected. While the product claims 1,
2 and 6 were rejected, the process claim 4 was merged with 3 to make it
claim 1 and claim 5 was renumbered as claim 2. <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_114">Section 3(d)</a> came in the
way of the product claims as there was no data to support that the
polymorphic versions were therapeutically more efficient than the basic
compound.
</p>
<p id="p_142">87.   The interesting thing is that the Cipla's argument would shoot down
the polymorph because of <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_115">Section 3(d)</a> and also attempts to shoot down the
main compound, because of the polymorphs rejection. This cannot be done.
</p>
<p id="p_143">88.   Cipla's argument that X-Ray Diffraction Data (XRD) was not
specified for the suit patent is also not plausible because XRD shows the
manner in which the molecules are arranged in a crystal lattice. This is only
important for a polymorphic patent but not for a main molecule where
irrespective of the polymorphs, it is the chemical structure which is the sum
and substance of the invention.
</p>
<p id="p_144">89.   Cipla raised a whole series of arguments on the distinction between
product and substance in an attempt to argue that it is the commercial
product alone for which a patent can be granted and therefore this was a case

 of early patenting as the polymorph version which was invented in the year
1999 was the only deserving candidate for a patent.

<p id="p_145">90.   This argument ignores the fundamental truth about breakthrough
inventions, which at the time they are invented may not be commercially the
most viable for immediate marketing. They are useful and are industrially
applicable as without them there would be no stepping stone to achieve the
next lot of improvements.      For this reason, the Courts have struck a
distinction between commercial utility and patentable utility as set out

</blockquote><p id="p_149">97.   This leads us at the stage to the take of point where we can deal with
Cipla's defence to the charge of infringement. The defence is essentially
based on the claim that IN ‗774 is for Polymorphs A+B of Erlotinib
Hydrochloride, Tarceva i.e. Roche's product is just Polymorph B, which
corresponds to US ‗221 (and the rejected DEL ‗507). Hence Cipla urges
that while the patent sought to be enforced is for Polymorphs A+B, the
product actually under manufacture by both Roche and Cipla is Polymorph
B which ought to be assumed to be in the public domain and hence Cipla's
activities are non-infringing in nature.
</p>
<p id="p_150">98.   In its response to the above argument by learned Senior Counsel for
Cipla, Sh.Pravin Anand, learned counsel for Roche argued that while the
Learned Single Judge correctly notes that the packaging (Ex.P1),package
insert of the Defendant (EX. P2) and the declarations/statements made
before the Drug Controller (Ex.PW1/D2) all demonstrate that the API of
Erlocip (Cipla's product) is Erlotinib Hydrochloride, the learned Single
Judge erred in disregards this evidence and instead lay emphasis on clinical
test not having been conducted by Roche to demonstrate the constituents of
Roche's drug Tarceva and Cipla's drug Erlocip and places a positive onus
on Roche to establish whether Tarceva corresponds to the suit patent or




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46"> RFA (OS) Nos.92/2012 &amp; 103/2012                             Page 47 of 106</span>
 whether it is a polymorphic version of the suit patent compound. Learned
counsel pointed out that while the Learned Single Judge correctly notes that
the physical form of Cipla's drug demonstrates that it contains Erlotinib
Hydrochloride, he disregards Roche's submission that manufacturing a
Polymorph B version of Erlotinib Hydrochloride infringes Claim 1 of the
suit patent. Sh.Pravin Anand, learned counsel for Roche argued that the
clinical test of the compound is not relevant for determination of
infringement. Learned counsel urged that the basic patent was not confined
to any polymorphic form of Erlotinib Hydrochloride and hence as long as
Erlotinib Hydrochloride is present in Cipla's product Erlocip, it infringes the
suit patent. Learned counsel illustrated this, by stating that if water is
discovered for the first time and a claim covers the chemical formula H2O,
then it clearly covers all forms of H2O whether they will be in liquid, steam,
ice or snow. Similarly, Roche's invention as disclosed in Claim 1 of Patent
No. IN ‗774 is a new compound with a specific chemical structure and it is
only the research conducted years later which led to further innovation and
the finding that Erlotinib Hydrochloride could exist in more than one
polymorphic form and that the polymorphic forms differ from each other in
physical properties with one version (Polymorph-B) being more suitable
than the other version on account of its thermodynamic stability for oral
dosage in solid form.      According to learned counsel the basic patent
discovers a molecule for the first time, which is novel and not found in
nature,   and consequently anyone who adopts, uses, reproduces or
manufactures the said molecule, irrespective of the physical form in which
it is done, would be infringing the said Claim.

<p id="p_151"> 99.     Sh.Pravin Anand, learned counsel for Roche admitted in all fairness
that the Learned Single Judge correctly notes that DW-2 analyzed the

based on Polymorph B of Erlotinib Hydrochloride which corresponds to US
‗221 (the Polymorph B patent). However, Sh.Pravin Anand urged that the
Learned Single Judge has erred in not appreciating that the X-ray diffraction
of Tarceva was wholly irrelevant to the lis in the present instance, which
was for infringement of Claim 1 of IN ‗774 by Cipla product Erlocip. It was
urged that it was not Roche's case that Tarceva is not Polymorph B of
Erlotinib Hydrochloride but in fact it is Roche's case that the compound in
Tarceva is Erlotinib Hydrochloride which corresponds to Claim 1 of IN
‗774.    Learned counsel urged that the Learned Single Judge failed to
appreciate that new chemical entities (NCE) such as Erlotinib Hydrochloride
can be identified and characterized by Chemical Name, International Union
of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC name), Chemical Structure and
International Non-Proprietary Names (INN). Having been so described in
Claim 1 of the suit patent, it was sufficient for Roche to show that Cipla had
admittedly the same Chemical Name, IUPAC name, Chemical Structure and
INN for its compound. X-ray diffraction analysis, urged Sh.Pravin Anand,
is meant to describe the crystal lattice or the manner in which various
molecules are arranged or packed together and this is only relevant when an
invention is claimed in a new Polymorphic form. According to learned
counsel, the invention does not relate to the physical characteristics of
Erlotinib Hydrochloride but to the basic chemical substance itself. Learned
counsel urged that if any third party uses, makes, sells etc. a compound or
drug and identifies the same by Chemical Name, Chemical Structure or INN

 name, it is admitted that infringement has occurred. In fact, in the United
States, Tarceva is covered by US ‗498 (being the Basic patent) and US ‗221
(being the Polymorph B or improvement patent) amongst other patents.
</p>
<p id="p_152">100. Any process involved in making Polymorph B of Erlotinib
Hydrochloride would first involve the preparation of Erlotinib hydrochloride
itself; in fact a perusal of US ‗221 reveals that it is clearly stated that
Erlotinib Hydrochloride in Polymorph B form results from re-crystallization
of Erlotinib Hydrochloride using different solvents and temperature
conditions. Hence if the suit patent was found to disclose Erlotinib
Hydrochloride, any polymorphic version of the same would infringe the suit
patent as Erlotinib Hydrochloride itself would be underlying every such
polymorphic version.
</p>
<p id="p_153">101. The first error with the impugned judgment which needs to be
highlighted before we bring the curtains down on the aspect of the matter
concerning issues raised by Cipla on the subject of ‗product‟ versus
‗substance‟. We begin by noting the observations made in this regard by
the Learned Single Judge in para 213 of the impugned judgement as
under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_39">      "...no clinical tests have been placed on record either by
      attorney of the plaintiffs or by the expert of the plaintiffs which
      would show and analyzes as to what are the exact constituents
      of the plaintiffs drug Tarceva and the defendant„s drug
      ERLOCIP more specifically the question whether the same
      corresponds with the Indian Patent in the entirety or whether
      the same are the Polymorphic version B of the suit patent
      compound. Rather, the plaintiffs attorney has deposed
      everything on the basis of what has been shown in the physical




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49"> RFA (OS) Nos.92/2012 &amp; 103/2012                                Page 50 of 106</span>
        form of literature of the drug of the defendant which only
       demonstrates that it contains Erlotinib Hydrochloride".
</blockquote><p id="p_154">102. The Learned Single Judge has thereafter relied on expert testimony of
two kinds on this issue - first on X-ray diffraction tests which establish that
Tarceva is Polymorph B alone and second that the tablet form of Erlotinib
Hydrochloride does not follow directly from the claims in IN ‗774 (on
account of the fact that further reactions of the product from IN ‗774 are
required to produce Tarceva). This has lead the Learned Single Judge to a
construction of Claim 1 of IN ‗774 to understand whether it subsumes
Polymorph B of Erlotinib Hydrochloride, which is admittedly Erlocip

</p><p id="p_155">103. The second error we find is in the casting of the infringement issue,
in para 228 of the decision, in the following words:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_40">        ―...the Court has to test as to whether the impugned product is
        infringing the patented subject matter especially when there
        is a patent claim on the subject and there is a product which
        may not strictly covered within the patent claim but contains
        something else as well in form of variant or reactants.‖
        (emphasis ours).
</blockquote>
<p id="p_156">104.   Yet, later on the same page, in para 230, the words used by the
learned Single Judge are:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_41">       "However, the question remains whether the said test is
       determinative one even in cases where there exists a patented
       claim for a product and another product which may
       substantially contain the patented product but also contain
       some other variants or some other parts in addition to the
       patented article or product" (emphasis ours).
</blockquote><p id="p_157">105.   Thus, it is apparent that the Learned Single Judge has referred to two
distinct things i.e. Claim 1 of IN ‗774 and Tarceva, interchangeably, to
determine the infringement question and comes to what appears to us to be



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">  RFA (OS) Nos.92/2012 &amp; 103/2012                               Page 51 of 106</span>
 an erroneous conclusion.
</p>
<p id="p_158">106.   At this stage it is important for us to make some observations on X-
ray diffraction as a methodology to ascertain infringement. X-ray diffraction
is a method to determine and understand the crystalline structure of a
compound. It is primarily used for the following broad purposes:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_42">          In the regulatory field or during drug development, to identify a
           compound.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_43">          To distinguish between amorphous and crystalline compounds.
          To identify the fingerprints of various polymorphic forms of a
           compound.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_159">107.   X-ray diffraction is certainly not an accurate method to ascertain
product patent infringement in the present case as the issue is not and indeed
cannot be whether Roche and Cipla's products are identical but whether
Cipla's product is covered in the claims of Roche's patent. Although this
appears to us to be a fairly elementary issue in appreciation of the nature of
evidence in product patent infringement cases, neither counsel have relied on
any jurisprudence to demonstrate what ought to be the correct test of
infringement of a product patent.
</p>
<p id="p_160">108.   While this issue was indeed framed by the Division Bench of the
Gujarat High Court in      the decision reported as 2008 (37) PTC 128(<a href="/doc/1056408/" id="a_118">Guj)
Hind Mosaic and Cement Works &amp; Anr. vs. Shree Shahjanand Trading
Corporation &amp; Anr</a>. in the following words:        ―an infringement analysis

allegedly infringing device. The analysis cannot be performed by comparing

 the product manufactured by the patentee with the allegedly infringing
product,‖ the decision does not expressly address this question. Since no
other judgement has been brought to our attention which sets this issue right,
we feel it is important for us to underscore it here.
</p>
<p id="p_161">109.   It is an incorrect analysis of product patent infringement in a case like
the present, to use methodologies like X-Ray diffraction to ascertain whether
the competing products are identical in nature. The correct test of
infringement in this case is to map Cipla product against the Roche's patent
claims, which we find has not been done by the learned Single Judge, and
this is the third infirmity on this aspect of the dispute.
</p>
<p id="p_162">110.   If Roche's patent was for a polymorphic form of Erlotinib
Hydrochloride and not the molecule itself and Cipla had argued that theirs
was a ‗new substance‟, then alone the Court could have relied on evidence of
use of the X-Ray diffraction technique and a consequential analysis of the
peaks of both to ascertain whether they are identical or dissimilar
compounds. However in that situation too, the comparison would have to be
between a product made on the basis of Roche's patent claim and Cipla's
product and not between Roche's product as sold in the market and Cipla's
product. This subtle distinction is important to be kept in mind because the
holder of a patent is by no means limited to only manufacture and sell only
those products that are disclosed in the claims of the patent and hence a
different polymorph manufactured by the patent holder which is not the
subject of the registered patent cannot be used for the purpose of comparison
with the infringer product; the very product disclosed in the patent claims
must be used.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">  RFA (OS) Nos.92/2012 &amp; 103/2012                                Page 53 of 106</span>
<p id="p_163"> 111.   Thus the question at hand is really whether Cipla's Polymorph B
(Erlocip) was subsumed in the claims of IN ‗774. We find the answer in the
decision reported as [2008] EWHC Civ 445 Servier v Apotex. Servier's
attempt to secure a patent for the α-form of the t-butylamine salt of
perindopril failed both before the Patents Court and the Court of Appeals
which observed that the crystal form could easily be obtained by carrying out
the process disclosed in the basic patent. In refusing to ‗evergreen' the basic
patent it was clear that the Court of Appeals was not denying Servier the
right to enforce the basic patent against a third party attempting to
manufacture the α-form crystals. In the present case too, the correct analysis
that the Learned Single Judge ought to have employed was a construction of
the IN ‗774 claim to understand whether it encompassed the manufacture of
Polymorph B of Erlotinib Hydrochloride. By focusing on evidence involving
the analysis of X-Ray diffraction data, the Learned Single Judge has
erroneously compared the products of Roche and Cipla when he ought to
have mapped the claims of the suit patent against Cipla's product. Counsels
for both the Appellant and the Respondent have not been able to assist the
court with authorities to support their stand on the test of infringement
required to be employed and much of the arguments have been on first
principles.
</p>
<p id="p_164">112.   It is therefore left to the Court to study the specification and claims of
the suit patent and note that as they are in relation to Erlotinib Hydrochloride
and are not restricted to any specific Polymorph, they would be infringed by
any manufacture of Polymorph B by a third party as the same would use the
subject matter of IN ‗774 as its basic starting point. The Learned Single




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">  RFA (OS) Nos.92/2012 &amp; 103/2012                                 Page 54 of 106</span>
 Judge has correctly applied the principle in the decision reported as AIR
1969 Bom 255       F.H &amp; B vs. Unichem, in stating that in case of any
ambiguity of the Claim of the suit patent then resort can be taken to the
specification of the said suit patent and nothing else. He correctly recognized
that a Purposive Construction of the claims is necessary in order to not
construe claims too narrowly. Yet we find that neither of these tests have
been applied in the present case to construct the claims themselves and hence
a conclusion that the IN ‗774 patent covers Polymorphs A+B itself is
erroneous.
</p>
<p id="p_165">113.   Once again we go back to Claim 1 of IN ‗774. It reads : ―A novel
[6,7-bis (2-methoxyethoxy) quinazolin-4-yl ]- (3-ethynylphenyl) amine
hydrochloride compound of the formula A.‖

</p><p id="p_166">114.   This is a sufficiently broad claim that is clearly not limited to any
polymorphic version of Erlotinib         Hydrochloride, but to Erlotinib
Hydrochloride itself. This compound may exist in several polymorphic
forms, but any and all such forms will be subsumed within this patent.
Therefore as Cipla's Erlocip is admittedly one particular polymorphic form
of the Erlotinib Hydrochloride compound (Polymorph B), it will clearly
infringe the IN ‗774 patent. We thus conclude this issue by noting that the
Single Judge's finding that ‗Tarceva'and ‗Erlocip' were based on the
Polymorph B version of Erlotinib Hydrochloride, though correct factually, is
irrelevant to the subject matter of the present patent as Cipla has clearly
infringed Claim 1 of Roche's IN ‗774 patent in arriving at the said
Polymorph.

the Patents Act. Learned Senior Counsel for Cipla contends that assuming
Roche believed Polymorph B of Erlotinib Hydrochloride to have been
covered in the suit patent, thus considered Polymorph B of Erlotinib
Hydrochloride to be ‗same and substantially the same‟ as the suit patent, then
it ought to have disclosed before the patent office while prosecuting its
application resulting in IN `774 that it had filed an application for grant of
patent for Polymorph B of Erlotinib Hydrochloride resulting in US `221
which fact was not disclosed.

<p id="p_169">116.   According to learned senior counsel for Cipla, <a href="/doc/879773/" id="a_121">Section 8</a> casts an
obligation upon the patentee to disclose particulars of application in foreign
Country of ‗same or substantially the same invention' to the Controller and
the same is a continuing obligation coupled with a duty to disclose. It is
contended that <a href="/doc/879773/" id="a_122">Section 8</a> is a mandatory provision, non-compliance whereof
results in revocation of the patent under <a href="/doc/217797/" id="a_123">Section 64</a> of the Patents Act and
thus the suit patent is liable to be revoked on this ground as well. It is

statement or counter claim there are no pleadings or material particulars to
show that the suit patent was violative of the disclosure requirement as
mandated by <a href="/doc/879773/" id="a_125">Section 8</a>. Further it is the case of Cipla itself that the claim
relating to Polymorph B form was based on entirely independent invention, it
not being the same and substantially the same as IN `774, thus the same was
not required to be disclosed to the patents office. The stand of Roche that the
invention of Polymorph B of Erlotinib Hydrochloride was a separate
invention is fortified by a separate patent for Polymorph B of Erlotinib
Hydrochloride having been granted in 40 Countries and thus the suit patent
cannot be recalled/revoked for non-disclosure of the patent application
resulting in grant of patent US `221 for Polymorph B in USA. Further
application resulting in grant of the patent US `221 for Polymorph B of
Erlotinib Hydrochloride was filed many years after the application for the
suit patent. While the claim of IN `774 was for a new chemical entity, the
claim of US `221 was for Polymorphic crystalline form of Erlotinib
Hydrochloride. Thus, pendency of application resulting in grant of patent US
`221 has no bearing on the examination of the suit patent and Roche was not
required to disclose the same under <a href="/doc/879773/" id="a_126">Section 8</a>. Further for the reason the
Indian patent office rejected the claim of Roche for Polymorph B of Erlotinib
Hydrochloride deeming it to be the same substance under <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_127">Section 3(d)</a> of the
Patents Act, the pendency of the application of patent US `221 was not
required to be revealed before the Patents Office.       The provision under

 relationship between the various molecules of Erlotinib Hydrochloride
resulting in a certain polymorphic structure with no enhanced therapeutic
values but more thermodynamic and due to the enhanced efficacy of
polymorph B not being demonstrated the patent application DEL `507 was
declined in India whereas granted in 40 other countries. Thus non filling of
the details of the application resulting in grant of patent US ‗221 by Roche is
attributable to the bona-fide belief of Roche that the application resulting in
patent US ‗221 is not same or substantially the same compound. This bona
fide belief of Roche is also fortified by the claim of Cipla in para 5 of the
reply to CM 219, an application in FAO (OS) 188/2008 Ex.DW-1/13 where
it states-

    object of enactment, the same will be construed as directory.
    But all this does not mean that the language used is to be
    ignored but only that the prima facie inference of the intention
    of the legislature arising from the words used may be displaced
    by considering the nature of the enactment, its design and the
    consequences flowing from alternative constructions. Thus, the
    use of the words „as nearly as may be‟ in contrast to the words
    „at least‟ will prima facie indicate a directory requirement,
    negative words a mandatory requirement, „may‟ a directory
    requirement and „shall‟ a mandatory requirement."

    remains to consider what intentions are to be attributed to the

    The first such question is: when a statute requires that
    something shall be done, or done in a particular manner or
    form, without expressly declaring what shall be the
    consequence of non-compliance, is the requirement to be
    regarded as imperative (or mandatory) or forms prescribed by
    the statute have been regarded as essential to the act or thing
    regulated by it, and their omission has been held fatal to its
    validity. In others, such prescriptions have been considered as
    merely directory, the neglect of them involving nothing more
    than liability to a penalty, if any were imposed, for breach of
    the enactment. „An absolute enactment must be obeyed or

    duty would work serious general inconvenience or injustice to
    persons who have no control over those entrusted with the duty
    and at the same time would not promote the main object of the

    this Court has observed as under: (SCC pp. 135-36, para 5)
    „5. The use of the word "shall" is ordinarily mandatory but it is
    sometimes not so interpreted if the scope of the enactment, on
    consequences to flow from such construction would not so
    demand. Normally, the word "shall" prima facie ought to be
    considered mandatory but it is the function of the Court to
    ascertain the real intention of the legislature by a careful
    examination of the whole scope of the statute, the purpose it
    seeks to serve and the consequences that would flow from the
    construction to be placed thereon. The word "shall", therefore,
    ought to be construed not according to the language with which
    it is clothed but in the context in which it is used and the
    purpose it seeks to serve. The meaning has to be ascribed to the
    word "shall" as mandatory or as directory, accordingly.
    Equally, it is settled law that when a statute is passed for the
    purpose of enabling the doing of something and prescribes the
    formalities which are to be attended for the purpose, those
    prescribed formalities which are essential to the validity of such
    thing, would be mandatory. However, if by holding them to be
    mandatory, serious general inconvenience is caused to innocent
    persons or general public, without very much furthering the
    object of the Act, the same would be construed as directory.‟"

    consideration to bear in mind while interpreting a provision.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_75">    122. The distinction between mandatory and directory
    provisions is a well-accepted norm of interpretation. The
    general rule of interpretation would require the word to be

    "must" unless it was essential to read it as "may" to achieve



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">RFA (OS) Nos.92/2012 &amp; 103/2012                              Page 65 of 106</span>
     the ends of legislative intent and understand the language of the
    provisions. It is difficult to lay down any universal rule, but
    wherever the word "shall" is used in a substantive statute, it
    normally would indicate mandatory intent of the legislature.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_76">    123.Crawford on Statutory Construction has specifically stated
    that language of the provision is not the sole criterion; but the
    courts should consider its nature, design and the consequences
    which could flow from construing it one way or the other.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_77">    124. Thus, the word "shall" would normally be mandatory
    while the word "may" would be directory. Consequences of
    non-compliance would also be a relevant consideration. The
    word "shall" raises a presumption that the particular provision
    is imperative but this prima facie inference may be rebutted by
    other considerations such as object and scope of the enactment
    and the consequences flowing from such construction.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_78">    125. Where a statute imposes a public duty and proceeds to lay
    down the manner and time-frame within which the duty shall be
    performed, the injustice or inconvenience resulting from a rigid
    adherence to the statutory prescriptions may not be a relevant
    factor in holding such prescription to be only directory. For
    example, when dealing with the provisions relating to criminal
    law, legislative purpose is to be borne in mind for its proper
    interpretation. It is said that the purpose of criminal law is to
    permit everyone to go about their daily lives without fear of
    harm to person or property and it is in the interests of everyone
    that serious crime be effectively investigated and prosecuted.
    There must be fairness to all sides. [Attorney General's
    Reference (No. 3 of 1999) [(2001) 2 AC 91 : (2001) 2 WLR 56 :
    (2001) 1 All ER 577 (HL)] ; Justice G.P. Singh on Principles of
    Statutory Interpretation, 11th Edn., 2008]. In a criminal case,
    the court is required to consider the triangulation of interests
    taking into consideration the position of the accused, the victim
    and his or her family and the public.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_79">    126. The basic purpose of interpretation of statutes is further to
    aid in determining either the general object of the legislation or
    the meaning of the language in any particular provision. It is
    obvious that the intention which appears to be most in



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">RFA (OS) Nos.92/2012 &amp; 103/2012                              Page 66 of 106</span>
       accordance with convenience, reason, justice and legal
      principles should, in all cases of doubtful interpretation, be
      presumed to be the true one. The intention to produce an
      unreasonable result is not to be imputed to a statute. On the
      other hand, it is not impermissible, but rather is acceptable, to
      adopt a more reasonable construction and avoid anomalous or
      unreasonable construction. A sense of the possible injustice of
      an interpretation ought not to induce Judges to do violence to
      the well-settled rules of construction, but it may properly lead
      to the selection of one, rather than the other, of the two
      reasonable interpretations. In earlier times, statutes imposing
      criminal or other penalties were required to be construed
      narrowly in favour of the person proceeded against and were
      more rigorously applied. The courts were to see whether there
      appeared any reasonable doubt or ambiguity in construing the
      relevant provisions. Right from the case of <a href="/doc/532743/" id="a_144">R.v. Jones</a>, ex p
      Daunton [(1963) 1 WLR 270 : (1963) 1 All ER 368 (DC)] , the
      basic principles state that even statutes dealing with
      jurisdiction and procedural law are, if they relate to infliction
      of penalties, to be strictly construed; compliance with the
      procedures will be stringently exacted from those proceedings
      against the person liable to be penalised and if there is any
      ambiguity or doubt, it will be resolved in favour of the
      accused/such person. These principles have been applied with
      approval by different courts even in India. Enactments relating
      to procedure in courts are usually construed as imperative. A
      kind of duty is imposed on court or a public officer when no
      general inconvenience or injustice is caused from different
      construction. A provision of a statute may impose an absolute
      or qualified duty upon a public officer which itself may be a
      relevant consideration while understanding the provision itself.

a directory rule. In the decision reported as 1981 SCC 202 Sharif-Ud-Din

mandatory rule and the directory rule held that while the former must be
strictly observed, in the case of the latter substantial compliance may be

be achieved by combining the two in a single table had been anticipated. An
amateur chemist, named John Newlands had suggested that when elements



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_70"> RFA (OS) Nos.92/2012 &amp; 103/2012                                 Page 71 of 106</span>
 were arranged by weights they appear to repeat properties - in a sense to
harmonise - at every eighth place along the scale. Newlands called it the
Law of OCTAVES, and linked the arrangement to the octaves on a piano
keyboard. Perhaps the manner of presentation by Newlands was perceived
to be funny and this explains his idea being considered fundamentally
preposterous and widely mocked. At gatherings, droller members of the
audience would sometimes ask him if he could get his elements to play them
a little tune.
</p><p id="p_187">133. By 1860, the card game known as solitaire in North America, called
patience elsewhere, where cards are arranged by a suit horizontally and by
number vertically, had become a rage.
</p><p id="p_188">134. Using a broad similar concept, Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev arranged
the elements in horizontal rows called periods and vertical columns called
groups. This instantly showed one set of relationships when read up and
down and another when read from side to side. Specifically, the vertical
columns put together have similar properties. Thus, copper sits on top of
silver and silver sits on top of gold because of their chemical affinities as
metals; while helium, neon and argon are in a column made up of gases.
</p><p id="p_189">135. The approach used by Mendeleev was slightly different than that of
John Newlands, but employed fundamentally the same premise. Suddenly,
the idea seemed brilliant and wondrously perceptive because the properties
repeated themselves periodically, the invention became known as the
periodic table.
</p><p id="p_190">136. For the world, the periodic table became a thing of beauty in the
abstract, but for the chemist it established an immediately orderliness and
clarity that can hardly be overstated.

invalid under <a href="/doc/217797/" id="a_155">Section 64</a> (1)(f) of the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_156">Patents Act</a>, 1970 for lack of inventive
steps and being obvious. It is urged that Example 51 of EP ‗226 is the
closest prior art cited in the suit patent and any person skilled in the art
would be motivated to use the same as a starting point. Further EP ‗226 was
the first patent document to disclose the use of Quinazoline derivatives for
their anti-cancer properties. The only difference between a large number of
compounds exemplified in EP ‗226 and those exemplified in the suit patent
was a mere substitution of Methyl with Ethynyl on the 3 meta position. The
motivation to choose Example 51 of EP ‗226 is also attributed to its
relatively effective IC 50 value which has been clearly defined in Example
51 of EP ‗226. Methyl and Ethynyl are known bioisoteres and a person
skilled in the art is aware of the well known basic principles of Grimm's
Hydride Displacement Law; applying which example 20 of the suit patent is
reached. Cipla claims that having discharged the initial burden of showing
that the suit patent was obvious, the onus shifted to Roche to prove that the
suit patent was not obvious and was an inventive step from the earlier
known example. Further EP ‗226 itself suggests Cyano as a possible
substitute and thus the suit patent lacks inventive steps and is not novel.

</p><p id="p_193">139. Roche rebutting argument of Cipla on lack of inventive steps and
obviousness claims that Cipla admitted patent IN 774 being novel, hence
anticipation has not been assailed as a ground. It is contended that an
invention is obvious or does not involve any inventive steps if the complete
specifications are published before the priority date of said claim.
Obviousness has to be determined by a person of ordinary skill in the Art (in
short ‗POSA'). POSA thinks along the lines of conventional wisdom in art
and does not undertake risks to go away from the main stream teaching.
While conducting an inquiry into obviousness, hindsight is impermissible
and the legal conclusion must be reached on the basis of facts gleaned from
the prior art and should not include knowledge gleaned from patent
disclosure. Teachings in prior art document have to be considered as a
whole. Teachings away from the patent claim are treated as non-obvious.
To inquire into obviousness, two fold inquiry is required to be conducted i.e.
motivation to select and motivation to modify. Mere structural similarity
cannot form the basis for selection of a lead compound in a prior art. The
legal position is well settled that potent and promising activity in the prior
art trumps mere structural similarity. There has to be a teaching, suggestion
or motivation in the prior art document in order to modify the lead
compound. Besides the primary consideration as noted, the objective indicia



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_73"> RFA (OS) Nos.92/2012 &amp; 103/2012                               Page 74 of 106</span>
 of non-obviousness include secondary considerations such as (i) a long-felt
need; (ii) failure of others; (iii) industry acclaim; and (iv) unexpected results.
Roche claims that Cipla has not discharged its onus to establish invalidity on
the ground of obviousness as no clear and convincing evidence was led to
demonstrate that the three distinct approaches canvassed by Cipla that
POSA would be motivated to modify the lead compound Example 51 with
EP ‗507 in order to substitute the 3rd meta position of Methyl on Phenyl ring
with Ethynyl there being no reference of a teaching to show that Ethynyl
would be a suitable alternative; the second being applying the concept of
―bioisosteric replacement‖ to the 3rd position of phenyl ring of Example 51
of EP ‗226 and thirdly Cipla's relying upon 5 additional documents, two of
which are not prior art namely EP 0477700, US 4138590, US 5427766, US
5736534 and WO 193004047 which were exhibited by DW-3 Prof.Ashwini
Nangia. The evidence of Prof. Ashwini Nangia DW-3 cannot be relied upon
as he was not a person skilled in art neither being a medicinal chemist nor
having any experience in drug discovery and development process from
inception to animal study and clinical trials, no independent search having
been conducted by DW-3 and his search was based on Google and
Wikipedia few days prior to cross-examination. Cipla provides no reason to
select EP ‗226 as the closest prior art and as to why Example 51 would have
been selected as a lead compound. The teaching of the prior art should be as
a whole and various steps cannot be surgically put together. No evidence
has been led by Cipla in support of its steps canvassed. Further Prof.Roger
Griffin, PW-2 has explained that bioisosteric replacement at best is a rough
rule of thumb and provides no motivation to a POSA to develop Erlotinib
Hydrochloride. Reliance is placed on the decisions reported as AIR 1969

of being wise after the event in regarding something that has been

noted that care must be taken to avoid hindsight reconstruction by using the

and if prior art gives reason or motivation to make claimed composition
however, the minority judgment noting various authorities held that Courts
have expressed dissatisfaction on the earlier rule that ‗structural
obviousness' alone was deemed to create a presumption of unpatentability.
The minority held that the weight of the authorities would show that
structural similarity of the prior art compound cannot be the criteria alone
and the prior art must prima facie suggest both similar structure and property

 before the burden shifts to the applicant to prove the unexpected differences.
Even in 444.2d 581 re: John R. Slemniski the Court held that similarity of
structure alone was insufficient for prima facie unpatentability. Thus to
show obviousness besides structural similarity there should be a reason or
motivation shown in the prior art to make the particular structural change in
order to achieve the properties that the applicant was seeking.

    basis in a CIP of application PCT/IB95/00436 dated June 6,

    Arnold had himself studied methyl, ethyl, ethenyl derivatives of
    4-heterocycle substituted quinazolines which are very close
    analogues of the claimed compound in IN `774. In my opinion,
    Mr. Arnold was wholly aware of the interchangeability of
    methyl and ethynyl amongst others at the C-phenyl ring
    appended to the 4-heterocycle position of quinazoline and on
    the basis of such knowledge it would have been obvious for him
    to try a similar interchangeability approach in N-phenyl
    quinazolines. If Mr. Arnold in IN `774 patent had included
    both methyl and ethynyl in the 3rd position, then compound
    having methyl would have been identical to the aforesaid
    compound of EP `226 and I would presume that for such reason
    reference to methyl as a interchangeably usable substituent in
    place of ethynyl was omitted. While the patent holder has

      routine replace substituent, ring, group of atoms etc. for
      various aspects of the lead component for example
      pharmacology, pharmacokinetic, toxicology, side effects, half

      claim of the Defendant is a mechanism directed to strategies for
      molecular modification and drug design.

      the inventor that the ethynyl substitution would work but due to
      successful use of both methyl and ethynyl in an interchangeable
      manner in several chemical compounds, it was not at all
      surprising to substitute methyl with ethynyl. Therefore, in my
      opinion such substitution cannot be said to be an inventive step

with platelet aggregation inhibitor not being an EGFR inhibitor, even US
‗766 and WO ‗0047 were not EGFR inhibitors and US ‗534 was published
on August 31, 1995 thus not a prior art.
</p><p id="p_238">169. The onus was on Cipla to show prima facie obviousness whereafter
the burden would have shifted to Roche. However DW-3 has not been able
to satisfy the tests laid down above thus could not establish prima facie that
the suit patent was obvious. Consequently, the action of Cipla seeking
invalidity of the suit patent on the ground of obviousness fails.
</p><p id="p_239">                                  Lack of title
</p><p id="p_240">170. In the written statement and counter claim Cipla claims lack of title to
the suit patent in favour of Roche. The pleadings in this regard in para 16 of
the written statement of Cipla are that the application number
537/DEL/1996 was filed as a convention application in India on March 13,
1996 by one Pfizer Inc. seeking priority from U.S. patent application dated
March 30, 1995 under the title ―Quinazoline Derivatives‖. The exact status
of Roche's patent and its ownership is neither known nor is fully established
and no documents which vest any right in Roche of ownership or ‗Right to
Sue‟ have been placed on record. In counter claim revocation is not sought
for lack of title as could not be sought under <a href="/doc/217797/" id="a_165">Section 64</a> of the Patents Act.
During the course of argument, learned counsel for Cipla argued that the
plaintiffs in the suit are F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. (in short Roche)




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_95"> RFA (OS) Nos.92/2012 &amp; 103/2012                                    Page 96 of 106</span>
 plaintiff No.1 and OSI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (in short OSI) plaintiff No.2.
In the plaint the claim of Roche and OSI is that OSI owned a patent with
Pfizer Products but the said company has not been impleaded as a plaintiff.
Further in the plaint it is stated that OSI along with M/s Pfizer Products Inc.
applied for grant of a patent in respect of drug Erlotinib and its process vide
application No.537/DEL/1996 on March 13, 1996 however the copy of the
patent application would reveal that OSI along with M/s Pfizer Inc was the
applicant and not M/s Pfizer Product Inc. Further it is the case of Roche that
it entered into a Development, Collaboration and Licensing Agreement with
OSI wherein Roche obtained a license to use, sell and offer for sale, the
licensed product including the drug Erlotinib however said document has
neither been filed nor produced by the plaintiffs. There being no document
to support how the interest was transferred from Pfizer Inc. to Pfizer Product
Inc., the claim of OSI that it was a joint owner of the suit patent with Pfizer
Product Inc. is not established. Even during patent prosecution after the first
assignment dated May 18, 2005 of the patent application of Pfizer Inc. to
Pfizer Product Inc. the second assignment took place wherein the patent
application had been assigned jointly in favour of Pfizer Product Inc. and
OSI.    The first assignment document dated May 18, 2005 is given a
retrospective effect from May 03, 2004 which is impermissible and not in
accordance with law. The second alleged assignment agreement dated May
05, 2004 is on a stamp paper dated August 12, 2005 and could not have been
dated May 05, 2004 especially when the first assignment is dated May 18,
2005.   No evidence having been led qua ownership of the suit patent,
Roche's appeal claiming be a joint owner is liable to be dismissed.

 further argued that even if accepting OSI to be a joint owner, it became joint
owner only on May 05, 2004 , thus prior thereto it had no right in the suit
patent. The assignment deeds are neither properly stamped nor registered
and having failed to prove so, Roche has failed to prove its title in the suit
patent.
</p><p id="p_241">171. In response Roche contends that no issue was settled in this regard
and as per the counter claim and written statement, the challenge to the
validity is to the extent mentioned under <a href="/doc/217797/" id="a_170">Section 64</a> of the Patents Act and
none of the grounds under <a href="/doc/217797/" id="a_171">Section 64</a> relate to the lack of title in the suit
patent. The grant of suit patent IN ‗774 has not been denied by Cipla and
any question regarding title pertains to rectification of the Register of
Patents under <a href="/doc/1939153/" id="a_172">Section 71</a> of the Patents Act for which jurisdiction
exclusively vests with the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB).
<a href="/doc/1939153/" id="a_173">Section 71</a> read with <a href="/doc/180803048/" id="a_174">Sections 117C</a> and <a href="/doc/149217889/" id="a_175">117D</a> of the Patents Act bars the
jurisdiction of this Court to try such an issue.        Notwithstanding the
preliminary objections, Roche claims that the patent application was filed by
Pfizer Inc. on March 13, 1996 and by virtue of assignment deed dated May
18, 2005 w.e.f. May 03, 2004 assignment took place from original applicant
Pfizer Inc to its wholly owned subsidiary Pfizer Product Inc. assigning its
right in the patent application 537/DEL/1996. By way of further assignment
deed dated May 05, 2004 Pfizer Product Inc assigned part of their right to
OSI, thus OSI became a joint applicant/owner of the rights to accrue
pursuant to application No.537/DEL/1996 for which a fresh form was filed
seeking change of the names of applicants. Further Pfizer Inc and OSI had
also entered into a collaboration research agreement on April 01, 1986
which was renewed on April 01, 1991 and April 01, 1996. The patent

 document issued on July 06, 2007 w.e.f. February 23, 2007 is in the name of
Pfizer Product Inc. and OSI. Further by way of agreement dated January 08,
2001 OSI granted exclusive license to Roche in relation to suit patent and
vide agreement dated September 07, 2008 Roche, Pfizer Product Inc. and
OSI confirmed exclusive license agreement dated January 08, 2001 which
documents are part of patent office record except Collaborative Research
Agreement which was exhibited as Ex.PW1/4. Referring to decision in AIR
2003 SC 1608 Renu Devi Vs. Mahinder Singh &amp; Ors. reliance is placed on
the principle of feeding grant by estopple and that a third party cannot
question the title.
</p><p id="p_242">172. Cipla in the written statement claims invalidity for the reason that the
exact status and ownership of Roche in the suit patent is not known. Lack of
title not being a ground of revocation under <a href="/doc/217797/" id="a_176">Section 64</a> of the Patents Act, to
press this point CIPLA ought to have insisted on settlement of a issue on
lack of title. Be that as it may even treating this issue to be subsumed in

<p id="p_244"> 174. Thus, the claim of Cipla qua the invalidity of the suit patent on the
ground of lack of title cannot be decided in suit proceedings before this
Court.
</p><p id="p_245">175. Further though CIPLA pleads that the application for grant of suit
patent being application number 537/DEL/1996 was filed by Pfizer Inc. it
does not dispute that the suit patent was granted in the joint name of Pfizer
Products Inc. and OSI Pharmaceuticals Inc. (OSI).             Ex.DW1/10 to
Ex.DW4/43 documents from the office of Controller of Patents would
evince that the convention application for patent in Form 2A was filed by
Pfizer Inc. being the assignee of inventors Rodney Caughren Schnur and
Lee Daniel Arnold on March 13, 1996 claiming priority from March 30,
1995 being the date of application in USA. During the pendency of the
patent prosecution in India, Pfizer Inc. the original applicant executed an
assignment deed dated May 18, 2005 w.e.f. May 03, 2004 assigning its right
in the application 537/DEL/1996 to Pfizer Products Inc. exhibited as
Ex.DW4/1(colly). By way of further assignment dated May 05, 2004 Pfizer
Product Inc. assigned a part of their right to OSI and thus Pfizer Product Inc.
and OSI became joint owners of application No.537/DEL/1996 exhibited as
Ex.DW4/1 (collectively) and a fresh form in this regard was filed. The letter
patent document issued on July 06, 2007 was in the name of Pfizer Product
Inc. and OSI.
</p><p id="p_246">176. Cipla pleads that two assignment deeds dated May 18, 2005 and May
05, 2004 were back-dated i.e. retrospective operation of the assignment was
conferred. In the decision reported as (1998) 7 SCC 348 Life Insurance
Corporation of India Ltd.&amp; Anr. Vs. Dharam Vir Anand Supreme Court laid

 down that while construing the contractual clause the words and term therein
must be given effect to and when it uses different expressions, ordinarily
those different expressions would convey different meanings.
</p><p id="p_247">177. Further it is not the case of Cipla that on the date of retrospective
assignment by Pfizer Inc. to Pfizer Products Inc., Pfizer Inc. had no right,
title in the property i.e. the patent application. Even assuming no right could
be created retrospectively in favour of Pfizer Products Inc., right certainly
vested on May 18, 2005 the date of assignment agreement and from which
date it vested in OSI. The patent i.e. IN ‗774 was granted on February 23,
2007 when OSI had been assigned the rights in the patent.
</p><p id="p_248">178. <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_189">The Registration Act</a> does not envisage a deed of assignment of a
trademark/copyright or patent to be compulsorily registered not being an
immovable property.      In the decision reported as (2004) 13 SCC 49
Collector of Central Excise, Ahmedabad Vs. Vikshara Trading &amp; Investment
(P) Ltd. &amp; Anr. the Supreme Court repelling the contention regarding deed
of assignment of trademark to be registered held that the mere fact that the
assignment was not registered would not alter the position.
</p><p id="p_249">179. In response to the contention of learned Senior counsel for Cipla that
as per <a href="/doc/607557/" id="a_190">Section 50</a> of the Patents Act, no right can be assigned, transferred or
licensed without the consent of the co-owner, Roche contends that the
exclusive license granted to Roche by OSI in relation to the suit patent vide
agreement dated January 08, 2001 was ratified/confirmed by an agreement
between Roche, Pfizer Products Inc. and OSI on September 04, 2008.

 not produced. No doubt the documents have not been exhibited by the
plaintiffs' witnesses during their evidence. Cipla does not deny that the
documents were part of patent office record which was duly summoned by
Cipla. We agree with the contention of learned counsel for the Roche that
since no issue having been settled with regard to the lack of title in the suit
patent Roche was not required to prove the same.
</p><p id="p_250">180. Even treating as the learned Single Judge has done that the issue of
title of Roche was subsumed in the issue of injunction we note that OSI is a
co-patentee of the suit patent and it being a co-plaintiff the suit cannot be
dismissed on this ground. In the decision reported as (2007) 2 SCC 551
Prem Lata Nahata &amp; Anr. Vs. Chandi Prasad Sikaria the Supreme Court
laid down that the objection of misjoinder of parties or of causes of action, is
only a procedural objection and it is open to the Court to proceed with the
suit notwithstanding such defects and if the suit results in a decision, the
same cannot be set aside in appeal merely on this ground in view of Section
99 CPC.

being no challenge to the ownership of OSI, plaintiff No.2 in the suit and a
co-patentee, the objection in terms of <a href="/doc/607557/" id="a_208">Section 50</a> of the Patents Act thus
fails. The suit patent cannot be held to be invalid for lack of title, nor is the
suit liable to be dismissed on the ground that Roche has not proved its
license for the reason title of OSI plaintiff No.2 to the suit patent is
established and it being a co-plaintiff, suit was maintainable. We also note
that lack of title is not a ground for revocation under <a href="/doc/217797/" id="a_209">Section 64</a> of the
Patents Act. Thus, we find no merit in the contention raised by Cipla
seeking dismissal of the suit on the ground of lack of title.

September 07, 2012 passed by the learned Single Judge in so far counter
claim filed by Cipla seeking revocation of IN ‗577 in favour of Roche has
been dismissed, we set aside the impugned decision dismissing suit for
injunction filed by Roche. But keeping in view the fact that the life of the
patent in favour of Roche in India would expire in March, 2016 we do not
grant the injunction as prayed for by Roche against Cipla (because as noted
above there was no interim injunction in favour of Roche and due to said
reason Cipla continued to manufacture and sell Erlocip). We decree that
Cipla would be liable to render accounts concerning manufacture and sale of
Erlocip, for which purpose suit filed by Roche against Cipla is restored with

evidence pertaining to the profits made by Cipla concerning the offending
product. Thereafter the report of the learned Joint Registrar shall be placed
