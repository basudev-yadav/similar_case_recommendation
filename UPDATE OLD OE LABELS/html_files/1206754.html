</pre><p id="p_37">6.	After passing of the order of assessment, a raid was conducted.  A 
criminal proceeding was initiated against the appellant-company.  An 
application was filed by it before the appropriate authority under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_3">Section 60</a> 
of the Act for classification and advance rulings.  By reason of the order 
dated 30th September, 2005, it was held :
The issue is examined in detail and it is seen that 
in the sale of the advertisement material, the 
background activity such as conceptualization is 
no doubt an idea but creation of advertisement is a 
comprehensive activity leading to creation of 
goods in question.  Even when any other goods are 
produced there is some idea and thought regarding 
the shape and size etc.  Therefore, to separate 
design and concept taking the sale value of merely 
the advertisement material as brochure etc. is 
improper.
</p><p id="p_38">It is further seen that in the bills there is separate 
charge made as content development concept, 
design, photography scanning and other charges 
such as system charges including colour sketch 
pen or computer used design software etc., 
Ultimately, the brochures come out.  Considering 
the entire ambit of activity of the dealer it is seen 
tht it is a comprehensive contract or supply of 
printed material developed by the company.  The 
bills also indicate the entire activity though 
separated is a comprehensive work.  Such creation 
of activity tanamounts to making indivisible 
contract in a divisible contract.  Therefore, this 
Authority rules that entire sale value including the 
creation of concept etc. done by the company 
forms a part of the value of sale of such brochures 
and liable to tax at 4% on the entire proceeds 
received including those relating to concept 
charges, system charges etc.  In short, this 
Authority rules that the sale of printed material 
with a background of providing the concept is an 
indivisible activity liable to tax at 4% as a whole.
(Emphasis supplied)

</p><p id="p_39">7.	An appeal preferred thereagainst by the appellant in terms of Section 
24(1) of the Kerala Sales Tax Act has been dismissed by a Division Bench 
of the High Court.  
</p><p id="p_40">8.	The High Court in its judgment noticed the decisions of this Court in 
<a href="/doc/952963/" id="a_4">Associated Cement Companies Ltd. v. Commissioner of Customs</a> [(2001) 4 
SCC 593]; <a href="/doc/39169380/" id="a_5">Tata Consultancy Services v. State of A.P</a>. [(2005) 1 SCC 132]; 
and Tata Consultancy Services v. Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay 
&amp; Anr. [(2006) 3 SCC 1] and held :
</p><p id="p_41">In the light of the three judgments stated supra, 
what is clear to us is the services rendered by the 
appellant is an indivisible activity and liable to 
levy of tax.  The aurhotity in Annexure-A after 
noticing the material facts, has chosen to hold that 
in the bills there is a separate charge made as 
content development concept design, photography 
scanning and other charges such as system charges 
including colour sketch pen or computer used 
design software etc.  Ultimately, the brochures 
come out.  Considering the entire ambit of activity 
of the dealer, it is seen that it is a comprehensive 
contract or supply of printed material developed by 
the company.  The bills also indicate the entire 
activity tantamounts to making indivisible contract 
in a divisible contract.  The subsequent 
rectification application made by the applicant 
dated 24.12.2005 was not considered by the 
authority in terms of Annexure-H, after noticing 
the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of 
Associated Cement Companites Ltd. (Stated 
supra).  Therefore, it is clear that there is no 
mistake apparent on the face of the record.  We are 
in full agreement with the impugned orders at 
Annexure-A &amp; H.

</p><p id="p_42">9.	Mr. Joseph Vellapalli, learned senior counsel appearing for the 
appellant, would submit that 
(1)	the High Court committed a serious error in passing the impugned 
judgment in so far as in the event the contract is held to be an 
indivisible one, the service element thereof being subject to service 
tax, no sales tax could have been levied on the incidental transfer 
of goods unless such transfer falls within the scope and ambit of 
one of the provisions contained in sub-clauses (a) to (f) of clause 
(29A) of <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_6">Article 366</a> of the Constitution of India.
(2)	Appellant being an advertising agency, i.e., providing professional 
services, is not liable to pay Value Added Tax (VAT) upon 
application of dominion nature test or otherwise.
(3)	From the orders of the assessment passed by the Assessing 
Authority itself, it would appear that a portion of the contract is 
often out sourced in which event, sale of goods are shown by the 
appellant as a second sale.
</p><p id="p_43">(4)	 On an indivisible contract, in view of the decisions of this Court in 
<a href="/doc/1425329/" id="a_7">The State of Madras v. Gannon Dunkerley &amp; Co., (Madras) Ltd</a>. 
[1959 SCR 379]; <a href="/doc/557776/" id="a_8">M/s. Gannon Dunkerley &amp; Co. &amp; Ors. v. State of 
Rajasthan &amp; Ors</a>.  [(1993) 1 SCC 364], no VAT would be payable.  
(5)	In any event, advertisement not being goods, they cannot be 
bought and sold in an open market being customer specific.
</p><p id="p_44">10.	Mr. Hegde, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents-
State, on the other hand, submitted that  
</p><p id="p_45">(i) 	an entire transaction is a composite whole inasmuch as all what was 
transferred is the documents containing not only the value of the 
goods but also the soft skill involved therein; and
</p><p id="p_46">(ii)  	Taxable value of goods is what the buyer is buying and in view of the 
fact that when by some creativity the value of the goods is enhanced, 
the entire value has rightly been held to be taxable.
	Strong reliance in this connection has been placed on Associated 
Cement Company (supra) as also the Constitution Bench decision of this 
Court in Tata Consultency and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. v. Union of India 
[(2006) 3 SCC 1].  
</p><p id="p_47">11.	At the outset, we must express our reservation in regard to the 
question as to whether the appellant having already undergone the process of 
regular assessment before the assessing authority, an application under 
Section 60 of the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 was maintainable.  
The purpose for which such a proceeding is taken recourse to is well known.  
When a decision of a competent authority is not known and an entrepreneur 
intends to know as to what would be his liability under the taxing statute, 
such a proceeding is ordinarily taken recourse to.  But it is not necessary for 
us to consider the matter any further.
	In this case, the order of assessment was complete.  The State did not 
prefer any appeal thereagainst. The process of accounting or the 
methodology adopted by the assessee for the purpose of payment of both 
service tax as also the value added tax attained finality at least for that year.  
</p><p id="p_48">12.	Be that as it may, as the order of the competent authority under 
<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_9">Section 60</a> of the Act would be binding on the assessing authority, in future 
also, we may examine the merit of the matter. 
</p><p id="p_49">13.	The fact that the appellant is a service provider is not in dispute.  It is 
also not in dispute that the orders received by it to provide such services is 
party specific and issue specific; be it for issuance of a brochure or a year 
book or for any other purpose.
</p><p id="p_50">	Appellant, in their returns, made three categorical divisions in regard 
to its tax liabilities (1) The amount of service tax on the specific design and 
production; (2) The amount of Kerala Sales Tax on the specified item on the 
first sale; and (3) when certain items are outsourced, the tax payable on 
resale of the said goods in terms of Section 6(4) of the Kerala Sales Tax Act.
</p><p id="p_51">14.	The Tribunal as also the High Court opined that the contract was an 
indivisible one.  The effect of such an indivisible contract, vis-`-vis work 
contract came up for consideration before this Court in <a href="/doc/1425329/" id="a_10">The State of Madras 
v. Gannon Dunkerley &amp; Co., (Madras) Ltd</a>. [1959 SCR 379] wherein it was 
clearly held :
</p><p id="p_52">To avoid misconception, it must be stated that the 
above conclusion has reference to works contracts, 
which are entire and indivisible, as the contracts of 
the respondents have been held by the learned 
Judges of the Court below to be.  The several 
forms which such kinds of contracts can assume 
are set out in Hudson on Building Contracts, at 
p.165.  It is possible that the parties might enter 
into distinct and for money consideration, and the 
other for payment of remuneration for services and 
for work done.

</p><p id="p_53">15.	The Parliament amended the Constitution to insert clause 29-A in 
<a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_11">Article 366</a> of the Constitution of India, Sub-clauses (a) to (f) whereof read 
thus :
</p><p id="p_54">(29A) "tax on the sale or purchase of goods" 
includes

</p><p id="p_55">(a) a tax on the transfer, otherwise than in 
pursuance of a contract, of property in any goods 
for cash, deferred payment or other valuable 
consideration;
</p>
<p id="p_56">(b) a tax on the transfer of property in goods 
(whether as goods or in some other form) involved 
in the execution of a works contract;
</p>
<p id="p_57">(c) a tax on the delivery of goods on hire-purchase 
or any system of payment by installments;
</p>
<p id="p_58">(d) a tax on the transfer of the right to use any 
goods for any purpose (whether or not for a 
specified period) for cash, deferred payment or 
other valuable consideration;
</p>
<p id="p_59">(e) a tax on the supply of goods by any 
unincorporated association or body of persons to a 
member thereof for cash, deferred payment or 
other valuable consideration;
</p>
<p id="p_60">(f) a tax on the supply, by way of or as part of any 
service or in any other manner whatsoever, of 
goods, being food or any other article for human 
consumption or any drink (whether or not 
intoxicating), where such supply or service, is for 
cash, deferred payment or other valuable 
consideration,

and such transfer, delivery or supply of any goods 
shall be deemed to be a sale of those goods by the 
person making the transfer, delivery or supply and 
a purchase of those goods by the person to whom 
such transfer, delivery or supply is made.

</p><p id="p_61">16.	By reason of the said provision, therefore, a legal fiction was created 
so as to make the supply of goods involved in a works contract, subject to 
tax.  A transaction of the present description was not contemplated.
</p><p id="p_62">     The question came for consideration again in Builders <a href="/doc/732612/" id="a_12">Association of 
India &amp; Ors. v. Union of India &amp; Ors</a>. [(1989) 2 SCC 645] and <a href="/doc/557776/" id="a_13">M/s.Gannon 
Dunkerley &amp; Co. &amp; Ors. v. State of Rajasthan &amp; Ors</a>. [(1993) 1 SCC 364].  
It has expressly been laid down therein that the effect of amendment by 
introduction of clause 29A in <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_14">Article 366</a> is that by legal fiction, certain 
indivisible contracts are deemed to be divisible into contract of sale of goods 
and contract of service.  In Gannon Dunkerley case (supra), it had been held:
Keeping in view the legal fiction introduced by 
the Forty-sixth Amendment whereby the works 
contract which was entire and indivisible has been 
altered into a contract which is divisible into one 
for sale of goods and other for supply of labour 
and services, the value of the goods involved in the 
execution of a works contract on which tax is 
leviable must exclude the charges which appertain 
to the contract for supply of labour and services.


</p><p id="p_63">17.	We may also notice that a Constitution Bench of this Court in Tata 
Consultancy Services (supra), opined that having regard to the definition of 
the term goods contained in clause (12) of <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_15">Article 366</a> of the Constitution 
of India, a software programme may consist of various commands which 
enable the computer to perform a designated task.  The copyright in that 
programme may remain with the originator of the programme, but the 
moment copies are made and marketed, it becomes goods, which are 
susceptible to sales tax.
</p><p id="p_64">	In regard to the element of intellectual property, it was held that the 
same having been incorporated on a media,  for purposes of transfer, both 
tangible and intangible property capable of being transmitted, transferred, 
delivered, stored and possessed etc. would come within the purview thereof.  
It was opined :
</p><p id="p_65">Thus, even unbranded software, when it is 
marketed/sold, may be goods.  We, however, are 
not dealing with this aspect and express no opinion 
thereon because in case of unbranded software 
other questions like situs of contract of sale and/or 
whether the contract is a service contract may 
arise.

</p><p id="p_66">18.	We may, furthermore, notice that therein one of us, in a separate but 
concurring judgment, opined as under :
78. A software may be intellectual property but such 
personal intellectual property contained in a medium 
is bought and sold. It is an article of value. It is sold in 
various forms like  floppies, disks, CD-ROMs, 
punchcards, magnetic tapes, etc. Each one of the 
mediums in which the intellectual property is 
contained is a marketable commodity. They are 
visible to the senses. They may be a medium through 
which the intellectual property is transferred but for 
the purpose of determining the question as regard s 
leviability of the tax under a fiscal statute, it may not 
make a difference. A program containing instructions 
in computer language is subject-matter of a licence. It 
has its value to the buyer. It is useful to the person 
who intends to use the hardware viz. the computer in 
an effective manner so as to enable him to obtain the 
desired results. It indisputably becomes an object of 
trade and commerce. These mediums containing the 
intellectual property are not only easily available in 
the market for a price but are circulated as a 
commodity in the market. Only because an instruction 
manual designed to instruct use and installation of the 
supplier program is supplied with the software, the 
same would not necessarily mean that it would cease 
to be a goods. Such instructions contained in the 
manual are supplied with several other goods 
including electronic ones. What is essential for an 
article to become goods is its marketability. 

</p><p id="p_67">19.	The question yet again came up for consideration before a Three 
Judge Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/6544121/" id="a_16">Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. v. Union of India</a> 
(supra) wherein it was held;
</p><p id="p_68">44. Of all the different kinds of composite 
transactions the drafters of the Forty-sixth 
Amendment chose three specific situations, a works 
contract, a hire-purchase contract and a catering 
contract to bring them within the fiction of a deemed 
sale. Of these three, the first and third involve a kind 
of service and sale at the same time. Apart from these 
two cases where splitting of the service and supply 
has been constitutionally permitted in sub-clauses ( b ) 
and ( f ) of clause (29-A) of <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_17">Article 366</a>, there is no 
other service which has been permitted to be so split. 
For example, the sub-clauses of <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_18">Article 366(29-A)</a> do 
not cover hospital services. Therefore, if during the 
treatment of a patient in a hospital, he or she is given a 
pill, can the Sales Tax Authorities tax the transaction 
as a sale? Doctors, lawyers and other professionals 
render service in the course of which can it be said 
that there is a sale of goods when a doctor writes out 
and hands over a prescription or a lawyer drafts a 
document and delivers it to his/her client? Strictly 
speaking, with the payment of fees, consideration 
does pass from the patient or client to the doctor or 
lawyer for the documents in both cases. 
</p><p id="p_69">45. The reason why these services do not involve a 
sale for the purposes of Entry 54 of List II is, as we 
see it, for reasons ultimately attributable to the 
principles enunciated in Gannon Dunkerley case 5, 
namely, if there is an instrument of contract which 
may be composite in form in any case other than the 
exceptions in <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_19">Article 366(29-A</a>), unless the 
transaction in truth represents two distinct and 
separate contracts and is discernible as such, then the 
State would not have the power to separate the 
agreement to sell from the agreement to render 
service, and impose tax on the sale. The test therefore 
for composite contracts other than those mentioned in 
<a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_20">Article 366(29-A)</a> continues to be: Did the partie s 
have in mind or intend separate rights arising out of 
the sale of goods? If there was no such intention there 
is no sale even if the contract could be disintegrated. 
The test for deciding whether a contract falls into one 
category or the other is to as what is the substance of 
the contract. We will, for the want of a better phrase, 
call this the dominant nature test. 
</p><p id="p_70">50. What are the goods in a sales transaction, 
therefore, remains primarily a matter of contract and 
intention. The seller and such purchaser would have to 
be ad idem as to the subject-matter of sale or 
purchase. The court would have to arrive at the 
conclusion as to what the parties had intended when 
they entered into a particular transaction of sale, as 
being the subject-matter of sale or purchase. In 
arriving at a conclusion the court would have to 
approach the matter from the point of view of a 
reasonable person of average intelligence. 

</p><p id="p_71">20. 	We may, at this juncture, also notice the decision of this Court in 
Associated Cement Company (supra).  The question which arose for 
consideration therein was as to whether any intellectual property contained 
in a software would be subject to custom duty within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1365818/" id="a_21">Section 
2(22)</a> of the Customs Act, defining goods.  A three Judge Bench of this 
Court sought to make a distinction between such a contingency arising under 
the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_22">Customs Act</a> involving a works contract and a contract of sale stating :
32. In the sales tax cases referred to hereinabove no 
doubt the question which arose was whether in a 
works contract, where there was a supply of materials 
and services in an indivisible contract, but there the 
question had arisen because the States powers prior 
to the Forty-sixth Amendment to the Constitution, 
were not entitled to bifurcate or split up the contract 
for the purpose of levying sales tax on the element of 
moveable goods involved in the contract. Apart from 
the decision in Rainbow Colour Lab case 11 which 
does not appear to be correct, the other decisions cited 
related to the pre-Forty-sixth Amendment period. 
Furthermore, the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_23">Customs Act</a> and 
the <a href="/doc/442204/" id="a_24">Tariff Act</a> are clear and unambiguous. Any 
moveable articles, irrespective of what they may be or 
may contain, would be goods as defined in <a href="/doc/1365818/" id="a_25">Section 
2(22)</a> of the Customs Act. 

</p><p id="p_72">21.	Evidently, therefore, the decision of Associated Cement Company 
Supra) whereupon strong reliance has been placed by the Tribunal as also by 
the High Court seeks to make a distinction between cases arising out of 
works contract wherefor sales tax is liable to be paid and the cases under the 
<a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_26">Customs Act</a>.  
</p><p id="p_73">22.	Our attention has furthermore been drawn to the decision of this Court 
in Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. (supra) wherein referring to Tata Consultancy 
(supra) it was observed that the approach of this Court in the said decision as 
to what would be goods for the purpose of sales tax is correct.  
</p><p id="p_74">23.	What, however, did not fall for consideration in any of the 
aforementioned decisions is the concept of works contract involving both 
service as also supply of goods constituting a sale.  Both, in Tata 
Consultancy (supra) as also in Associated Cement Company (supra), what 
was in issue was the value of the goods and only for the said purpose, this 
Court went by the definition thereof both under the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_27">Customs Act</a> as also the 
<a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_28">Sales Tax Act</a> to hold that the same must have the attributes of its utility, 
capability of being bought and sold and capability of being transmitted, 
transferred, delivered, stored and possessed.  As a software was found to be 
having the said attributes, they were held to be goods.  
</p><p id="p_75">24.	We have, however, a different problem at hand.  Appellant admittedly 
is a service provider.   When it provides for service, it is assessable to a tax 
known as service tax.  Such tax is leviable by reason of a Parliamentary 
statute.  In the matter of interpretation of a taxing statute, as also other 
statutes where the applicability of <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_29">Article 246</a> of the Constitution of India, 
read with Seventh Schedule thereof is in question, the Court may have to 
take recourse to various theories including aspect theory, as was noticed by 
this Court in Federation of Hotel &amp; Restaurant Association of India, etc. v. 
Union of India&amp; Ors. [(1989) 3 SCC 634].
</p><p id="p_76">25.	If the submission of Mr. Hegde is accepted in its entirety, whereas on 
the one hand, the Central Government would be deprived of obtaining any 
tax whatsoever under the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_30">Finance Act</a>, 1994, it is possible to arrive at a 
conclusion that no tax at all would be payable as the tax has been held to be 
an indivisible one.  A distinction must be borne in mind between an 
indivisible contract and a composite contract.  If in a contract,  an element to 
provide service is contained, the purport and object for which the 
Constitution had to be amended and clause 29A had to be inserted in <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_31">Article 
366</a>, must be kept in mind. 
</p><p id="p_77">26.	We have noticed hereinbefore that a legal fiction is created by reason 
of the said provision.  Such a legal fiction, as is well known, should be 
applied only to the extent for which it was enacted.  It, although must be 
given its full effect but the same would not mean that it should be applied 
beyond a point which was not contemplated by the legislature or which 
would lead to an anomaly or absurdity.  
</p><p id="p_78">27.	The Court, while interpreting a statute, must bear in mind that the 
legislature was supposed to know law and the legislation enacted is a 
reasonable one.  The Court must also bear in mind that where the application 
of a Parliamentary and a <a href="/doc/1369884/" id="a_32">Legislative Act</a> comes up for consideration; 
endeavours shall be made to see that provisions of both the acts are made 
applicable.  
</p><p id="p_79">28.	Payments of service tax as also the VAT are mutually exclusive.   
Therefore, they should be held to be applicable having regard to the 
respective parameters of service tax and the sales tax as envisaged in a 
composite contract as contradistinguished from an indivisible contract.  It 
may consist of different elements providing for attracting different nature of 
levy.   It is, therefore, difficult to hold that in a case of this nature, sales tax 
would be payable on the value of the entire contract; irrespective of the 
element of service provided.  The approach of the assessing authority, to us, 
thus, appears to be correct. 
</p><p id="p_80">34.	We may notice that the concept of aspects theory whcih had found 
echoes in <a href="/doc/90703/" id="a_33">State of U.P. Another v. Union of India &amp; Anr</a>. [(2003) 3 SCC 
239] has expressly been overruled by a Three Judge Bench in Bharat 
Sanchar Nigam Ltd. (supra) stating :
</p><p id="p_81">78. But if there are no deliverable goods in existence 
as in this case, there is no transfer of user at all. 
Providing access or telephone connection does not put 
the subscriber in possession of the electromagnetic 
waves any more than a toll collector puts a road or 
bridge into the possession of the toll payer by lifting a 
toll gate. Of course the toll payer will use the road or 
bridge in one sense. But the distinction with a sale of 
goods is that the user would be of the thing or goods 
delivered. The delivery may not be simultaneous with 
the transfer of the right to use. But the goods must be 
in existence and deliverable when the right is sought 
to be transferred.
</p><p id="p_82">79. Therefore whether goods are incorporeal or 
corporeal, tangible or intangible, they must be 
deliverable. To the extent that the decision in <a href="/doc/90703/" id="a_34">State of 
U.P. v. Union of India</a> held otherwise, it was, in our 
humble opinion erroneous.

</p><p id="p_83">35.	For the reasons aforementioned, the impugned judgment cannot be 
sustained.  It is set aside accordingly.  The Appeal is allowed.  No costs.
