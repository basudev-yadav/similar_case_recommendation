ACT:
Maintenance  of	 Internal  Security Act,  1971	(Act  26  of
1971)--Constitutional  validity--Act  Whether  violative  of
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_1">Article	 14</a><a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_2">,  19</a><a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_3">, 21</a> and <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_4">22--</a>Held, the Act does	 not  suffer
from any constitutional infirmity.



HEADNOTE:
The petitioners were detained under the Act for acting in  a
manner	prejudicial  to	 the  maintenance  of  supplies	 and
services  essential to the community.  In the one case,	 the
ground	of  detention was that the petitioner  in  collusion
with  his  father  had hoarded foodgrains, that	 he  had  no
licence	 as required by the anti-hoarding control Order	 and
that  he  was  likely  to  withheld  or	 impede	 supply	  of
foodstuffs or rationed articles essential to the  community.
In the other case, the grounds were that the petitioner	 and
his associates had smuggled 115 bags of rice covered by coal
by engaging lorry without any valid permit or authority	 and
in  violation  of control order and tried to  frustrate	 the
food and procurement policy of the Govt. and thus acted in a
manner	prejudicial  to	 the  maintenance  of  supplies	 and
services   Annual   to	the  community.	   The	 petitioners
challenged the respective orders of detention as having been
made for a collateral purpose and contended that The Act was
violative of Articles 14, 19, 21 and 22 of the	Constitution
of India.  Dismissing the Writ petitions,
HELD  :	 (1) <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_5">Article 14</a> is inapplicable	 because  preventive
detention and Prosecution are not synonymous.  The  purposes
are  different.	 The authorities are different.	 The  nature
of proceedings is different.  In a prosecution an accused is
sought	to  be	punished  for a	 past  act.   In  preventive
detention, the past act is merely the material for inference
about  the future course of probable conduct on the part  of
the detenu. [787H]
The  principles	 which	can be	broadly	 stated	 are  these.
First,	merely because a detenu is liable to be tried  in  a
criminal  court for the commission of a criminal offence  or
to be proceeded against for preventing him front  committing
offences dealt with in Chapter VIII of the Code of  Criminal
Procedure  would not by itself debar the Govt.	from  taking
action	for his detention under the Act.  Second,  the	fact
that  Police  arrests a person and later on enfargs  him  on
bail and initiates steps to prosecute him under the Code  of
Criminal  Procedure  and  even lodges  a  first	 information
report may be no bar against the District Magistrate issuing
an  order under the preventive detention.  Third, where	 the
concerned  person  is actually in jail custody at  the	time
when an order of detention is passed against him and is	 not
likely	to be released for a fair length of time, it may  be
possible  to contend that there could be no satisfaction  on
the part of the detaining authority as to the likelihood  of
such a person indulging in activities which would jeopardise
the security of the State or public order.  Fourth, the mere
circumstance  that  a detention order is passed	 during	 the
pendency  of  the prosecution will not	violate	 the  order.
Fifth, the order of detention is a precautionay measure.  It
is  based on a reasonable prognosis of the future  behaviour
of  a person based on his past conduct in the light  of	 the
surrounding circumstances. [788B-F]

1161 overruled.
(ii) The Constitution has conferred rights under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_10">Art. 19</a> and
also  adopted  preventive detention to prevent	the  greater
evil  of elements imperilling the security, the safety of  a
State and the welfare of the nation.  It is not possible  to
think that a person who is detained will yet be free to move
or assemble or form associations or unions or have the right
to reside in any part of India or have the freedom of speech
or expression.	A law which attracts <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_11">Art. 19</a> therefore	must
be such as is capable of being tested to be reasonable under
clauses (2) to (5) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_12">Art. 19.</a> [784C-E]
On  the	 assumption  that the Act which	 is  for  preventive
detention,  may be tested with regard to its  reasonableness
with  reference	 to  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_13">Art. 19</a>, Sec. 3 of the  Art  is  to  be
interpreted in the light of various existing statutes  which
deal  with various acts mentioned in Section 3. The  section
provides for the detention of persons to prevent likely acts
of come or acts which fall within its ambit. [785A-<a href="/doc/1857950/" id="a_14">D]
A. K. Gopalan v. The State of Madras</a>, 1950 SCR 88 and Rustom
Cavasjee  Cooper  etc.	v.  Union of  India  &amp;	other  (Bank
Nationalization case) (1970) 3 SCR 530 referred to.
It is an established rule of this Court that a detenu has  a
right to be apprised of all the materials on which the order
of detention is based or approved.  The only exception is as
provided  in clauses (6) and (8) of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_15">Art. 22</a> where it is	 not
necessary to disclose facts which may be against the  public
interest to disclose. [785D-E]
Procedural reasonableness flows from <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_16">Art. 19.</a>  Principles of
natural	  justice   are	 an  element  in   considering	 the
reasonableness of a restriction where <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_17">Art. 19</a> is applicable.
There  is an obligation on the State and the Advisory  Board
to consider the representation of a detenu.  There should be
a  real and proper consideration.  The duty to consider	 the
representation	does  not  mean a personal  hearing  or	 the
disclosure  of reasons.	 There cannot be any abstract  stan-
dard  or general pattern of procedural reasonableness.	 The
nature of the right infringed, the underlying purpose of the
restrictions  imposed,	the extent and Urgency of  the	evil
sought	to  be	remedied thereby the  disproportion  of	 the
imposition,  the  prevailing  conditions at  the  time,	 all
provide	 the basis for considering the reasonableness  of  a
particular  provision.	 Fairness  denotes  abstention	from
abuse of discretion.  Even if <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_18">Art. 19</a> be examined in  regard
to preventive detention it does not increase the content  of
reasonableness required to be observed in respect of  orders
of preventive detention. [786E-H]
(ii)   Art   22(5)   speaks  of	  liberty   and	  making   a
representation.	  The combined result of clause (4),  (5)  &amp;
(6)   of  <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_19">Art.	22</a>  is	that  a	 procedure   which   permits
representation	will  give all the facts before	 the  Board.
<a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_20">Art. 22(5)</a> shows that the law as to detention is  necessary.
The  requirements  of that law are to be found	in  <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_21">Art.  22</a>
which  gives  the  mandate as to what will  happen  in	such
circumstances.	  The	Article	  lays	 down	 substantive
limitations   as   well	 as  procedural	  safeguards.	 The
principles  of	natural	 justice  in  so  far  as  they	 are
compatible with detention laws find place in <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_22">Art. 22</a>  itself
and also in the Act. [785H-786B; 787D-E]
Section 8 of the Act which casts an obligation on the  State
to  consider the representation affords the detenu  all	 the
rights which are guaranteed by Art
780
22(5).	 The  section is in complete  conformity  With	<a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_23">Art.
22(5)</a> because it follows the provisions of the Constitution.
The   Govt.  considers	the  representation   to   ascertain
essentialy whether the order is in conformity with the power
Linder	the  law.  The Board. on the other  hand,  considers
whether	 in  the  light	 of  ,he  representation  there	  is
sufficient cause for detention. [785G; 786H-787B]
Sec.  14 of the Act clothes the authority with the power  of
revoking or modifying the detention order at any time.	Such
a power which is for the benefit of the detenu carries	with
it  the duty to exercise that power whenever and as soon  as
changed or new factors call for the exercise of that  power.
This  shows that the authorities can consider new  facts  or
changed circumstances. [785C-<a href="/doc/882228/" id="a_24">D]
Fagu  Shaw    v. State of West	Bengal</a>	AIR  1974  S.C.	 613
referred to.
For the foregoing reasons, the Act does not suffer from	 any
constitutional infirmity. [788F]

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
RAY, C.J. The constitutional validity of the Maintenance  of
Internal  Security  Act, 1971 being Act No. 26	of  1971  is
challenged in these petitions.
</p><p id="p_3">First,	it is said that the law of preventive  detention  is
unreasonable,  and,  therefore,	 it  violates  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_26">Article	 19.</a>
Second, it is said that the Act violates <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_27">Article 21</a>  because
the  guarantee of a right to be heard is infringed.   Third,
it is said that the Act does not lay down the just procedure
for giving effect to <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_28">Article 22(5).</a>  Fourth, it is said
that the Act   violates	  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_29">Article  14</a>  because	it   permits
discrimination.
</p><p id="p_4">The Act	  confers  power  on the Central Government  or	 the
State Government    to	make orders directing  detention  of
persons.  Section 3 of the Act	   provides  that  when	 the
Central Government or the State Government   is	   satisfied
with  respect to any person that with a view  to  preventing
him from acting in any manner prejudicial to (i) the defence
of India, the relations of India with foreign powers, or the
security of India, or (ii) the security of the State or	 the
maintenance  of	 public order, or (iii) the  maintenance  of
supplies  and services essential to the community,  District
Magistrates,	Additional    District	  Magistrates	  or
Commissioners of Police can pass orders of detention.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">781</span>
<p id="p_5">The  Act provides in sub-sections (3) and (4) of  section  3
that when any order is made for detention the officer  shall
forthwith  report the fact to the State Government with	 the
grounds	 on  which the order has been made  and	 such  other
particulars as in his opinion have a bearing on the  matter.
Further no order shall remain in force for more than  twelve
days after the making thereof unless in the meantime it	 has
been approved by the State Government.	The proviso to	sub-
section (3) states that where under section 8 the grounds of
detention are communicated by the authority making the order
after  five  days but not later than fifteen days  from	 the
date  of detention, this subsection shall apply	 subject  to
the modification that for the words "twelve days", the words
"twenty-two  days" shall be substituted.  When any order  is
made  or  approved  by	the  State  Government,	 the   State
Government shall, within seven days, report the fact to	 the
Central	 Government together with the grounds on  which	 the
order  has  been made and such other particulars as  in	 the
opinion,  (-if	the State Government have a bearing  on	 the
necessity for the order.
</p><p id="p_6">Section	 7 of the Act states that if the Central  Government
or   the  State	 Government  or	 an  officer  specified	  in
Subsection (2) of section 3 of the Act has reason to believe
that a person in respect of whom a detention order has	been
made  has  absconded or is concealing himself, a  report  in
writing	 is  to be made to the Presidency  Magistrate  or  a
Magistrate of the first class.	Thereafter the provisions of
<a href="/doc/449333/" id="a_30">sections  87</a>,  <a href="/doc/719844/" id="a_31">88</a> and <a href="/doc/210095/" id="a_32">89</a> of the Code of	 Criminal  Procedure
1898 (now the corresponding sections in the 1973 Act)  shall
apply  in respect of the said person and his property as  if
the  order  directing  that he be detained  were  a  warrant
issued	by  the	 Magistrate.  An order can  also  be  passed
directing  such person to appear and if he fails  to  comply
with  the directions he shall unless he proves that  it	 was
not  possible for him to comply therewith and that  he	had,
within	the  period  specified in the  order,  informed	 the
officer	 of the reason which rendered  compliance  therewith
impossible  and	 of  his  whereabouts,	be  punishable	with
imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with
fine or with both.
</p><p id="p_7"><a href="/doc/1663045/" id="a_33">Section	 8</a>  provides  that when a  person  is  detained	 the
authority  making  the order shall, as soon as may  be,	 but
ordinarily  not	 later	than five days	and  in	 exceptional
circumstances not later than fifteen days, from the date  of
detention, communicate to him the ground on which the  order
has been made and shall afford him the opportunity of making
a  representation  against  the	 order	to  the	 appropriate
Government.
</p><p id="p_8">The Government constitutes one or more Advisory Boards.	 The
Board shall consist-of three persons who are, or have  been,
or are qualified to be appointed as, Judges of a High Court.
The appropriate Government shall appoint one of the  members
of  the Advisory Board who is, or has been, a Judge  of	 the
High  Court to be its Chairman.	 A detention order is to  be
placed	before	the Advisory Board within 30 days  from	 the
date of detention under the order.  The grounds:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">782</span>
<p id="p_9">of   detention,	 the  representation  made  by	the   person
concerned  and	the report of the officer making  the  order
shall  be placed before, the Advisory Board.  These are	 the
provisions of section 10 of the Act.
</p><p id="p_10">The Advisory Board under section 11 of the Act shall,  after
considering  the  materials  placed  before  it	 and,  after
calling	 for  such  further  information  as  it  may	deem
necessary from the appropriate Government or from any person
called for the purpose through the appropriate Government or
from the person concerned and if, in any particular case, it
considers it essential so to do or if the, person  concerned
desires to be heard, after hearing him in person, submit its
report	to the appropriate Government within 10	 weeks	from
the  date  of detention.  The report of the  Advisory  Beard
shall specify in a separate part thereof the opinion of	 the
Advisory  Board	 as to whether or not  there  is  sufficient
cause for the detention of the person concerned. If here  is
a  difference of opinion of the Advisory Board, the  opinion
of  the majority of such members shall be deemed to be	the,
opinion of the Board.  A person against,whom detention order
has  been  made	 is  not  entitled  to	appear	by  a  legal
practitioner before the Advisory Board.
</p><p id="p_11">Under section 12 of the Act where the Advisory Board has re-
ported that there is sufficient cause for the detention of a
person, the appropriate Government may confirm the detention
order  and continue the detention of the  person  concerned.
It  the Advisory Board reports that there is  no  sufficient
cause for detention the appropriate  Government shall revoke
the detention order.
</p><p id="p_12"><a href="/doc/862285/" id="a_34">Section 14</a> provides that without prejudice to the provisions
of  <a href="/doc/141478/" id="a_35">section 21</a> of the General Clauses Act, 1897 a  detention
order  may,  at	 any time, be  revoked	by  the	 appropriate
Government.
</p><p id="p_13"><a href="/doc/223624/" id="a_36">Section 15</a> provides that the appropriate Government may,  at
any time, direct the release of any person detained  without
conditions   or	 upon  such  conditions	 specified  in	 the
direction.  The Government may also cancel his release.
In  the	 background  of	 these provisions  of  the  Act	 the
petitioners  contend as follows : <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_37">The Act</a> does	not  provide
for  an objective determination of the facts which  are	 the
foundation of a decision for detention.	 The opportunity  to
make a representation cannot be reasonable if the order does
not  disclose  the  material  on  the  basis  of  which	 the
detaining authority arrives at a conclusion that grounds for
detention exist.  The representation cannot be reasonable if
the  detenu  has  no opportunity to test the  truth  of	 the
materials relied on for detention.  <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_38">The Act</a> does not  define
or  lay down the standards for objective assessment  of	 the
grounds	 for  detention.   <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_39">The	Act</a>  does  not,	 oblige	 the
Government to consider the representation against  detention
and  decide  every  detention on facts and  on	law  against
grounds communicated to the detenu.
</p><p id="p_14">In short, it is said that the order of detention should	 set
out all. the materials on the basis of which the appropriate
Government comes
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">783</span>
to  a  conclusion that it is necessary to detain  a  person.
Mere  recital in the order that with a view to preventing  a
person	from acting in any manner prejudical to the  defence
of India, the relations of India with foreign powers, or the
security  of  India,  or the security of the  State  or	 the
maintenance of public order, or the maintenance of  supplies
and services essential to the community does not enable	 the
person	detained to attack the grounds for detention and  to
prove by material in rebutal his innocence by  consideration
of the representation.
</p><p id="p_15">The  petitioners contend that the Act permits detention	 for
two  years  and	 even  until the expiry	 of  the  period  of
proclamation   of   emergency  and  therefore	it   is	  an
unreasonable restriction in violation of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_40">Article 19</a>  without
a six monthly review with a judicial approach.	With  regard
to  the	 report of the Advisory Board it is  said  that	 the
reasons	 for rejecting representation must be  available  to
the person detained.  This is said to be necessary to enable
the  person  detained  to  come up,  before  the  Court	 for
judicial review and in aid of his right to liberty,
The   petitioners,  therefore,	contend	 that  the  law	  of
preventive  detention  is  unreasonable,  in  violation	  of
<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_41">Article 19</a> inasmuch as the, order of detention can be passed
on  acts sought to be prevented which acts are not  defined.
It is said that the power is so unguided that acts forbidden
and  acts not forbidden by law are treated, alike to be	 the
foundation for detention.
</p><p id="p_16">The petitioners contend that <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_42">Article 21</a> is violated  because
a detenu is not given the right to be heard on all facts and
circumstances.	  The	petitioners  submit   that   whether
deprivation of liberty is punitive or preventive, the  right
to be heard is guaranteed by <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_43">Article 21.</a>
</p><p id="p_17">The  petitioners contend that <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_44">Article 22</a> is violated by	 the
Act  because it does not provide for impartial and  judicial
consideration of, the representation by the Government.	 <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_45">The
Act</a>  merely  reproduces	 the language of  <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_46">Article  22</a>  which
creates a fetter on the power GI the legislature.  <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_47">This	 Act</a>
does  not  provide any machinery and  jug(.,  procedure	 for
giving	effect	to  <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_48">Article 22(5).</a>  The acts  sought  to  be
prevented  and which are mentioned as grounds for  detention
are not defined.  Therefore power A unguided and un-bridled.
<a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_49">The  Act</a>  is  so framed by reproducing	<a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_50">Article	 22(5)</a>	that
nothing is shown to spell out the requirements of  procedure
available  in a reasonable manner. to ensure fair  play	 and
justice against grounds communicated and not withheld  under
<a href="/doc/1782826/" id="a_51">Article 22(6).</a>
</p><p id="p_18">Finally, the petitioners contended that <a href="/doc/174566148/" id="a_52">section 3</a> of the Act
violated  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_53">Article 14</a> because it permits the same offence  to
be  a ground for detention in different	 and  discriminatory
ways.	The petitioners submit that A may be prosecuted	 but
not  detained  preventively or B may not be  prosecuted	 but
only  detained preventively or C may be prosecuted and	also
detained preventively.
</p><p id="p_19">The  essential concept of preventive detention is  that	 the
detention of a person is not to punish him for something  he
has done but to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">784</span>
prevent	 him from doing it.  The, basis of detention is	 the
satisfaction of the executive of a reasonable probability of
the  likelihood of the detenu acting in a manner similar  to
his past acts and preventing him by detention from doing the
same.  A criminal conviction on the other hand is for an act
already done which can only be possible by a trial and legal
evidence.   There  is no parallel between prosecution  in  a
Court of law and a detention order under the Act.  One is  a
punitive action and the other is a preventive act.  In	one,
case  a	 person	 is  punished to prove	his  guilt  and	 the
standard  is  proof  beyond  reasonable	 doubt	whereas	  in
preventive detention a man is prevented from doing something
which it is necessary for reasons mentioned in <a href="/doc/174566148/" id="a_54">section 3</a>  of
the Act to prevent.
</p><p id="p_20">Constitution has conferred rights under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_55">Article 19</a> and	also
adopted preventive detention to prevent the greater evil  of
elements imperiling the security, the safety of a State	 and
the welfare of the Nation.  It is not possible to think that
a  person,  who	 is detained will yet be  free	to  move  or
assemble or form association or unions or have the right  to
reside in any part of India or have the freedom of speech or
expression.  Suppose a person is convicted of an offence  of
cheating  and prosecuted after trial, it is not open to	 say
that  the  imprisonment should be tested with  reference  to
<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_56">Article	 19</a>  for its reasonableness.  A law  which  attracts
<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_57">Article	 19</a>  therefore must be such as is capable  of  being
tested to be reasonable under clauses (2) to (5) of  Article
</p><p id="p_21">19.
This Court in <a href="/doc/1857950/" id="a_58">A. K. Gopalan v. The State of Madras</a> [1950] S.
C. R 88 held that <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_59">Article 22</a> is a complete code and  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_60">Article
19</a>  is not invoked in those cases.  It is now said that	 the
view  in  Gopalan's case (supra) no longer holds  the  field
after the decision in the Bank Nationalisation case [1970] 3
S.C.R.	530.  In the Bank Nationalisation case (supra)	this
Court  held that <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_61">Article 31(2)</a> is not a complete  protection
for acquisition of property by the two tests of authority of
law  and  compensation.	  This Court said  that	 the  direct
impact	of such an act of acquisition might  invade  rights,
under  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_62">Article 19</a>, and, therefore, the acquisition could  be
tested as to whether it was a reasonable restriction on	 the
rights guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_63">Article 19.</a>  <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_64">Article 19(1)(f)</a>  deals
with the right to acquire, hold and dispose of property.  It
is apparent that after a person's property has been acquired
by the State he cannot acquire, hold or dispose of the	same
property.   In the Bank Nationalisation case (supra)  it  is
said  that the acquisition which left the Banks free  to  do
business  other than banking was rendered  unreasonable	 by,
reason	of  the Banks being deprived of the  wherewithal  to
carry  on the business.	 The right guaranteed under  <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_65">Article
19(1)(g)</a> to carry on any occupation, trade or business	were
therefore held to be directly invaded by the nationalisation
of   Banks.    It  is  in  this	 context   that	  the	Bank
Nationalisation	 case (supra) held that in spite of  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_66">Article
31(2).</a> the acquisition of property directly impinged on	 the
right  of the Banks to carry on business other than  Banking
guaranteed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">785</span>
under	<a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_67">Article	 19(1)(g)</a>  and	<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_68">Article	 31(2)</a>	was  not   a
protection against infringement of that guaranteed right.
We  may proceed on the assumption that the Act which is	 for
preventive  detention  may  be tested  with  regard  to	 its
reasonableness	with reference to <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_69">Article 19.</a>  <a href="/doc/174566148/" id="a_70">Section 3</a>  of
the  Act  is  to  be interpreted in  the  light	 of  various
existing Statutes which deal with the various acts mentioned
in  <a href="/doc/174566148/" id="a_71">section  3</a>.	 Acts sought to be prevented  are  found  in
various legislations like the <a href="/doc/774360/" id="a_72">Essential Commodities Act</a>, the
<a href="/doc/902835/" id="a_73">Essential Services Act</a>.	 It is not necessary that the person
to  be detained should have actually committed a crime or  a
forbidden act.	In some cases the person who has not already
committed  a  crime is likely to commit an  act	 to  prevent
which  <a href="/doc/608452/" id="a_74">section	3</a> provides for detention of such  a  person.
Some  times  it	 may be possible that an act  which  is	 not
forbidden  by  law may fall within the ambit of	 <a href="/doc/608452/" id="a_75">section  3</a>,
Such  cases  may  be dealing with relations  of	 India	with
foreign powers or maintenance of public order,
The Preventive Detention Act of 1950 was considered by	this
Court  and. it is an established rule of this Court  that  a
detenu	has a right to be apprised of all the  materials  on
which the order of detention is based or approved.  The only
exception  is as provided in clauses (6) and (8) of  <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_76">Article
22</a> where it is not necessary to disclose facts which may  be
considered to be against the public interest to disclose.
The  representation of a detenu is to be considered.   There
is   an	  obligation   on  the	 State	 to   consider	 the
representation.	  The Advisory Board has adequate  power  to
examine	 the entire materials.	The Board can also call	 for
more  materials.   The	Board may call	the  detenu  at	 his
request.  The constitution of the Board shows that it is  to
consist	 of Judges or persons qualified to be Judges of	 the
High  Court.   The constitution of the	Board  observes	 the
fundamental  of	   fair	 play  and  principles	of,  natural
justice.  It is not the requirement of principles of natural
justice	 that there must be an oral hearing.  <a href="/doc/837552/" id="a_77">Section  8</a>  of
the  Act which casts an obligation on the State to  consider
the  representation affords the detenu all the rights  which
are  guaranteed by <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_78">Article 22(5).</a>  The Government  considers
the  representation  to ascertain  essentially	whether	 the
order  is in conformity with the power under the  law.	 The
Board, on the other hand, considered whether in the light of
the representation there is sufficient cause for detention.
The representation is to be considered by the Advisory Board
by  following the substance of natural justice as far as  it
is  consistent	with  the nature of the	 impugned  Act,	 the
nature of the relative juris  diction of the Government	 and
of  the	 Advisory  Board.   Procedural	reasonableness	 for
natural justice flows from <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_79">Article 19.</a>	<a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_80">Article 22(5)</a> speaks
of  liberty  and  making of  representation.   The  combined
result	of clauses (4), (5) and (6) of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_81">Article 22</a> is that  a
procedure which 4-L192Sup.Cl 75
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">786</span>
permits	 representation will give all the facts	 before	 the
Board.	 <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_82">Article  22(5)</a> shows that law as  to  detention  is
necessary.  The requirements of that law are to be found  in
<a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_83">Article	 22.</a>  <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_84">Article 22</a> gives the mandate as to  what	will
happen in such circumstances.
</p><p id="p_22">The  opinion  of  the  Board as well as	 the  order  of	 the
Government  rejecting the representation of the detenu	must
be after proper consideration.	There need not be a speaking
order.	There is also no failure of justice by the order not
being a speaking order.	 All that is necessary is that there
should be a real and proper consideration by the  Government
and the Advisory Board.
</p><p id="p_23"><a href="/doc/902835/" id="a_85">Section	 14</a> of the Act clothes the authority with the  power
of  revoking or modifying the detention order at  any  time.
Such a power which is for the benefit of the detenu  carries
with it the duty to exercise that power whenever and as soon
as  changed  or new factors call for the  exercise  of	that
power.	 This  shows that the authorities can  consider	 new
factors	 or changed circumstances.  This Court	has  already
held  in Fagu Shaw etc. v. State of West Bengal A.I.R.	1974
S.C. 613 that when Parliament prescribed two years or  until
the expiry of the Defence of India Act, whichever is  later,
it satisfied the requirements of <a href="/doc/504536/" id="a_86">Article 22(7)(b)</a> of  fixing
the  maximum  period.	The further  requirement  of  a	 six
monthly review as contended for by the petitioners  suggests
a new provision.  That does not go to reasonableness but  to
policy of legislature and due process of law.
<a href="/doc/837552/" id="a_87">Section 8</a> of the Act follows the provisions of <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_88">Article 22(5)</a>
of  the	 Constitution.	 <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_89">Article  22(5)</a>	 enjoins  upon	 the
detaining authority obligation to afford the detenu earliest
opportunity  of making a representation against	 the  order.
An opportunity of making a representation cannot be  equated
with  an  opportunity of oral hearing or  hearing  before  a
Court and the procedure of judicial trial.  As long as there
is an opportunity to make a representation against the order
of  detention  and  a  long as a  representation  is  to  be
considered    by   the	 Advisory   Board   there   is	  no
unreasonableness  in regard to the procedure.  The  duty  to
consider the representation does not mean a personal hearing
or  the	 disclosure of reasons.	  Procedural  reasonableness
which is invoked by the petitioners cannot have any abstract
standard  or general pattern of reasonableness.	 The  nature
of  the	 right	infringed, the	underlying  purpose  of	 the
restrictions  imposed,	the extent and urgency of  the	evil
sought	to  be remedied there by, the disproportion  of	 the
imposition,  the  prevailing  conditions at  the  time,	 all
provide	 the basis for considering the reasonableness  of  a
particular provision.  The procedure embodied in the Act has
to be judged in the context of the urgency and the magnitude
of  the problem, the underlying purpose of the	restrictions
and the prevailing conditions.
</p><p id="p_24">Principles of natural justice are an element in	 considering
the  reasonableness  of a restrictions where <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_90">Article  19</a>  is
applicable.  At the stage of consideration of representation
by  the	 State	Government,  the  obligation  of  the  State
Government  is such as <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_91">Article 22(5)</a> implies.  <a href="/doc/837552/" id="a_92">Section 8</a>  of
the Act is in complete conformity with <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_93">Article
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">787</span>
22(5)</a>  because	this section follows the provisions  of	 the
Constitution.	If  the	 representation	 of  the  detenu  is
received  before  the  matter is referred  to  the  Advisory
Board, the detaining authority considers the representation.
If  a  representation  is made after  the  matter  has	been
referred to the Advisory Board, the detaining authority will
consider  it  before  it will  send  representation  to	 the
Advisory Board.
</p><p id="p_25">Elaborate  rules  of  natural justice  are  excluded  either
expressly  or  by  necessary  implication  where  procedural
provisions  are made in the statute or where disclosure,  of
relevant  information  to  an  interested  party  would	  be
contrary  to the public interest.  If a statutory  provision
excludes the   application  of any or all the principles  of
natural justice then the Court	does not  completely  ignore
the mandate of the legislature.	   The	Court  notices	 the
distinction between the duty to act	fairly and a duty to
art  judicially	 in accordance with  natural  justice.	 The
detaining   authority	is  under  a  duty  to	 give	fair
consideration  to the representation made by the detenu	 but
it  is	not  under  a duty to disclose	to  the	 detenu	 any
evidence  or  information.   The  duty	to  act	 fairly	  is
discharged  even it there is not an oral bearing.   Fairness
denotes abstention from abuse of discretion.
<a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_94">Article 22</a> which provides for preventive detention lays down
substantive  limitations as well as  procedural	 safeguards.
The  principles	 of natural justice in so far  as  they	 are
compatible  with  detention laws find place  in	 <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_95">Article  22</a>
itself and also in the Act.  Even if <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_96">Article 19</a> be  examined
in  regard to preventive detention it does not increase	 the
content of reasonableness required to be observed in respect
of orders of preventive detention.  The procedure in the Act
provides  for  fair  consideration  to	the  representation.
Whether in a particular case, a detenu has not been afforded
an  opportunity	 of making a representation or	whether	 the
detaining  authority is abusing the powers of detention	 can
be brought before the Court of Law.
</p><p id="p_26">The power of preventive detention is qualitatively different
from punitive detention.  The power of preventive  detention
is   a	 precautionary	 power	 exercised   in	  reasonable
anticipation.	It may or may not relate to an offence.	  It
is  not	 a parallel proceeding.	 It does not over  lap	with
prosecution  even  if it relies on certain facts  for  which
prosecution  may be launched or may have been  launched.  An
order of preventive detention, may be made before or  during
prosecution.   An order of preventive detention may be	made
with  or  without prosecution and in anticipation  or  after
discharge or even acquittal.  The pendency of prosecution is
no  bar	 to an order of preventive detention.  An  order  of
preventive detention is also not a bar
to prosecution.
</p><p id="p_27"><a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_97">Article 14</a> is inapplicable because preventive detention	 and
prosecution are not synonymous.	 The purposes are different.
The authorities are different.	The nature of proceedings is
different.   In	 a prosecution an accused is  sought  to  be
punished for a past act.  In preventive detention, the	past
act  is merely the material for inference about	 the  future
course of probable conduct on the part of the detenu.

<p id="p_28">The recent decisions of this Court on this subject are many.
The decisions in <a href="/doc/832408/" id="a_98">Borjahan Gorey v. The State of West  Bengal</a>
reported in A.I.R. 1972 S.C. 2256, <a href="/doc/435302/" id="a_99">Ashim Kumar Ray v.  State
of  West  Bengal</a> reported in A.I.R. 1972 S.C.  2561.,  <a href="/doc/358973/" id="a_100">Abdul
Aziz  v. The Distt</a>. Magistrate, Burdwan &amp; Ors.	reported  in
A.I.R.	1973  S.C. 770 and <a href="/doc/353578/" id="a_101">Debu Mahto v. The State  of	West
Bengal</a>	reported in A.I.R. 1974 S C. 816 correctly lay	down
the  principles	 to be followed as to  whether	a  detention
order  is  valid or not.  The, decision in  <a href="/doc/229789/" id="a_102">Biram  Chand  v.
State  of Uttar Pradesh &amp; Ors</a>. reported in A.I.R. 1974	S.C.
1161  Which  is	 a Division Bench decision  of	two  learned
Judges	is contrary to the other Bench decisions  consisting
in each case of three learned Judges.  The principles  which
can  be	 broadly stated are these.  First merely  because  a
detenu	is  liable to be tried in a criminal court  for	 the
commission of a criminal offence or to be proceeded  against
for  preventing him from committing offences dealt  with  in
Chapter VIII of the Code of Criminal Procedure would not  by
itself	debar  the  Government from taking  action  for	 his
detention  under the Act.  Second, the fact that the  Police
arrests	 a  person  and later on enlarges him  on  bail	 and
initiates steps to prosecute him under-the Code of  Criminal
Procedure and even lodges a first information report may  be
no  bar	 against the District Magistrate, issuing  an  order
under the preventive detention.	 Third, where the  concerned
person is actually in jail custody at the time when an order
of  detention is passed against him and is not likely to  be
released  for a fair length of time, it may be	possible  to
contend	 that there could be no satisfaction on the part  of
the  detaining	authority  as to the likelihood	 of  such  a
person	indulging in activities which would  jeopardise	 the
security of the State or the public order.  Fourth, the mere
circumstance  that  a detention order is passed	 during	 the
pendency  of  the prosecution will not	violate	 the  order.
Fifth,	the order of detention is a  precautionary  measure.
It  is	based  on  a  reasonable  prognosis  of	 the  future
behaviour of a person based on his past conduct in the light
of the surrounding circumstances.
</p><p id="p_29">For  the foregoing reasons, we are of opinion that  the	 Act
does not suffer from any constitutional infirmity
In  the case of Madanlal Agarwala it is submitted  that	 the
detention order was for a collateral purpose because he	 was
released  on 26 March 1973 &amp; the detention order was of	 the
same day.  It was also said that one incident was said to be
the ground in the order of detention and one incident should
not suffice for an order of detention.
</p><p id="p_30">The ground given in Madan Lal Agarwala's case is that he  in
collusion  with his father had hoarded 8 quintals 84 kg.  of
rice,  2  quintals 88 kg. of flour and 1 quintal 96  kg.  of
suji  and  further  that he had no licence  as	required  by
section	 4  of the West Bengal	Essential  Foodstuffs  Anti-
Hoarding  Order, 1966.	The detaining authority said in	 the
ground:	 "It is apparent in the aforesaid facts that you  in
collusion with your father are likely to withhold or  impede
supply	of foodstuffs or rationed articles essential to	 the
community." The future behaviour of Madan Lal Agarwala based
on   his   past	 conduct  in  the   light   of	 surrounding
circumstances is the real ground of detention.	It is  need-
less  to stress the obvious that Madan Lal  Agarwala's	acts
are  gravely  'prejudicial to the  maintenance	of  supplies
essential to the community.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">789</span>
<p id="p_31">It  was	 said  in  the case of Haradhan	 Saha  that  he	 was
released  on 25 July, 1973 and he was arrested on 7  August,
1973, pursuant to, a detention order dated 31 July, 1973, It
is, therefore,, said that the detention order was passed for
collateral purposes.  The grounds in the detention order are
that on 19 June, 1973 Haradhan Saba with his associates	 was
smuggling  115 bags of rice weighing 93 quintals 80 kgs.  to
Calcutta covered by coal by engaging lorry without any valid
permit or authority.  Haradhan Saha violated the  provisions
of  West Bengal Rice and Paddy (Restriction on	Movement  by
Night) Order, 1969 and West Bengal Rice and Paddy (Licensing
and Control) Order, 1967 and tried to frustrate the food and
procurement   policy  of  the  Government.   These   grounds
concluded  by stating that Haradhan Saha acted in  a  manner
prejudicial  to	 the maintenance of  supplies  and  services
essential  to the community.  This again illustrates  as  to
how these detention orders came to be passed to prevent	 the
likelihood  of such acts prejudicial to the  maintenance  of
supplies essential to the community.
