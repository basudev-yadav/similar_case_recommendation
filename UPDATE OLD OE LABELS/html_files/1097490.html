ACT:
    Narcotic  Drugs  &amp; <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1">Psychotropic  Substances	 Act</a>,  1985:
Sections 36A(d), 52, 52A, 53-Whether Officers of  Department
of  Revenue Intelligence invested with powers under  <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_2">section
53</a> are "police officers' within the meaning of <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_3">section 25</a> of
the Evidence Act.



HEADNOTE:
    The	 officers of the Department of Revenue	Intelligence
(DRI) intercepted one truck. On search, a large quantity  of
hashish	 was recovered. In the course of  investigation	 the
names of the appellant and the petitioner surfaced. Both  of
them made confessional statements to the DRI officials.
    Complaints	were  lodged against the appellant  and	 the
petitioner  under  the Narcotic DrUgs  &amp;  Psychotropic	Sub-
stances Act, 1985 and the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_4">Customs Act</a>, 1962. On their apply-
ing   for   enlargement	 on  bail,   the   selfincriminating
statements  made  by  them to the DRI  officials  were	used
against	 them  by  the prosecution. The	 appellant  and	 the
petitioner argued before the Single Judge of the High  Court
hearing the bail applications that the said statements	were
not  admissible	 in evidence in view of <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_5">section	 25</a>  of	 the
Evidence Act. The learned Single Judge referred the question
of  admissibility  of  the confessional	 statements  to	 the
Division Bench which concluded that the officials of the DRI
invested  with powers under <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_6">section 53</a> of the  Narcotic	 Act
did  not  possess any of the attributes	 of  an	 officer-in-
charge of a police station conducting an investigation under
Chapter XII of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Against	this
decision  of  the  Division Bench,  the	 appellant  and	 the
petitioner have appealed to this Court.
    It	was  contended before this Court on  behalf  of	 the
appellant  and	the  petitioner	 that:	(1)  the  expression
'police officer' used in <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_7">section 25</a>
<a href="/doc/1050291/" id="a_8">64</a>
of the Evidence Act must not be read in the narrow sense  of
only  those officers belonging to the regular  police  force
but must be construed broadly to include all those who	have
been  invested	with powers of the police in the  matter  of
investigation  of a penal offence; (2) when  such  extensive
powers are conferred on the officers appointed under the Act
and  the consequences are so drastic, it is  desirable	that
the  protection of <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_9">section 25</a>, <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_10">Evidence Act</a>, should  be	 ex-
tended	to  persons accused of the commission of  any  crime
punishable  under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_11">Narcotic Act</a>; (3) since the  Act	does
not prescribe the procedure for investigation, the  officers
invested with power under <a href="/doc/1047846/" id="a_12">section 53</a> of the Act must  neces-
sarily resort to the procedure under Chapter XH of the	Code
of  Criminal  Procedure, 1973 which would  require  them  to
culminate  the	investigation by submitting a  report  under
section 173 of the Code, and (4) since the officers referred
to  in <a href="/doc/1047846/" id="a_13">section 53</a> have been invested with all the powers  of
an  officer-in-charge of a police station for  investigation
of  offences under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_14">Narcotic Act</a>, they have all  the	 at-
tributes  of  a police officer investigating a	crime  under
Chapter	 XII  of the Code of Criminal  Procedure,  1973	 and
would,	therefore, fail within the expression "police  offi-
cer" in <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_15">section 25</a> of the Evidence Act.
Dismissing  the appeal and the special leave petition,	this
Court,
    HELD: (1) <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_16">Section 25</a>, <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_17">Evidence Act</a>, engrafts a wholesome
protection. It must not, therefore, be construed in a narrow
and  technical sense but must be understood in a  broad	 and
popular	 sense. But at the same time it cannot be  construed
in  so wide a sense as to include persons on whom only	some
of  the powers exercised by the police are conferred  within
the category of police officers. [73B-C]

    (2) Even if an officer is invested under any special law
with powers analogous to those exercised by a police officer
in  charge  of a police station investigating  a  cognizable
offence,  he does not thereby become a police officer  under
<a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_20">Section 25</a>, <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_21">Evidence Act</a>, unless he has the power to lodge a

    (3)	 The role of the officers effecting arrest  or	sei-
zure,  except  in the case of a police	officer,  ends	with
disposal  of the person arrested and the article  seized  in
the  manner  provided  by <a href="/doc/1890761/" id="a_26">sections 52</a> and <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_27">52A</a>  of  the	Act.
<a href="/doc/1363154/" id="a_28">Section 57</a> obliges the officer making the arrest or  seizure
to  report the same to his superior within 48  hours.  These
powers	are more or less similar to the powers conferred  on
Customs Officers under the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_29">Customs Act</a>, 1962. [80F-G]
    (4) The important attribute of police power is not	only
the  power to investigate into the commission of  cognizable
offence	 but  also the power to prosecute  the	offender  by
filing	a report or a charge-sheet under section 173 of	 the
Code. [81H; 82A]
    (5)	 There	is nothing in the provisions of the  Act  to
show  that the legislature desired to vest in  the  officers
appointed  under  <a href="/doc/1047846/" id="a_30">section 53</a> of the Act, all the  powers  of
Chapter	 XII, including the power to submit a  report  under
Section 173 of the Code.[82C-D]
    (6) <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_31">Section 36A</a> (1)(d) of the Act makes it clear that if
the  investigation  is	conducted by the  police,  it  would
conclude in a police report but if the investigation is made
by an officer of any other department including the DRI, the
Special	 Court would take cognizance of the offence  upon  a
formal	complaint  made by such authorised  officer  of	 the
concerned Government. [82F-G]
    (7)	 The Division Bench is right in holding that a	con-
fessional  or self-incriminating statement made by a  person
accused	 of having committed a crime under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_32">Narcotic	 Act</a>
to an officer invested with the
power  of investigation under <a href="/doc/1047846/" id="a_33">section 53</a> of the Act was	 not

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
    AHMADI, J. Are the officers of the Department of Revenue
Intelligence (DRI) who have been invested with the powers of
an officer-in-charge of a police station under <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_37">Section 53</a> of
Narcotic Drugs &amp; <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_38">Psychotropic Substances Act</a>, 1985  (herein-
after called 'the Act'), "police officers" within the  mean-
ing of <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_39">Section 25</a> of the Evidence Act? If yes, is a  confes-
sional	statement recorded by such officer in the course  of
investigation  of a person accused of an offence  under	 the
said  Act, admissible in evidence as against him? These	 are
the  questions which we are called upon to answer  in  these
appeals by special leave.
</p><p id="p_4">    These are the facts, briefly stated. A motor truck DEL 3
124  was intercepted on July 12, 1986 near Calcutta  by	 the
DRI officials. On search a large quantity of hashish  weigh-
ing about 743 Kgs. found concealed in machines loaded in the
said  truck  was recovered. The machinery was  meant  to  be
exported  to  Saudi-Arabia and the United  Kingdom  by	M/s.
Northern   Exports  (Importers,	 Exporters  and	  Commission
Agents)	 and M/s. Modern Machinery and Instruments, both  of
New  Delhi.  After the hashish was found hidden in  the	 ma-
chines	loaded	in the said vehicle, the same  was  attached
under a seizure memo. Joginder Singh and Shivraj Singh,	 the
drivers of the vehicle, were apprehended on the spot by	 the
DRI officials.
</p><p id="p_5">    The	 disclosure  made by these two drivers	led  to	 the
search of a Farm House at Khasra No.417, Gadaipur, Mehrauli,
New  Delhi on the 13th/14th and 15th of July, 1986.  In	 the
course	of the said search hashish weighing about  976	Kgs.
was  recovered from the machines lying in the said  premises
and a further quantity of 365 Kgs. was recovered from  Gunny
bags which were secreted underground in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">67</span>
out-house of the Farm House. The DRI officials learnt in the
course	of  investigation that the said hashish	 was  to  be
exported through M/s. Lee Muirhead (I) Ltd., and M/s. Shiekh
and Pandit, of Calcutta. Mohan Lal Pandit and Tushar Pandit,
the  partners  of  the said two	 firms,	 respectively,	were
arrested.  One	Subhash Narang who was arrested by  the	 DRI
officials implicated the appellant Kitpal Mohan Virmani.  In
the course of investigation the name of the other  appellant
Raj  Kumar  Karwal also surfaced. Both	these  persons	made
confessional  statements to the DRI officials in the  course
of investigation.
</p><p id="p_6">    On	the conclusion of the investigation a complaint	 was
lodged	against the said two persons under <a href="/doc/1712157/" id="a_40">Sections 21</a>,	 <a href="/doc/813048/" id="a_41">23</a>,
<a href="/doc/962897/" id="a_42">29</a>  and <a href="/doc/1974480/" id="a_43">30</a> of the Act and <a href="/doc/585487/" id="a_44">Section 135A</a> of the  Customs	Act,
1962.  The  appellants now stand committed to the  Court  of
Sessions for trial. On the appellants applying for  enlarge-
ment  on  bail	under <a href="/doc/1290514/" id="a_45">Section 439</a> of the  Code	of  Criminal
Procedure, 1973 ('the Code' hereinafter), the  self-incrimi-
nating	statements made by the appellants to the  DRI  offi-
cials were used against them by the prosecution to establish
a prima-facie case and to prevent their enlargement on bail.
The  appellants	 argued that the said  statements  were	 not
admissible in evidence in view of <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_46">Section 25</a> of the Evidence
Act  which  provides  that no confession made  to  a  police
officer	 shall be proved as against a person accused of	 any
offence.  The  question which arose  for  consideration	 was
whether DRI officials invested with powers under <a href="/doc/1047846/" id="a_47">Section  53</a>
of the Act could be said to be "police officers" within	 the
meaning	 of  <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_48">Section 25</a>, <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_49">Evidence Act</a>, so as  to  place	 the
confessional statements recorded by them beyond the reach of
the prosecution. The learned Single Judge of the Delhi	High
Court before whom the bail applications came up for  hearing
felt that the question of admissibility of the	confessional
statement was of vital and far-reaching importance and since
it  was	 likely to' arise in a number of such cases  it	 was
desirable that it be answered by a larger bench.  According-
ly,  the  question was referred to a  Division	Bench  which
concluded that the officials of the DRI invested with powers
under  <a href="/doc/1047846/" id="a_50">Section 53</a> of the Act do not possess any of  the	 at-
tributes  of an officer-in-charge of a police  station	con-
ducting an investigation under Chapter XII of the Code.	 The
High  Court held that a confessional  or  self-incriminating
statement  made	 by a person accused of having	committed  a
crime under the Act to an officer invested with the power of
investigation  under  <a href="/doc/1047846/" id="a_51">Section 53</a> of the Act was not  hit  by
<a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_52">Section	 25</a>  of	 the Evidence Act. After  so  answering	 the
question, the learned Judges constituting the Division Bench
sent back the matter for disposal in accordance with law  to
the  learned  Single Judge. It is  against  this  conclusion
reached	 by  the Division Bench of the High Court  that	 the
appellants are before us.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">68</span>
<p id="p_7"><a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_53">Section 25</a> of the Evidence Act reads as under:
"No  confession made to a police officer shall be proved  as
against a person accused of any offence."
</p><p id="p_8">(Emphasis supplied).
</p><p id="p_9">Thus a confession made to a police officer cannot be used or
tendered  in  evidence as against a person  accused  of	 any
offence. <a href="/doc/387768/" id="a_54">Section 26</a> next provides that no confession made by
any person whilst he is in the custody of a police  officer,
unless it be made in the immediate presence of a Magistrate,
shah be proved as against such person. <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_55">Section 27</a>, which  is
in  the nature of an exception to <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_56">Sections 25</a> and  <a href="/doc/387768/" id="a_57">26</a>,	pro-
vides  that,  when any fact is deposed to as  discovered  in
consequence of information received from a person accused of
any offence, in the custody of a police officer, so much  of
such information, whether it amounts to a confession or not,
as relates distinctly to the fact thereby discovered, may be
proved. The restriction on admissibility of a confession  of
an  accused  person  imposed by <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_58">Sections 25</a> and	 <a href="/doc/387768/" id="a_59">26</a>  of	 the
Evidence  Act, when made to a police officer and not in	 the
immediate presence of a Magistrate, is as a matter of public
policy designed to prevent the practice of securing  confes-
sional	statements of persons in police custody by means  of
threats, inducements, torture, coercion, etc. what  impelled
the  introduction  of this provision  was  the	overwhelming
evidence  which	 disclosed  that the powers  vested  in	 the
police	under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_60">  the  Code</a> were often misused  and  abused  by
police officers investigating crimes for extorting a confes-
sional	statement  from the accused with a view	 to  earning
credit for the prompt solution of the crime and/or to secure
himself	 against  allegations of supineness  or	 neglect  of
duty.  It was also realised that once a police officer	suc-
ceeds  in extorting a confession from the person accused  of
the  commission of the crime by threats, inducements,  etc.,
the  real offender becomes more or less immune from  arrest.
Therefore,  the purpose of the restriction under <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_61">Section  25</a>
of the Evidence Act, is broadly speaking, two-fold,  namely,
</p><p id="p_10">(i)  to	 protect the person accused of a  crime	 from  third
degree	treatment  and, more importantly, (ii) to  ensure  a
proper and scientific investigation of the crime with a view
to bringing the real culprit to book.
</p><p id="p_11">    It was, therefore, argued by the counsel for the  appel-
lants  that the expression "police officer" used in  <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_62">Section
25</a> must not be read in the narrow sense of only those  offi-
cers  belonging	 to  the regular police force  but  must  be
construed broadly to include all those who have been invest-
ed with powers of the police in the matter of  investigation
of a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">69</span>
penal  offence. Since <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_63">Section 25</a> engrafts a rule  of  public
policy	and is designed to protect a person accused of	com-
mission	 of a crime from third degree treatment	 or  induce-
ments  or  fraud, counsel  argued,  confessional  statements
obtained  by such officers exercising police powers,  though
not  belonging to regular police force, should also  be	 ex-
cluded	from  being  tendered in evidence  against  such  an
accused	 person. Counsel submitted that since  the  officers
referred  to in <a href="/doc/1047846/" id="a_64">Section 53</a> have been invested with  all	 the
powers	of  an	officer-in-charge of a	police	station	 for
investigation  of offences under the Act, they have all	 the
attributes  of a police officer investigating a crime  under
Chapter	 XII of the Code and would, therefore,	fall  within
the  expression "police officer" in Section 25 of  the	Evi-
dence  Act.  To buttress this submission our  attention	 was
invited to <a href="/doc/1893993/" id="a_65">Section 2</a> (xxix) of the Act which says that words
and  expressions used in the Act but not: defined will	have
the  same meaning as is assigned to them in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_66"> the Code</a>.  Since
the word 'investigation' is not defined in the Act,  counsel
submitted,  that  we must look to <a href="/doc/1067480/" id="a_67">Section 2(h)</a> of  the	Code
which defines the said expression to include all proceedings
under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_68"> the Code</a> for the collection of evidence conducted by a
police officer. <a href="/doc/708036/" id="a_69">Section 4(2)</a> of the Code next provides	that
all  offences  under  any other law, i.e.,  other  than<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_70">	 the
Indian	Penal  Code</a>, shall be investigated,  inquired  into,
tried, and otherwise dealt with according to the same provi-
sions,	but subject to any enactment for the time  being  in
force  regulating  the	manner or  place  of  investigating,
inquiring  into, trying or otherwise dealing with  such	 of-
fences.	 It was argued that since the Act does not  regulate
the manner of investigation, the investigation must be	made
in  accordance with the provisions in that behalf  contained
in  Chapter XII of the Code; it must, therefore, be  assumed
that the officer investigating the crime under the Act is  a
"police	 officer", properly so called, and any	confessional
statement made to such an officer must be rendered  inadmis-
sible  in  evidence  when the maker thereof  is	 accused  of
having	committed an offence. To appreciate the	 submissions
made by counsel for the appellants it is necessary to under-
stand the scheme of the Act.
</p><p id="p_12">    We may at once examine the scheme of the Act. Before the
enactment of the Act, statutory control over narcotic  drugs
was exercised through certain State and Central	 enactments,
principally  through  the <a href="/doc/912591/" id="a_71">Opium Act</a>, 1856,  the	 <a href="/doc/912591/" id="a_72">Opium	Act</a>.
1878, the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1930, etc. However, with	 the
increase  in  drug abuse and illicit  drug  traffic  certain
deficiencies  in  the existing laws surfaced which  made  it
necessary  for Parliament to enact a comprehensive  legisla-
tion sufficiently stringent to combat the challenge posed by
drug  traffickers.  India  had participated  in	 the  second
International Opium
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">70</span>
Conference held at Geneva in 1925 which adopted the  conven-
tion  relating	to dangerous drugs. To give  effect  to	 the
obligations undertaken by the Government of India by signing
and ratifying the said convention, the Dangerous Drugs	Act,
1930  came to be enacted to vest in the	 Central  Government
the  control  over certain operations  concerning  dangerous
drugs.	<a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_73">Article	 25</a> of the Universal  Declaration  of  Human
Rights,	 1948, and <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_74">Article 12</a> of the International  Covenant
on Economical, Social and Cultural Rights, 1966, reflect the
concern of the international community for the protection of
the  individual's  right  to the enjoyment  of	the  highest
attainable  standards  of physical and	mental	health.	 The
other International Conventions which prompted the  legisla-
tion  are set out in <a href="/doc/1893993/" id="a_75">Section 2(ix)</a> of the Act. Besides,	 one
of the primary duties of the Government under our  Constitu-
tion is improvement of public health. inter alia, by prohib-
iting  the  consumption	 of intoxicating  drinks  and  drugs
injurious to health. <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_76">The Act</a> was, therefore, enacted, as  is
evident	 from  its Preamble, inter alia, to  make  stringent
provisions  for	 the control and  regulation  of  operations
relating  to narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances	 and
to  provide for deterrent punishment, including the  forfei-
ture of property derived from or used in illicit traffic  of
such drugs and substances.
</p><p id="p_13">    <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_77">The	 Act</a>  is divided into VI Chapters  accommodating  83
Sections.  Chapter  I contains the short title of  the	Act.
definitions  of various terms and expressions  used  therein
and  provisions enabling addition to and omission  from	 the
list  of psychotropic substances. Chapter II  entitled	'au-
thorities  &amp; officers' empowers the Central as well  as	 the
State  Government to make appointments of certain  officers.
etc.  for the purposes of the Act. The newly  added  Chapter
IIA  provides  for the Constitution of a national  fund	 for
control	 of drug abuse. Provision for the prohibition,	con-
trol and regulation on cultivation, production, manufacture,
etc.,  of any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance is  to
be  found  in Chapter III. Chapter IV defines  the  offences
punishable  under  the	Act  and  prescribes  the  penalties
therefore.  Needless to say that the punishments  prescribed
are very severe. In some cases the minimum punishment is  10
years  with  fine  extending to Rs.2 lacs and  above.  By  a
recent	amendment  death penalty is prescribed	for  certain
offences  committed by persons after a previous	 conviction.
Provision  for	rebuttable presumption	of  mensrea-culpable
mental	state--is  also made under <a href="/doc/1034981/" id="a_78">Section  35</a>	and  Special
Courts are envisaged by <a href="/doc/1730374/" id="a_79">Sections 36</a> and <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_80">36A</a> for the trial of

Chapter V which outlines the proce-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">71</span>
<p id="p_14">dure to be followed by the officers appointed for the imple-
mentation of the various provisions of the Act.	 Sub-section
(1)  of <a href="/doc/1610765/" id="a_83">Section 51</a> empowers a Metropolitan Magistrate  or  a
Magistrate of the First Class or a Magistrate of the  Second
Class,	specially  empowered,  to issue a  warrant  for	 the
arrest	of  any	 person suspected of  having  committed	 any
offence punishable under the provisions of Chapter IV of the
Act and for the search of any premises, conveyance or  place
in  which  such person is suspected of having kept  or	con-
cealed any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance. <a href="/doc/1038208/" id="a_84">Sections
41(2)</a>, <a href="/doc/219456/" id="a_85">42</a>, <a href="/doc/43650/" id="a_86">43</a>, and <a href="/doc/1326950/" id="a_87">44</a> confer on officers named under Act the
powers	of arrest, search and seizure without any  order  or
warrant	 from  the concerned Magistrate. We  will  refer  to
these  provisions in some detail when we discuss the  impact
thereof hereafter.
</p><p id="p_15">    Power  to  stop, rummage and search	 any  conveyance  or
goods  carried	in any conveyance or on any animal  is	con-
ferred by <a href="/doc/481329/" id="a_88">Section 49</a>. <a href="/doc/1610765/" id="a_89">Section 51</a> provides that all  warrants
issued	and  arrests, searches and seizures  made  shall  be
governed  by the provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_90"> of the Code</a> unless	such  provi-
sions are not consistent with the provisions of the Act.
    Next comes <a href="/doc/1047846/" id="a_91">Section 53</a> which we consider proper to repro-
duce at this stage. It reads as under:
</p><p id="p_16">"<a href="/doc/1047846/" id="a_92">Section 53</a>: Power to invest officers of certain departments
with powers of an officer-in-charge of a police station.--
(1)  The  Central Government, after  consultation  with	 the
State  Government,  may, by notification  published  in	 the
Official  Gazette, invest any officer of the  department  of
central excise, narcotics, customs, revenue intelligence  or
Border Security Force or any class of such officers with the
powers	of an officer-in-charge of a police station for	 the
investigation of the offences under this Act.
(2)  The State Government may, by notification published  in
the  Official Gazette, invest any officer of the  department
of  drugs  control, revenue or excise or any class  of	such
officers with the powers of an officer-in-charge of a police
station for the investigation of offences under this Act."
<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_93">Section	 53A</a>, inserted by Act 2 of 1989, makes	a  statement
made  and  signed by a person before any  officer  empowered
under <a href="/doc/1047846/" id="a_94">Section 53</a> for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">72</span>
investigation of offences, during the course of such  inves-
tigation,  relevant in certain circumstances e.g., when	 the
maker  of  the statement is dead or cannot be traced  or  is
incapable of giving evidence or is kept away by the opposite
party  or whose presence cannot be secured without delay  or
when  he  is examined as a witness in the case.	 <a href="/doc/59438/" id="a_95">Section  54</a>
permits	 raising  of  a rebuttable  presumption	 against  an
accused	 in  a trial for any offence under the	Act  to	 the
extent	permitted by clauses (a) to (d) thereof. <a href="/doc/785774/" id="a_96">Section  55</a>
enjoins	 upon  an officer-in-charge of a police	 station  to
take  charge of and keep in safe custody any article  seized
under the Act and made over to him. <a href="/doc/1363154/" id="a_97">Section 57</a> enjoins	upon
the officer making an arrest or effecting seizure under	 the
Act to make a full report thereof to his immediate  superior
within	48  hours. <a href="/doc/1143279/" id="a_98">Section 58</a> provides	the  punishment	 for
vexatious  entry,  search,  seizure or	arrest.	 <a href="/doc/884542/" id="a_99">Section  67</a>
empowers  an authorised officer to call for  information  or
require	 any  person to produce or deliver any	document  or
thing  useful  or  relevant to the enquiry  or	examine	 any
person	acquainted with the facts and circumstances  of	 the
case.  The newly added Chapter VA deals with  forfeiture  of
property derived from and used in illicit traffic of  drugs,
etc. The last Chapter VI contains miscellaneous provisions.
    The	 scheme	 of the Act clearly shows that	the  Central
Government  is charged with the duty to take all such  meas-
ures  as it deems necessary or expedient for preventing	 and
combating  the abuse of narcotic drugs (<a href="/doc/1893993/" id="a_100">Section	 2(xiv)</a>	 and
psychotropic substances (<a href="/doc/1893993/" id="a_101">Section 2(xxiii)</a> and the menance of
illicit	 traffic  (<a href="/doc/1893993/" id="a_102">Section 2(viiia)</a> therein As	pointed	 out
earlier	 Chapter IV defines the offences and prescribes	 the
punishments for violating the provisions of the Act. We must
immediately concede that the punishments prescribed for	 the
various	 offences under the Act are very severe	 e.g.,	Sec-
tions 21 and 23 prescribe the punishment of rigorous impris-
onment for a term which shall not be less than ten years but
which may extend to twenty years and shall also be liable to
fine which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but  which
may extend to two lakh rupees, <a href="/doc/962897/" id="a_103">Section 29</a> which makes  abet-
ment  an offence prescribes the punishment provided for	 the
offence	 abetted while <a href="/doc/1974480/" id="a_104">Section 30</a> prescribes the  punishment
which is one half of the punishment and fine for the princi-
pal  offence.  In  addition  thereto  certain  presumptions,
albeit	rebuttable, are permitted to be raised	against	 the
accused. Counsel for the appellants, therefore, argued	that
when  such  extensive powers are conferred on  the  officers
appointed under the Act and the consequences are so drastic,
it is desirable that the protection of <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_105">Section 25</a>,  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_106">Evidence
Act</a>, should be extended to persons accused of the commission
of any crime punish-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">73</span>
<p id="p_17">able  under  the Act. In this connection our  attention	 was
drawn  to the observations of this Court in Balbir Singh  v.
State of Haryana, J.T. 1987 1 S.C. 2 10 wherein it is empha-
sised that when drastic provisions are made by a statute the
duty  of  care on the authorities  investigating  the  crime
under  such  law is greater and the investigation  must	 not
only  be thorough but also of a very high order. We,  there-
fore,  agree  that as <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_107">Section 25</a>. <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_108">Evidence Act</a>,	 engrafts  a
wholesome  protection it must not be construed in  a  narrow
and  technical sense but must be understood in a  broad	 and
popular	 sense. But at the same time it cannot be  construed
in  so wide a sense as to include persons on whom only	some
of  the powers exercised by the police are conferred  within
the category of police officers. <a href="/doc/1090657/" id="a_109">See The State of Punjab  v.
Barkat Ram</a>, [1962] 3 SCR 338 at 347 and <a href="/doc/1409644/" id="a_110">Raja Ram Jaiswal  v.
State of Bihar</a>, [1964] 2 SCR 752 at 761. This view has	been
reiterated in subsequent cases also.
</p><p id="p_18">    The	 question  then is whether  the	 expression  "police
officer",  even	 if liberally construed, would take  in	 its
fold officers of other departments including the DRI invest-
ed with powers under <a href="/doc/1047846/" id="a_111">Section 53</a> of the Act. According to the
view  taken  by	 the Bombay High Court in  <a href="/doc/1882646/" id="a_112">Sheikh  Ahmed  v.
Emperor</a>, [1927] I.L.R. 51 Bombay 78 they perhaps would,	 but
not  if the view expressed by the Patna High Court in  Radha
Kishan	Marwari	 v. King Emperor, [933] I.L.R. 12  Patna  46
prevails.  These two lines of thought have been the  subject
matter of scrutiny by this Court in a few subsequent  cases.
We will presently refer to them.
</p><p id="p_19">    In the case of Barkat Ram this Court was called upon  to
consider  whether  Customs  Officers  to  whom	confessional
statements  were  made could be said to be  police  officers
within the meaning of <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_113">Section 25</a>, <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_114">Evidence Act</a>. On behalf of
the  prosecution it was argued that the mere tact that	cer-
tain  powers  of arrest, search, seizure  and  recording  of
evidence have been conferred on such officers, where contra-
vention	 of the provisions of the statute is complained	 of,
is not sufficient to make them police officers under <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_115">Section
25</a>  of the Evidence Act. The respondents on the	 other	hand
contended  that officers on whom such powers  are  conferred
are in fact police officers, no matter by what name they are
called.	 This Court, by majority, pointed out that the	pri-
mary  function of the police under the <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_116">Police Act</a>, 1861,  is
prevention and detection of crime while the Customs Officers
are  mainly  interested in the detection and  prevention  of
smuggling of goods and safeguarding the recovery of  customs
duties,	 i.e.,	they are more concerned with the  goods	 and
customs duty, than with the offender. After referring to the
provisions of the various statutes including Section 5(2) of
the  Old  Code (now <a href="/doc/750738/" id="a_117">Section 4(2)</a>. This Court held  at  pages
364-365 as under:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">74</span>
<p id="p_20">"The foregoing consideration of the case law and the  statu-
tory  provisions  yields  the following	 results:  The	term
'police officer' is not defined in the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_118">Evidence Act</a>, or,  as
a matter of fact, in any other contemporaneous or subsequent
enactment. The question, therefore, fails to be decided on a
fair construction of the provisions of<a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_119"> s. 25</a> of the Evidence
Act, having regard to the history of the legislation and the
meaning	 attributed to that term in and about the time	when
s. 25 of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_120">Evidence Act</a> came to be inserted therein. If  a
literal meaning is given to the term 'police officer'  indi-
cating	thereby an officer designated as police officer,  it
will  lead to anomalous results. An officer designated as  a
police	officer, even though he does not discharge the	well
understood  police  functions, will be hit by<a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_121"> s. 25</a>  of	 the
Evidence  Act, whereas an officer not so designated but	 who
has  all the powers of a police officer would not be hit  by
that  section;	with the result, the object of	the  section
would  be defeated. The intermediate position, namely,	that
an officer can be a police officer only if powers and duties
pertaining  to	an  officer in charge of  a  police  station
within	the  meaning<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_122"> of the Code</a> of Criminal  Procedure	 are
entrusted  to him, would also lead to an  equally  anomalous
position, for, it would exclude from its operation a case of
an  officer on whom specific powers and functions  are	con-
ferred under specific statutes without reference to<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_123"> the Code</a>
of Criminal Procedure does not define a 'police officer' and
s.  5(2) thereof makes the procedure prescribed by<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_124"> the	Code</a>
subject	 to  the  procedure that may be	 prescribed  by	 any
specific Act. This construction would make the provisions of
s.  25 of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_125">Evidence Act</a> otiose in respect of officers  on
whom  specific and incontrovertible police powers  are	con-
ferred. But the third position would not only carry out	 the
intention  of the Legislature, but would also make the	sec-
tion purposive and useful without doing any violence to	 the
language of the section. A police officer within the meaning
of <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_126"> s. 25</a> of the Evidence Act may be defined thus: An  offi-
cer, by whatever designation he is called, on whom a statute
substantially  confers the powers and imposes the duties  of
the  police is a police officer within the meaning of<a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_127"> s.  25</a>
of the Evidence Act."
</p><p id="p_21">In the final analysis this Court held that the duties of the
Customs	 Officer were substantially different from those  of
the police and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">75</span>
merely because they possessed certain powers having similar-
ity  with those of police officers, cannot make them  police
officers  within the meaning of <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_128">Section 25</a> of  the  Evidence
Act.
</p><p id="p_22">    In	the case of Raja Ram Jaiswal, the  undisputed  facts
were that a motor car was intercepted by an Excise Inspector
and searched. On search five bundles of non-duty paid Napali
charas were found and seized. The Excise Inspector  recorded
the statements of all persons found in the car including the
appellant.  The admissibility of the appellant's  statement,
was challenged on the ground that it was hit by <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_129">Section	 25</a>,
<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_130">Evidence Act</a>, This Court, by majority, (Raghubar Dayal,	 J.)
dissenting, laid down the test in the following words:
"The test for determining whether such a person is a 'police
officer' for the purpose of<a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_131"> s. 25</a> of the Evidence Act would,
in  our judgment, be whether the powers of a police  officer
which  are conferred on him or which are exercisable by	 him
because he is deemed to be an officer in charge of a  police
station establish a direct or substantial relationship	with
the prohibition enacted by<a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_132"> s. 25</a> that is, the recording of a
confession.  In	 our words, the test would  be	whether	 the
powers are such as would tend to facilitate the obtaining by
him of a confession from a suspect or a delinquent. If	they
do, then it is unnecessary to consider the dominant  purpose
for  which he is appointed or the question as to what  other
powers he enjoys"
</p><p id="p_23">Applying  this	test this Court concluded  that	 the  Excise
Inspector, who recorded the appellant's confessional  state-
ment  was  in  fact a police  officer,	properly  so-called,
within	the meaning of that expression in <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_133">Section  25</a>,	Evi-
dence Act.
</p><p id="p_24">    Both these decisions came up for consideration before  a
bench  consisting  of five learned Judges of this  Court  in
<a href="/doc/32824/" id="a_134">Badku  Joti Savant v. State of Mysore</a>, [1966] 3 S.C.R.	698.
In  that case the appellant was found in possession of	con-
traband	 gold when his house was raided and searched in	 the
presence of panches on November 27, 1960. The appellant	 was
arrested on November 30, 1960 and his statement was  reduced
to  writing and his signature was obtained thereon.  In	 the
course	of  his statement he admitted  knowledge  about	 the
existence  of the contraband goods. Two questions arose	 for
determination,	the first related to the  interpretation  of
Section	 167(81)  of  the Sea Customs  Act  and	 the  second
touched the point of admissibility of the confessional
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">76</span>
statement  in view of <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_135">Section 25</a>, <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_136">Evidence Act</a>.	 This  Court
distinguished  Raja  Ram Jaiswal's case and  held  that	 the
facts of the case on hand were more in accord with the	case
of Barkat Ram. Accordingly, it held that the Central  Excise
Officer	 was  not a police officer under <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_137">Section 25</a>  of	 the
Evidence  Act. This Court while dealing with the  submission
based  on  <a href="/doc/154201074/" id="a_138">Section 21(2)</a> of the Central Excise &amp;  <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_139">Salt	Act</a>,
1944, observed that even though this sub-section confers  on
the   Central	Excise	Officer	 the  same  powers   as	  an
officer-in-charge  of a police station investigating a	cog-
nizable	 case "It does not, however, appear that  a  Central
Excise	Officer under the Act has power to submit a  charge-
sheet  under  <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_140">Section 173</a> of the Code  ......  ".  Thus	 the
ratio of the decision appears to be that even if an  officer
is  invested under any special law with powers analogous  to
those  exercised  by police officer in charge  of  a  police
station	 investigating	a cognizable offence,  he  does	 not
thereby	 become a police officer under <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_141">Section 25</a>,  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_142">Evidence
Act</a>, unless he has the power to lodge a report under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_143">Section
173</a> of the Code.

2 S.C.R. 461 a bench of five learned Judges held:
"   ......  the test for determining whether an	 officer  of

tigation  of  an offence, including the power  to  submit  a
report, under<a href="/doc/1233094/" id="a_145"> s. 173</a> of the Code of Criminal, Procedure.  It

view  of  <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_154">Section 25</a>, <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_155">Evidence Act</a>. This Court	observed  at
pages 886887 as under:
</p><p id="p_28">"The  fight and duty of an investigating officer to  file  a
police report or a charge-sheet on the conclusion of  inves-
tigation is the hallmark of an investigation under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_156"> the Code</a>.
<a href="/doc/1610752/" id="a_157">Section	 173(1)(a)</a> of the Code provides that as soon as	 the
investigation  is  completed the officer  in-charge  of	 the
police	station shall forward to a Magistrate  empowered  to
take cognizance of the offence on a police report, a  report
in the form prescribed by the State Government. The  officer
conducting  an	inquiry under <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_158">section 8(1)</a>  cannot  initiate
court  proceedings by filing a police report as	 is  evident
from the two provisos to <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_159">section 8(2)</a> of the Act.
    ..........	 On the conclusion of an enquiry under	sec-
tion 8(1), therefore, if the officer of the Force is of	 the
opinion	 that  there is sufficient  evidence  or  reasonable
ground	of  suspicion against the accused, he  must  file  a
complaint under <a href="/doc/545340/" id="a_160">section 190(1)(a)</a> of the Code in order	that
the Magistrate concerned may take cognizance of the offence.
Thus an officer conducting an inquiry under <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_161">section 8(1)</a>  of
the  Act does not possess all the attributes of an  officer-
incharge  of  a police station investigating  a	 case  under
Chapter	 XIV of the Code. He possesses but a part  of  those
attributes limited to the purpose of holding the inquiry".
    In	a more recent case, Balkishan A. Devidayal  etc.  v.
State  of  Maharashtra etc., [1981] 1 SCR 175  the  question
which  arose for determination was whether an  Inspector  of
the Railway Protection Force enquiring into an offence under
<a href="/doc/197281033/" id="a_162">Section 3</a> of the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act,
1966, can be said to be a "police officer" under <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_163">Section 25</a>,
<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_164">Evidence  Act</a>. This Court, after a review of the  case	law,
concluded at page 201 as under:
</p><p id="p_29">"In  the light of the above discussion, it is clear that  an
officer of the RPF conducting an enquiry under <a href="/doc/482978/" id="a_165">Section	8(1)</a>
of the 1966 Act has not been invested with all the powers of
an officer-in-charge of a police station making an  investi-
gation	under Chapter XIV of the Code. Particularly, he	 has
no  power  to initiate prosecution by filing  a	 chargesheet
before the Magistrate concerned under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_166">Section 173</a> of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">78</span><a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_167">
the Code</a>, which has been held to be the clinching  attribute
of  an investigating 'police officer'. Thus, judged  by	 the
test  laid down in Badku Jyoti Savant's which has been	con-
sistently adopted in the subsequent decisions noticed above,
Inspector  Kakade  of the RPF could not be deemed  to  be  a
'police	 officer'  within the meaning of <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_168">Section 25</a>  of	 the
Evidence Act  ...........  "
</p><p id="p_30">    Keeping  in view the law laid down by this Court in	 the
decisions referred to above, we may now proceed to apply the
test  in the context of the provisions of the Act.  We	have
noticed that <a href="/doc/1525862/" id="a_169">Section 37</a> makes every offence punishable under
the Act cognizable notwithstanding anything contained in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_170"> the

any  offence  under  Chapter IV, or for the  search  of	 any
building,  conveyance  or place in which he  has  reason  to
believe	 any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance or	 any
document  or  other article is kept  or	 concealed.  <a href="/doc/1038208/" id="a_172">Section
41(2)</a> empowers certain gazetted officers of central  excise,
narcotics,  customs,  revenue  intelligence,  etc.,  of	 the
Central Government or the Border Security Force, or any such
officer	 of  the revenue, excise, police, drug	control,  or
other  departments  of the State  Governments  empowered  by
general or special orders in this behalf to issue an author-
isation	 for the arrest of any person believed to have	com-
mitted an offence or for the search of any building, convey-
ance  or place whether by day or by night in which  the	 of-
fending	 drug or substance or article is kept or  concealed.
<a href="/doc/219456/" id="a_173">Section	 42</a> enables certain officers duly empowered in	this
behalf by the Central or the State Governments to enter into
and  search any building, conveyance or enclosed  place	 be-
tween  sunrise and sunset without any warrant or  authorisa-
tion, if there is reason to believe from personal  knowledge
or information given any person and reduced to writing, that
any  narcotic  drug or psychotropic substance  inrespect  of
which such an offence has been committed or any document  or
other  article which may furnish evidence of the  commission
of such offence has been kept or concealed therein and seize
the  same. The proviso requires that the  concerned  officer
must  record  the grounds of his  belief  before  exercising
power  under the said provision. Sub-section (2) of  <a href="/doc/219456/" id="a_174">section
42</a>  enjoins upon an officer taking down the  information  or
recording  grounds for his belief to forward a copy  thereof
to his immediate superior. <a href="/doc/43650/" id="a_175">Section 43</a> confers on any officer
of any of the departments mentioned in <a href="/doc/219456/" id="a_176">Section 42</a>, power  to
seize  in any public place or in transit, any narcotic	drug
or psychotropic substance, in respect of which he has reason
to believe an offence punishable under
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">79</span>
Chapter	 IV  has  been committed, and  along  therewith	 any
animal or conveyance or article liable to confiscation under
the  Act and any document or other article  which  furnishes
evidence  of the commission of the offence relating to	such
drug or substance. Power is also conferred on such an  offi-
cer  to detain and search any person whom he has  reason  to
believe to have committed an offence under Chapter IV and if
such person has any narcotic drug or psychotropic  substance
in his possession and such possession appears to him  unlaw-
ful,  arrest  him, and any other person in his	company.  By
<a href="/doc/1326950/" id="a_177">Section 44</a> the provisions of <a href="/doc/1038208/" id="a_178">Sections 41</a>, <a href="/doc/219456/" id="a_179">42</a> and <a href="/doc/43650/" id="a_180">43</a> are made
applicable  in relation to offences concerning	coca  plant,
opium  poppy or cannabis plant. Where it is not	 practicable
to  seize  any	goods (including standing  crop)  liable  to
confiscation,  any officer duly authorised under <a href="/doc/219456/" id="a_181">Section  42</a>
is  empowered to serve on the owner or person in  possession
of  the goods, an order that he shall not remove, part	with
or  otherwise deal with the goods except with  the  previous
permission of such officer. <a href="/doc/1502920/" id="a_182">Section 48</a> confers on the Magis-
trate  or any officer of the gazetted rank  empowered  under
<a href="/doc/219456/" id="a_183">Section 42</a>, power of attachment of crop illegally  cultivat-
ed. <a href="/doc/481329/" id="a_184">Section 49</a> empowers any officer authorised under <a href="/doc/219456/" id="a_185">Section
42</a>,  if he has reason to suspect that any animal or  convey-
ance  is, or is about to be, used for the transport  of	 any
narcotic drug or psychotropic substance in respect of  which
he  suspects that any provision of the Act has been.  or  is
being, or is about to be contravened, to stop such animal or
conveyance  and	 rummage and search the conveyance  or	part
thereof;  examine and search any goods on the animal  or  in
the conveyance and use all lawful means for stopping it	 and
where such means fail, the animal or conveyance may be fired
upon.  <a href="/doc/1610983/" id="a_186">Section 50</a> enjoins upon the officer who is  about  to
search	any person, if such person so requires, to take	 him
without unnecessary delay to the nearest gazetted officer of
any  of	 the departments mentioned in <a href="/doc/219456/" id="a_187">Section 42</a> or  to	 the
nearest	 Magistrate. Then comes <a href="/doc/1610765/" id="a_188">Section 51</a> which  says	that
the provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_189"> of the Code</a> shall apply, insofar as they	 are
not  inconsistent  with the provisions of the  Act,  to	 all
warrants  issued  and arrests, searches	 and  seizures	made
under the Act. On a plain reading of the section it is clear
that if there is any inconsistency between the provisions of
the  Act and<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_190"> the Code</a>, the former will prevail.	 <a href="/doc/1890761/" id="a_191">Section  52</a>
deals  with  the disposal of persons arrested  and  articles
seized	under <a href="/doc/1038208/" id="a_192">Sections 41</a>, <a href="/doc/219456/" id="a_193">42</a>, <a href="/doc/43650/" id="a_194">43</a> or 44 of the Act.  It	 en-
joins  upon the officer arresting a person to inform him  of
the  grounds for his arrest. It further provides that  every
person	arrested  and article seized  under  warrant  issued
under  sub-section  (1)	 of <a href="/doc/1038208/" id="a_195">Section 41</a>	shall  be  forwarded
without	 unnecessary  delay to the Magistrate  by  whom	 the
warrant was issued. Where, however, the arrest or seizure is
effected  by  virtue  of <a href="/doc/1038208/" id="a_196">Sections 41(2)</a>, <a href="/doc/219456/" id="a_197">42</a>, <a href="/doc/43650/" id="a_198">43</a>	 or  44	 the
<a href="/doc/1647617/" id="a_199">Section
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">80</span></a>
enjoins upon the officer to forward the person arrested	 and
the  article seized to the officer-in-charge of the  nearest
police station or the officer empowered to investigate under
<a href="/doc/1047846/" id="a_200">Section 53</a> of the Act. Special provision is made in  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_201">Section
52A</a>  in regard to the disposal of seized narcotic drugs	 and
psychotropic substances. Then comes <a href="/doc/1047846/" id="a_202">Section 53</a> which we have
extracted  earlier. <a href="/doc/785774/" id="a_203">Section 55</a> requires an  officer-incharge
of  a  police  station to take charge of and  keep  in	safe
custody, pending the orders of the Magistrate, all  articles
seized	under the Act within the local area of	that  police
station	 and which may be delivered to him. <a href="/doc/1363154/" id="a_204">Section  57</a>	 en-
joins upon any officer making an arrest or effecting seizure
under  the Act to make a full report of all the	 particulars
of such arrest or seizure to his immediate official superior
within	48  hours next after such arrest or  seizure.  These
provisions found in Chapter V of the Act show that there  is
nothing	 in  the Act to indicate that all the  powers  under
Chapter	 XII  of  the Code, including the power	 to  file  a
report	under  <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_205">Section 173</a> of the Code have  been  expressly
conferred on officers who are invested with the powers of an
officer-in-charge of a police station under <a href="/doc/1047846/" id="a_206">Section 53</a>,	 for
the purpose of investigation of offences under the Act.
    <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_207">The	 Act</a> was enacted for the control and  regulation  of
operations  relating  to  narcotic  drugs  and	psychotropic
substances. Under <a href="/doc/1038208/" id="a_208">Sections 41</a>, <a href="/doc/219456/" id="a_209">42</a>, <a href="/doc/43650/" id="a_210">43</a>, <a href="/doc/1326950/" id="a_211">44</a> and <a href="/doc/481329/" id="a_212">49</a> of the	 Act
certain	 powers	 of  arrest, search and	 seizure  have	been
conferred  on certain officers of different departments.  If
the  arrest or seizure is made pursuant to a warrant  issued
under  <a href="/doc/1038208/" id="a_213">Section	41(1)</a>, the person arrested  or	the  article
seized has to be forwarded to the Magistrate with  despatch.
If  the arrest or seizure is made under <a href="/doc/1038208/" id="a_214">Sections 41(2)</a>,	 <a href="/doc/219456/" id="a_215">42</a>,
<a href="/doc/43650/" id="a_216">43</a> or 44 the person arrested or the article seized has to be
forwarded  to  the officer-in-charge of the  nearest  police
station	 or  the officer empowered under <a href="/doc/1047846/" id="a_217">Section 53</a>  of	 the
Act. Special procedure has been prescribed for the  disposal
of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances having  regard
to  the	 factors  set out in <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_218">Section 52A</a>. The  role  of	 the
officers effecting arrest or seizure, except in the case  of
a  police  officer,  ends with the disposal  of	 the  person
arrested  and the article seized in the manner	provided  by
<a href="/doc/1890761/" id="a_219">Section 52</a> and <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_220">52A</a> of the Act. <a href="/doc/1363154/" id="a_221">Section 57</a> obliges the  offi-
cer  making the arrest or seizure to report the same to	 his
superior  within  48 hours. These powers are  more  or	less
similar	 to the powers conferred on Customs  Officers  under
the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_222">Customs Act</a>, 1962.
</p><p id="p_31">    For	 the  offences under the Act, the  investigation  is
entrusted to officers in whom powers of an officer-in-charge
of  a  police station are vested by  a	notification  issued
under <a href="/doc/1047846/" id="a_223">Section 53</a> of the Act by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">81</span>
concerned Government. Thus a special investigating agency is
created to investigate the commission of offences under	 the
Act.  There is no doubt that the Act creates  new  offences,
empowers  officers of certain departments to effect  arrest,
search	and seizure, outlines the procedure therefore,	pro-
vides for a special machinery to investigate these  offences
and provides for the constitution of Special Courts for	 the
trial  of offences under the Act,  notwithstanding  anything
contained  in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_224"> the Code</a>. But, argued learned counsel for	 the
appellants,  the  officers empowered  to  investigate  under
<a href="/doc/1047846/" id="a_225">Section 53</a> of the Act must of necessity follow the procedure
for  investigation under Chapter XII of the Code, since	 the
Act  does not lay down its own procedure for  investigation.
By  virtue of <a href="/doc/1610765/" id="a_226">Section 51</a> of the Act, the provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_227">  of	 the
Code</a>  would  apply since there is no provision	in  the	 Act
which  runs  counter to the provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_228"> of the Code</a>.  It	 was
said  that since the term 'investigation' is not defined  by
the Act, the definition thereof found in <a href="/doc/1067480/" id="a_229">Section 2(h)</a> of the
Code  must be invoked in view of <a href="/doc/1893993/" id="a_230">Section 2(xxix)</a> of the	 Act
which in terms states that words and expressions used in the
Act but not defined will carry the meaning assigned of them,
if  defined  in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_231"> the Code</a>. <a href="/doc/1067480/" id="a_232">Section 2(h)</a> of  the	Code,  which
defines 'investigation' by an inclusive definition means all
proceedings  under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_233"> the Code</a> for collection of evidence	con-
ducted by a police officer or by any person authorised by  a
magistrate  in this behalf. Under <a href="/doc/708036/" id="a_234">Section 4(2)</a> of  the	Code
all  offences under any other law have to  be  investigated,
inquired  into, tried and otherwise dealt with according  to
the provisions contained in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_235"> the Code</a>. However, according  to
<a href="/doc/94717/" id="a_236">Section	 5</a>,  nothing  contained in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_237"> the	Code</a>  shall,  unless
otherwise  provided, affect any special or local law or	 any
special jurisdiction or power conferred, or any special form
of procedure prescribed, by any other law for the time being
in force. The power to investigate is to be found in Chapter
XII of the Code which begins with <a href="/doc/1646837/" id="a_238">Section 154</a> and ends	with
<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_239">Section 176</a>. The scheme of this Chapter is that the law	 can
be  set in motion in regard to a cognizable offence  on	 re-
ceipt  of information, written or oral, by  the	 officer-in-
charge	of  a police station. Once such information  is	 re-
ceived	and  registered, <a href="/doc/288317/" id="a_240">Section 156</a> empowers  any  officer-
incharge  of  the  police station to  investigate  the	same
without	 any magisterial order. The investigation  which  so
commences  must be concluded, without unnecessary delay,  by
the submission of a report under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_241">Section 173</a> of the Code  to
the concerned Magistrate in the prescribed form. Any  person
on whom power to investigate under Chapter XII is  conferred
can be said to be a 'police officer', no matter by what name
he is called. The nomenclature is not important, the content
of  the power he exercises is the determinative factor.	 The
important attribute of police power is not only the power to
investigate
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">82</span>
into the commission of cognizable offence but also the power
to  prosecute the offender by filing a report or  a  charge-
sheet under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_242">Section 173</a> of the Code. That is why this  Court
has  since  the decision in Badku Joti Savant  accepted	 the
ratio  that unless an officer is invested under any  special
law with the powers of investigation under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_243"> the Code</a>, includ-
ing  the  power	 to submit a report under  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_244">Section  173</a>,  he
cannot	be described to be a 'police officer' under  <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_245">Section
25</a>,  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_246">Evidence  Act</a>.  Counsel for  the  appellants,  however,
argued	that since the Act does not prescribe the  procedure
for  investigation, the officers invested with	power  under
<a href="/doc/1047846/" id="a_247">Section 53</a> of the Act must necessarily resort to the  proce-
dure under Chapter XII of the Code which would require	them
to culminate the investigation by submitting a report  under
<a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_248">Section	 173</a> of the Code. Attractive though  the  submission
appears	 at first blush, it cannot stand close scrutiny.  In
the  first place as pointed out earlier there is nothing  in
the  provisions	 of  the Act to show  that  the	 legislature
desired	 to vest in the officers appointed under <a href="/doc/1047846/" id="a_249">Section  53</a>
of  the	 Act, all the powers of Chapter XII,  including	 the
power to submit a report under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_250">Section 173</a> of the Code.	 But
the issue is placed beyond the pale of doubt by	 sub-section
(1)  of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_251">Section 36A</a> of the Act which begins with  a  non-ob-
stante	clause--notwithstanding	 anything contained  in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_252">	 the
Code</a>--and proceeds to say in clause (d) as under:
"36-A(d):  a  Special Court may, upon a	 perusal  of  police
report	of the facts constituting an offence under this	 Act
or  upon a complaint made by an officer of the Central	Gov-
ernment	 or  a State Government authorised in  this  behalf,
take  cognizance of that offence without the  accused  being
committed to it for trial."
</p><p id="p_32">This  clause  makes it clear that if  the  investigation  is
conducted  by  the  police, it would conclude  in  a  police
report but if the investigation is made by an officer of any
other department including the DRI, the Special Court  would
take cognizance of the offence upon a formal complaint	made
by  such  authorised officer of	 the  concerned	 Government.
Needless to say that such a complaint would have to be under
<a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_253">Section 190</a> of the Code. This clause, in our view,  clinches
the matter. We must, therefore, negative the contention that
an officer appointed under <a href="/doc/1047846/" id="a_254">Section 53</a> of the Act, other than
a  police officer, is entitled to exercise 'all' the  powers
under Chapter XII of the Code, including the power to submit
a report or charge-sheet under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_255">Section 173</a> of the Code. That
being so, the case does not satisfy the ratio of Badku	Joti
Savant and subsequent decisions referred to earlier.

<p id="p_33">    In	view of the above discussion we are of	the  opinion
that the view taken by the Delhi High Court in the  impugned

Allahabad  High Court in <a href="/doc/830479/" id="a_256">Mahesh v. Union of India</a>, [1988]  1
F.A.C. 339 and the Gujarat High Court in Mangal Singh v. The
