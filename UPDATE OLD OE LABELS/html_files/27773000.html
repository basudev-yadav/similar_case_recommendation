Judgment on                      : 03.04.2019

</pre><p id="p_2">      Soumen Sen, J.: The instant appeal is arising out of an order passed

by the learned Single Judge by which the counter-claim was dismissed on

the ground of lack of territorial jurisdiction.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      The essential question that has fallen for consideration in the instant

appeal is whether in a suit for specific performance of an agreement to sell

an immovable property, the defendant can make a counter-claim for

recovery of possession of the said immovable property when the property is

situated beyond the territorial jurisdiction of this Court.

</p><p id="p_4">      The plaintiff has filed a suit for specific performance of an agreement.

In the written statement, the defendant has denied existence of such

agreement and in addition had claimed that the plaintiff is in wrongful
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                           2</span>


possession of the property in question and accordingly has prayed for

eviction. The plaintiff has filed addition written statement. At the trial of the

suit the following issues were framed:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">            "1.Was there any agreement between the parties in respect of
            any of the suit properties?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">            2. Whether the plaintiffs trespassed into the suit properties?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">            3. Whether the plaintiffs are interfering with the defendant's use
            and occupation of his portions of premises No. 344, Canel Street,
            Kolkata?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">            4. To what relief, if any, are the plaintiffs entitled? 5. To what
            relief, if any, is the defendant entitled?"</blockquote><p id="p_5">


</p><p id="p_6">      The plaintiff thereafter did not proceed with the suit and the suit was

dismissed for non-prosecution.      Thereafter the learned Judge took upon

himself the issue of territorial jurisdiction in relation to the counter-claim

and decided it against the defendant. The learned Single Judge has held

that since the immovable property is situated outside the territorial limits of

this Court, this Court has no jurisdiction to pass a decree in favour of the

defendant for recovery of the said immovable property.

</p><p id="p_7">      The findings of the learned Single Judge are:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">                   "The suit premises involved in the present case is Premises
            No. 344, Canal Street, Kolkata- 700048. The suit property is
            situate outside the territorial jurisdiction of this Court. If the
            defendant wanted to file a suit with the reliefs as sought for in its
            counterclaim in respect of such immovable property, the suit
            would not have been maintainable before this Court.</blockquote><p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">                   Rule 12 of Chapter IX of the Original Side Rules states that
            a counterclaim shall be treated as a plaint and be governed by
            the rules applicable to plaints. In terms of Rule 12 of Chapter IX
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                              3</span>


of the Original Side Rules treating a counterclaim to be a plaint,
the relief of possession in respect of immovable property
admittedly lying and situate outside the territorial jurisdiction of
this Court cannot be entertained. The provisions of Order 8 Rules
6A to 6G<a href="/doc/206650/" id="a_1"> of the Code</a> of Civil Procedure, 1908 do not assist the
defendant in sustaining a counterclaim before this Court when
this Court does not have the territorial jurisdiction to entertain the
counterclaim made in the written statement of the defendant.
</p><p id="p_10">       Rule 6C Order 8<a href="/doc/206650/" id="a_2"> of the Code</a> of Civil Procedure, 1908 allows
a plaintiff to raise an issue that the claim raised in the
counterclaim ought not to be disposed of by way of a
counterclaim. In the present case, the plaintiffs have not
appeared at the hearing of the suit. However, the counterclaim
made in the written statement of the defendant is such that the
counterclaim cannot be entertained by this Court due to lack of
territorial jurisdiction of this Court.
</p><p id="p_11">       Barthels and Luders GmbH (supra) relates to an admiralty
suit. The Bombay High Court considered Order 8 Rules 6A to 6G<a href="/doc/206650/" id="a_3">
of the Code</a> of Civil Procedure, 1908 and found that since the
counterclaim related to the same repairs as that which was the
subject matter of the plaint, it was found not to be fair to drive a
defendant to a separate suit in a different Court. The factual
situation in the instant case is different. The defendant has
sought for relief with regard to an immovable property situate
admittedly outside the territorial jurisdiction of this Court in its
counterclaim. The defendant could not have filed an independent
suit seeking the same relief as that of the counterclaim in this
Court. It would not be proper to allow the defendant to invoke the
jurisdiction of this Court when this Court does not possess such
jurisdiction by reason of the reliefs sought for in respect of
immovable property lying and situate outside its territorial
jurisdiction.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                       4</span><p id="p_12">


</p><p id="p_13">                    In such circumstances, no relief can be granted to the
             defendant in the counterclaim due to the lack of territorial
             jurisdiction of this Court to entertain the counterclaim of the
             defendant."
</p><p id="p_14">      The counter claim was not accordingly considered on the ground of

lack of territorial jurisdiction.
</p>
<p id="p_15">      Mr. Rupak Ghosh appearing on behalf of the appellant has submitted

that under Order 8 Rule 6-A<a href="/doc/206650/" id="a_4"> of the Code</a> of Civil Procedure, the only

embargo to a counter-claim is that the counter-claim shall not exceed the

pecuniary limits of the jurisdiction of the Court. The counter-claim under

the amended provisions may not arise out of the same transaction or must

be of the same nature as the claim of the plaintiff. Under Order 8 Rule 6-A,

the claim and counter-claim are to be regarded as a unified proceeding in

which the Court decides both the claim and the counter-claim by a single

judgment. Mr. Ghosh submits that the object of Order 8 Rule 6-A<a href="/doc/206650/" id="a_5"> of the

Code</a> of Civil Procedure is to prevent multiplicity of proceedings and

conflicting decisions.     Mr. Ghosh submits that there is no restriction

regarding territorial jurisdiction of the court. This is because the suit and

the counter-claim are in many ways not two independent proceedings but a

unified proceeding. In this regard Mr. Ghosh relied upon the decision of the

Bombay High Court in <a href="/doc/517423/" id="a_6">Barthels And Luders Gmbh vs M.V. "Dominique</a>"

reported at AIR 1988 Bom 380.
</p>
<p id="p_16">      Mr. Ghosh submits that the view expressed by Justice Sujata

Mahohar in Barthels And Luders (supra) was subsequently followed by a

Coordinate Bench of the Bombay High Court in <a href="/doc/608819/" id="a_7">Datta Bandu Sadale And

Bombay 422 (paragraph 8):-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">           "8. ....In Barthels and Ludera Gmbh's case (supra), Mrs. Sujata
           Manohar J. has considered the scheme of the amended
           provisions of O. VIII Rule 6 A and 6C and has come to the
           conclusion that under O. VIII R. 6A the defendants may set of by
           way of a counter claim against the claim of the plaintiff, any right
           or claim in respect of the cause of action accruing to the
           defendants against the plaintiffs either before or after the filing of
           the suit but before the defendant has delivered his defence or
           before the time limit for delivering his defence has expired. O. VIII
           R. 6A reads as under :
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">           O.XVII, R.6A :
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">                    (1) A defendant in a suit may, in addition to his right or
           pleading a set off under Rule 6, set up, by way of counter claim
           against the claim of the plaintiff, any right or claim in respect of a
           cause of action accruing to the defendant against the plaintiff
           either before or after the filing of the suit but before the defendant
           has delivered his defence or before the time limited for delivering
           his defence has expired, whether such counter claim is in the
           nature of a claim for damages or not;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">                    Provided that such counter claim shall not exceed the
           pecuniary limits of the jurisdiction of the Court.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">                    (2) Such counter-claim shall have the same effect as a
           cross-suit so as to enable the Court to pronounce a final judgment
           in the same suit, both on the original claim and on the counter
           claim.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">                    (3) The plaintiff shall be at liberty to file a written statement
           in answer to the counter claim of the defendant within such
           period as may be fixed by the Court.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">                    (4) The counter claim shall be treated as a plaint and
           governed by the rules applicable to plaints.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                         6</span>


<blockquote id="blockquote_13">             A perusal of the above provisions makes it clear that there is no
             requirement that the counter claim must be of the. same nature as
             the claim of the plaintiff or that it must be arising out of the same
             transaction. In fact the words "any right or claim in respect of the
             cause of action accruing to the defendant against the plaintiff
             make it very clear that the counter-claim is not subjected to the
             same restriction as a set off is under O. VIII R. 6 of the Code of
             Civil Procedure. Shri Bagwe, the learned' Counsel did contend
             that even a counter claim failing under Rule 6A must be of the
             same nature as a set off falling under Rule 6. On a plain reading
             of the provisions of Rule 6A it is not possible to accept this
             contention of Shri Bagwe. Further the concluding words of sub-
             rule (1) of Rule 6A reading "whether such counter claim is in the
             nature of a claim for damages or not" make it abundantly clear
             that the counter claim may be a claim in the nature of damages or
             may not be so. All that the proviso to sub-rule (1) of Rule 6A says
             is that the counter claim should not exceed the pecuniary limits of
             the jurisdiction of the Court. There is no restriction regarding the
             territorial jurisdiction of the Court. Thus the only ground on which
             the impugned order is based is clearly erroneous in law. Having
             regard to the scheme of the grounded provisions of O. VIII Rule 6A
             of the Code of Civil Procedure and in view of the decision of this
             Court in Barthels and Luders Gmbh's case (supra) it is not
             possible to uphold the reasoning of the learned Trial Judge
             rejecting the counter claim on the ground that it must be in
             respect of the same subject-matter as the claim in the suit. As
             stated earlier, there is neither a bar of limitation nor any other
             plea raised in the way of the application for amendment being
             granted."</blockquote><p id="p_17">
</p><p id="p_18">      Mr. Ghosh submits all that the Court is required to ensure is that the

counter-claim does not exceed the pecuniary jurisdiction of the Court. There

is no restriction regarding the territorial jurisdiction of the Court. In order to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                        7</span>


avoid multiplicity of the proceeding the legislature has introduced Order 8

Rule 6-A. The suit relates to the same property over which rival claims have

been made.     The plaintiff has not taken any objection with regard to the

counter-claim by filing an application and cannot at this stage raise any

objection with regard to the territorial jurisdiction of the Court to try and

receive the suit.
</p>
<p id="p_19">       Mr. Ghosh has referred a Single Bench decision of the Bombay High

Court <a href="/doc/1744444/" id="a_8">Lassoo &amp; Sons V. Krishna Bahadur Nepali</a> reported at AIR 1932

Bombay 617 at page 618, and submits that a counter-claim is considered

to be a weapon of offence and enables defence to enforce a claim against the

plaintiff as effectually in an independent action.

</p><p id="p_20">       A decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/734813/" id="a_9">Jag Mohan Chawla &amp;

Anr. V. Dera Radha Swami Satsang &amp; Ors</a>.              reported at (1996)4 SCC

699 has been relied upon by Mr. Ghosh to show that the counter-claim

expressly is treated as a cross-suit with all the indicia of pleadings as a

plaint including the duty to aver his cause of action and also payment of the

requisite court fee thereon. The defendant is now by reason of the

amendment not required to file an independent suit. In order to avert

multiplicity of the proceeding and needless protraction, the legislature

intended to try both the suit and the counter- claim in the same suit as suit

and cross suit and have them disposed of in the same trial. Mr. Ghosh has

also   referred     to   Vidyapoornachary      Sons,    T.K.V.S.   vs.   M.R.

Krishnamachary reported at AIR 1983 Mad. 291 for the self-same

proposition.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                         8</span><p id="p_21">


</p><p id="p_22">      These judgments were also cited to demonstrate that the right to file

counter-claim is an additional right and it could be in respect of any right of

claim which may not have any connection with the cause of action as

pleaded by the plaintiff in its suit.
</p>
<p id="p_23">      It is submitted that both the claim and the counter-claim are decided

in a single motion and the said provision lays down that the Court shall

pronounce a single judgment in the suit both on the original claim and the

counter-claim. The Code provides for a single judgment to dispose of at one

stroke the suit claim as well as the counter-claim like "hitting two birds in

one stone". However, Rule 6C specifically lays down a special procedure to

separate the suit claim from the counter-claim, wherever the separation is

called for. This provision emphasis by implication that as a general rule a

suit claim and a counter-claim ought properly to be regarded as constituting

a unified proceeding.
</p>
<p id="p_24">      Mr. Ghosh submits that both the said provisions speak of an

exemption and it is stated thus: should the plaintiff in a given case desire

that the counter-claim filed by the defendant in answer to his suit claim be

dealt with as a separate suit in itself, he ought to apply for that relief before

the Trial Court and it should be done before the issues are settled which,

however, has not happened in the instant case as admittedly, neither had

the plaintiff filed any application under Order 8 Rule 6C for separation of the

two trials nor raised any jurisdictional issue at the time of settlement of

issues. Mr. Ghosh submits that the right to question territorial jurisdiction

of the Court can be allowed to be raised provided the plaintiff applied under
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                          9</span>


Order 8 Rule 6C before the Court and before the issues are settled. At the

stage of trial, the plaintiff cannot raise the issue as to territorial jurisdiction.

</p><p id="p_25">      In support of the argument that the objection as to territorial

jurisdiction is one which does not go to the competence to the Court and

can, therefore, be waived, Mr. Ghosh has relied upon the Apex Court

judgment <a href="/doc/1286865/" id="a_10">Hira Lal Patni v. Sri Kali Nath</a> reported at (1962) 2 SCR 747.

</p><p id="p_26">      Mr. Ghosh submits that even prior to coming into force<a href="/doc/206650/" id="a_11"> of the Code</a> of

<a href="/doc/206650/" id="a_12">Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act</a>, 1976, the Court would accept a counter-

claim or a cross-suit and even under such unamended provision it was open

to the Court to treat a counter-claim as a plaint in a cross-suit.

</p><p id="p_27">      Mr. Ghosh submits that the counter-claim has been filed within the

prescribed period and it was not a belated counter-claim. Mr. Ghosh has

referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal in The Cheapside reported at

1904 CA 339 for the proposition that if a plaintiff residing out of

jurisdiction commences an action here, and so brings himself within the

jurisdiction, he must submit to a counter-claim raised against him. The

defendant's desire to avail of the counter-claim since the action is initiated

here and making of a counter-claim is a proper course for the defendant to

take and one, which the Court would sanction.
</p>
<p id="p_28">      Mr. Ghosh submits that when the object of the amendment is to avoid

multiplicity of proceeding and a unified procedure to be adopted for deciding

both the claim and counter-claim. Unless there is inherent lack of

jurisdiction, the Court is not precluded from deciding the counter-claim

even if it relates to matters beyond its territorial jurisdiction.       In such a

situation, the Court may apply the doctrine of casus omissus. In this regard
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                       10</span>


Mr. Ghosh has referred to the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in

<a href="/doc/213017/" id="a_13">Shiv Shakti Cooperative Housing Society, Nagpur v. M/s. Swaraj

DEvelpers &amp; Ors</a>. reported at AIR 2003 SC 2434.
</p>
<p id="p_29">     Mr. Ghosh has concluded by referring to paragraphs 719 and 720

from the Halsbury Laws of England (3rd Edition, Vol. 34).            The said

paragraphs are:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">                   "719. When counter-claim available.     A counter-claim is
           available to a defendant only when the rules of procedure of the
           Court in which the plaintiff brings his action allow a counter-claim
           to be set up, and the more in which a counter-claim may be
           brought is determined by those rules. A counter-claim may be set
           up by or against the Crown, subject to the same limitations as are
           imposed in the case of a set off. The Supreme Court of judicature
           Act, 1873, did not give, and the rules of the Supreme Court have
           not given, new rights of action, but have only altered the
           procedure to the extent of allowing a cross-action and an action to
           be brought and tried in the same proceedings. A person who has
           a right not enforceable by action, but in some other way, cannot
           enforce that right by a counter-claim, but is confined to the proper
           remedy.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_15">                   720. Subject matter of counter-claim. A counterclaim can in
           general be brought in respect of any claim that could be the
           subject of an independent action.     It is not confined to money
           claims, or to causes of action of the same nature as the original
           action; and, except where a person other than the plaintiff is also
           made a defendant to it, it need not relate to or be connected with
           the original subject of the cause or matter. A claim founded on
           tort may be opposed to one founded on contract and in an action
           in rem the defendant may set up a counterclaim in personam.
           The defendant by his counterclaim may ask for any form of relief,
           for example, a declaration, a vesting order or relief against
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                         11</span>


            forfeiture,   an   injunction,   a   receiver,   specific   performance,
            revocation of a patent an account, payment of money claim or
            damages."</blockquote><p id="p_30">
</p><p id="p_31">      Mr. Ghosh submits that the suit Court was otherwise competent to

decide the issue of recovery of possession of the property in question

although the property is situated outside the territorial jurisdiction of this

Court by way of counter-claim in view of the plaintiff's claim in respect of the

same property.
</p>
<p id="p_32">      Per contra, Mr. Tiwary appearing on behalf of the plaintiff has

submitted that the jurisdiction of this Court is governed by Clause 12 of the

Letters Patent and not by any provision<a href="/doc/206650/" id="a_14"> of the Code</a> of Civil Procedure. It is

submitted that under Clause 12 of the Letters Patent the Court can receive,

try and determine suits for land or other immovable property, if such

property is situated within the local limit of original jurisdiction of the High

Court. Section 120 of the Code of Civil Procedure clearly specifies that

Sections 16, 17 and 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure would not apply to

chartered High Court.
</p>
<p id="p_33">      Mr. Tiwary submits that since the defendant could not have originally

filed the suit for eviction of the plaintiff in this Hon'ble Court as admittedly

the property is situated beyond the territorial limits of this Court, the Court

has no jurisdiction to pass any decree in relation to the counter-claim and

the Single Judge was justified in dismissing the counter-claim on the

ground of lack of territorial jurisdiction. Once the Court does not have a

jurisdiction to entertain a suit for eviction, it cannot entertain a counter-

claim. In this regard Mr. Tiwary has relied upon a decision of the Hon'ble

Supreme Court in the cases of

      Mr. Tiwary has referred to Chapter IX Rule 12 of the Original Side

Rules and says that a counter-claim under the said rules shall be treated as

a plaint and governed by the rules applicable to the plaints. Similarly order

8 Rule 6-A (4) of the code provides that the counter-claim shall be treated as

a plaint and governed by the rules applicable to the plaints. Since the leave

is necessary to initiate the original suit, the leave is also necessary in the

cross-suit. In this regard he has relied upon a decision in <a href="/doc/319525/" id="a_16">Weld &amp; Co. v.

Sher Ahmed Ekbal Ahmed</a> reported at 59 Indian Cases 12.

</p><p id="p_37">      It is submitted that the defendant however did not take leave which

the defendant could not have obtained under Clause 12 of the Letters

Patent, as the suit property is situated outside the territorial limits and it is

a "suit for land". This claim of the defendant cannot be tried, entertained

and adjudicated by this Court. Mr. Tiwary refers to Blacks Law Dictionary

8th Edition for the definition of counter-claim which means "the claim

presented by the defendant in opposition to or deduction from the claim of

the plaintiff". The counter-claim and set off cannot travel beyond scope and

limit of suit. It cannot bring about something which is completely foreign to

the suit. In this regard he has referred <a href="/doc/32058398/" id="a_17">Aninda Saha and Anr. vs Amal

</p><p id="p_42">      In Muttra Electric Supply Co. Ltd. Vs. Gopal Saran reported at 59

CWN 419 the scope of Clause 12 has been succinctly stated by Justice P.B.

Mukharji, J. a former Chief Justice of this Court and an eminent jurist in

the following words:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">                  "The basic character of the jurisdiction of this Court under
            clause 12 of the Letters Patent requires a more thorough
            investigation than it has received so far. Under this clause there
            is first a grant of power to this Court to receive, try and determine
            suits of every description. Then there is a broad classification of
            such suits into two divisions. The first classification is concerned
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                            14</span>


with suits for land and immovable property and the second
classification is with regard to other suits.   Regarding the first
class of suits relating to land and immovable property the
limitation of jurisdiction of this Court is that such land or
immovable property must be situated within its jurisdiction.
</blockquote><p id="p_43">Regarding the second class of suits other than those for land and
immovable property the first limitation is that the cause of action
must arise wholly within its jurisdiction. Then this clause deals
with those cases where part of the land or part of the cause of
action is outside the jurisdiction of this Court. It is here that the
leave of this Court has first to be obtained before the suit can be
instituted in this Court, with the one exception where the
defendant at the time of the suit dwells or carries on business or
personally works for gain within the jurisdiction of the Court.
</p><p id="p_44">      A close scrutiny of this clause, therefore, reveals that there
are certain total and absolute jurisdictions of this Court. They are
where the whole of the land or immovable property is situated
within its jurisdiction when the suit is for such land or immovable
property. That is also the case where the whole of the cause of
action arises within the jurisdiction of the Court in suits other
than suits for land and immovable property. Also that is the case
in such cases where the defendant at the time of the institution of
the suit dwells or caries on business or personally works for gain
within the jurisdiction of this Court irrespective of the fact where
the cause of action arises. These three are the categories of total
and absolute jurisdiction of the Court under the grant of power in
clause 12 of the Letters Patent. No question of the litigant having
to take the leave of the Court arises in these three cases. So long
as the litigant satisfies the test laid down in these three cases his
right to institute the suit in this Court is absolute and unfettered.
The court can neither assume nor renounce such jurisdiction.
</p><p id="p_45">      But then there is another class of jurisdiction which this
Court can avail under clause 12 of the Letters Patent where the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                        15</span>


           reality or the cause of action is not wholly but only partly within
           its jurisdiction.   It is an inchoate jurisdiction which comes into
           action upon the Court granting the leave to institute the suit. It is
           the nascent jurisdiction which lies dormant in this Court and can
           only be put into life and operation by an act of the Court in
           granting leave to institute the suit.     No act of the Court is
           necessary to assume jurisdiction in those three cases, which I
           have just described where the jurisdiction is total and absolute.
           There the Court in its inception is invested with jurisdiction. But
           here the Court has to acquire it. Here the jurisdiction does not
           depend only on the fact of the Court but also on the act of the
           Court."

Patent would lie has also been elaborately discussed in <a href="/doc/71112088/" id="a_18">Chainrup

Sampatram v. Punjab &amp; Sind Bank</a>, reported at 2009 (1) CHN 346 at

Paragraph 24 which reads:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">                  "24. There are three limbs to Clause 12 of the Letters
           Patent : the first limb covers suits for land or other immovable
           property, which is not germane for the present purpose; the
           second limb speaks of the place of accrual of the cause of action
           in the suit, requiring no previous leave if the cause of action
           arises wholly within jurisdiction but requiring previous leave if
           only a part - however infinitesimal or significant - of the cause of
           action arises within jurisdiction; and, the third is the suits of the
           defendant at the time of commencement of the suit. A suit for land
           (or other immovable property) stands on a different pedestal and
           it is unnecessary to go into that aspect of Clause 12 here. But in a
           suit which is not a suit for land (or other immovable property) the
           plaintiff has a choice of invoking the jurisdiction of this Court on
           either of the two remaining limbs of Clause 12. If there is a
           solitary defendant in a suit which is not a suit for land (or other
           immovable property), the plaintiff may unquestionably institute it
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                           16</span>


            on the Original Side of this Court if the entirety of the cause of
            action arises within the original jurisdiction of the Court and
            irrespective of where the defendant may dwell or carry on
            business or personally work for gain. If there is a solitary
            defendant in a suit which is not a suit for land (or other
            immovable property), the plaintiff may institute it on the original
            side of this Court if a part of the cause of action arises within the
            original jurisdiction of this Court irrespective of where the
            defendant may dwell or carry on business or personally work for
            gain, subject, however, to obtaining prior leave under Clause 12
            to institute the suit. It there is a solitary defendant in a suit which
            is not a suit for land (or other immovable property), the plaintiff
            may institute it on the original side of this Court if the defendant,
            at the time of the commencement of the suit, dwells or carries on
            business or personally works for gain within the original
            jurisdiction of this Court, irrespective of where the cause of action
            may be arisen. The second and third limbs of Clause 12 that
            cover suits other than suits for land (or other immovable property)
            are, in a sense, mutually exclusive; in that the plaintiff has the
            choice of either founding territorial jurisdiction on suits of cause of
            action   or   on   location   of   the   defendant   at   the   time   of
            commencement of the suit. In a suit other than a suit for land (or
            other immovable property) where the plaintiff sues more than one
            defendant, either of the last two limbs of Clause 12 of the Letters
            Patent has to be satisfied in respect of each defendant in the suit
            for the action to be launched on the Original Side of this Court."</blockquote><p id="p_47">

the property outside the jurisdiction of this Court, the Court, over a period

of time has evolved of jurisprudence of suit for land meaning thereby if it is

found that the dominant purpose of the suit is for determination of any

right, title or interest of any immovable property outside the jurisdiction of

the High Court and merely because some of the parties are within the

jurisdiction of this Court or may have entered into some agreement relating

and/or concerning of such immovable property the Court will refuse to

exercise its jurisdiction under Clause 12 of the letters patent unless it is a

suit for specific performance without a claim for possession. Granting or

refusing leave is a discretion of the Court. A suit for specific performance of

an agreement entered within the jurisdiction without a prayer for possession

is maintainable even though the property is situated outside within the

jurisdiction of the Court on the ground that there is no requirement to

decide the right, title and interest of the parties to the suit and the plaintiff

is merely seeking to enforce an agreement for sale and not possession. (See.

 said Paragraph reads:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_19">                      "314. Meaning of 'jurisdiction'. By 'jurisdiction' is meant
             the authority which a court has to decide matters that are
             litigated before it or to take cognizance of matters presented in a
             formal way for its decision. The limits of the authority are
             imposed by the statute, charter or commission under which the
             court is constituted, and may be extended or restricted by similar
             means.</blockquote><p id="p_52">
</p><p id="p_53">                      If no restriction or limit is imposed the jurisdiction is said to
             be unlimited. A limitation may be either as to the kind and nature
             of the claims and matters of which the particular court has
             cognizance, or as to the area over which the jurisdiction extends,
             or it may partake of both these characteristics. If the jurisdiction
             of an inferior court or tribunal, including an arbitrator, depends
             on the existence of a particular state of facts, the court or tribunal
             must inquire into the existence of the facts in order to decide
             whether it has jurisdiction; but, except where the court or tribunal
             has been given power to determine conclusively whether the facts
             exist, the correctness of its decision may be inquired into by
             means of proceedings for judicial review. Where a court takes it
             upon itself to exercise a jurisdiction which it does not possess, its
             decision amounts to nothing. Jurisdiction must be acquired before
             judgment is given." (emphasis added)

University And Ors</a>. reported at AIR 2001 SC 2552 the relative scope of

the expression void and voidable have been discussed in paragraphs 16 and

21 of the said report. In paragraph 22 the law was summarized the said

paragraph reads:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_23">                    "22. Thus the expressions void and voidable have been
           subject matter of consideration on innumerable occasions by
           courts. The expression void has several facets. One type of void
           acts, transactions, decrees are those which are wholly without
           jurisdiction, ab initio void and for avoiding the same no
           declaration is necessary, law does not take any notice of the
           same and it can be disregarded in collateral proceeding or
           otherwise. The other type of void act, e.g., may be transaction
           against a minor without being represented by a next friend. Such
           a transaction is good transaction against the whole world. So far
           the minor is concerned, if he decides to avoid the same and
           succeeds in avoiding it by taking recourse to appropriate
           proceeding the transaction becomes void from the very beginning.
           Another type of void act may be which is not a nullity but for
           avoiding the same a declaration has to be made. Voidable act is
           that which is a good act unless avoided, e.g., if a suit is filed for a
           declaration that a document is fraudulent and/or forged and
           fabricated, it is voidable as apparent state of affairs is real state
           of affairs and a party who alleges otherwise is obliged to prove it.
           If it is proved that the document is forged and fabricated and a
           declaration to that effect is given a transaction becomes void from
           the very beginning. There may be a voidable transaction which is
           required to be set aside and the same is avoided from the day it
           is so set aside and not any day prior to it. In cases, where legal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                       21</span>


           effect of a document cannot be taken away without setting aside
           the same, it cannot be treated to be void but would be obviously
           voidable." (emphasis added)


           The expressions "void" decree and "illegal, incorrect or irregular"

<blockquote id="blockquote_24">decree came up for consideration in Balvant N. Viswamitra &amp; Ors. Vs.

Yadav Sadashiv Mule &amp; Ors. reported at (2004) 8 SCC 706. The Hon'ble

Supreme Court after considering the earlier decisions, summarized the law

in Paragraphs 9, 14 and 15, which read:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_25">                 "9. The main question which arises for our consideration is
           whether the decree passed by the trial court can be said to be
           'null and 'void'. In our opinion, the law on the point is well settled.
           The distinction between a decree which is void and a decree
           which is wrong, incorrect, irregular or not in accordance with law
           cannot be overlooked or ignored. Where a court lacks inherent
           jurisdiction in passing a decree or making an order, a decree or
           order passed by such court would be without jurisdiction non est
           and void ab initio. A defect of jurisdiction of the court goes to the
           root of the matter and strikes at the very authority of the court to
           pass a decree or make an order. Such defect has always been
           treated as basic and fundamental and a decree or order passed
           by a court or an authority having no jurisdiction is nullity. Validity
           of such decree or order can be challenged at any stage, even in
           execution or collateral proceedings.

<blockquote id="blockquote_27">      "6. What is 'void' has to be clearly understood. A decree
can be said to be without jurisdiction, and hence a nullity, if the
court passing the decree has usurped a jurisdiction which it did
not have; a mere wrong exercise of jurisdiction does not result in
a nullity. The lack of jurisdiction in the court passing the decree
must be patent on its face in order to enable the executing court to
take cognizance of such a nullity based on want of jurisdiction,
else the normal rule that an executing court cannot go behind the
decree must prevail. (emphasis added)
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_28">      7. Two things must be clearly borne in mind. Firstly, 'the
court will invalidate an order only if the right remedy is sought by
the right person in the right proceedings and circumstances. The
order may be a 'a nullity' and 'void' but these terms have not
absolute sense: their meaning is relative, depending upon the
court's willingness to grant relief in any particular situation. If
this principle of illegal relativity is borne in mind, the law can be
made to operate justly and reasonably in cases where the
doctrine   of   ultra   vires,   rigidly   applied,   would   produce
unacceptable results.' (Administrative Law, Wade and Forsyth,
8th Edn., 2000, p. 308). Secondly, there is a distinction between
mere administrative orders and the decrees of courts, especially a
superior court. 'The order of a superior court such as the High
Court must always be obeyed no matter what flaws it may be
thought to contain. Thus, a party who disobeys a High Court
injunction in punishable for contempt of court even though it was
granted in proceedings deemed to have been irrevocably
abandoned owing to the expiry of a time-limit.' (ibid., p. 312)
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_29">      8. A distinction exists between a decree passed by a court
having no jurisdiction and consequently being a nullity and not
executable and a decree of the court which is merely illegal or not
passed in accordance with the procedure laid down by law. A
decree suffering from illegality or irregularity of procedure, cannot
be termed inexecutable by the executing court; the remedy of a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                        23</span>


            person aggrieved by such a decree is to have it set aside in a
            duly constituted legal proceedings or by a superior court failing
            which he must obey the common of the decree. A decree passed
            by a court of competent jurisdiction cannot be denuded of its
            efficacy by any collateral attack or in incidental proceedings."</blockquote><p id="p_56">
</p><p id="p_57">            (emphasis supplied)
</p><p id="p_58">                   15. From the above decisions, it is amply clear that all
            irregular or wrong decrees or orders are not necessarily null and
            void. An erroneous or illegal decision, which is not void, cannot be
            objected in execution or collateral proceedings." (emphasis added)


      In the instant case there is no dispute that the plaintiff did not make

any application under Order 8 Rule 6C<a href="/doc/206650/" id="a_24"> of the Code</a> of Civil Procedure.

However, the fact remains that the subject matter of the counter-claim

namely the recovery of the immovable property is situated outside the

jurisdiction of this Court. The Court could not have entertained the suit in

its original side under Clause 12 of the Letters Patent.

582 has considered Clause 12 of the Letters Patent of the Bombay High

held that suits involving controversy over possession of land would be a 'suit

respectful agreement with the view expressed by Mahajan, J. in

Mahajan had observed in Moolji Jaitha (supra):-
</p><p id="p_63">      "If an attempt is made to find a comprehensive definition of
the phrase, it will eventually be discovered that it has created
further complications. I therefore content myself by saying that
where the nature of the suit is such that in substance it involves a
controversy about land or immovable property and the court is
called upon to decide conflicting claims to such property and a
decree or order is prayed for which will bring about a change in
the title to it, that suit can be said to be in respect of land or
immovable property; but where incidentally in a suit, the main
purpose of which or the primary object of which is quite different,
some relief has to be given about land, the title to it not being in
dispute in the real sense of the term, then such a suit cannot fall
within the four corners of this expression."

</p><p id="p_66">      "In my opinion, if the suit is for specific performance and a
decree for possession of the land sold is claimed, such a suit
would certainly be a suit for land; but if the suit is simpliciter for
specific performance, i.e., for the enforcement of the contract of
sale and for execution of a conveyance, in that event there can be
no good ground for holding that such a suit is a suit for
determination of title to land or that the decree in it would operate
on the land."

the High Court of Calcutta. The two-Judge Bench addressed to
the issue "what is the suit for land", and observed as under:-

is an established rule that to determine whether it is a suit for

evidence (<a href="/doc/338115/" id="a_30">Indian Mineral &amp; Chemicals Co. v. Deutsche Bank</a>[7]). If
by the averments in the plaint and prayers therein, it appears
that the suit is one for land, it shall be so held and if it does not
so appear, then the suit shall continue under leave granted under

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_36">                     18. The Court referred to the relief clause, the authority in

             case)
                     "16. It may be noted that the sale certificate sought under
             the prayer requires the delivery of possession of the suit property.
             Thus, we find that the prayer for delivery of possession was an
             implicit one in the present case. The prayer as sought in the plaint
             could not have been granted without the delivery of possession of
             the suit property. Thus, in view of this we find that Adcon
             Electronics (supra) would not apply as there was a prayer for
             delivery of possession in the present case. Therefore, we hold
             that the present suit was indeed a suit for land."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_37">                     Being of this view, it concurred with the opinion expressed

      In Harshad Chimunlal (Supra) although the jurisdiction of the

Chartered High Court was not considered but the relative scope of Section

15 to 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure was discussed.            It is stated that

<a href="/doc/273116/" id="a_33">Section 16</a> of the Code of Civil procedure recognizes a well established

principle that actions against res or property should be brought in the forum

where such res is situate. A Court, within whose territorial jurisdiction the

property is not situate, has no power to deal and decide the rights or

interests in such property.     A court has no jurisdiction over a dispute in

which it cannot given an effective judgment.</blockquote><p id="p_72">

</p><p id="p_73">      Thereafter the judgment proceeds to hold that the jurisdiction of a

court may be classified into several categories. The important categories are

</p><p id="p_74">i) territorial or local jurisdiction ii) pecuniary jurisdiction and iii) jurisdiction

over the subject matter. So far as territorial and pecuniary jurisdictions are
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                        28</span>




concerned, objection to such jurisdiction has to be taken at the earliest

possible opportunity and in any case at or before settlement of issues, The

law is well settled on the point that if such objection is not taken at the

earliest, it cannot be allowed to be taken at a subsequent stage.

Jurisdiction as to subject matter, however, is totally distinct and stands on

a different footing.   Where a court has no jurisdiction over the subject

matter of the suit by reason of any limitation imposed by statute, charter or

commission, it cannot take up the cause or matter. An order passed by a

court having no jurisdiction is a nullity.
</p>
<p id="p_75">
</p><p id="p_76">      The objection to the jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court relates to

subject matter of the dispute and is one which goes to the jurisdiction and

competence of the Court to decide the dispute. The suit for recovery of the

immovable property could not have been filed in this Court as the subject

matter of the suit, namely, the immovable property is admittedly situated

outside the ordinary original jurisdiction of this Court.


</p><p id="p_77">      On such consideration the appeal fails. It is made clear that we have

not gone into the merits of the dispute. The appellant is permitted to pursue

its counter claim before the Civil Court having jurisdiction over the subject

<p id="p_92">5. From a bare perusal of the reliefs prayed for in the counterclaim filed


   by the defendant, it will be evident that in the counterclaim the


   defendant has sought reliefs pertaining to recovery of possession of


   flats lying and situated on the 3rd and 4th floors of premises no.344,


   Canal Street, Kolkata-700048 and also consequential injunctions in


   respect thereof. It is an admitted position that the properties of which


   the defendant has claimed possession are situated outside the


   jurisdiction of the Original Side jurisdiction of this Court. To the


   argument that a counterclaim for land outside the jurisdiction of this


   Court can be allowed, Mr. Rupak Ghosh, Advocate assisted by Debdut
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                     32</span>


  Mukherjee, Advocate has contended that the only embargo under


  Order 8 Rule 6A-6G is in respect of pecuniary jurisdiction and not in


  respect of territorial jurisdiction.
</p>
<p id="p_93">

</p><p id="p_94">6. In order to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court in exercise of its


  Original Civil Jurisdiction, it is undoubtedly the case that jurisdiction


  is attracted on the basis of Clause 12 of the Letters Patent, 1865. In


  the case of the suit being a suit for land or other immovable property


  which is the case here, if the suit property is situated beyond the


  territories of the Original Side of the High Court this Court does not


  have any jurisdiction to entertain, try or determine a suit. This is


  because the jurisdiction in respect of suits which are instituted


  pertaining to land depends on where the subject matter is situated or


  on the situs of the land. Admittedly, in the instant case, the suit


  property is located outside the original jurisdiction of this Court.


  Thus, if a party had come to file an independent suit he could not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                     33</span>


   have filed a suit in respect of the reliefs prayed for in the counterclaim


   within the original jurisdiction of this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_95">

</p><p id="p_96">7. As has been spelt out in Order 8 Rule 6 A (4), a counterclaim is to be


   treated as a plaint and governed by the rules applicable to plaints.


   This would mean that a counterclaim may be set up only in respect of


   those claims as to which the party could bring an independent action


   in the Court in which the counterclaim is brought (Halsbury Laws of


   England, 2nd Edition, Volume 29 Para 503). There is a long list of cases


   in support of this proposition that goes as far back as 1879. <a href="/doc/54103580/" id="a_37">In


   Williams Brothers vs. Aguius Ltd</a>.1914 AC 510, Lord Danedin has


   stated this proposition in the following manner (at page 522) "but this


   at least is certain that no counterclaim can be given effect to as a


   defence unless the Court dealing with original action has also


   jurisdiction in the matter of the counterclaim." Support for this


   proposition is also to be found in the judgment of the Privy Council


   reported in Bow, Me. Laahlan &amp; Co. Vs. Ship Gamosun 1909 AC 597
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                   34</span>


  where it was held that "A counterclaim is substantially a cross action,


  not merely a defence to the plaintiff's claim. It must be of such a


  nature that a Court would have jurisdiction to entertain it as a


  separate action. As has been held in Vasudevandra Saraswathi Swami


  vs. Sridhara Sivarama Moorthy reported in AIR 1949 Mad 630, it has


  been held that "the fact that the plaintiff has brought a suit within the


  jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court does not mean that the defendant's


  rights become limitless, e.g. to put forward a claim which nobody else


  could put forward as a plaintiff and for which there is no justification


  in the Letters Patent or in the Civil Procedure Code. A person who


  comes as a plaintiff generally gives the Court jurisdiction, that is not


  to say, that in every case does it enable the defendant to bring


  proceedings which he could not have otherwise brought before the


  Court."
</p>
<p id="p_97">

</p><p id="p_98">8. A counterclaim may be set up only in respect of a claim as to which


  the party putting it forward could bring an independent action thereon
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                     35</span>


  in the Court in which the original suit is brought. In other words, no


  counterclaim can be given effect to as a defence unless the Court


  dealing with the original action has also jurisdiction in the matter of


  the counterclaim if the counterclaim had been made the subject


  matter of an independent suit brought in that very Court.



</p><p id="p_99">9. In Vithaldas Vs. Hyderabad Spinning &amp; Weaving Co. Ltd. reported in


  AIR 1923 Bom. 24 it was held that "If the defendants were to file a


  separate suit on the subject matter of their claim in that suit this


  Court would have no jurisdiction to try it, as the plaintiff resided


  outside jurisdiction and the whole cause of action arose outside


  jurisdiction."

</p><p id="p_101">10.     Thus, it is clear from a reading of Order 8 Rule 6A<a href="/doc/206650/" id="a_38"> of the Code</a>


  with Chapter IX Rule 12 of the Original Side Rules that no


  counterclaim can be entertained unless the Court dealing with the


  original action has also jurisdiction both territorial and pecuniary in


  the matter of the counterclaim.

</p><p id="p_103">11.     If this were not the case, then it would lead to an absurd result

  where a plaintiff would be unable to file a suit in a Court which would

  lack territorial jurisdiction whether because no part of the cause of

  action had arisen within the territorial limits or where the situs of the

  land was situated outside the jurisdiction of the Court. However, if the

  submission of Mr. Ghosh were to be accepted, a defendant would be

  permitted to bring such an action by way of filing a counterclaim.


</p><p id="p_104">12.     I am, therefore, of the view that there is an inherent lack of

  jurisdiction in this Court in entertaining the counterclaim. The reliefs

  prayed for by the defendant in the counterclaim pertain to possession

  of a property outside the jurisdiction of this Court. This Court in its

  Original Side has no inherent power to decide on the right, title or

  interest in respect of a property lying outside the local jurisdiction of

  this Hon'ble Court.

  appeal should be dismissed.
