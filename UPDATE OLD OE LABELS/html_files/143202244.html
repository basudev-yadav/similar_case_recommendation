  appeal have been set out in that judgment in some detail, and need not

  be repeated by us. After hearing arguments from both sides, the Court

  recorded that the Appellant in Criminal Appeal No.152 of 2013 had

  challenged his conviction primarily on three grounds, as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       “24.1. The conviction is based solely on the purported
       confessional statement recorded under Section 67 of the
       NDPS Act which has no evidentiary value inasmuch as:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">       (a) The statement was given to and recorded by an officer
       who is to be treated as “police officer” and is thus, hit by
       <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_2">Section 25</a> of the Evidence Act.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">       (b) No such confessional statement could be recorded
       under <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_3">Section 67</a> of the NDPS Act. This provision
       empowers to call for information and not to record such
       confessional statements. Thus, the statement recorded
       under this provision is akin to the statement under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_4">Section
       161</a> CrPC.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">       (c) In any case, the said statement having been retracted,
       it could not have been the basis of conviction and could
       be used only to corroborate other evidence.”
</blockquote><p id="p_5">2. Under the caption “Evidentiary value of statement under <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_5">section 67</a> of

  the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, Act, 1985 (“<a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_6">NDPS

  Act</a>”)”, the Court noted the decisions of <a href="/doc/1097490/" id="a_7">Raj Kumar Karwal v. Union of

  India</a> (1990) 2 SCC 409 and <a href="/doc/813659/" id="a_8">Kanhaiyalal v. Union of India</a> (2008) 4

  SCC 668, as also certain other judgments, most notably <a href="/doc/805009/" id="a_9">Abdul Rashid

  v. State of Bihar</a> (2001) 9 SCC 578 and <a href="/doc/1584447/" id="a_10">Noor Aga v. State of Punjab</a>

  (2008) 16 SCC 417, and thereafter came to the conclusion that the

  <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_11">NDPS Act</a>, being a penal statute, is in contradistinction to the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_12">Customs

  Act</a>, 1962 and the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_13">Central Excise Act</a>, 1944, whose dominant object is


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                       2</span>
to protect the revenue of the State, and that therefore, judgments

rendered in the context of those Acts may not be apposite when

considering the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_14">NDPS Act</a> – see paragraph 33. After then considering a

number of other judgments, the referral order states that a re-look into

the ratio of Raj Kumar Karwal (supra) and Kanhaiyalal (supra) would

be necessary, and has referred the matter to a larger Bench thus:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">     “41. For the aforesaid reasons, we are of the view that the
     matter needs to be referred to a larger Bench for
     reconsideration of the issue as to whether the officer
     investigating the matter under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_15">NDPS Act</a> would qualify
     as police officer or not.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">     42. In this context, the other related issue viz. whether the
     statement recorded by the investigating officer under
     <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_16">Section 67</a> of the Act can be treated as confessional
     statement or not, even if the officer is not treated as police
     officer also needs to be referred to the larger Bench,
     inasmuch as it is intermixed with a facet of the 1st issue
     as to whether such a statement is to be treated as
     statement under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_17">Section 161</a> of the Code or it partakes
     the character of statement under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_18">Section 164</a> of the Code.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">     43. As far as this second related issue is concerned we
     would also like to point out that Mr Jain argued that the
     provisions of <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_19">Section 67</a> of the Act cannot be interpreted
     in the manner in which the provisions of <a href="/doc/877314/" id="a_20">Section 108</a> of
     the Customs Act or <a href="/doc/82982698/" id="a_21">Section 14</a> of the Excise Act had been
     interpreted by a number of judgments and there is a
     qualitative difference between the two sets of provisions.
     Insofar as <a href="/doc/877314/" id="a_22">Section 108</a> of the Customs Act is concerned, it
     gives power to the custom officer to summon persons “to
     give evidence” and produce documents. Identical power is
     conferred upon the Central Excise Officer under <a href="/doc/663765/" id="a_23">Section
     14</a> of the Act. However, the wording to <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_24">Section 67</a> of the
     NDPS Act is altogether different. This difference has been
     pointed out by the Andhra Pradesh High Court in <a href="/doc/1898691/" id="a_25">Shahid
     Khan v. Director of Revenue Intelligence</a> [2001 Cri LJ
     3183 (AP)].”

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                      3</span>
</blockquote><p id="p_6">3. Shri Sushil Kumar Jain, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the

  Appellants in Criminal Appeal Nos. 152 of 2013; 836 of 2011; 433 of

  2014; 77 of 2015 and 1202 of 2017, outlined six issues before us, which

  really boil down to two issues, namely:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">       “1. Whether an officer “empowered under Section 42 of
       the NDPS Act” and/or “the officer empowered under
       Section 53 of the NDPS Act” are “Police Officers” and
       therefore statements recorded by such officers would be
       hit by Section 25 of the Evidence Act; and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">       2. What is the extent, nature, purpose and scope of the
       power conferred under <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_26">Section 67</a> of the NDPS Act
       available to and exercisable by an officer under <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_27">section 42</a>
       thereof, and whether power under <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_28">Section 67</a> is a power
       to record confession capable of being used as substantive
       evidence to convict an accused?”
</blockquote><p id="p_7">4. Shri Jain took us through the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_29">NDPS Act</a> which,

  according to him, is a special Act, and a complete code on the subject it

  covers. He referred to how the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_30">NDPS Act</a> sometimes overrides the

  Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (“<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_31">CrPC</a>”); sometimes says that it is

  applicable; and sometimes states that it is made applicable with

  necessary modifications. According to Shri Jain, <a href="/doc/1223622/" id="a_32">section 41(2)</a> and

  <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_33">section 42</a> of the NDPS Act refer to a ‘First Information Report’ being

  lodged by the officers referred to therein. As the source of information is

  required to be kept a secret under <a href="/doc/980287/" id="a_34">section 68</a> of the NDPS Act, the

  officer receiving information under these provisions is therefore treated

  as an informant. The tasks assigned to officers under <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_35">section 42</a> of the

  NDPS Act are four in number, namely, entry, search, seizure or arrest.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                           4</span>
As opposed to this, <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_36">section 53</a> of the NDPS Act invests the designated

officers with all the powers of an ‘officer-in-charge of a police station’ for

the process of investigation, which would then begin after information

collected by a <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_37">section 42</a> officer is handed over to the officer designated

under <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_38">section 53</a>, and end with a final report being submitted under

<a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_39">section 173</a> of the CrPC to the Special Court under <a href="/doc/26119/" id="a_40">section 36A(1)(d)</a> of

the NDPS Act. According to the learned Senior Advocate, <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_41">section 67</a> is

to be read only with <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_42">section 42</a>, and is a power to call for information so

that the “reason to believe” mentioned in <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_43">section 42</a> can then be made

out, without proceeding further under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_44">NDPS Act</a>. Thus, “reason to

believe”, which is at a higher threshold than “reason to suspect” – which

phrase has been used in <a href="/doc/1798309/" id="a_45">section 49</a> of the NDPS Act – is a condition

precedent to the officer thereafter moving forward. Shri Jain argued that

the reason to believe must be formed before the officer acts, and that

therefore, <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_46">section 67</a> operates at a stage antecedent to the exercise of

the powers of the officer designated under <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_47">section 42</a>. He then went on

to argue that these provisions must be construed strictly in favour of the

subject, inasmuch as they impinge upon the fundamental right to

privacy, recently recognised by this Court in <a href="/doc/91938676/" id="a_48">K.S. Puttaswamy and Anr.

v. Union of India and Ors</a>. (2017) 10 SCC 1. He also argued that the

<a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_49">NDPS Act</a> therefore incorporates a legislative balance between powers

of investigation and the obligation to uphold privacy rights of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                            5</span>
individual. He then went on to argue that the “information” under <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_50">section

67</a> of the NDPS Act cannot be equated with “evidence”, which is only

evidence before a court, as per the definition of “evidence” under the

<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_51">Indian Evidence Act</a>, 1872 (“<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_52">Evidence Act</a>”). He cited judgments to

show that even witness statements made under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_53">section 164</a> of the

CrPC are not substantive evidence. He then contrasted <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_54">section 67</a> of

the NDPS Act with the power of officers under revenue acts to record

evidence, such as <a href="/doc/877314/" id="a_55">section 108</a> of the Customs Act 1962, and <a href="/doc/82982698/" id="a_56">section 14</a>

of the Central Excise Act 1944. He then went on to state that as none of

the safeguards contained in <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_57">sections 161-164</a> of the CrPC are

contained in the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_58">NDPS Act</a> when the person is examined under <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_59">section

67</a>, obviously statements made to officers under <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_60">section 67</a> cannot

amount to substantive evidence on the basis of which conviction can

then take place. An important argument was that it would be highly

incongruous if an officer of the police department, empowered under

<a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_61">section 42</a> and exercising the same powers under <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_62">section 67</a>, records a

confessional statement which would be hit by <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_63">section 25</a> of the

Evidence Act, whereas officers exercising the same powers under the

<a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_64">NDPS Act</a>, who are not regular policemen, would be able to record

confessional statements, and bypass all constitutional and statutory

safeguards. Shri Jain contended that as the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_65">NDPS Act</a>

are extremely stringent, they must be strictly construed, and safeguards

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                       6</span>
provided must be scrupulously followed. According to him, arbitrary

power conferred under <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_66">section 67</a> upon an officer above the rank of

peon, sepoy or constable, but denied to a senior officer under <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_67">section

53</a>, would be ex facie contrary to <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_68">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. On the

other hand, <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_69">section 53</a> statutorily confers powers on the named officer

of an officer-in-charge of a police station for the investigation of the

offences under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_70">NDPS Act</a>. This, according to the learned counsel,

would contain the entire gamut of powers contained in <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_71">sections 160-173</a>

of the CrPC, including the power to then file a charge-sheet before the

Special Court under <a href="/doc/26119/" id="a_72">section 36A(1)(d)</a> of the NDPS Act. The learned

counsel argued that <a href="/doc/686843/" id="a_73">section 53A</a> of the NDPS Act shows that

confessional statements that are made under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_74">section 161</a> of the CrPC,

which are otherwise hit by <a href="/doc/523607/" id="a_75">section 162</a> of the CrPC, are made relevant

only in the two contingencies mentioned under <a href="/doc/686843/" id="a_76">section 53A</a> of the NDPS

Act, being exceptions to the general rule stated in <a href="/doc/523607/" id="a_77">section 162</a> of the

CrPC. He contended, therefore, that <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_78">section 67</a> of the NDPS Act cannot

be used to bypass <a href="/doc/686843/" id="a_79">section 53A</a> therein and render it otiose. He stressed

the fact that all offences under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_80">NDPS Act</a> are cognizable offences,

unlike under revenue statutes like the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_81">Customs Act</a>, 1962 and <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_82">Central

Excise Act</a>, 1944, and then argued that the “complaint” that is referred

to in <a href="/doc/26119/" id="a_83">section 36A(1)(d)</a> of the NDPS Act has only reference to a

complaint filed under <a href="/doc/809276/" id="a_84">section 59(3)</a> therein. He also pointed out the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                                      7</span>
anomalies of granting to the concerned officer under <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_85">section 53</a> all the

powers of the officer-in-charge of a police station, which, unless it ends

up in the form of a final report, would leave things hanging. Thus, if the

concerned officer finds that there is no sufficient evidence, and that the

accused should be released, <a href="/doc/481610/" id="a_86">section 169</a> of the CrPC would apply. In

the absence of <a href="/doc/481610/" id="a_87">section 169</a> of the CrPC, as has been contended by the

other side, there is no procedure for discharge of the accused if

evidence against him is found to be wanting. In a without-prejudice

argument that complaints under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_88">NDPS Act</a> can be made outside of

<a href="/doc/809276/" id="a_89">section 59(3)</a>, Shri Jain stressed the fact that there is in reality and

substance no difference between the “complaint” under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_90">NDPS Act</a>

and the charge-sheet under the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_91">CrPC</a>, as investigation has already

been carried out even before the complaint under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_92">NDPS Act</a> is

made. He therefore argued that both Raj Kumar Karwal (supra) and

Kanhaiyalal (supra) require to be overruled by us, as they erroneously

applied earlier judgments which concerned themselves with revenue

statutes, and not penal statutes like the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_93">NDPS Act</a>. He then referred us

to <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_94">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution, and <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_95">section 25</a> of the Evidence Act,

and cited a plethora of case law to drive home the point that in this

country, as coercive methods are used against persons during the

course of investigation, all confessions made to a police officer, whether

made during the course of investigation or even before, cannot be relied

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                                        8</span>
  upon as evidence in a trial. He then referred to several judgments of

  this Court to state that the expression “police officer” is not defined, and

  the functional test therefore must apply, namely, that a person who is

  given the same functions as a police officer under the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_96">CrPC</a>, particularly

  in the course of investigating an offence under the Act, must be

  regarded as a police officer for the purpose of <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_97">section 25</a> of the

  Evidence Act. In the course of his submissions, he referred to a number

  of judgments of this Court, and most particularly, the judgments of <a href="/doc/1090657/" id="a_98">State

  of Punjab v. Barkat Ram</a> (1962) 3 SCR 338; <a href="/doc/1409644/" id="a_99">Raja Ram Jaiswal v.

</p><p id="p_9">6. Shri Anand Grover, learned Senior Advocate, appearing for the

 Appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 90 of 2017, followed in the wake of the

 two Jains, père et fils. The learned Senior Advocate stressed the

 various provisions of the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_110">NDPS Act</a> which showed that it was extremely

 stringent, in that it had minimum sentences for even possession of what

 is regarded as a “commercial quantity” of a drug or psychotropic

 substance, being a minimum sentence of rigorous imprisonment of 10

 years, going up to 20 years. This, coupled with various presumptions

 raised against the accused, and stringent bail conditions, all made the

 <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_111">NDPS Act</a> a very stringent measure of legislation, which, the more

 stringent it is, must contain necessary safeguards against arbitrary

 search, seizure and arrest, or else it would fall foul of the fundamental

 rights chapter of the Constitution. He argued that the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_112">NDPS Act</a> was

 penal in nature, and contained regulatory provisions as well, but given

 the fact that we are concerned only with the penal provisions, could be

 distinguished from the revenue statutes whose dominant object is the

 collection of revenue, and not the punishment of crime. He stressed the

 fact that the “enquiry” under <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_113">section 67</a> of the NDPS Act is not a judicial

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                                                        10</span>
enquiry, but only a preliminary fact-finding exercise before a “reason to

believe” is formed under <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_114">section 42</a>, which could then lead to

investigation of an offence under the Act. He also referred to <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_115">section 50</a>

of the NDPS Act, and stated that given a higher protection as to

conditions under which a search of person may be conducted, it would

be inconceivable to then conclude that under <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_116">section 67</a>, confessional

statements can be recorded without more, subject to no safeguards

whatsoever, on which convictions can then be based. He relied strongly

on <a href="/doc/1098587/" id="a_117">State of Punjab v. Baldev Singh</a> (1999) 6 SCC 172 and its

aftermath <a href="/doc/1145861/" id="a_118">Vijaysinh Chandubha Jadeja v. State of Gujarat</a> (2011) 1

SCC 609 to argue that even after sub-sections (5) and (6) were added

to <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_119">section 50</a> of the NDPS Act, they did not dilute what was contained in

<a href="/doc/1288137/" id="a_120">section 50(1)</a>-(4), and could only be used in emergent and urgent

situations. He referred to statutes like the Terrorist and Disruptive

Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 (“TADA”), and stated that where under

certain limited circumstances exceptions were made to <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_121">section 25</a> of the

Evidence Act, they were hedged in with a number of safeguards, as

were laid down by this Court in <a href="/doc/1813801/" id="a_122">Kartar Singh v. State of Punjab</a> (1994)

3 SCC 569. According to him, therefore, “police officer” needs to be

construed functionally to include special police officers under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_123">NDPS

  to <a href="/doc/1374738/" id="a_127">43</a> of the NDPS Act, and emphasised the fact that no powers to

  “investigate” any offences are vested in the officers mentioned in these

  sections. He then referred to <a href="/doc/1013783/" id="a_128">section 36</a> of the CrPC, and said that the

  scheme followed in the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_129">NDPS Act</a> could be assimilated to <a href="/doc/1182815/" id="a_130">section 36</a>, in

  that, police officers superior in rank to an officer in charge of a police

  station may exercise the same powers, throughout the local area to

  which they are appointed, as may be exercised by such officer within

  the limits of his station. He emphasised the fact that <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_131">section 25</a> of the

  Evidence Act only applies to confessions made against the maker, as

  against statements recorded under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_132">section 161</a> of the CrPC, which are

  completely barred from being received in evidence under <a href="/doc/523607/" id="a_133">section 162</a> of

  the CrPC, save and except for purposes of contradiction. He argued

  that a confessional statement made to a <a href="/doc/1439062/" id="a_134">section 41</a> or <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_135">section 42</a> officer

  was also hit by <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_136">section 25</a> of the Evidence Act. He added that the

  special procedure in <a href="/doc/1712009/" id="a_137">section 36A</a> of the NDPS Act applies only qua

  offences punishable for a term of more than three years, and where

  offences under the Act are punishable for terms up to three years, they

  are to be tried by a Magistrate under the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_138">CrPC</a>. Obviously, officers

 show that investigation does culminate in a police report for offences

 punishable for a term up to three years, as a result of which <a href="/doc/26119/" id="a_141">section

 36A(1)(d)</a> has to be read as providing two methods of approaching a

 Special Court – one, by way of a police report, and the other, by way of

</p><p id="p_11">8. Shri Uday Gupta, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the

 Appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 344 of 2013, supplemented the

 arguments of his predecessors, and stressed the fact that the “enquiry”

 under <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_142">section 67</a> of the NDPS Act cannot possibly be governed by the

 definition of “inquiry” under <a href="/doc/132965/" id="a_143">section 2(g)</a> of the CrPC, as that “inquiry”

 relates only to inquiries conducted by a Magistrate or Court. Hence, the

 expression “enquiry” under <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_144">section 67</a> must be given its ordinary

 meaning, which would indicate that it is only a preliminary fact-finding

 enquiry that is referred to. He relied strongly on the Directorate of Law

 Enforcement Handbook, in which the Directorate made it clear that

 when statements are recorded under <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_145">section 67</a> of the NDPS Act by the

 police, these would amount to statements under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_146">section 161</a> of the

   behalf of the Union of India, took us through the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_157">NDPS Act</a>, and said,

   that read as a whole, it is a balanced statute which protected both the

   investigation of crime, as well as the citizen, in that several safeguards

   were contained therein. He was at pains to point out that it was not his

   case that a confession recorded under <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_158">section 67</a> of the NDPS Act,

   without more, would be sufficient to convict a person accused of an

   offence under the Act. According to him, this could only be done if

   <a href="/doc/967059/" id="a_159">section 24</a> of the Evidence Act was met, and the Court was satisfied

   that the confession so recorded was both voluntary and truthful. In any

case, he asserted that the safeguards that have been pointed out in

<a href="/doc/354201/" id="a_160">D.K. Basu v. Union of India</a> (1997) 1 SCC 416 at 435, 436, have now

largely been incorporated in Chapter V of the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_161">CrPC</a>, which safeguards

would also operate qua confessions recorded under <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_162">section 67</a> of the

NDPS Act. According to him, <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_163">section 67</a> on its plain language does not

refer to the “information” spoken of in <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_164">section 42</a>, as it uses the

expression “require” any person to produce or deliver a document, as

opposed to information “called for” from such persons. He also argued,

based on judgments of this Court, that confessions, if properly

recorded, are the best form of evidence, as these are facts known to the

accused, about which he then voluntarily deposes. He also argued that

<a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_165">section 190</a> of the CrPC is not completely displaced by <a href="/doc/1894406/" id="a_166">section 36A(1)</a>

</p><p id="p_14">(d) of the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_167">NDPS Act</a>, in that the requirement of the filing of a complaint

and/or a police report contained in <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_168">section 190</a> continues to apply, in

support of the decision in Raj Kumar Karwal (supra). He then referred

in detail to Badku Joti Savant (supra), and stated that this judgment

was not considered in the reference order, and that finally, the only test

that is laid down by several Constitution Bench judgments to determine

whether a person is or is not a “police officer” is whether such person is

given the right to file a report under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_169">section 173</a> of the CrPC. He made it

clear that <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_170">section 53</a> of the NDPS Act did not deem the officers named

therein to be police officers – they were only given certain powers of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                                                       15</span>
investigation, which did not ultimately lead to filing of a charge-sheet

under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_171">section 173</a> of the CrPC. What was clear was that only a

“complaint” could be filed by such officers under <a href="/doc/26119/" id="a_172">section 36A(1)(d)</a> of the

NDPS Act – the police report being only filed by the police force as

constituted under the <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_173">Police Act</a>, 1861. He disagreed vehemently with

the submission of Shri Jain that the “complaint” under <a href="/doc/26119/" id="a_174">section 36A(1)(d)</a>

would refer only to the complaint under <a href="/doc/809276/" id="a_175">section 59(3)</a> of the NDPS Act,

and referred to <a href="/doc/1445793/" id="a_176">section 2(xxix)</a> of the NDPS Act to refer to the definition

of “complaint” under <a href="/doc/255245/" id="a_177">section 2(d)</a> of the CrPC, which is used in the

same sense as in the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_178">CrPC</a>. He then pointed out several provisions in

the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_179">NDPS Act</a>, where the word “police” or “police officer” is used in

contrast to the other persons or officers who are part of the narcotics

and other setups. According to him, in any case, <a href="/doc/686843/" id="a_180">section 53A</a> makes an

inroad into <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_181">section 25</a> of the Evidence Act. Equally, according to him,

the majority judgment in Raja Ram Jaiswal (supra) is per incuriam,

inasmuch as it does not consider several provisions of the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_182">CrPC</a>, and

therefore, arrives at the wrong test to determine as to who can be said

to be a “police officer” within the meaning of <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_183">section 25</a> of the Evidence

Act. In any case, he argued that the officers mentioned in <a href="/doc/1439062/" id="a_184">sections 41</a>

and <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_185">42</a> of the NDPS Act cannot be tarnished with the same brush as the

regular police, as there is nothing to show that these officers use third-

degree measures to extort confessions. He then referred to the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                                                       16</span>
   language of <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_186">section 67</a> of the NDPS Act, in which, according to him, the

   expression “enquiry” is nothing but an investigation, and the expression

   “examine” is the same expression used in <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_187">section 161</a> of the CrPC,

   which therefore should be accorded evidentiary value, as no safeguards

   as provided under <a href="/doc/523607/" id="a_188">section 162</a> of the CrPC are mentioned qua

   statements made under <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_189">section 67</a> of the NDPS Act. He also argued

   that investigation begins from the stage of collection of material under

   <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_190">section 67</a>, and for this relied strongly upon the recent Constitution

   Bench judgment in Mukesh Singh (supra). According to him, therefore,

   the reference order itself being flawed, there ought to have been no

   reference at all, and that the judgments in Raj Kumar Karwal (supra)

   and Kanhaiyalal (supra) do not need reconsideration. Later judgments

   such as Noor Aga (supra) ought to be overruled by us, inasmuch as

    they are contrary to several Constitution Bench judgments of this Court.

</p><p id="p_19">14. The first most important constitutional protection provided in the

   provided by <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_196">Article 20(3</a>), which is the well-known right against self-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">         “In view of the above background, there is no inherent
         reason to construe the ambit of this fundamental right as
         comprising a very wide range. Nor would it be legitimate
         to confine it to the barely literal meaning of the words
         used, since it is a recognised doctrine that when

to prevent its circumvention. Analysing the terms in which
this right has been declared in our Constitution, it may be
said to consist of the following components. (1) It is a right
pertaining to a person “accused of an offence”; (2) It is a
protection against “compulsion to be a witness”; and (3) It
is a protection against such compulsion resulting in his
giving evidence “against himself”.”
                                            (at page 1086)

Broadly stated the guarantee in <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_200">Article 20(3)</a> is against
“testimonial compulsion”. It is suggested that this is
confined to the oral evidence of a person standing his trial
for an offence when called to the witness-stand. We can
see no reason to confine the content of the constitutional
guarantee to this barely literal import. So to limit it would
be to rob the guarantee of its substantial purpose and to
miss the substance for the sound as stated in certain
American decisions. The phrase used in <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_201">Article 20(3)</a> is
“to be a witness”. A person can “be a witness” not merely
by giving oral evidence but also by producing documents
or making intelligible gestures as in the case of a dumb
witness (See <a href="/doc/211471/" id="a_202">Section 119</a> of the Evidence Act) or the like.
</blockquote><p id="p_22">“To be a witness” is nothing more than “to furnish
evidence” and such evidence can be furnished through
the lips or by production of a thing or of a document or in
other modes. So far as production of documents is
concerned, no doubt <a href="/doc/334170/" id="a_203">Section 139</a> of the Evidence Act
says that a person producing a document on summons is
not a witness. But that section is meant to regulate the
right of cross-examination. It is not a guide to the
connotation of the word “witness”, which must be
understood in its natural sense i.e. as referring to a
person who furnishes evidence. Indeed, every positive
volitional act, which furnishes evidence is testimony, and
testimonial compulsion connotes coercion which procures
the positive volitional evidentiary acts of the person, as
opposed to the negative attitude of silence or submission
on his part. Nor is there any reason to think that the
protection in respect of the evidence so procured is
confined to what transpires at the trial in the court room.
The phrase used in <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_204">Article 20(3)</a> is “to be a witness” and
not to “appear as a witness”: It follows that the protection

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                                                 19</span>
         afforded to an accused in so far as it is related, to the
         phrase “to be a witness” is not merely in respect of
         testimonial compulsion in the court room but may well
         extend to compelled testimony previously obtained from
         him. It is available therefore to a person against whom a
         formal accusation relating to the commission of an offence
         has been levelled which in the normal course may result
         in prosecution. Whether it is available to other persons in
         other situations does not call for decision in this case.
         Considered in this light, the guarantee under <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_205">Article 20(3)</a>
         would be available in the present cases to these
         petitioners against whom a first information report has
         been recorded as accused therein. It would extend to any
         compulsory     process       for production of   evidentiary
         documents which are reasonably likely to support a
         prosecution against them.

   privacy” under the Indian Constitution, like the Fourth Amendment to the

   US Constitution, about which more shall be said a little later. What is

   important, however, is the fact that even in this early judgment, a mere

   literal reading was not given to <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_206">Article 20(3).</a> The Court recognised that

   a person can be said to be a witness not merely by giving oral

   evidence, but also by producing documents – evidence being furnished

   through the lips of a person or by production of a thing or of a document

   or in other modes. It is important to stress that the protection was

   afforded to a person formally accused of an offence on the basis of a

   statement that may be compulsorily taken from him even before

   evidence is given in a court.

   raised on some of the propositions contained in the eight-Judge Bench

   decision of M.P. Sharma (supra). In this case, there were three appeals

   before the Court, one of which involved proof of handwritten evidence,

   another of which involved comparison of handwriting under <a href="/doc/770022/" id="a_208">section 73</a>

   of the Evidence Act, and the third of which involved <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_209">section 27</a> of the

   Evidence Act. After hearing arguments on both sides, the Court first

   concluded that M.P. Sharma (supra) was correctly decided insofar as it

   stated that the guarantee under <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_210">Article 20(3)</a> extended to testimony by a

   witness given in or out of courts, which included statements which

   incriminated the maker. However, the Court went on to state that

   “furnishing evidence” would exclude thumb-impressions or writing

   specimens, for the reason that the taking of impressions of parts of the

   body often becomes necessary for the investigation of a crime (see

   page 29). Incriminating information must therefore include statements

   based on personal knowledge. The Court then went on to consider

   whether <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_211">section 27</a> of the Evidence Act would fall foul of <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_212">Article 20(3</a>),

place reliance on the object recovered as a result of the statement

made (see pages 33-34). In the result, the Court held:

     compelled to be a witness against himself simply because
     he made a statement while in police custody, without
     anything more. In other words, the mere fact of being in
     police custody at the time when the statement in question
     was made would not, by itself, as a proposition of law,
     lend itself to the inference that the accused was
     compelled to make the statement, though that fact, in
     conjunction with other circumstances disclosed in
     evidence in a particular case, would be a relevant
     consideration in an enquiry whether or not the accused
     person had been compelled to make the impugned
     statement.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">     (2) The mere questioning of an accused person by a
     police officer, resulting in a voluntary statement, which
     may ultimately turn out to be incriminatory, is not
     “compulsion”.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">     (3) “To be a witness” is not equivalent to “furnishing
     evidence” in its widest significance; that is to say, as
     including not merely making of oral or written statements
     but also production of documents or giving materials
     which may be relevant at a trial to determine the guilt or
     innocence of the accused.

   Dani</a> (1978) 2 SCC 424. This case referred to the inter-play between

   <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_222">Article 20(3)</a> and <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_223">section 161</a> of the CrPC as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">        “21. Back to the constitutional quintessence invigorating
        the ban on self-incrimination. The area covered by <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_224">Article
        20(3)</a> and <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_225">Section 161(2)</a> is substantially the same. So
        much so, we are inclined to the view, terminological
        expansion apart, that <a href="/doc/1110422/" id="a_226">Section 161(2)</a> of the CrPC is a
        parliamentary gloss on the constitutional clause. The
        learned Advocate-General argued that <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_227">Article 20(3</a>), unlike
        <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_228">Section 161(1)</a>, did not operate at the anterior stages
        before the case came to court and the accused's
        incriminating utterance, previously recorded, was
        attempted to be introduced. He relied on some passages
        in American decisions but, in our understanding, those
        passages do not so circumscribe and, on the other hand,
        the landmark Miranda [Miranda v. Arizona, 384 US 436
        (1966)] ruling did extend the embargo to police
        investigation also. Moreover, <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_229">Article 20(3</a>), which is our
        provision, warrants no such truncation. Such a narrow
        meaning may emasculate a necessary protection. There
        are only two primary queries involved in this clause that
        seals the lips into permissible silence: (i) Is the person
        called upon to testify “accused of any offence”? (ii) Is he
        being compelled to be witness against himself? A
        constitutional provision receives its full semantic range
        and so it follows that a wider connotation must be
        imparted to the expressions “accused of any offence” and
        “to be witness against himself”. The learned Advocate-</blockquote><p id="p_33">
</p><p id="p_34">        General, influenced by American decisions rightly agreed
        that in expression <a href="/doc/1110422/" id="a_230">Section 161(2)</a> of the Code might cover
        not merely accusations already registered in police
        stations but those which are likely to be the basis for
        exposing a person to a criminal charge. Indeed, this wider
        construction, if applicable to <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_231">Article 20(3</a>), approximates
        the constitutional clause to the explicit statement of the
        prohibition in <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_232">Section 161(2)</a>. This latter provision
        meaningfully uses the expression “expose himself to a
        criminal charge”. Obviously, these words mean, not only
        cases where the person is already exposed to a criminal

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                                                      24</span>
charge but also instances which will imminently expose
him to criminal charges. In <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_233">Article 20(3</a>), the expression
“accused of any offence” must mean formally accused in
praesenti not in futuro — not even imminently as
decisions now stand. The expression “to be witness
against himself” means more than the court process. Any
giving of evidence, any furnishing of information, if likely to
have an incriminating impact, answers the description of
being witness against oneself. Not being limited to the
forensic stage by express words in <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_234">Article 20(3</a>), we have
to construe the expression to apply to every stage where
furnishing of information and collection of materials takes
place. That is to say, even the investigation at the police
level is embraced by <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_235">Article 20(3).</a> This is precisely what
<a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_236">Section 161(2)</a> means. That sub-section relates to oral
examination by police officers and grants immunity at that
stage. Briefly, the Constitution and<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_237"> the Code</a> are co-
terminus in the protective area. While<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_238"> the Code</a> may be
changed, the Constitution is more enduring. Therefore, we
have to base our conclusion not merely upon <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_239">Section
161(2)</a> but on the more fundamental protection, although
equal in ambit, contained in <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_240">Article 20(3).</a>

</p><p id="p_36">57. We hold that <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_241">Section 161</a> enables the police to
examine the accused during investigation. The prohibitive
sweep of <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_242">Article 20(3)</a> goes back to the stage of police
interrogation — not, as contended, commencing in court
only. In our judgment, the provisions of <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_243">Article 20(3)</a> and
<a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_244">Section 161(1)</a> substantially cover the same area, so far
as police investigations are concerned. The ban on self-
accusation and the right to silence, while one investigation
or trial is under way, goes beyond that case and protects
the accused in regard to other offences pending or
imminent, which may deter him from voluntary disclosure
of criminatory matter. We are disposed to read “compelled
testimony” as evidence procured not merely by physical
threats or violence but by psychic torture, atmospheric
pressure, environmental coercion, tiring interrogative
prolixity, overbearing and intimidatory methods and the
like — not legal penalty for violation. So, the legal perils
following upon refusal to answer, or answer truthfully,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                                                  25</span>
cannot be regarded as compulsion within the meaning of
<a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_245">Article 20(3).</a> The prospect of prosecution may lead to
legal tension in the exercise of a constitutional right, but
then, a stance of silence is running a calculated risk. On
the other hand, if there is any mode of pressure, subtle or
crude, mental or physical, direct or indirect, but sufficiently
substantial, applied by the policeman for obtaining
information from an accused strongly suggestive of guilt, it
becomes “compelled testimony”, violative of <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_246">Article 20(3).</a>

</p><p id="p_37">58. A police officer is clearly a person in authority.
Insistence on answering is a form of pressure especially
in the atmosphere of the police station unless certain
safeguards erasing duress are adhered to. Frequent
threats of prosecution if there is failure to answer may
take on the complexion of undue pressure violating <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_247">Article
20(3).</a> Legal penalty may by itself not amount to duress
but the manner of mentioning it to the victim of
interrogation may introduce an element of tension and
tone of command perilously hovering near compulsion.

</p><p id="p_38">59. We have explained elaborately and summed up, in
substance, what is self-incrimination or tendency to
expose oneself to a criminal charge. It is less than
“relevant” and more than “confessional”. Irrelevance is
impermissible but relevance is licit but when relevant
questions are loaded with guilty inference in the event of
an answer being supplied, the tendency to incriminate
springs into existence. We hold further that the accused
person cannot be forced to answer questions merely
because the answers thereto are not implicative when
viewed in isolation and confined to that particular case. He
is entitled to keep his mouth shut if the answer sought has
a reasonable prospect of exposing him to guilt in some
other accusation actual or imminent, even though the
investigation under way is not with reference to that. We
have already explained that in determining the
incriminatory character of an answer the accused is
entitled to consider — and the Court while adjudging will
take note of — the setting, the totality of circumstances,
the equation, personal and social, which have a bearing
on making an answer substantially innocent but in effect
guilty in import. However, fanciful claims, unreasonable

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                                                  26</span>
         apprehensions and vague possibilities cannot be the
         hiding ground for an accused person. He is bound to
         answer where there is no clear tendency to criminate.”

   in the following terms:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">         “205. In our Constitution as well as procedural law and
         law of Evidence, there are certain guarantees protecting
         the right and liberty of a person in a criminal proceeding
         and safeguards in making use of any statement made by
         him. <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_249">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution declares that “No
         person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a

<blockquote id="blockquote_19">         206. <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_250">Article 20(3)</a> of our Constitution embodies the
         principle of protection against compulsion of self-
         incrimination which is one of the fundamental canons of
         the British System of Criminal Jurisprudence and which
         has been adopted by the American System and
         incorporated in the <a href="/doc/1726510/" id="a_251">Federal Act</a>s. The Fifth Amendment of
         the Constitution of the United States of America provides,
         “No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or
         otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or
         indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising … nor

         of the components of the guarantee contained in <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_252">Article

that if a confession made by one or more persons,

explanation to the section reads that “offence” as used in
this section includes the abetment of, or attempt to
commit, the offence.

reads:
</p>
<p id="p_48">“Provided that no confession shall be recorded by a police

the questions and exerts pressure on the captive to
comply (sic). Silence on the part of the frightened captive
seems to his ears to call for vengeance and induces a
belief that confession holds out a chance to avoid torture
or to get bail or a promise of lesser punishment. The
resourceful investigator adopts all successful tactics to
elicit confession as is discussed below.

testimonial compulsion connotes coercion which procures
positive oral evidence. The acts of the person, of course,
is neither negative attitude of silence or submission on his
part, nor is there any reason to think that the protection in
respect of the evidence procured is confined to what

         witness” is not merely in respect of the testimonial
         compulsion in the court room but may well extend to
         compelled testimony previously obtained from him. The

         guarantee under <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_298">Article 20(3)</a> that no person accused of
         an offence shall be compelled to be a witness against
         himself. The word ‘offence’ used in the article should be
         given its ordinary meaning. It applies as much to an
         offence committed under TADA as under any other Act.</blockquote><p id="p_56">
</p><p id="p_57">         The word, ‘compelled’ ordinarily means ‘by force’. This
         may take place positively and negatively. When one
         forces one to act in a manner desired by him it is
         compelling him to do that thing. Same may take place
         when one is prevented from doing a particular thing
         unless he agrees to do as desired. In either case it is
         compulsion. A confession made by an accused or
         obtained by him under coercion suffers from infirmity
         unless it is made freely and voluntarily. No civilised
         democratic country has accepted confession made by an
         accused before a police officer as voluntary and above
         suspicion, therefore, admissible in evidence. One of the
         established rule or norms accepted everywhere is that
         custodial confession is presumed to be tainted. The mere

         fact that the Legislature was competent to make the law,
         as the offence under TADA is one which did not fall in any
         State entry, did not mean that the Legislature was
         empowered to curtail or erode a person of his
         fundamental rights. Making a provision which has the
         effect of forcing a person to admit his guilt amounts to
         denial of the liberty. The class of offences dealt by TADA
         may be different than other offences but the offender
         under TADA is as much entitled to protection of Articles 20
         and 21 as any other. The difference in nature of offence or
         the legislative competence to enact a law did not affect
         the fundamental rights guaranteed by Chapter III. If the
         construction as suggested by the learned Additional

         cannot be held to be valid merely because it is as a result
         of law made by a body which has been found entitled to
         make the law. The law must still be fair and just as held by
         this Court. A law which entitles a police officer to record

</p><p id="p_61">         Ordinarily evidence is classified into three broad
         categories, namely, oral testimony, documents and

         read with <a href="/doc/1110422/" id="a_303">Section 161(2)</a> CrPC guards against the

identification or comparison with materials and information
that is already in the possession of investigators.

</p><p id="p_62">180. We have already stated that the narcoanalysis test
includes substantial reliance on verbal statements by the
test subject and hence its involuntary administration
offends the “right against self-incrimination”. The crucial
test laid down in Kathi Kalu Oghad is that of

“imparting knowledge in respect of relevant facts, by
means of oral statements or statements in writing by a
person who has personal knowledge of the facts to be
communicated to a court or to a person holding an
enquiry or investigation” (ibid. at SCR p. 30.).

The difficulty arises since the majority opinion in that case
appears to confine the understanding of “personal
testimony” to the conveyance of personal knowledge
through oral statements or statements in writing. The
results obtained from polygraph examination or a BEAP
test are not in the nature of oral or written statements.
Instead, inferences are drawn from the measurement of
physiological responses recorded during the performance
of these tests. It could also be argued that tests such as
polygraph examination and the BEAP test do not involve a
“positive volitional act” on part of the test subject and
hence their results should not be treated as testimony.
However, this does not entail that the results of these two
tests should be likened to physical evidence and thereby
excluded from the protective scope of <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_306">Article 20(3).</a>

</p><p id="p_63">181. We must refer back to the substance of the decision
in Kathi Kalu Oghad which equated a testimonial act with
the imparting of knowledge by a person who has personal
knowledge of the facts that are in issue. It has been
recognised in other decisions that such personal
knowledge about relevant facts can also be
communicated through means other than oral or written
statements. For example in M.P. Sharma case, it was
noted that “…evidence can be furnished through the lips
or by production of a thing or of a document or in other
modes.” (ibid. at SCR p. 1087) Furthermore, common
sense dictates that certain communicative gestures such

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                                                34</span>
as pointing or nodding can also convey personal
knowledge about a relevant fact, without offering a verbal
response. It is quite foreseeable that such a
communicative gesture may by itself expose a person to
“criminal charges or penalties” or furnish a link in the
chain of evidence needed for prosecution.
</p>
<p id="p_64">182. We must also highlight that there is nothing to show
that the learned Judges in Kathi Kalu Oghad had
contemplated the impugned techniques while discussing
the scope of the phrase “to be a witness” for the purpose
of <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_307">Article 20(3).</a> At that time, the transmission of
knowledge through means other than speech or writing
was not something that could have been easily conceived
of. Techniques such as polygraph examination were fairly
obscure and were the subject of experimentation in some
western nations while the BEAP technique was developed
several years later. Just as the interpretation of statutes
has to be often re-examined in light of scientific
advancements, we should also be willing to re-examine
judicial observations with a progressive lens.

</p><p id="p_65">183. An explicit reference to the lie detector tests was of
course    made       by   the    US      Supreme      Court
in Schmerber [384 US 757 (1965)] decision, wherein
Brennan, J. had observed at US p. 764: (L Ed p. 916)

“…To compel a person to submit to testing in which an
effort will be made to determine his guilt or innocence on
the basis of physiological responses, whether willed or
not, is to evoke the spirit and history of the Fifth
Amendment.”

</p><p id="p_66">184. Even though the actual process of undergoing a
polygraph examination or a BEAP test is not the same as
that of making an oral or written statement, the
consequences are similar. By making inferences from the
results of these tests, the examiner is able to derive
knowledge from the subject's mind which otherwise would
not have become available to the investigators. These two
tests are different from medical examination and the
analysis of bodily substances such as blood, semen and
hair samples, since the test subject's physiological

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                                                              35</span>
responses are directly correlated to mental faculties.
Through lie detection or gauging a subject's familiarity
with the stimuli, personal knowledge is conveyed in
respect of a relevant fact. It is also significant that unlike
the case of documents, the investigators cannot possibly
have any prior knowledge of the test subject's thoughts
and memories, either in the actual or constructive sense.
Therefore, even if a highly strained analogy were to be
made between the results obtained from the impugned
tests and the production of documents, the weight of
precedents leans towards restrictions on the extraction of
“personal knowledge” through such means.
</p>
<p id="p_67">185. During the administration of a polygraph test or a
BEAP test, the subject makes a mental effort which is
accompanied by certain physiological responses. The
measurement of these responses then becomes the basis
of the transmission of knowledge to the investigators. This
knowledge may aid an ongoing investigation or lead to the
discovery of fresh evidence which could then be used to
prosecute the test subject. In any case, the compulsory
administration of the impugned tests impedes the
subject's right to choose between remaining silent and
offering substantive information. The requirement of a
“positive volitional act” becomes irrelevant since the
subject is compelled to convey personal knowledge
irrespective of his/her own volition.
</p>
<p id="p_68">xxx xxx xxx

</p><p id="p_69">189. In light of the preceding discussion, we are of the
view that the results obtained from tests such as
polygraph examination and the BEAP test should also be
treated as “personal testimony”, since they are a means
for “imparting personal knowledge about relevant facts”.
Hence, our conclusion is that the results obtained through
the involuntary administration of either of the impugned
tests (i.e. the narcoanalysis technique, polygraph
examination and the BEAP test) come within the scope of
“testimonial compulsion”, thereby attracting the protective
shield of <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_308">Article 20(3).</a>

</p><p id="p_71">262. In our considered opinion, the compulsory
administration of the impugned techniques violates the
“right against self-incrimination”. This is because the
underlying rationale of the said right is to ensure the
reliability as well as voluntariness of statements that are
admitted as evidence. This Court has recognised that the
protective scope of <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_309">Article 20(3)</a> extends to the
investigative stage in criminal cases and when read with
<a href="/doc/1110422/" id="a_310">Section 161(2)</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 it
protects accused persons, suspects as well as witnesses
who are examined during an investigation. The test
results cannot be admitted in evidence if they have been
obtained through the use of compulsion. <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_311">Article 20(3)</a>
protects an individual's choice between speaking and
remaining silent, irrespective of whether the subsequent
testimony proves to be inculpatory or exculpatory. <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_312">Article
20(3)</a> aims to prevent the forcible “conveyance of personal
knowledge that is relevant to the facts in issue”. The
results obtained from each of the impugned tests bear a
“testimonial” character and they cannot be categorised as
material evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_72">263. We are also of the view that forcing an individual to
undergo any of the impugned techniques violates the
standard of “substantive due process” which is required
for restraining personal liberty. Such a violation will occur
irrespective of whether these techniques are forcibly
administered during the course of an investigation or for
any other purpose since the test results could also expose
a person to adverse consequences of a non-penal nature.
The impugned techniques cannot be read into the
statutory provisions which enable medical examination
during investigation in criminal cases i.e. the Explanation
to <a href="/doc/633996/" id="a_313">Sections 53</a>, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_314">53-A</a> and <a href="/doc/441720/" id="a_315">54</a> of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973. Such an expansive interpretation is not
feasible in light of the rule of “ejusdem generis” and the
considerations which govern the interpretation of statutes
in relation to scientific advancements. We have also
elaborated how the compulsory administration of any of
these techniques is an unjustified intrusion into the mental
privacy of an individual. It would also amount to “cruel,
inhuman or degrading treatment” with regard to the

</p><p id="p_73">         Furthermore, placing reliance on the results gathered from
         these techniques comes into conflict with the “right to fair
         trial”. Invocations of a compelling public interest cannot
         justify the dilution of constitutional rights such as the “right
         against self-incrimination”.

<p id="p_74">         264. In light of these conclusions, we hold that no
         individual should be forcibly subjected to any of the
         techniques in question, whether in the context of
         investigation in criminal cases or otherwise. Doing so
         would amount to an unwarranted intrusion into personal
         liberty. However, we do leave room for the voluntary
         administration of the impugned techniques in the context
         of criminal justice provided that certain safeguards are in
         place. Even when the subject has given consent to
         undergo any of these tests, the test results by themselves
         cannot be admitted as evidence because the subject does
         not exercise conscious control over the responses during
         the administration of the test. However, any information or
         material that is subsequently discovered with the help of
         voluntary administered test results can be admitted in
         accordance with <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_316">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act, 1872.”

</p><p id="p_75">25. Equally important is the right to privacy which has been recognised by a

   number of decisions of this Court, and now firmly grounded in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_317">Article 21</a>

   of the Constitution of India. In K.S. Puttaswamy (supra), several

   judgments were referred to; and M.P. Sharma (supra), where it was

   held that no such right was recognised in the Constitution of India, was

   overruled. Thus, in the judgment of Chandrachud, J., it was stated:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_23">         “26.M.P. Sharma [1954 SCR 1077] was a case where a
         law prescribing a search to obtain documents for

         contrary to the guarantee against self-incrimination in
         <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_318">Article 20(3).</a> The Court repelled the argument that a
         search for documents compelled a person accused of an
         offence to be witness against himself. Unlike a notice to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                                                            38</span>
produce documents, which is addressed to a person and
whose compliance would constitute a testimonial act, a
search warrant and a seizure which follows are not
testimonial acts of a person to whom the warrant is
addressed, within the meaning of <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_319">Article 20(3).</a> The Court
having held this, the controversy in M.P. Sharma would
rest at that. The observations in M.P. Sharma to the effect
that the Constitution makers had not thought it fit to
subject the regulatory power of search and seizure to
constitutional limitations by recognising a fundamental
right to privacy (like the US Fourth Amendment), and that
there was no justification to import it into a “totally different
fundamental right” are at the highest, stray observations.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_76">27. The decision in M.P. Sharma held that in the absence
of a provision like the Fourth Amendment to the US
Constitution, a right to privacy cannot be read into the
Indian Constitution. The decision in M.P. Sharma did not
decide whether a constitutional right to privacy is
protected by other provisions contained in the
fundamental rights including among them, the right to life
and personal liberty under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_320">Article 21.</a> Hence the decision
cannot be construed to specifically exclude the protection
of privacy under the framework of protected guarantees
including those in Articles 19 or 21. The absence of an
express constitutional guarantee of privacy still begs the
question whether privacy is an element of liberty and, as
an integral part of human dignity, is comprehended within
the protection of life as well.

<p id="p_77">xxx xxx xxx

</p><p id="p_78">100.M.P. Sharma dealt with a challenge to a search on
the ground that the statutory provision which authorised it,
violated the guarantee against self-incrimination in <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_321">Article
20(3).</a> In the absence of a specific provision like the
Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution in the Indian
Constitution, the Court answered the challenge by its
ruling that an individual who is subject to a search during
the course of which material is seized does not make a
voluntary testimonial statement of the nature that would
attract <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_322">Article 20(3).</a> The Court distinguished a compulsory
search from a voluntary statement of disclosure in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                                                                    39</span>
         pursuance of a notice issued by an authority to produce
         documents. It was the former category that was held to be
         involved in a compulsive search, which the Court held
         would not attract the guarantee against self-incrimination.
         The judgment, however, proceeded further to hold that in
         the absence of the right to privacy having been
         enumerated in the Constitution, a provision like the Fourth
         Amendment to the US Constitution could not be read into
         our own. The observation in regard to the absence of the
         right to privacy in our Constitution was strictly speaking,
         not necessary for the decision of the Court in M.P.
         Sharma and the observation itself is no more than a
         passing observation. Moreover, the decision does not
         adjudicate upon whether privacy could be a
         constitutionally protected right under any other provision
         such as <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_323">Article 21</a> or under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_324">Article 19.</a>
</p>
<p id="p_79">         xxx xxx xxx

</p><p id="p_80">         316. The judgment in M.P. Sharma holds essentially that
         in the absence of a provision similar to the Fourth
         Amendment to the US Constitution, the right to privacy
         cannot be read into the provisions of <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_325">Article 20(3)</a> of the
         Indian Constitution. The judgment does not specifically
         adjudicate on whether a right to privacy would arise from
         any of the other provisions of the rights guaranteed by
         Part III including <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_326">Article 21</a> and <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_327">Article 19.</a> The observation
         that privacy is not a right guaranteed by the Indian
         Constitution is not reflective of the correct position. M.P.
         Sharma is overruled to the extent to which it indicates to
         the contrary.”

</p><p id="p_81">26. The judgment of Nariman, J. held as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_24">         “442. The importance of Semayne case [77 ER 194] is
         that it decided that every man's home is his castle and
         fortress for his defence against injury and violence, as
         well as for his repose. William Pitt, the Elder, put it thus:</blockquote><p id="p_82">

</p><p id="p_83">         “The poorest man may in his cottage bid defiance to all
         the force of the Crown. It may be frail—its roof may shake

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                                                         40</span>
his force dare not cross the threshold of the ruined
tenement.”

A century and a half later, pretty much the same thing was
said in Huckle v. Money [Huckle v. Money 95 ER 768] in
which it was held that Magistrates cannot exercise
arbitrary powers which violated the Magna Carta (signed
by King John, conceding certain rights to his barons in
1215), and if they did, exemplary damages must be given
for the same. It was stated that: (ER p. 769)

“… To enter a man's house by virtue of a nameless
warrant, in order to procure evidence, is worse than the
Spanish Inquisition; a law under which no Englishman
would wish to live an hour….”

</p><p id="p_84">443. This statement of the law was echoed
in Entick v. Carrington [Entick v. Carrington 95 ER 807] in
which Lord Camden held that an illegal search warrant
was “subversive of all the comforts of society” and the
issuance of such a warrant for the seizure of all of a man's
papers, and not only those alleged to be criminal in
nature, was “contrary to the genius of the law of England”.
A few years later, in Da Costa v. Jones [Da Costa v. Jones
98 ER 1331] , Lord Mansfield upheld the privacy of a third
person when such privacy was the subject-matter of a
wager, which was injurious to the reputation of such third
person. The wager in that case was as to whether a
certain Chevalier D'eon was a cheat and imposter in that
he was actually a woman. Such wager which violated the
privacy of a third person was held to be injurious to the
reputation of the third person for which damages were
awarded to the third person. These early judgments did
much to uphold the inviolability of the person of a citizen.

</p><p id="p_85">456. The first thing that strikes one on reading the
aforesaid passage is that the Court (in M.P. Sharma)
resisted the invitation to read the US Fourth Amendment
into the US Fifth Amendment; in short it refused to read or
import the Fourth Amendment into the Indian equivalent of
that part of the Fifth Amendment which is the same as

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                                                               41</span>
<a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_328">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution of India. Also, the
fundamental right to privacy, stated to be analogous to the
Fourth Amendment, was held to be something which
could not be read into <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_329">Article 20(3).</a>
</p>
<p id="p_86">457. The second interesting thing to be noted about these
observations is that there is no broad ratio in the said
judgment that a fundamental right to privacy is not
available in Part III of the Constitution. The observation is
confined to <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_330">Article 20(3).</a> Further, it is clear that the actual
finding in the aforesaid case had to do with the law which
had developed in this Court as well as the US and the UK
on <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_331">Article 20(3)</a> which, on the facts of the case, was held
not to be violated. Also we must not forget that this was an
early judgment of the Court, delivered in the Gopalan era,
which did not have the benefit of R.C. Cooper or Maneka
Gandhi. Quite apart from this, it is clear that by the time
this judgment was delivered, India was already a
signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_332">Article 12</a> of which states:
</p>
<p id="p_87">“12. No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference
with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to
attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the
right to the protection of the law against such interference
or attacks.”

</p><p id="p_88">468. It will be seen that different smaller Benches of this
Court were not unduly perturbed by the observations
contained in M.P. Sharma as it was an early judgment of
this Court delivered in the Gopalan era which had been
eroded by later judgments dealing with the interrelation
between fundamental rights and the development of the
fundamental right to privacy as being part of the liberty
and dignity of the individual.
</p>
<p id="p_89">469. Therefore, given the fact that this judgment dealt only
with <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_333">Article 20(3)</a> and not with other fundamental rights;
given the fact that the 1948 Universal Declaration of
Human Rights containing the right to privacy was not
pointed out to the Court; given the fact that it was

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                                                                  42</span>
delivered in an era when fundamental rights had to be
read disjunctively in watertight compartments; and given
the fact that <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_334">Article 21</a> as we know it today only sprung
into life in the post Maneka Gandhi era, we are of the view
that this judgment is completely out of harm's way insofar
as the grounding of the right to privacy in the fundamental
rights chapter is concerned.

<p id="p_90">xxx xxx xxx

</p><p id="p_91">472. The majority judgment in <a href="/doc/179237868/" id="a_335">Kharak Singh [Kharak
Singh v. State of U.P</a>., (1964) 1 SCR 332] then went on to
refer to the Preamble to the Constitution, and stated that
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_336">Article 21</a> contained the cherished human value of dignity
of the individual as the means of ensuring his full
development and evolution. A passage was then quoted
from Wolf v. Colorado [Wolf v. Colorado 338 US 25
(1949)] to the effect that the security of one's
privacy against arbitrary intrusion by the police is basic to
a free society. The Court then went on to quote the US
Fourth Amendment which guarantees the rights of the
people to be secured in their persons, houses, papers and
effects against unreasonable searches and seizures.
Though the Indian Constitution did not expressly confer a
like guarantee, the majority held that nonetheless an
unauthorised intrusion into a person's home would violate
the English Common Law maxim which asserts that every
man's house is his castle. In this view of <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_337">Article 21</a>,
Regulation 236(b) was struck down.
</p>
<p id="p_92">xxx xxx xxx

</p><p id="p_93">475. If the passage in the judgment dealing with
domiciliary visits at night and striking it down is contrasted
with the later passage upholding the other clauses of
Regulation 236 extracted above, it becomes clear that it
cannot be said with any degree of clarity that the majority
judgment upholds the right to privacy as being contained
in the fundamental rights chapter or otherwise. As the
majority judgment contradicts itself on this vital aspect, it
would be correct to say that it cannot be given much value
as a binding precedent. In any case, we are of the view

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                                                                 43</span>
that the majority judgment is good law when it speaks of
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_338">Article 21</a> being designed to assure the dignity of the
individual as a most cherished human value which
ensures the means of full development and evolution of a
human being. The majority judgment is also correct in
pointing out that <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_339">Article 21</a> interdicts unauthorised
intrusion into a person's home. Where the majority
judgment goes wrong is in holding that fundamental rights
are in watertight compartments and in holding that the
right to privacy is not a guaranteed right under our
Constitution. It can be seen, therefore, that the majority
judgment is like the proverbial curate's egg—good only in
parts. Strangely enough when the good parts alone are
seen, there is no real difference between Subba Rao, J.'s
approach in the dissenting judgment and the majority
judgment. This then answers the major part of the
reference to this nine-Judge Bench in that we hereby
declare that neither the eight-Judge nor the six-Judge
Bench can be read to come in the way of reading the
fundamental right to privacy into Part III of the
Constitution.

<p id="p_94">xxx xxx xxx

</p><p id="p_95">521. In the Indian context, a fundamental right to privacy
would cover at least the following three aspects:

• Privacy that involves the person i.e. when there is some
invasion by the State of a person's rights relatable to his
physical body, such as the right to move freely

• Informational privacy which does not deal with a
person's body but deals with a person's mind, and
therefore recognises that an individual may have control
over the dissemination of material that is personal to him.
Unauthorised use of such information may, therefore lead
to infringement of this right; and

• The privacy of choice, which protects an individual's
autonomy over fundamental personal choices.
</p>
<p id="p_96">For instance, we can ground physical privacy or privacy
relating to the body in Articles 19(1)(d) and (e) read with

   <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_342">Article 21</a>, Parliament being aware of the fundamental rights of the

   citizen and the judgments of this Court interpreting them, as a result of

   which a delicate balance is maintained between the power of the State

   to maintain law and order, and the fundamental rights chapter which

   protects the liberty of the individual. Several safeguards are thus

   contained in the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_343">NDPS Act</a>, which is of an extremely drastic and

   draconian nature, as has been contended by the counsel for the

   Appellants before us. Also, the fundamental rights contained in Articles

   20(3) and 21 are given pride of place in the Constitution. After the 42 nd

   Amendment to the Constitution was done away with by the 44 th

   Amendment, it is now provided that even in an Emergency, these rights

   cannot be suspended – see <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_344">Article 359(1).</a> The interpretation of a

   statute like the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_345">NDPS Act</a> must needs be in conformity and in tune with

   the spirit of the broad fundamental right not to incriminate oneself, and

   the right to privacy, as has been found in the recent judgments of this

   Court.

         himself against any charge of supinates or neglect by
         getting up a case against parties whose circumstances or
         characters are such as are likely to obtain credit for an
         accusation of the kind against them. This is not
         infrequently done by extorting or fabricating false
         confession, and when this step is once taken, there is of
         course impunity for real offenders, and a great
         encouragement to crime. The darogah is henceforth
         committed to the direction he has given to the case; and it
         is his object to prevent a discovery of the truth, and the
         apprehension of the guilty parties, Who, as far as the
         police are concerned, are now perfectly safe. We are
         persuaded that any provision to correct the exercise of
         this power by the police will be futile; and we accordingly
         propose to remedy the evil, as far as possible, by the
         adoption of a rule prohibiting any examination whatever of
         any accused party by the police, the result of which is to
         constitute a written document.”

</blockquote><p id="p_103">31. It is important to emphasise that the interpretation of the term “accused”

   in <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_358">section 25</a> of the Evidence Act is materially different from that

   contained in <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_359">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution. The scope of the section is

   not limited by time – it is immaterial that the person was not an accused

   at the time when the confessional statement was made. This was

   felicitously put by this Court in Deoman Upadhyaya (supra) as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_31">         “By <a href="/doc/1373137/" id="a_360">Section 24</a>, in a criminal proceeding against a person,
         a confession made by him is inadmissible if it appears to
         the court to have been caused by inducement, threat or
         promise having reference to the charge and proceeding
         from a person in authority. By <a href="/doc/1089586/" id="a_361">Section 25</a>, there is an
         absolute ban against proof at the trial of a person accused
         of an offence, of a confession made to a police officer.</blockquote><p id="p_104">
</p><p id="p_105">         The ban which is partial under <a href="/doc/1373137/" id="a_362">Section 24</a> and complete
         under <a href="/doc/1089586/" id="a_363">Section 25</a> applies equally whether or not the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">                                                                           48</span>
        person against whom evidence is sought to be led in a
        criminal trial was at the time of making the confession in
        custody. For the ban to be effective the person need not
        have been accused of an offence when he made the
        confession. The expression, “accused person” in <a href="/doc/1373137/" id="a_364">Section
        24</a> and the expression “a person accused of any offence”
        have the same connotation, and describe the person
        against whom evidence is sought to be led in a criminal
        proceeding.       As     observed   in Pakala     Narayan
        Swami v. Emperor [LR 66 IA 66] by the Judicial
        Committee of the Privy Council, “<a href="/doc/1089586/" id="a_365">Section 25</a> covers a
        confession made to a police officer before any
        investigation has begun or otherwise not in the course of
        an investigation”. The adjectival clause “accused of any
        offence” is therefore descriptive of the person against
        whom a confessional statement made by him is declared
        not provable, and does not predicate a condition of that
        person at the time of making the statement for the
        applicability of the ban.”
                                                      (at page 21)

</p><p id="p_106">32. Likewise, in <a href="/doc/924340/" id="a_366">Agnoo Nagesia v. State of Bihar</a> (1966) 1 SCR 134, the

   Court held:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_32">        “<a href="/doc/1089586/" id="a_367">Section 25</a> provides: “No confession made to a police
        officer, shall be proved as against a person accused of an
        offence”. The terms of <a href="/doc/1089586/" id="a_368">Section 25</a> are imperative. A
        confession made to a police officer under any
        circumstances is not admissible in evidence against the
        accused. It covers a confession made when he was free
        and not in police custody, as also a confession made
        before any investigation has begun. The expression
        “accused of any offence” covers a person accused of an
        offence at the trial whether or not he was accused of the
        offence when he made the confession.”
                                                      (at page 137)

</blockquote><p id="p_107">33. Thus, whereas a formal accusation is necessary for invoking the

   protection under <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_369">Article 20(3</a>), the same would be irrelevant for invoking

   the protection under <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_370">section 25</a> of the Evidence Act.

</p><p id="p_108">34. <a href="/doc/387768/" id="a_371">Section 26</a> of the Evidence Act extends the protection to confessional

   statements made by persons while “in the custody” of a police-officer,

   unless it be made in the immediate presence of a Magistrate. “Custody”

   is not synonymous with “arrest”, as has been held in a number of

   judgments of this Court – custody could refer to a situation pre-arrest,

   as was the case in <a href="/doc/1997357/" id="a_372">State of Haryana and Ors. v. Dinesh Kumar</a>

   (2008) 3 SCC 222 (see paragraphs 27-29). In fact, <a href="/doc/706971/" id="a_373">section 46</a> of the

   CrPC speaks of “a submission to the custody by word or action”, which

   would, inter alia, refer to a voluntary appearance before a police officer

   without any formal arrest being made.

        were enacted a long time ago. With the passage of time
        and the developments in the field of illicit drug traffic and
        drug abuse at national and international level, many
        deficiencies in the existing laws have come to notice,
        some of which are indicated below:

<blockquote id="blockquote_37">        (i)    The scheme of penalties under the present Acts is
               not sufficiently deterrent to meet the challenge of
               well organized gangs of smugglers. The Dangerous
               Drugs Act, 1930 provides for a maximum term of
               imprisonment of 3 years with or without fine and 4
               years imprisonment with or without fine for repeat
               offences. Further, no minimum punishment is

               drug traffickers have been some times let off by the

                narcotics control has evolved through various
                international   treaties   and     protocols.    The
                Government of India has been a party to these
                treaties and conventions which entail several
                obligations which are not covered or are only partly
                covered by the present Acts.

<p id="p_121">        (iv)    During recent years new drugs of addiction which
                have come to be known as psychotropic substances

                problems to national government. There is no
                comprehensive law to enable exercise of control
                over psychotropic substances in India in the manner
                as envisaged in the Convention on Psychotropic
                Substances, 1971 to which India has also acceded.

</p><p id="p_122">        2. In view of what has been stated above, there is an
        urgent need for the enactment of a comprehensive

        existing laws relating to narcotic drugs, strengthen the
        existing controls over drug abuse, considerably enhance
        the penalties particularly for trafficking offences, make
        provisions for exercising effective control over
        psychotropic substances and make provisions for the
        implementation of international conventions relating to
        narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances to which
        India has become a party.

   investing, for the first time, the officers of central enforcement agencies

   with the power of investigation of offences under the new law.

   Undoubtedly, the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_420">NDPS Act</a> is a comprehensive legislation which makes

   provisions for exercising control over narcotic drugs and psychotropic

   substances, at the heart of which is the power vested in various officers

   to investigate offences under the Act, so as to prevent and punish the

   same against offenders being, inter alia, organised gangs of smugglers

   who indulge in what is considered by Parliament to be a menace to

   society. Also, the preamble to the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_421">NDPS Act</a> states:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_38">         “<a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_422">An Act</a> to consolidate and amend the law relating to

         and regulation of operations relating to narcotic drugs and
         psychotropic substances, to provide for the forfeiture of
         property derived from, or used in, illicit traffic in narcotic
         drugs and psychotropic substances, to implement the
         provisions of the International Convention on Narcotic

   15-24</a> speak of various drugs and psychotropic substances, in which

   offences under the Act, and the fundamental rights of the citizen.

   Several safeguards are contained in <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_460">section 42</a>, which states as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_48">        “42. Power of entry, search, seizure and arrest without

<p id="p_146">Provided further that if such officer has reason to believe
that a search warrant or authorisation cannot be obtained
without affording opportunity for the concealment of

         under sub-section (1) or records grounds for his belief
         under the proviso thereto, he shall within seventy-two
         hours send a copy thereof to his immediate official
         superior.”

</p><p id="p_148">46. From this section it is clear that only when the concerned officer has

   “reason to believe” from personal knowledge or information given by

   any person and taken down in writing that an offence has been

   committed, that the concerned officer may, only between sunrise and

   sunset, enter, search, seize drugs and materials, and arrest any person

   who he believes has committed any offence. By the first proviso, this

   can be done only by an officer not below the rank of sub-inspector.

   Under sub-section (2) in addition, where the information in writing is

   given, the officer involved must send a copy thereof to his immediate

   official superior within seventy-two hours. It is important here to contrast

   “reason to believe” with the expression “reason to suspect”, which is

   contained in <a href="/doc/1798309/" id="a_461">section 49</a> of the NDPS Act. Thus, “reason to believe” has

   been construed by this Court in <a href="/doc/321914/" id="a_462">A.S. Krishnan v. State of Kerala</a>

   (2004) 11 SCC 576 as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_50">         “9. Under <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_463">IPC</a>, guilt in respect of almost all the offences is
         fastened either on the ground of “intention” or “knowledge”
         or “reason to believe”. We are now concerned with the
         expressions “knowledge” and “reason to believe”.
         “Knowledge” is an awareness on the part of the person
         concerned indicating his state of mind. “Reason to
         believe” is another facet of the state of mind. “Reason to
         believe” is not the same thing as “suspicion” or “doubt”
         and mere seeing also cannot be equated to believing.
</blockquote>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">                                                                            62</span>
<p id="p_149">        “Reason to believe” is a higher level of state of mind.
</p><p id="p_150">        Likewise “knowledge” will be slightly on a higher plane
        than “reason to believe”. A person can be supposed to
        know where there is a direct appeal to his senses and a
        person is presumed to have a reason to believe if he has
        sufficient cause to believe the same. <a href="/doc/1475631/" id="a_464">Section 26</a> IPC
        explains the meaning of the words “reason to believe”
        thus:
</p>
<p id="p_151">        “26. ‘Reason to believe’.—A person is said to have
        ‘reason to believe’ a thing, if he has sufficient cause to

   under which a search of persons shall be conducted. <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_466">Section 50</a> states:

         an opportunity to the person to be searched “if he so
         requires to be searched before a gazetted officer or a
         Magistrate” he must be made aware of that right and that
         could be done only by the empowered officer

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">                                                                        64</span>
by informing him of the existence of that right. The Court
went on to hold that failure to inform the person to be
searched of that right and if he so requires, failure to take
him to the gazetted officer or the Magistrate, would mean
non-compliance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_488">Section 50</a> which in
turn would “affect the prosecution case and vitiate the
trial”. The following conclusions were arrived at by the
two-Judge Bench in <a href="/doc/166513655/" id="a_489">State of Punjab v. Balbir Singh</a>:

“25. The questions considered above arise frequently
before the trial courts. Therefore we find it necessary to
set out our conclusions which are as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_159">(1) If a police officer without any prior information as
contemplated under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_490">NDPS Act</a>
makes a search or arrests a person in the normal course
of investigation into an offence or suspected offences as
provided under the provisions of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_491">CrPC</a> and when such
search is completed at that stage <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_492">Section 50</a> of the NDPS
Act would not be attracted and the question of complying
with the requirements thereunder would not arise. If
during such search or arrest there is a chance recovery of
any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance then the
police officer, who is not empowered, should inform the
empowered officer who should thereafter proceed in
accordance with the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_493">NDPS Act</a>. If he
happens to be an empowered officer also, then from that
stage onwards, he should carry out the investigation in
accordance with the other provisions of the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_494">NDPS Act</a>.

(2-A) Under <a href="/doc/1200558/" id="a_495">Section 41(1)</a> only an empowered Magistrate
can issue warrant for the arrest or for the search in
respect of offences punishable under Chapter IV of the
Act etc. when he has reason to believe that such offences
have been committed or such substances are kept or
concealed in any building, conveyance or place. When
such warrant for arrest or for search is issued by a
Magistrate who is not empowered, then such search or
arrest if carried out would be illegal. Likewise only
empowered officers or duly authorized officers as
enumerated in <a href="/doc/1223622/" id="a_496">Sections 41(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/855593/" id="a_497">42(1)</a> can act under the
provisions of the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_498">NDPS Act</a>. If such arrest or search is
made under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_499">NDPS Act</a> by anyone
other than such officers, the same would be illegal.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">                                                                65</span>
(2-B) Under <a href="/doc/1223622/" id="a_500">Section 41(2)</a> only the empowered officer can
give the authorisation to his subordinate officer to carry
out the arrest of a person or search as mentioned therein.
If there is a contravention, that would affect the
prosecution case and vitiate the conviction.
</p>
<p id="p_160">(2-C) Under <a href="/doc/855593/" id="a_501">Section 42(1)</a> the empowered officer if has a
prior information given by any person, that should
necessarily be taken down in writing. But if he has reason
to believe from personal knowledge that offences under
Chapter IV have been committed or materials which may
furnish evidence of commission of such offences are
concealed in any building etc. he may carry out the arrest
or search without a warrant between sunrise and sunset
and this provision does not mandate that he should record
his reasons of belief. But under the proviso to <a href="/doc/855593/" id="a_502">Section
42(1)</a> if such officer has to carry out such search between
sunset and sunrise, he must record the grounds of his
belief.
</p>
<p id="p_161">To this extent these provisions are mandatory and
contravention of the same would affect the prosecution
case and vitiate the trial.
</p>
<p id="p_162">(3) Under <a href="/doc/1158106/" id="a_503">Section 42(2)</a> such empowered officer who
takes down any information in writing or records the
grounds under proviso to <a href="/doc/855593/" id="a_504">Section 42(1)</a> should forthwith
send a copy thereof to his immediate official superior. If
there is total non-compliance of this provision the same
affects the prosecution case. To that extent it is
mandatory. But if there is delay whether it was undue or
whether the same has been explained or not, will be a
question of fact in each case.
</p>
<p id="p_163">(4-A) If a police officer, even if he happens to be an
‘empowered’ officer while effecting an arrest or search
during normal investigation into offences purely under the
provisions of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_505">CrPC</a> fails to strictly comply with the
provisions of <a href="/doc/1137396/" id="a_506">Sections 100</a> and <a href="/doc/996365/" id="a_507">165</a> CrPC including the
requirement to record reasons, such failure would only
amount to an irregularity.
</p>
<p id="p_164">(4-B) If an empowered officer or an authorised officer
under <a href="/doc/1223622/" id="a_508">Section 41(2)</a> of the Act carries out a search, he

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">                                                             66</span>
would be doing so under the provisions of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_509">CrPC</a> namely
<a href="/doc/1137396/" id="a_510">Sections 100</a> and <a href="/doc/996365/" id="a_511">165</a> CrPC and if there is no strict
compliance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_512">CrPC</a> then such search
would not per se be illegal and would not vitiate the trial.

The effect of such failure has to be borne in mind by the
courts while appreciating the evidence in the facts and
circumstances of each case.
</p>
<p id="p_165">(5) On prior information the empowered officer or
authorised officer while acting under <a href="/doc/1223622/" id="a_513">Sections 41(2)</a> or 42
should comply with the provisions of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_514">Section 50</a> before the
search of the person is made and such person should be
informed that if he so requires, he shall be produced
before a gazetted officer or a Magistrate as provided
thereunder. It is obligatory on the part of such officer to
inform the person to be searched. Failure to inform the
person to be searched and if such person so requires,
failure to take him to the gazetted officer or the
Magistrate, would amount to non-compliance of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_515">Section
50</a> which is mandatory and thus it would affect the
prosecution case and vitiate the trial. After being so
informed whether such person opted for such a course or
not would be a question of fact.
</p>
<p id="p_166">(6) The provisions of <a href="/doc/1294540/" id="a_516">Sections 52</a> and <a href="/doc/669884/" id="a_517">57</a> which deal with
the steps to be taken by the officers after making arrest or
seizure under <a href="/doc/1439062/" id="a_518">Sections 41</a> to <a href="/doc/109977/" id="a_519">44</a> are by themselves not
mandatory. If there is non-compliance or if there are
lapses like delay etc. then the same has to be examined
to see whether any prejudice has been caused to the
accused and such failure will have a bearing on the
appreciation of evidence regarding arrest or seizure as
well as on merits of the case.”

</p><p id="p_167">57. On the basis of the reasoning and discussion above,
the following conclusions arise:
</p>
<p id="p_168">(1) That when an empowered officer or a duly authorised
officer acting on prior information is about to search a
person, it is imperative for him to inform the concerned

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">                                                               67</span>
person of his right under Sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_520">Section 50</a> of
being taken to the nearest Gazetted Officer or the nearest
Magistrate for making the search. However, such
information may not necessarily be in writing;

(2) That failure to inform the concerned person about the
existence of his right to be searched before a Gazetted
Officer or a Magistrate would cause prejudice to an
accused;
</p>
<p id="p_169">(3) That a search made, by an empowered officer, on prior
information, without informing the person of his right that,
if he so requires, he shall be taken before a Gazetted
Officer or a Magistrate for search and in case he so opts,
failure to conduct his search before a Gazetted Officer or
a Magistrate, may not vitiate the trial but would render the
recovery of the illicit article suspect and vitiate the
conviction and sentence of an accused, where the
conviction has been recorded only on the basis of the
possession of the illicit article, recovered from his person,
during a search conducted in violation of the provisions
of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_521">Section 50</a> of the Act;
</p>
<p id="p_170">(4) That there is indeed need to protect society from
criminals. The societal intent in safety will suffer if persons
who commit crimes are let off because the evidence
against them is to be treated as if it does not exist. The
answer, therefore, is that the investigating agency must
follow the procedure as envisaged by the statute
scrupulously and the failure to do so must be viewed by
the higher authorities seriously inviting action against the
concerned official so that the laxity on the part of the
investigating authority is curbed. In every case the end
result is important but the means to achieve it must
remain above board. The remedy cannot be worse than
the disease itself. The legitimacy of judicial process may
come under cloud if the court is seen to condone acts of
lawlessness conducted by the investigating agency during
search operations and may also undermine respect for
law and may have the effect of unconscionably
compromising the administration of justice. That cannot
be permitted. An accused is entitled to a fair trial. A
conviction resulting from an unfair trial is contrary to our
concept of justice. The use of evidence collected in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_68">                                                                  68</span>
breach of the safeguards provided by <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_522">Section 50</a> at the
trial, would render the trial unfair.
</p>
<p id="p_171">(5) That whether or not the safeguards provided
in <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_523">Section 50</a> have been duly observed would have to be
determined by the Court on the basis of evidence led at
the trial. Finding on that issue, one way or the other,
would be relevant for recording an order of conviction or
acquittal. Without giving an opportunity to the prosecution
to establish, at the trial, that the provisions of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_524">Section 50</a>,
and particularly the safeguards provided therein were duly
complied with, it would not be permissible to cut-short a
criminal trial;
</p>
<p id="p_172">(6) That in the context in which the protection has been
incorporated in <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_525">Section 50</a> for the benefit of the person
intended to be searched, we do not express any opinion
whether the provisions of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_526">Section 50</a> are mandatory or
directory, but, hold that failure to inform the concerned
person of his right as emanating from Sub-section (1)
of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_527">Section 50</a>, may render the recovery of the contraband
suspect and the conviction and sentence of an accused
bad and unsustainable in law;
</p>
<p id="p_173">(7) That an illicit article seized from the person of an
accused during search conducted in violation of the
safeguards provided in <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_528">Section 50</a> of the Act cannot be
used as evidence of proof of unlawful possession of the
contraband on the accused though any other material
recovered during that search may be relied upon by the
prosecution, in other proceedings, against an accused,
notwithstanding the recovery of that material during an
illegal search;
</p>
<p id="p_174">(8) A presumption under <a href="/doc/1297682/" id="a_529">Section 54</a> of the Act can only be
raised after the prosecution has established that the
accused was found to be in possession of the contraband
in a search conducted in accordance with the mandate
of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_530">Section 50</a>. An illegal search cannot entitle the
prosecution to raise a presumption under <a href="/doc/1297682/" id="a_531">Section 54</a> of
the Act

(9) That the judgment in Pooran Mal's case cannot be
understood to have laid down that an illicit article seized

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_69">                                                                 69</span>
        during a search of a person, on prior information,
        conducted in violation of the provisions of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_532">Section 50</a> of
        the Act, can by itself be used as evidence of unlawful
        possession of the illicit article on the person from whom
        the contraband has been seized during the illegal search;

        (10) That the judgment in Ali Mustaffa's case correctly
        interprets and distinguishes the judgment in Pooran Mal's
        case and the broad observations made in Pirthi Chand's
        case and Jasbir Singh's case are not in tune with the
        correct exposition of law as laid down in Pooran Mal's
        case. The above conclusions are not a summary of our
        judgment and have to be read and considered in the light
        of the entire discussion contained in the earlier part.”

</p><p id="p_175">49. Immediately after this judgment, Parliament enacted sub-sections (5)

   and (6). Despite the enactment of these provisions, this Court in

   Vijaysinh Chandubha Jadeja (supra) specifically held as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_56">        “24. Although the Constitution Bench in Baldev Singh
        case [(1999) 6 SCC 172] did not decide in absolute terms
        the question whether or not <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_533">Section 50</a> of the NDPS Act
        was directory or mandatory yet it was held that provisions
        of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_534">Section 50</a> make it imperative for the
        empowered officer to “inform” the person concerned
        (suspect) about the existence of his right that if he so
        requires, he shall be searched before a gazetted officer or
        a Magistrate; failure to “inform” the suspect about the
        existence of his said right would cause prejudice to him,
        and in case he so opts, failure to conduct his search
        before a gazetted officer or a Magistrate, may not vitiate
        the trial but would render the recovery of the illicit article
        suspect and vitiate the conviction and sentence of an
        accused, where the conviction has been recorded only on
        the basis of the possession of the illicit article, recovered
        from the person during a search conducted in violation of
        the provisions of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_535">Section 50</a> of the NDPS Act. The Court
        also noted that it was not necessary that the information
        required to be given under <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_536">Section 50</a> should be in a
        prescribed form or in writing but it was mandatory that the

be searched before a gazetted officer or a Magistrate, if
so required by him. We respectfully concur with these
conclusions. Any other interpretation of the provision
would make the valuable right conferred on the suspect
illusory and a farce.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_176">xxx xxx xxx

</p><p id="p_177">27. It can, thus, be seen that apart from the fact that
in Karnail Singh [(2009) 8 SCC 539], the issue was
regarding the scope and applicability of <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_537">Section 42</a> of the
NDPS Act in the matter of conducting search, seizure and
arrest without warrant or authorisation, the said decision
does not depart from the dictum laid down in Baldev
Singh case [(1999) 6 SCC 172] insofar as the obligation of
the empowered officer to inform the suspect of his right
enshrined in sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_538">Section 50</a> of the NDPS
Act is concerned. It is also plain from the said paragraph
that the flexibility in procedural requirements in terms of
the two newly inserted sub-sections can be resorted to
only in emergent and urgent situations, contemplated in
the provision, and not as a matter of course. Additionally,
sub-section (6) of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_539">Section 50</a> of the NDPS Act makes it
imperative and obligatory on the authorised officer to send
a copy of the reasons recorded by him for his belief in
terms of sub-section (5), to his immediate superior officer,
within the stipulated time, which exercise would again be
subjected to judicial scrutiny during the course of trial.

xxx xxx xxx

</p><p id="p_178">29. In view of the foregoing discussion, we are of the firm
opinion that the object with which the right under <a href="/doc/1288137/" id="a_540">Section
50(1)</a> of the NDPS Act, by way of a safeguard, has been
conferred on the suspect viz. to check the misuse of
power, to avoid harm to innocent persons and to minimise
the allegations of planting or foisting of false cases by the
law enforcement agencies, it would be imperative on the
part of the empowered officer to apprise the person
intended to be searched of his right to be searched before
a gazetted officer or a Magistrate. We have no hesitation
in holding that insofar as the obligation of the authorised
officer under sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_541">Section 50</a> of the NDPS
Act is concerned, it is mandatory and requires strict

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_71">                                                                71</span>
         compliance. Failure to comply with the provision would
         render the recovery of the illicit article suspect and vitiate
         the conviction if the same is recorded only on the basis of
         the recovery of the illicit article from the person of the
         accused during such search. Thereafter, the suspect may
         or may not choose to exercise the right provided to him
         under the said provision.
</p>
<p id="p_179">         xxx xxx xxx

</p><p id="p_180">         31. We are of the opinion that the concept of “substantial
         compliance” with the requirement of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_542">Section 50</a> of the
         NDPS Act introduced and read into the mandate of the
         said section in Joseph Fernandez [(2000) 1 SCC 707]
         and Prabha Shankar Dubey [(2004) 2 SCC 56] is neither
         borne out from the language of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_543">Section
         50</a> nor is it in consonance with the dictum laid down
         in Baldev Singh case [(1999) 6 SCC 172]. Needless to
         add that the question whether or not the procedure
         prescribed has been followed and the requirement of
         <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_544">Section 50</a> had been met, is a matter of trial. It would
         neither be possible nor feasible to lay down any absolute
         formula in that behalf.”

</p><p id="p_181">50. Thus, this extremely important safeguard continues, as has been

   originally enacted, subject only to the exceptions in sub-sections (5) and

   (6), which can only be used in urgent and emergent situations. This

   Court has clearly held that non-compliance of this provision would lead

   to the conviction of the accused being vitiated, and that “substantial”

   compliance with these provisions would not save the prosecution case.

sub-section (2) only a gazetted officer or other officers

provided if they have reason to believe from personal
knowledge or information. In both these provisions there
are two important requirements. One is that the
Magistrate or the officers mentioned therein firstly be
empowered and they must have reason to believe that an
offence under Chapter IV has been committed or that
such arrest or search was necessary for other purposes
mentioned in the provision. So far as the first requirement
is concerned, it can be seen that the legislature intended
that only certain Magistrates and certain officers of higher
rank and empowered can act to effect the arrest or
search. This is a safeguard provided having regard to the
deterrent sentences contemplated and with a view that
innocent persons are not harassed. Therefore if an arrest
or search contemplated under these provisions of <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_584">NDPS

competent and empowered Magistrates or officers
mentioned thereunder.”

an accused is founded upon and subject to satisfaction of
the officer as the term “reason to believe” has been used.
Such belief may be founded upon secret information that
may be orally conveyed by the informant. Draconian
provision which may lead to a harsh sentence having
regard to the doctrine of “due process” as adumbrated
under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_585">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India requires
striking of balance between the need of law and

         scrupulous compliance with the statutory provisions must
         be insisted upon.”

</blockquote><p id="p_199">57. With this pronouncement of the law in mind, let us now examine the two

   questions that have been referred to us.
</p>
<p id="p_200">   SCOPE OF SECTION 67 OF THE NDPS ACT

</p><p id="p_201">58. <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_588">Section 67</a> of the NDPS Act is set out hereinbelow:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_67">         “67. Power to call for information, etc.—Any officer
         referred to in <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_589">section 42</a> who is authorised in this behalf by
         the Central Government or a State Government may,
         during the course of any enquiry in connection with the
         contravention of any provision of this Act,—

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_68">         (a) call for information from any person for the purpose of
         satisfying himself whether there has been any
         contravention of the provisions of this Act or any rule or
         order made thereunder;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_69">         (b) require any person to produce or deliver any document
         or thing useful or relevant to the enquiry;
</blockquote>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">                                                                           77</span>
<p id="p_202">         (c) examine any person acquainted with the facts and
         circumstances of the case.”

</p><p id="p_203">59. The marginal note to the section indicates that it refers only to the

   power to “call for information, etc.”. As has been held by this Court in

   <a href="/doc/399708/" id="a_590">K.P. Varghese v. Income Tax Officer, Ernakulam and Anr</a>. (1981) 4

   SCC 173, a marginal note is an important internal tool for indicating the

   meaning and purpose of a section in a statute, as it indicates the “drift”

   of the provision. The Court held as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_70">         “9. This interpretation of sub-section (2) is strongly
         supported by the marginal note to <a href="/doc/1294540/" id="a_591">Section 52</a> which reads
         “Consideration for transfer in cases of understatement”. It
         is undoubtedly true that the marginal note to a section
         cannot be referred to for the purpose of construing the
         section but it can certainly be relied upon as indicating the
         drift of the section or, to use the words of Collins, M.R.
         in Bushel v. Hammond [(1904) 2 KB 563] to show what
         the section is dealing with. It cannot control the
         interpretation of the words of a section particularly when
         the language of the section is clear and unambiguous but,
         being part of the statute, it prima facie furnishes some
         clue as to the meaning and purpose of the section
         (vide <a href="/doc/608874/" id="a_592">Bengal Immunity Company Limited v. State of
         Bihar</a> [(1955) 2 SCR 603]).”

</blockquote><p id="p_204">60. Secondly, it is only an officer referred to in <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_593">section 42</a> who may use the

   powers given under <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_594">section 67</a> in order to make an “enquiry” in

   connection with the contravention of any provision of this Act. The word

   “enquiry” has been used in <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_595">section 67</a> to differentiate it from “inquiry” as

   used in <a href="/doc/686843/" id="a_596">section 53A</a>, which is during the course of investigation of




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_78">                                                                           78</span>
    offences2. As a matter of fact, the notifications issued under the Act

    soon after the Act came into force, which will be referred to later in the

    judgment, specifically speak of the powers conferred under <a href="/doc/855593/" id="a_597">section

    42(1)</a> read with <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_598">section 67</a>. This is an important executive reading of the

    <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_599">NDPS Act</a>, which makes it clear that the powers to be exercised under

    <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_600">section 67</a> are to be exercised in conjunction with the powers that are

    delineated in <a href="/doc/855593/" id="a_601">section 42(1)</a>. Thus, in <a href="/doc/1463903/" id="a_602">Desh Bandhu Gupta &amp; Co. v.

    Delhi Stock Exchange Assn. Ltd</a>. (1979) 4 SCC 565, this Court

    referred to the principle of “contemporanea expositio” in the context of

    an executive interpretation of a statute, as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_71">          “9…The principle of contemporanea expositio (interpreting
          a statute or any other document by reference to the
          exposition it has received from contemporary authority)
          can be invoked though the same will not always be
          decisive of the question of construction (Maxwell 12th ed.</blockquote><p id="p_205">
</p><p id="p_206">          p.268). In Crawford on Statutory Construction (1940 ed.)
          in para 219 (at pp. 393-395) it has been stated that
          administrative     construction    (i.e.  contemporaneous
          construction placed by administrative or executive officers
          charged with executing a statute) generally should be
          clearly wrong before it is overturned; such a construction,
          commonly referred to as practical construction, although
          not controlling, is nevertheless entitled to considerable
          weight;    it   is    highly    persuasive.   In Baleshwar
          Bagarti v. Bhagirathi Dass [ILR 35 Cal 701 at 713] the
          principle, which was reiterated in Mathura Mohan


2   In Lexico (a collaboration between Oxford University Press and
Dictionary.com), it is stated that “the traditional distinction between
the verbs enquire and inquire is  that enquire is     to   be  used    for
general senses of ‘ask’, while inquire is reserved for uses meaning ‘make
a formal investigation’”. (see https://www.lexico.com/grammar/enquire-or-
inquire).

         stated by Mookerjee, J., thus:
</p>
<p id="p_208">         “It is a well settled principle of interpretation that courts in
         construing a statute will give much weight to the
         interpretation put upon it, at the time of its enactment and
         since, by those whose duty it has been to construe,
         execute and apply it...I do not suggest for a moment that
         such interpretation has by any means a controlling effect
         upon the courts; such interpretation may, if occasion
         arises, have to be disregarded for cogent and persuasive
         reasons, and in a clear case of error, a court would
         without hesitation refuse to follow such construction.”

</p><p id="p_209">61. The officer referred to in <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_604">section 42</a> is given powers of entry, search,

   seizure and arrest without warrant, with the safeguards that have been

   pointed out hereinabove in this judgment. The first safeguard is that

   such officer must have “reason to believe”, which as has been noted, is

   different from mere “reason to suspect”. It is for this reason that such

   officer must make an enquiry in connection with the contravention of the

   provisions of this Act, for otherwise, even without such enquiry, mere

   suspicion of the commission of an offence would be enough. It is in this

   enquiry that he has to call for “information” under sub-clause (a), which

   “information” can be given by any person and taken down in writing, as

   is provided in <a href="/doc/855593/" id="a_605">section 42(1)</a>. Further, the information given must be for

   the purpose of “satisfying” himself that there has been a contravention

   of the provisions of this Act, which again goes back to the expression

   “reason to believe” in <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_606">section 42</a>. This being the case, it is a little difficult




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_80">                                                                                80</span>
   to accept Shri Lekhi’s argument that “enquiry” in <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_607">section 67</a> is the same

   as “investigation”, which is referred to in <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_608">section 53</a>. <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_609">Section 53</a> states:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_72">         “53. Power to invest officers of certain departments

         —(1) The Central Government, after consultation with the

         any other department of the Central Government including
         para-military forces or armed forces or any class of such

</blockquote><p id="p_211">63. By virtue of <a href="/doc/1445793/" id="a_612">section 2(xxix)</a> of the NDPS Act, this definition becomes

   applicable to the use of the expression “investigation” in <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_613">section 53</a> of

   the NDPS Act. It is important to notice that it is an inclusive definition, by

   which, “evidence” is collected by a police officer or a person authorised

   by the Magistrate. The “enquiry” that is made by a <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_614">section 42</a> officer is

   so that such officer may gather “information” to satisfy himself that there

   is “reason to believe” that an offence has been committed in the first

   place.

   to the officer-in-charge of the nearest police station, who must then

   proceed to “investigate” the case given to him, or to the officer

   empowered under <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_619">section 53</a> of the NDPS Act, which officer then

   “investigates” the case in order to find out whether an offence has been

   committed under the Act. It is clear, therefore, that <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_620">section 67</a> is at an

   antecedent stage to the “investigation”, which occurs after the

   concerned officer under <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_621">section 42</a> has “reason to believe”, upon

   information gathered in an enquiry made in that behalf, that an offence

   has been committed.

<p id="p_214">65. Equally, when we come to <a href="/doc/1925275/" id="a_622">section 67(c)</a> of the NDPS Act, the

   expression used is “examine” any person acquainted with the facts and

   circumstances of the case. The “examination” of such person is again

   only for the purpose of gathering information so as to satisfy himself

   that there is “reason to believe” that an offence has been committed.

   This can, by no stretch of imagination, be equated to a “statement”

   under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_623">section 161</a> of the CrPC, as is argued by Shri Lekhi, relying upon

   <a href="/doc/1643745/" id="a_624">Sahoo v. State of U.P</a>. (1965) 3 SCR 86 (at page 88), which would

   include the making of a confession, being a sub-species of “statement”.

   the fundamental rights contained in Articles 20(3) and 21, as well as the

   scheme of the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_625">NDPS Act</a>, together with the safeguards that have been

   set out by us hereinabove. First and foremost, even according to Shri

   Lekhi, a police officer, properly so-called, may be authorised to call for

   <a href="/doc/855593/" id="a_627">section 42(1)</a>. Yet, while “investigating” an offence under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_628">NDPS Act</a>

   i.e. subsequent to the collection of information etc. under <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_629">section 67</a>, the

   same police officer will be bound by <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_630">sections 160-164</a> of the CrPC,

   together with all the safeguards mentioned therein – firstly, that the

   person examined shall be bound to answer truly all questions relating to

   such case put to him, other than questions which would tend to

   incriminate him; secondly, the police officer is to reduce this statement

   into writing and maintain a separate and true record of this statement;

   thirdly, the statement made may be recorded by audio-video electronic

   means to ensure its genuineness; and fourthly, a statement made by a

   woman can only be made to a woman police officer or any woman

   officer. Even after all these safeguards are met, no such statement can

   be used at any inquiry or trial, except for the purpose of contradicting

   such witness in cross-examination. <a href="/doc/56195/" id="a_631">In Tahsildar Singh v. State of U.P</a>.,

learned Judge held:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_75">     “It is, therefore, seen that the object of the legislature
     throughout has been to exclude the statement of a
     witness made before the police during the investigation
     from being made use of at the trial for any purpose, and
     the amendments made from time to time were only
     intended to make clear the said object and to dispel the
     cloud cast on such intention. <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_633">The Act</a> of 1898 for the first
     time introduced an exception enabling the said statement
     reduced to writing to be used for impeaching the credit of
     the witness in the manner provided by the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_634">Evidence Act</a>.
     As the phraseology of the exception lent scope to defeat
     the purpose of the legislature, by the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_635">Amendment Act</a> of
     1923, the section was redrafted defining the limits of the
     exception with precision so as to confine it only to
     contradict the witness in the manner provided under
     <a href="/doc/1110615/" id="a_636">Section 145</a> of the Evidence Act. If one could guess the
     intention of the legislature in framing the section in the
     manner it did in 1923, it would be apparent that it was to
     protect the accused against the user of the statements of
     witnesses made before the police during investigation at
     the trial presumably on the assumption that the said
     statements were not made under circumstances inspiring
     confidence. Both the section and the proviso intended to
     serve primarily the same purpose i.e., the interest of the
     accused.</blockquote><p id="p_216">

     The object of the main section as the history of its
     legislation shows and the decided cases indicate is to
     impose a general bar against the use of statement made
     before the police and the enacting clause in clear terms
     says that no statement made by any person to a police
     officer or any record thereof, or any part of such statement
     or record, be used for any purpose. The words are clear
     and unambiguous. The proviso engrafts an exception on
     the general prohibition and that is, the said statement in
     writing may be used to contradict a witness in the manner
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_84">                                                                        84</span>
provided by <a href="/doc/1110615/" id="a_637">Section 145</a> of the Evidence Act. We have
already noticed from the history of the section that the
enacting clause was mainly intended to protect the
interests of accused. At the stage of investigation,
statements of witnesses are taken in a haphazard
manner. The police officer in the course of his
investigation finds himself more often in the midst of an
excited crowd and babel of voices raised all round. In
such an atmosphere, unlike that in a court of law, he is
expected to hear the statements of witnesses and record
separately the statement of each one of them. Generally
he records only a summary of the laments which appear
to him to be relevant. These statements are, therefore
only a summary of what a witness says and very often
perfunctory. Indeed, in view of the aforesaid facts, there is
a statutory prohibition against police officers taking the
signature of the person making the statement, indicating
thereby that the statement is not intended to be binding on
the witness or an assurance by him that it is a correct
statement.
</p>
<p id="p_218">At the same time, it being the earliest record of the
statement of a witness soon after the incident, any
contradiction found therein would be of immense help to
an accused to discredit the testimony of a witness making
the statement. The section was, therefore, conceived in
an attempt to find a happy via media, namely, while it
enacts an absolute bar against the statement made
before a police officer being used for any purpose
whatsoever, it enables the accused to rely upon it for a
limited purpose of contradicting a witness in the manner
provided by <a href="/doc/1110615/" id="a_638">Section 145</a> of the Evidence Act by drawing
his attention to parts of the statement intended for
contradiction. It cannot be used for corroboration of a
prosecution or a defence witness or even a court witness.
Nor can it be used for contradicting a defence or a court
witness. Shortly stated, there is a general bar against its
use subject to a limited exception in the interest of the
accused, and the exception cannot obviously be used to
cross the bar.”

   audio-video electronic means in the presence of the Advocate of the

   person accused of an offence. This confession can only be recorded

   after the Magistrate explains to the person making it that he is not

   bound to make a confession and that, if he does so, it may be used as

   evidence against him – see <a href="/doc/873866/" id="a_642">section 164(2)</a> of the CrPC. The Magistrate

   is then to make a memorandum at the foot of the record that he has, in

   fact, warned the person that he is not bound to make such confession,

   and that it may be used as evidence against him – see <a href="/doc/91322/" id="a_643">section 164(4)</a> of

   was admitted by Shri Lekhi in the course of his arguments. Even if any

   such anomaly were to arise on a strained construction of <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_650">section 67</a> as

   contended for by Shri Lekhi, the alternative construction suggested by

   the Appellants, being in consonance with fundamental rights, alone

   would prevail, as <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_651">section 67</a> would then have to be “read down” so as to

   conform to fundamental rights.
</p>
<p id="p_221">69. Take, for example, an investigation conducted by the regular police

   force of a State qua a person trafficking in ganja. If the same person

   were to be apprehended with ganja on a subsequent occasion, this time

   not by the State police force but by other officers for the same or similar

   offence, the safeguards contained in <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_652">sections 161-164</a> of the CrPC

   would apply insofar as the first incident is concerned, but would not

   apply to the subsequent incident. This is because the second time, the

   investigation was not done by the State police force, but by other

   officers. The fact situation mentioned in the aforesaid example would

   demonstrate manifest arbitrariness in the working of the statute, leading

   to a situation where, for the first incident, safeguards available under

   the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_653">CrPC</a> come into play because it was investigated by the local State

   police, as opposed to officers other than the local police who

   investigated the second transaction.

   apprehended in the State of Punjab by the local State police with a

   certain quantity of ganja, and Y is apprehended in the State of

   Maharashtra by officers other than the State police, again with a certain

   quantity of ganja which comes from the same source, the investigation

   by the State police in Punjab would be subject to safeguards contained

   in the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_654">CrPC</a>, but the investigation into the ganja carried by Y to

   Maharashtra would be carried out without any such safeguards, owing

   to the fact that an officer other than the local police investigated into the

   offence. These anomalies are real and not imaginary, and if a statute is

   so read as to give rise to such anomalies, it would necessarily have to

   be struck down under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_655">Article 14</a> of the Constitution as being

   discriminatory and manifestly arbitrary.

<p id="p_223">71. Further, the provisions of <a href="/doc/686843/" id="a_656">section 53A</a> of the NDPS Act militate strongly

   against Shri Lekhi’s argument. <a href="/doc/686843/" id="a_657">Section 53A</a> states as follows:

   made under <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_659">section 67</a> is sufficient as substantive evidence to convict

   an accused under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_660">NDPS Act</a>, <a href="/doc/686843/" id="a_661">section 53A</a> would be rendered otiose.

   <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_662">Sections 53</a> and <a href="/doc/686843/" id="a_663">53A</a> of the NDPS Act, when read together, would make

   it clear that <a href="/doc/686843/" id="a_664">section 53A</a> is in the nature of an exception to <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_665">sections 161</a>,

   <a href="/doc/523607/" id="a_666">162</a> and <a href="/doc/1330928/" id="a_667">172</a> of the CrPC. This is for the reason that <a href="/doc/23637/" id="a_668">section 53(1)</a>, when

   it invests certain officers or classes of officers with the power of an

   officer in charge of a police station for investigation of offences under

   the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_669">NDPS Act</a>, refers to Chapter XII of the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_670">CrPC</a>, of which <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_671">sections 161</a>,

   <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_672">162</a> and <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_673">172</a> are a part. First and foremost, under <a href="/doc/1153129/" id="a_674">section 162(1)</a> of the

   CrPC, statements that are made in the course of investigation are not

   required to be signed by the person making them – under <a href="/doc/686843/" id="a_675">section 53A</a>

   they can be signed by the person before an officer empowered under

   <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_676">section 53</a>. Secondly, it is only in two circumstances [under <a href="/doc/968858/" id="a_677">section

   53A(1)(a)</a> and (b)] that such a statement is made relevant for the

   purpose of proving an offence against the accused: it is only if the

   of giving evidence; or is kept out of the way by the adverse party, or

   whose presence cannot be obtained without delay or expense which

   the court considers unreasonable, that such statement becomes

   relevant. Otherwise, if the person who made such a statement is

   examined as a witness, and the court thinks that in the interest of justice

   such statement should be made relevant and does so, then again, such

   statement may become relevant. None of this would be necessary if

   Shri Lekhi’s argument were right, that a confessional statement made

   under <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_678">section 67</a> – not being bound by any of these constraints – would

   be sufficient to convict the accused.

<p id="p_225">73. Shri Lekhi then relied strongly upon the recent Constitution Bench

   judgment in Mukesh Singh (supra). This judgment concerned itself with

   the correctness of the decision in <a href="/doc/1815889/" id="a_679">Mohan Lal v. State of Punjab</a>, (2018)

   17 SCC 627, which had taken the view that in case the investigation is

   conducted by the very police officer who is himself the complainant, the

   trial becomes vitiated as a matter of law, and the accused is entitled to

   acquittal. In deciding this question, the Constitution Bench of this Court

   referred to various earlier judgments, in particular, the judgment in <a href="/doc/53207636/" id="a_680">State

   v. V. Jayapaul</a> (2004) 5 SCC 223. After setting out the relevant

         an “officer in charge of a police station” as defined under

</p><p id="p_231">76. On the basis of this judgment, Shri Lekhi argued that “investigation”

   under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_713">NDPS Act</a> includes search and seizure which is to be done by

   a <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_714">section 42</a> officer and would, therefore, begin from that stage.

</p><p id="p_232">77. In this connection, it is important to advert first to the decision of this

   Court in <a href="/doc/1361495/" id="a_715">H.N. Rishbud and Inder Singh v. State of Delhi</a> (1955) 1

   SCR 1150. This judgment explains in great detail as to what exactly the

   scope of “investigation” is under the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_716">CrPC</a>. It states:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_84">         “In order to ascertain the scope of and the reason for
         requiring such investigation to be conducted by an officer
         of high rank (except when otherwise permitted by a

Magistrate), it is useful to consider what “investigation”
under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_717"> the Code</a> comprises. Investigation usually starts on
information relating to the commission of an offence given
to an officer in charge of a police station and recorded
under <a href="/doc/1980578/" id="a_718">Section 154</a> of the Code. If from information so
received or otherwise, the officer in charge of the police
station has reason to suspect the commission of an
offence, he or some other subordinate officer deputed by
him, has to proceed to the spot to investigate the facts
and circumstances of the case and if necessary to take
measures for the discovery and arrest of the offender.
</blockquote><p id="p_233">Thus investigation primarily consists in the ascertainment
of the facts and circumstances of the case. By definition, it
includes “all the proceedings under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_719"> the Code</a> for the
collection of evidence conducted by a police officer”. For
the above purposes, the investigating officer is given the
power to require before himself the attendance of any
person appearing to be acquainted with the
circumstances of the case. He has also the authority to
examine such person orally either by himself or by a duly
authorised deputy. The officer examining any person in
the course of investigation may reduce his statement into
writing and such writing is available, in the trial that may
follow, for use in the manner provided in this behalf in
<a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_720">Section 162</a>. Under <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_721">Section 155</a> the officer in charge of a
police station has the power of making a search in any
place for the seizure of anything believed to be necessary
for the purpose of the investigation. The search has to be
conducted by such officer in person. A subordinate officer
may be deputed by him for the purpose only for reasons
to be recorded in writing if he is unable to conduct the
search in person and there is no other competent officer
available. The investigating officer has also the power to
arrest the person or persons suspected of the commission
of the offence under <a href="/doc/441720/" id="a_722">Section 54</a> of the Code. A police
officer making an investigation is enjoined to enter his
proceedings in a diary from day-to-day. Where such
investigation cannot be completed within the period of 24
hours and the accused is in custody he is enjoined also to
send a copy of the entries in the diary to the Magistrate
concerned. It is important to notice that where the
investigation is conducted not by the officer in charge of
the police station but by a subordinate officer (by virtue of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_93">                                                                93</span>
one or other of the provisions enabling him to depute such
subordinate officer for any of the steps in the
investigation) such subordinate officer is to report the
result of the investigation to the officer in charge of the
police station. If, upon the completion of the investigation
it appears to the officer in charge of the police station that
there is no sufficient evidence or reasonable ground, he
may decide to release the suspected accused, if in
custody, on his executing a bond. If, however, it appears
to him that there is sufficient evidence or reasonable
ground, to place the accused on trial, he is to take the
necessary steps therefore under <a href="/doc/1367808/" id="a_723">Section 170</a> of the Code.
In either case, on the completion of the investigation he
has to submit a report to the Magistrate under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_724">Section 173</a>
of the Code in the prescribed form furnishing various
details. Thus, under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_725"> the Code</a> investigation consists
generally of the following steps: (1) Proceeding to the
spot, (2) Ascertainment of the facts and circumstances of
the case, (3) Discovery and arrest of the suspected
offender, (4) Collection of evidence relating to the
commission of the offence which may consist of (a) the
examination of various persons (including the accused)
and the reduction of their statements into writing, if the
officer thinks fit, (b) the search of places or seizure of
things considered necessary for the investigation and to
be produced at the trial, and (5) Formation of the opinion
as to whether on the material collected there is a case to
place the accused before a Magistrate for trial and if so
taking the necessary steps for the same by the filing of a
charge-sheet under <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_726">Section 173</a>. The scheme<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_727"> of the Code</a>
also shows that while it is permissible for an officer in
charge of a police station to depute some subordinate
officer to conduct some of these steps in the investigation,
the responsibility for every one of these steps is that of the
person in the situation of the officer in charge of the police
station, it having been clearly provided in <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_728">Section 168</a> that
when a subordinate officer makes an investigation he
should report the result to the officer in charge of the
police station. It is also clear that the final step in the
investigation, viz. the formation of the opinion as to
whether or not there is a case to place the accused on
trial is to be that of the officer in charge of the police
station. There is no provision permitting delegation thereof

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_94">                                                                 94</span>
         but only a provision entitling superior officers to supervise
         or participate under <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_729">Section 551</a>.”
                                               (at pages 1156-1158)

   This statement of the law was reiterated in <a href="/doc/1710467/" id="a_730">State of Madhya Pradesh

   v. Mubarak Ali</a> (1959) Supp. 2 SCR 201 at 211, 212.

</p><p id="p_234">78. It is important to remember that an officer-in-charge of a police station,

   when he investigates an offence, begins by gathering information, in the

   course of which he may collect evidence relating to the commission of

   the offence, which would include search and seizure of things in the

   course of investigation, to be produced at the trial. Under the scheme of

   the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_731">NDPS Act</a>, it is possible that the same officer who is authorised

   there being no bar under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_757">NDPS Act</a> for doing so. This is a far cry

   that a <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_759">section 67</a> confessional statement, being in the course of

<p id="p_240">83. As has been pointed out hereinabove, there could be a situation in

   officer, in which case, it would be necessary for the <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_762">section 42</a> officer to

   first have “reason to believe” that an offence has been committed, for

   the purpose of which he gathers information, which is then presented

   not only to his superior officer under <a href="/doc/1158106/" id="a_763">section 42(2)</a>, but also presented to

   either an officer-in-charge of a police station, or to an officer designated

<p id="p_243">85. Also, we must bear in mind the fact that the Constitution Bench’s focus

   and the investigator of an offence could be the same. From the point of

   view of this question, <a href="/doc/686843/" id="a_773">section 53A</a> of the NDPS Act is not relevant and

   convict an accused of an offence under the Act, is correct. For all these

   reasons, we do not accede either to Shri Puneet Jain’s argument to

         applicable by sub-s. (1) of s. 9 of the Land Customs Act,
         are included all the sections in Chapters XVI and XVII of
         the Sea Customs Act viz. ss.167 to 193.”

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_100">                                                                          100</span>
“<a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_781">The Police Act</a>, 1861 (Act 5 of 1861), is described as an
Act for the regulation of police, and is thus an Act for the
regulation of that group of officers who come within the
word ‘police’ whatever meaning be given to that word. The
preamble of the Act further says: ‘whereas it is expedient
to re-organise the police and to make it a more efficient
instrument for the prevention and detection of crime, it is
enacted as follows’. This indicates that the police is the
instrument for the prevention and detection of crime which
can be said to be the main object and purpose of having
the police. <a href="/doc/654722/" id="a_782">Sections 23</a> and <a href="/doc/1089586/" id="a_783">25</a> lay down the duties of the
police officers and <a href="/doc/919170/" id="a_784">Section 20</a> deals with the authority they
can exercise. They can exercise such authority as is
provided for a police officer under the <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_785">Police Act</a> and any
Act for regulating criminal procedure. The authority given
to police officers must naturally be to enable them to
discharge their duties efficiently. Of the various duties
mentioned in<a href="/doc/654722/" id="a_786"> s. 23</a>, the more important duties are to
collect and communicate intelligence affecting the public
peace, to prevent the commission of offences and public
nuisances and to detect and bring offenders to justice and
to apprehend all persons whom the police officer is legally
authorised to apprehend. It is clear, therefore, in view of
the nature of the duties imposed on the police officers, the
nature of the authority conferred and the purpose of the
<a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_787">Police Act</a>, that the powers which the police officers enjoy
are powers for the effective prevention and detection of
crime in order to maintain law and order.
</p>
<p id="p_248">The powers of Customs Officers are really not for such
purpose. Their powers are for the purpose of checking the
smuggling of goods and the due realisation of customs
duties and to determine the action to be taken in the
interests of the revenues of the country by way of
confiscation of goods on which no duty had been paid and
by imposing penalties and fines.
</p>
<p id="p_249">Reference to s.9(1) of the Land Customs Act may be
usefully made at this stage. It is according to the
provisions of this sub-section that the provisions of the
Sea Customs Act and the orders, Rules etc. prescribed
thereunder, apply for the purpose of levy of duties of land
customs under the Land Customs Act in like manner as

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_101">                                                               101</span>
        they apply for the purpose of levy of duties of customs on
        goods imported or exported by sea. This makes it clear
        that the provisions conferring various powers on the Sea
        Customs Officers are for the purpose of levying and
        realisation of duties of customs on goods and that those
        powers are conferred on the Land Customs Officers also
        for the same purpose. Apart from such an expression in
        Section 9(1) of the Land Customs Act, there are good
        reasons in support of the view that the powers conferred
        on the Customs Officers are different in character from
        those of the police officers for the detection and
        prevention of crime and that the powers conferred on
        them are merely for the purpose of ensuring that dutiable
        goods do not enter the country without payment of duty
        and that articles whose entry is prohibited are not brought
        in. It is with respect to the detecting and preventing of the
        smuggling of goods and preventing loss to the Central
        Revenues that Customs Officers have been given the
        power to search the property and person and to detain
        them and to summon persons to give evidence in an
        enquiry with respect to the smuggling of goods.

        The preamble of the Sea Customs Act says: “Whereas it
        is expedient to consolidate and amend the law relating to
        the levy of Sea Customs-duties”. Practically, all the
        provisions of the Act are enacted to achieve this object.”
                                                  (pages 343-344)

        “The Customs Officer, therefore, is not primarily
        concerned with the detection and punishment of crime
        committed by a person, but is mainly interested in the
        detection and prevention of smuggling of goods and
        safeguarding the recovery of customs duties. He is more
        concerned with the goods and customs duty, than with the
        offender.”

      member of the police in any other country. Officers of the
      police in the erstwhile Indian States and an officer of the

      decided cases to be police officers within the meaning of
      <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_788">Section 25</a> of the Evidence Act. There is no denying that

      be covered by the word “police”.

         be too much to say that that statement is a confession to

         prevent the police from obtaining confessions by force,
         torture or inducement. The salutary principle underlying
         the section would apply equally to other officers, by
         whatever designation they may be known, who have the

   Land Customs Act, 1924 and the Sea Customs Act, 1878 were statutes

   primarily concerned with the levy of duties of customs, and ancillary to

   this duty, officers designated in those Acts are given certain powers to

   check smuggling of goods for due realisation of customs duties. In a

   significant sentence, the Court, therefore, stated that a customs officer

   is more concerned with the goods and customs duty than with the

   offender. (2) The persons who are not enrolled as “police” under the

   <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_819">Police Act</a>, 1861, would be included as “police” under the inclusive

   definition contained in that Act, leading to the acceptance of the “broad

   view” and rejection of the “narrow view” of       the meaning of “police

   officer”. (3) The protection of <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_820">section 25</a> of the Evidence Act is very

   wide, and applies to a confession made to any member of the police

   empowers the customs officer to summon a person to give evidence, or

   produce a document in an enquiry which he makes, is a judicial enquiry

shall, for the purpose of <a href="/doc/1291024/" id="a_828">Section 156</a> of the Code of
Criminal Procedure be deemed to be an officer in charge
of a police station with respect to the area to which his
appointment as an Excise Officer extends. Sub-section (1)
of <a href="/doc/217159/" id="a_829">Section 77</a> empowers the Collector of Excise to
investigate without the order of a Magistrate any offence
punishable under the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_830">Excise Act</a> committed within the
limits of his jurisdiction. Sub-section (2) of that section
provides that any other Excise Officer specially
empowered behalf in this by the State Government in
respect of all or any specified class of offences punishable
under the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_831">Excise Act</a> may, without the order of a
Magistrate, investigate any such offence which a court
having jurisdiction within the local area to which such
officer is appointed would have power to enquire into or
try under the aforesaid provisions. By virtue of these
provisions the Lieutenant Governor of Bihar and Orissa by
Notification 470-F dated 15-1-1919 has specially
empowered Inspectors of Excise and Sub-Inspectors of
Excise to investigate any offence punishable under the
Act. It is not disputed before us that this notification is still
in force. By virtue of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_832">Section 92</a> the Act it
shall have effect as if enacted in the Act. It would thus
follow that an Excise Inspector or Sub-Inspector in the
State of Bihar shall be deemed to be an officer in charge
of a police station with respect to the area to which he is
appointed and is in that capacity entitled to investigate
any offence under the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_833">Excise Act</a> within that area without
the order of Magistrate. Thus he can exercise all the
powers which an officer in charge of a police station can
exercise under Chapter XIV of the Code of Criminal
Procedure. He can investigate into offences, record
statements of the persons questioned by him, make
searches, seize any articles connected with an offence
under the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_834">Excise Act</a>, arrest an accused person, grant him
bail, send him up for trial before a Magistrate, file a
charge-sheet and so on. Thus his position in so far as
offences under the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_835">Excise Act</a> committed within the area
to which his appointment extends are concerned is no
different from that of an officer in charge of a police
station. As regards these offences not only is he charged
with the duty of preventing their commission but also with

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_109">                                                                    109</span>
their detection and is for these purposes empowered to
act in all respects as an officer in charge of a police
station. No doubt unlike an officer in charge of a police
station he is not charged with the duty of the maintenance
of law and order nor can he exercise the powers of such
officer with respect to offences under the general law or
under any other special laws. But all the same, in so far
as offences under the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_836">Excise Act</a> are concerned, there is
no distinction whatsoever in the nature of the powers he
exercises and those which a police officer exercises in
relation to offences which it is his duty to prevent and
bring to light. It would be logical, therefore, to hold that a
confession recorded by him during an investigation into an
excise offence cannot reasonably be regarded as
anything different from a confession to a police officer.
</blockquote><p id="p_262">For, in conducting the investigation he exercises the
powers of a police officer and the act itself deems him to
be a police officer, even though he does not belong to the
police force constituted under the <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_837">Police Act</a>. It has been
held by this court that the expression “police officer” in
<a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_838">Section 25</a> of the Evidence Act is not confined to persons
who are members of the regularly constituted police force.
The position of an Excise Officer empowered under
<a href="/doc/1170743/" id="a_839">Section 77(2)</a> of the Bihar and Orissa Excise Act is not
analogous to that of a Customs Officer for two reasons.
One is that the Excise Officer, does not exercise any
judicial powers just as the Customs Officer does under the
Sea Customs Act, 1878. Secondly, the Customs Officer is
not deemed to be an officer in charge of a police station
and therefore can exercise no powers under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_840"> the Code</a> of
Criminal Procedure and certainly not those of an officer in
charge of a police station. No doubt, he too has the power
to make a search, to seize articles suspected to have
been smuggled and arrest persons suspected of having
committed an offence under the Sea Customs Act. But
that is all. Though he can make an enquiry, he has no
power to investigate into an offence under <a href="/doc/1291024/" id="a_841">Section 156</a> of
the Code of Criminal Procedure. Whatever powers he
exercises are expressly set out in the Sea Customs Act.
Though some of those set out in Chapter XVII may be
analogous to those of a police officer under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_842"> the Code</a> of
Criminal Procedure they are not identical with those of a
police officer and are not derived from or by reference to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_110">                                                                 110</span><a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_843">
the Code</a>. In regard to certain matters, he does not
possess powers even analogous to those of a Police
Officer. Thus he is not entitled to submit a report to a
Magistrate under <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_844">Section 190</a> of the Code of Criminal
Procedure with a view that cognizance of the offence be
taken by the Magistrate. Section 187(A) of the Sea
Customs Act specially provides that cognizance of an
offence under the Sea Customs Act can be taken only
upon a complaint in writing made by the Customs Officers
or other officer of the customs not below the rank of an
Assistant Collector of Customs authorised in this behalf by
the Chief Customs Officer.
</p>
<p id="p_263">It may well be that a statute confers powers and impose
duties on a public servant, some of which are analogous
to those of a police officer. But by reason of the nature of
other duties which he is required to perform he may be
exercising various other powers also. It is argued on
behalf of the State that where such is the case the mere
conferral of some only of the powers of a police officer on
such a person would not make him a police officer and,
therefore, what must be borne in mind is the sum total of
the powers which he enjoys by virtue of his office as also
the dominant purpose for which he is appointed. The
contention thus is that when an officer has to perform a
wide range of duties and exercise correspondingly a wide
range of powers, the mere fact that some of the powers
which the statute confers upon him are analogous to or
even identical with those of a police officer would not
make him a police officer and, therefore, if such an officer
records a confession it would not be hit by <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_845">Section 25</a> of
the Evidence Act. In our judgment what is pertinent to
bear in mind for the purpose of determining as to who can
be regarded a “police officer” for the purpose of this
provision is not the totality of the powers which an officer
enjoys but the kind of powers which the law enables him
to exercise. The test for determining whether such a
person is a “police officer” for the purpose of <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_846">Section 25</a> of
the Evidence Act would, in our judgment, be whether the
powers of a police officer which are conferred on him or
which are exercisable by him because he is deemed to be
an officer in charge of police station establish a direct or
substantial relationship with the prohibition enacted by

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_111">                                                                111</span>
          <a href="/doc/1089586/" id="a_847">Section 25</a>, that is, the recording of a confession. In our
          words, the test would be whether the powers are such as
          would to facilitate the obtaining by him of a confession
          from a suspect or delinquent. If they do, then it is
          unnecessary to consider the dominant purpose for which
          he is appointed or the question as to what other powers
          he enjoys. These questions may perhaps be relevant for
          consideration where the powers of the police officer
          conferred upon him are of a very limited character and are
          not by themselves sufficient to facilitate the obtaining by
          him of a confession.

          in charge of a police station making an investigation under
          Chapter XIV of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He would
          likewise have the same opportunity of extorting a
          confession from a suspect. It is, therefore, difficult to draw

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_110">          “It is urged that under sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1566465/" id="a_873">Section 21</a> a
          Central Excise Officer under the Act has all the powers of
          an officer in charge of a police station under Chapter XIV
          of the Code of Criminal Procedure and therefore he must
          be deemed to be a police officer within the meaning of
          those words in <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_874">Section 25</a> of the Evidence Act. It is true
          that sub-section (2) confers on the Central Excise Officer
          under the Act the same powers as an officer in charge of
          a police station has when investigating a cognizable case;</blockquote><p id="p_287">
</p><p id="p_288">          but this power is conferred for the purpose of sub-section
          (1) which gives power to a Central Excise Officer to whom
          any arrested person is forwarded to inquire into the
          charge against him. Thus under <a href="/doc/1566465/" id="a_875">Section 21</a> it is the duty of
          the Central Excise Officer to whom an arrested person is
          forwarded to inquire into the charge made against such
          person. Further under proviso (a) to sub-section (2) of
          <a href="/doc/1566465/" id="a_876">Section 21</a> if the Central Excise Officer is of opinion that
          there is sufficient evidence or reasonable ground of
          suspicion against the accused person, he shall either
          admit him to bail to appear before a Magistrate having
          jurisdiction in the case, or forward him in custody to such
          Magistrate. It does not however appear that a Central
          Excise Officer under the Act has power to submit a
          charge-sheet under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_877">Section 173</a> of the Code of Criminal
          Procedure. Under <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_878">Section 190</a> of the Code of Criminal
          Procedure a Magistrate can take cognizance of any
          offence either (a) upon receiving a complaint of facts

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_117">                                                                         117</span>
         which constitute such offence, or (b) upon a report in
         writing of such facts made by any police officer, or (c)
         upon information received from any person other than a
         police officer, or upon his own knowledge or suspicion,
         that such offence has been committed. A police officer for
         purposes of clause (b) above can in our opinion only be a
         police officer properly so-called as the scheme<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_879"> of the
         Code</a> of Criminal Procedure shows and it seems therefore
         that a Central Excise Officer will have to make a complaint
         under clause (a) above if he wants the Magistrate to take
         cognizance of an offence, for example, under <a href="/doc/775154/" id="a_880">Section 9</a> of
         the Act. Thus though under sub-section (2) of Section 21
         the Central Excise Officer under the Act has the powers of
         an officer in charge of a police station when investigating
         a cognizable case, that is for the purpose of his inquiry
         under sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1566465/" id="a_881">Section 21</a>. <a href="/doc/1566465/" id="a_882">Section 21</a> is in terms
         different from <a href="/doc/677392/" id="a_883">Section 78(3)</a> of the Bihar and Orissa
         Excise Act, 1915 which came to be considered in Raja
         Ram Jaiswal’s case [(1964) 2 SCR 752] and which
         provided in terms that “for the purposes of <a href="/doc/1291024/" id="a_884">Section 156</a> of
         the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, the area to which
         an excise officer empowered under <a href="/doc/217159/" id="a_885">Section 77</a>, sub-
         section (2), is appointed shall be deemed to be a police-
         station, and such officer shall be deemed to be the officer
         in charge of such station”. It cannot therefore be said that
         the provision in <a href="/doc/1566465/" id="a_886">Section 21</a> is on par with the provision in
         <a href="/doc/677392/" id="a_887">Section 78(3)</a> of the Bihar and Orissa Excise Act. All that
         <a href="/doc/1566465/" id="a_888">Section 21</a> provides is that for the purpose of his enquiry,
         a Central Excise Officer shall have the powers of an
         officer in charge of a police station when investigating a
         cognizable case. But even so it appears that these
         powers do not include the power to submit a charge-sheet
         under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_889">Section 173</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure for
         unlike the Bihar and Orissa Excise Act, the Central Excise

Railway property”. <a href="/doc/1840572/" id="a_938">Section 3(1)</a> of the Act of 1957

thereof, and shall be entitled to exercise the powers
conferred on Railway servants by or under that Act”.
<a href="/doc/108119/" id="a_941">Section 11</a> which defines duties of every superior officer
and member of the Force provides that they must
promptly execute all orders lawfully issued to them by

Railway property and do any other act conducive to the
better protection and security of Railway property. <a href="/doc/663765/" id="a_942">Section
14</a> imposes a duty on the superior officers and members
of the Force to make over persons arrested by them to a

These provisions are incompatible with the position that a

    powers of investigation, which culminates in the filing of a police report,

    such officers can be said to be police officers within the meaning of

    <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_1005">section 25</a> of the Evidence Act, as when they prevent and detect crime,

    they are in a position to extort confessions, and thus are able to achieve

    their object through a shortcut method of extracting involuntary

    confessions.

<p id="p_321">127.Shri Lekhi’s assault on Raja Ram Jaiswal (supra), stating that it is

    wrongly decided and ought to be held to be per incuriam, cannot be

    countenanced. Raja Ram Jaiswal (supra) correctly decided that the

    Court in Barkat Ram (supra) had held that the words “police officer” to

    be found in <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_1006">section 25</a> of the Evidence Act are not to be construed in a

    narrow way, but in a wide and popular sense. It is wholly incorrect to

    say, from a strained reading of Barkat Ram (supra) that, in reality,

    Barkat Ram (supra) preferred the “narrow” view over the “broad” view.

    This is also contrary to the understanding of several judgments of this

    Court which refer to Barkat Ram (supra), and which continued to adopt

    the broad, and not narrow, test laid down in the said judgment. Also,

    Raja Ram Jaiswal (supra) has been referred to by several Constitution

    Benches of this Court, as has been pointed out by us hereinabove, as

    also other Division Benches, and has never been doubted. In fact, it has

    always been distinguished in the revenue statute cases as well as the

    railway protection force cases as being a case in which all powers of

    investigation, which would lead to the filing of a police report, were

    invested with excise officers, who therefore, despite not belonging to the

    police force properly so-called, must yet be regarded as police officers

    for the purpose of <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_1007">section 25</a> of the Evidence Act. The vital link between

    <a href="/doc/1089586/" id="a_1008">section 25</a> and such officers then gets established, namely, that in the

    course of investigation it is possible for such officers to take a shortcut

    by extorting confessions from an accused person.

</p><p id="p_322">128.At this point, we come to the decision in Raj Kumar Karwal (supra). In

    this case, the very question that arises before us arose before a

    Division Bench of this Court. The question was set out by the Division

    Bench as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_132">         “1. Are the officers of the Department of Revenue

          called upon to answer in these appeals by special leave.”

</blockquote><p id="p_323">129.The Court analysed the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1012">NDPS Act</a>, and “conceded” that the

    punishments prescribed for the various offences under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1013">NDPS Act</a>

    are very severe. It then went on to hold:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_133">          “11…We, therefore, agree that as <a href="/doc/1089586/" id="a_1014">Section 25</a>, <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1015">Evidence
          Act</a>, engrafts a wholesome protection it must not be
          construed in a narrow and technical sense but must be
          understood in a broad and popular sense. But at the same
          time it cannot be construed in so wide a sense as to
          include persons on whom only some of the powers
          exercised by the police are conferred within the category
          of police officers. <a href="/doc/1090657/" id="a_1016">See State of Punjab v. Barkat Ram</a>
          and <a href="/doc/1409644/" id="a_1017">Raja Ram Jaiswal v. State of Bihar</a>. This view has
          been reiterated in subsequent cases also.”

</blockquote><p id="p_324">130.After referring to all the cases that have been cited by us hereinabove,

    the Court noticed the difference between the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1018">NDPS Act</a> and the revenue

    statutes and railway statute previously considered in some of the

    judgments of this Court, in that <a href="/doc/496325/" id="a_1019">section 37</a> of the NDPS Act makes

    offences punishable under the Act cognizable. The judgment then went

    on to state:

          44 of the Act. It enjoins upon the officer arresting a person
          to inform him of the grounds for his arrest. It further

         or the officer empowered to investigate under <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_1028">Section 53</a>
         of the Act. Special provision is made in <a href="/doc/1304888/" id="a_1029">Section 52-A</a> in
         regard to the disposal of seized narcotic drugs and
         psychotropic substances. Then comes <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_1030">Section 53</a> which
         we have extracted earlier. <a href="/doc/1363838/" id="a_1031">Section 55</a> requires an officer-
         in-charge of a police station to take charge of and keep in
         safe custody, pending the orders of the Magistrate, all

         police station and which may be delivered to him. <a href="/doc/669884/" id="a_1032">Section

         particulars of such arrest or seizure to his immediate
         official superior within 48 hours next after such arrest or
         seizure. These provisions found in Chapter V of the Act
         show that there is nothing in the Act to indicate that all the
         powers under Chapter XII of the Code, including the
         power to file a report under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_1033">Section 173</a> of the Code have
         been expressly conferred on officers who are invested
         with the powers of an officer-in-charge of a police station
         under <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_1034">Section 53</a>, for the purpose of investigation of
         offences under the Act.”

</blockquote><p id="p_325">131.After referring to <a href="/doc/1439062/" id="a_1035">sections 41</a>, <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_1036">42</a>, <a href="/doc/1374738/" id="a_1037">43</a>, <a href="/doc/109977/" id="a_1038">44</a>, <a href="/doc/1294540/" id="a_1039">52</a>, <a href="/doc/1304888/" id="a_1040">52A</a> and <a href="/doc/669884/" id="a_1041">57</a> of the NDPS

    Act, the Court concluded that these powers are more or less similar to

    the powers conferred on customs officers under the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_1042">Customs Act</a>, 1962

    – see paragraph 21. The Court then concluded:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_135">         22…The investigation which so commences must be

         concerned Magistrate in the prescribed form. Any person
         on whom power to investigate under Chapter XII is
         conferred can be said to be a ‘police officer’, no matter by
         what name he is called. The nomenclature is not
         important, the content of the power he exercises is the
         determinative factor. The important attribute of police
         power is not only the power to investigate into the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_135">                                                                          135</span>
commission of cognizable offence but also the power to
prosecute the offender by filing a report or a charge-sheet
under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_1044">Section 173</a> of the Code. That is why this Court has
since the decision in Badku Joti Savant accepted the ratio
that unless an officer is invested under any special law
with the powers of investigation under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1045"> the Code</a>, including
the power to submit a report under <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1046">Section 173</a>, he cannot
be described to be a ‘police officer’ under <a href="/doc/1089586/" id="a_1047">Section 25</a>,
<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1048">Evidence Act</a>. Counsel for the appellants, however argued
that since the Act does not prescribe the procedure for
investigation, the officers invested with power under
<a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_1049">Section 53</a> of the Act must necessarily resort to the
procedure under Chapter XII of the Code which would
require them to culminate the investigation by submitting a
report under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_1050">Section 173</a> of the Code. Attractive though
the submission appears at first blush, it cannot stand
close scrutiny. In the first place as pointed out earlier there
is nothing in the provisions of the Act to show that the
legislature desired to vest in the officers appointed under
<a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_1051">Section 53</a> of the Act, all the powers of Chapter XII,
including the power to submit a report under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_1052">Section 173</a>
of the Code. But the issue is placed beyond the pale of
doubt by sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1712009/" id="a_1053">Section 36-A</a> of the Act which
begins with a non-obstante clause — notwithstanding
anything contained in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1054"> the Code</a> — and proceeds to say in
clause (d) as under:
</blockquote>
<p id="p_326">“36-A. (d) a Special Court may, upon a perusal of police
report of the facts constituting an offence under this Act or
upon a complaint made by an officer of the Central
Government or a State Government authorised in this
behalf, take cognizance of that offence without the
accused being committed to it for trial.”

This clause makes it clear that if the investigation is
conducted by the police, it would conclude in a police
report but if the investigation is made by an officer of any
other department including the DRI, the Special Court
would take cognizance of the offence upon a formal
complaint made by such authorised officer of the
concerned government. Needless to say that such a
complaint would have to be under <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_1055">Section 190</a> of the
Code. This clause, in our view, clinches the matter. We

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_136">                                                                  136</span>
          must, therefore, negative the contention that an officer
          appointed under <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_1056">Section 53</a> of the Act, other than a police
          officer, is entitled to exercise ‘all’ the powers under
          Chapter XII of the Code, including the power to submit a
          report or charge-sheet under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_1057">Section 173</a> of the Code.
          That being so, the case does not satisfy the ratio
          of Badku Joti Savant and subsequent decisions referred
          to earlier.”

</p><p id="p_327">132.Despite the fact that Raj Kumar Karwal (supra) notices the fact that the

    <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1058">NDPS Act</a> prescribes offences which are “very severe” and that <a href="/doc/1089586/" id="a_1059">section

    25</a> is a wholesome protection which must be understood in a broad and

    popular sense, yet it arrives at a conclusion that the designated officer

    under <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_1060">section 53</a> of the NDPS Act cannot be said to be a police officer

    under <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_1061">section 25</a> of the Evidence Act. The Division Bench also notices

    that, unlike all the revenue and railway protection statues where

    offences are non-cognizable, the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1062">NDPS Act</a> offences are cognizable. It

    also notices that the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1063">NDPS Act</a> deals with prevention and detection of

    crimes of a very serious nature. However, Raj Kumar Karwal (supra)

    did not properly appreciate the following distinctions that arise between

    the investigative powers of officers who are designated in statutes

    primarily meant for revenue or railway purposes, as against officers who

    are designated under <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_1064">section 53</a> of the NDPS Act: first, that <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_1065">section 53</a>

    is located in a statute which contains provisions for the prevention,

    detection and punishment of crimes of a very serious nature. Even if the

    <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1066">NDPS Act</a> is to be construed as a statute which regulates and exercises


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_137">                                                                         137</span>
control over narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, the

prevention, detection and punishment of crimes related thereto cannot

be said to be ancillary to such object, but is the single most important

and effective means of achieving such object. This is unlike the revenue

statutes where the main object was the due realisation of customs

duties and the consequent ancillary checking of smuggling of goods (as

in the Land Customs Act, 1924, the Sea Customs Act, 1878 and the

<a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_1067">Customs Act</a>, 1962); the levy and collection of excise duties (as in the

<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_1068">Central Excise Act</a>, 1944); or as in the <a href="/doc/38107498/" id="a_1069">Railway Property (Unlawful

Possession Act</a>), 1966, the better protection and security of Railway

property. Second, unlike the revenue statutes and the <a href="/doc/1022405/" id="a_1070">Railway Act</a>, all

the offences to be investigated by the officers under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1071">NDPS Act</a> are

cognizable. Third, that <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_1072">section 53</a> of the NDPS Act, unlike the aforesaid

statutes, does not prescribe any limitation upon the powers of the officer

to investigate an offence under the Act, and therefore, it is clear that all

the investigative powers vested in an officer in charge of a police station

under the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1073">CrPC</a> – including the power to file a charge-sheet – are

vested in these officers when dealing with an offence under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1074">NDPS

Act</a>. This is wholly distinct from the limited powers vested in officers

under the aforementioned revenue and railway statutes for ancillary

purposes, which have already been discussed by this Court in Barkat

Ram (supra), with reference to the Land Customs Act; Badku Joti

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_138">                                                                        138</span>

    Chandra Mehta (supra), with reference to the Sea Customs Act; Illias

    (supra), with reference to the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_1076">Customs Act</a>; and Durga Prasad (supra)

    and Balkishan (supra) with reference to the <a href="/doc/1022405/" id="a_1077">Railway Act</a>, to be in aid of

    the dominant object of the statutes in question, which – as already

    alluded to – were not primarily concerned with the prevention and

    detection of crime, unlike the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1078">NDPS Act</a>. Also, importantly, none of those

    statutes recognised the power of the State police force to investigate

    offences under those Acts together with the officers mentioned in those

    Acts, as is the case in the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1079">NDPS Act</a>. No question of manifest

    arbitrariness or discrimination on the application of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_1080">Article 14</a> of the

    Constitution of India would therefore arise in those cases, unlike cases

    which arise under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1081">NDPS Act</a>, as discussed in paragraphs 67 to 70

    hereinabove.
</p>
<p id="p_328">133.The Bench also failed to notice <a href="/doc/686843/" id="a_1082">section 53A</a> of the NDPS Act and,

    therefore, falls into error when it states that the powers conferred under

    the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1083">NDPS Act</a> can be assimilated with powers conferred on customs

    officers under the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_1084">Customs Act</a>. When <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_1085">sections 53</a> and <a href="/doc/686843/" id="a_1086">53A</a> are seen

    together in the context of a statute which deals with prevention and

    detection of crimes of a very serious nature, it becomes clear that these

    sections cannot be construed in the same manner as sections

    contained in revenue statutes and railway protection statutes.

</p><p id="p_351">137.What is clear, therefore, is that the designated officer under <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_1114">section 53</a>,

    invested with the powers of an officer in charge of a police station, is to

    forward a police report stating the particulars that are mentioned in

    <a href="/doc/461024/" id="a_1115">section 173(2)</a> CrPC. Because of the special provision contained in

    <a href="/doc/1894406/" id="a_1116">section 36A(1)</a> of the NDPS Act, this police report is not forwarded to a

    Magistrate, but only to a Special Court under <a href="/doc/26119/" id="a_1117">section 36A(1)(d)</a>. Raj

    Kumar Karwal (supra), when it states that the designated officer cannot

    submit a police report under <a href="/doc/26119/" id="a_1118">section 36A(1)(d)</a>, but would have to

    submit a “complaint” under <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_1119">section 190</a> of the CrPC misses the

    importance of the non obstante clause contained in <a href="/doc/1894406/" id="a_1120">section 36A(1)</a>,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_143">                                                                           <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1121">143</a></span>
which makes it clear that the drill of <a href="/doc/1712009/" id="a_1122">section 36A</a> is to be followed

notwithstanding anything contained in <a href="/doc/255245/" id="a_1123">section 2(d)</a> of the CrPC. It is

obvious that <a href="/doc/26119/" id="a_1124">section 36A(1)(d)</a> is inconsistent with <a href="/doc/1445793/" id="a_1125">section 2(d)</a> and

<a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_1126">section 190</a> of the CrPC and therefore, any complaint that has to be

made can only be made under <a href="/doc/26119/" id="a_1127">section 36A(1)(d)</a> to a Special Court,

and not to a Magistrate under <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1128">section 190</a>. Shri Lekhi’s argument, that

the procedure under <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1129">section 190</a> has been replaced only in part, the

police report and complaint procedure under <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1130">section 190</a> not being

displaced by <a href="/doc/26119/" id="a_1131">section 36A(1)(d)</a>, cannot be accepted. <a href="/doc/26119/" id="a_1132">Section 36A(1)(d)</a>

specifies a scheme which is completely different from that contained in

the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1133">CrPC</a>. Whereas under <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_1134">section 190</a> of the CrPC it is the Magistrate

who takes cognizance of an offence, under <a href="/doc/26119/" id="a_1135">section 36A(1)(d)</a> it is only a

Special Court that takes cognizance of an offence under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1136">NDPS Act</a>.

Secondly, the “complaint” referred to in <a href="/doc/26119/" id="a_1137">section 36A(1)(d)</a> is not a private

complaint that is referred to in <a href="/doc/545340/" id="a_1138">section 190(1)(a)</a> of the CrPC, but can

only be by an authorised officer. Thirdly, <a href="/doc/731740/" id="a_1139">section 190(1)(c)</a> of the CrPC is

conspicuous by its absence in <a href="/doc/26119/" id="a_1140">section 36A(1)(d)</a> of the NDPS Act – the

Special Court cannot, upon information received from any person other

than a police officer, or upon its own knowledge, take cognizance of an

offence under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1141">NDPS Act</a>. Further, a Special Court under <a href="/doc/1712009/" id="a_1142">section 36A</a>

is deemed to be a Court of Session, for the applicability of the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1143">CrPC</a>,

under <a href="/doc/1774432/" id="a_1144">section 36C</a> of the NDPS Act. A Court of Session under <a href="/doc/930621/" id="a_1145">section

   <a href="/doc/1145599/" id="a_1146">193</a> of the CrPC cannot take cognizance as a Court of original

   jurisdiction unless the case has been committed to it by a Magistrate.

   However, under <a href="/doc/26119/" id="a_1147">section 36A(1)(d)</a> of the NDPS Act, a Special Court

   may take cognizance of an offence under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1148">NDPS Act</a> without the

   accused being committed to it for trial. It is obvious, therefore, that in

   view of <a href="/doc/26119/" id="a_1149">section 36A(1)(d)</a>, nothing contained in <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_1150">section 190</a> of the CrPC

   can be said to apply to a Special Court taking cognizance of an offence

   under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1151">NDPS Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_352">138.Also, the officer designated under <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_1152">section 53</a> by the Central

   Government or State Government to investigate offences under the

   <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1153">NDPS Act</a>, need not be the same as the officer authorised by the

   Central Government or State Government under <a href="/doc/26119/" id="a_1154">section 36A(1)(d)</a> to

   make a complaint before the Special Court. As a matter of fact, if the

   Central Government is to invest an officer with the power of an officer in

   charge of a police station under sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_1155">section 53</a>, it can only

   do so after consultation with the State Government, which requirement

   is conspicuous by its absence when the Central Government authorises

   an officer under <a href="/doc/26119/" id="a_1156">section 36A(1)(d)</a>. Also, both <a href="/doc/23637/" id="a_1157">section 53(1)</a> and (2) refer

   to officers who belong to particular departments of Government. <a href="/doc/26119/" id="a_1158">Section

   36A(1)(d)</a> does not restrict the officer that can be appointed for the

   purpose of making a complaint to only an officer belonging to a

   department of the Central/State Government. There can also be a

    situation where officers have been designated under <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_1159">section 53</a> by the

    Government, but not so designated under <a href="/doc/26119/" id="a_1160">section 36A(1)(d)</a>. It cannot

    be that in the absence of the designation of an officer under <a href="/doc/26119/" id="a_1161">section

    36A(1)(d)</a>, the culmination of an investigation by a designated officer

    under <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_1162">section 53</a> ends up by being an exercise in futility.

</p><p id="p_353">139.Take the anomalous position that would arise as a result of the

    judgment in Raj Kumar Karwal (supra). Suppose a designated officer

    under <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_1163">section 53</a> of the NDPS Act investigates a particular case and

    then arrives at the conclusion that no offence is made out. Unless such

    officer can give a police report to the Special Court stating that no

    offence had been made out, and utilise the power contained in <a href="/doc/481610/" id="a_1164">section

    169</a> CrPC to release the accused, there would be a major lacuna in the

    <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1165">NDPS Act</a> which cannot be filled.
</p>
<p id="p_354">140.A second anomaly also results from the judgment in Raj Kumar Karwal

    (supra). Ordinarily, after the police report under <a href="/doc/461024/" id="a_1166">section 173(2)</a> of the

    CrPC is forwarded to the Magistrate (the Special Court in the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1167">NDPS

    Act</a>), the police officer can undertake “further investigation” of the

    offence under <a href="/doc/274924/" id="a_1168">section 173(8)</a> of the CrPC. <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1169">Section 173(8)</a> reads as

    follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_143">          “(8) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to preclude
          further investigation in respect of an offence after a report

          in charge of the police station obtains further evidence,

</blockquote><p id="p_355">141.A three-Judge Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/131202146/" id="a_1170">Vinubhai Haribhai Malviya and

    Ors. v. State of Gujarat and Anr</a>. 2019 SCC OnLine SC 1346 held that

    the power to further investigate an offence would be available at all

    stages of the progress of a criminal case before the trial actually

    commences – see paragraph 49. If, as is contended by Shri Lekhi, that

    the officer designated under <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_1171">section 53</a> can only file a “complaint” and

    not a “police report”, then such officer would be denuded of the power to

    further investigate the offence under <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1172">section 173(8)</a> after such

    “complaint” is filed. This is because <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1173">section 173(8)</a> makes it clear that

    the further report can only be filed after a report under sub-section (2)

    (i.e. a police report) has been forwarded to the Court. However, a police

    officer, properly so-called, who may be investigating an identical offence

    under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1174">NDPS Act</a>, would continue to have such power, and may, until

    the trial commences, conduct further investigation so that, as stated by

    this Court in Vinubhai (supra), an innocent person is not wrongly

    arraigned as an accused, or that a prima facie guilty person is not so

    left out. Such anomaly – resulting in a violation of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_1175">Article 14</a> of the

    Constitution of India – in that there is unequal treatment between

    identically situated persons accused of an offence under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1176">NDPS Act</a>

    solely due to the whether the investigating officer is a police officer or an

    officer designated under <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_1177">section 53</a> of the NDPS Act, would arise only if

    the view in Raj Kumar Karwal (supra) is correct.

</p><p id="p_356">142.A third anomalous situation would arise, in that under <a href="/doc/135163/" id="a_1178">section 36A(1)(a)</a>

    of the NDPS Act, it is only offences which are punishable with

    imprisonment for a term of more than three years that are exclusively

    triable by the Special Court. If, for example, an accused is tried for an

    offence punishable under <a href="/doc/186683/" id="a_1179">section 26</a> of the NDPS Act, he may be tried

    by a Magistrate and not the Special Court. This being the case, the

    special procedure provided in <a href="/doc/26119/" id="a_1180">section 36A(1)(d)</a> would not apply, the

    result being that the <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_1181">section 53</a> officer who investigates this offence, will

    then deliver a police report to the Magistrate under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_1182">section 173</a> of the

    CrPC. Absent any provision in the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1183">NDPS Act</a> truncating the powers of

    investigation for prevention and detection of crimes under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1184">NDPS

    Act</a>, it is clear that an offence which is punishable for three years and

    less can be investigated by officers designated under <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_1185">section 53</a>,

    leading to the filing of a police report. However, in view of Raj Kumar

    Karwal (supra), a <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_1186">section 53</a> officer investigating an offence under the

    <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1187">NDPS Act</a> can end up only by filing a complaint under <a href="/doc/26119/" id="a_1188">section 36A(1)(d)</a>

    of the NDPS Act. Shri Lekhi’s only answer to this anomaly is that under

    <a href="/doc/67836473/" id="a_1189">section 36A(5)</a> of the NDPS Act, such trials will follow a summary

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_148">                                                                             148</span>
    procedure, which, in turn, will relate to a complaint where investigation

    is undertaken by a narcotics officer. First and foremost, trial procedure

    is post-investigation, and has nothing to do with the manner of

    investigation or cognizance, as was submitted by Shri Lekhi himself.

    Secondly, even assuming that the mode of trial has some relevance to

    this anomaly, <a href="/doc/729109/" id="a_1190">section 258</a> of the CrPC makes it clear that a summons

    case can be instituted “otherwise than upon complaint”, which would

    obviously refer to a summons case being instituted on a police report –

    see <a href="/doc/1030147/" id="a_1191">John Thomas v. Dr. K. Jagadeesan</a> (2001) 6 SCC 30 (at

    paragraph 8).

<p id="p_357">143.<a href="/doc/1573215/" id="a_1192">Section 59</a> of the NDPS Act is an important pointer to when cognizance

    of an offence can take place only on a complaint, and not by way of a

    police report. By <a href="/doc/809276/" id="a_1193">section 59(3)</a>, both in the case of an offence under

    <a href="/doc/1608599/" id="a_1194">section 59(1)</a> [which is punishable for a term which may extend to one

    year] or in the case of an offence under <a href="/doc/1573215/" id="a_1195">section 59(2)</a> [which is

    punishable for a term which shall not be less than 10 years, but which

    may extend to 20 years], no Court shall take cognizance of any offence

    under <a href="/doc/1608599/" id="a_1196">section 59(1)</a> or (2), except on a complaint in writing made with

    the previous sanction of the Central Government, or, as the case may

    be, the State Government. Thus, under <a href="/doc/1573215/" id="a_1197">section 59</a>, in either case i.e. in

    a case where the trial takes place by a Magistrate for an offence under

    <a href="/doc/1608599/" id="a_1198">section 59(1)</a>, or by the Special Court for an offence under <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1199">section

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_149">                                                                         149</span></a>
    <a href="/doc/1573215/" id="a_1200">59(2)</a>, cognizance cannot be taken either by the Magistrate or the

    Special Court, except on a complaint in writing. This provision is in

    terms markedly different from <a href="/doc/26119/" id="a_1201">section 36A(1)(d)</a>, which provides two

    separate procedures for taking cognizance of offences made out under

    the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1202">NDPS Act</a>. For all these reasons, it is clear that Raj Kumar Karwal

    (supra) cannot possibly have laid down the law correctly.

</p><p id="p_358">144.At this juncture, it is important to state that we do not accept the

    submission of Shri S.K. Jain that the “complaint” referred to in <a href="/doc/26119/" id="a_1203">section

    36A(1)(d)</a> refers only to <a href="/doc/1573215/" id="a_1204">section 59</a> of the NDPS Act. A complaint can be

    made by a designated officer qua offences which arise under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1205">NDPS

    Act</a> – it is not circumscribed by a provision which requires previous

    sanction for an offence committed under <a href="/doc/233696/" id="a_1206">section 58</a>, as that would do

    violence to the plain language of <a href="/doc/26119/" id="a_1207">section 36A(1)(d)</a>. This argument is,

    therefore, rejected.   It is always open, therefore, to the designated

    officer, designated this time for the purpose of filing a complaint under

    <a href="/doc/26119/" id="a_1208">section 36A(1)(d)</a>, to do so before the Special Court, which is a

    separate procedure provided for under the special statute, in addition to

    the procedure to be followed under <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_1209">section 53</a>, as delineated

    hereinabove.
</p>
<p id="p_359">145.Shri Lekhi, however, argued that <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_1210">section 53</a> does not use the

    expression “deemed” and that therefore, the power contained in <a href="/doc/23637/" id="a_1211">section

    53(1)</a> is only a truncated power to investigate which does not culminate

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_150">                                                                         150</span>
    in a police report being filed. We cannot agree. The officer who is

    designated under <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_1212">section 53</a> can, by a legal fiction, be deemed to be an

    officer in charge of a police station, or can be given the powers of an

    officer in charge of a police station to investigate the offences under the

    <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1213">NDPS Act</a>. Whether he is deemed as an officer in charge of a police

    station, or given such powers, are only different sides of the same coin

    – the aforesaid officer is not, in either circumstance, a police officer who

    belongs to the police force of the State. To concede that a deeming

    fiction would give full powers of investigation, including the filing of a

    final report, to the designated officer, as against the powers of an officer

    in charge of a police station being given to a designated officer having

    only limited powers to investigate, does not stand to reason, and would

    be contrary to the express language and intendment of <a href="/doc/23637/" id="a_1214">section 53(1)</a>.

</p><p id="p_360">146.Another argument of Shri Lekhi is that police officers or policemen who

    belong to the police force are recognised in the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1215">NDPS Act</a> as being

    separate and distinct from the officers of the Department of Narcotics,

    etc. This argument has no legs on which to stand when it is clear that

    the expression “police officers” does not only mean a police officer who

    belongs to the State police force, but includes officers who may belong

    to other departments, such as the Department of Excise in Raja Ram

    Jaiswal (supra), who are otherwise invested with all powers of

    investigation so as to attract the provisions of <a href="/doc/1089586/" id="a_1216">section 25</a> of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_151">                                                                            151</span>
   <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1217">Evidence Act</a>. Further, if the distinction between police officer as

   narrowly defined and the officers of the Narcotics Control Bureau is

   something that is to be stressed, then any interpretation which would

   whittle down the fundamental rights of an accused based solely on the

   designation of a particular officer, would fall foul of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_1218">Article 14</a>, as the

   classification between the two types of officers would have no rational

   relation to the object sought to be achieved by the statute in question,

   which is the prevention and detection of crime.

</p><p id="p_361">147.What remains to be considered is Kanhaiyalal (supra). In this

   judgment, the question revolved around a conviction on the basis of a

   confessional statement made under <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_1219">section 67</a> of the NDPS Act. This

   Court, after setting out <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_1220">section 67</a>, then drew a parallel between the

    and these provisions. In fact, <a href="/doc/877314/" id="a_1233">section 108</a> of the Customs Act, 1962

    expressly states that the statements made therein are evidence, as

    opposed to <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_1234">section 67</a> which is only a section which enables an officer

    notified under <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_1235">section 42</a> to gather information in an enquiry in which

    persons are “examined”.
</p>
<p id="p_372">149.Equally, <a href="/doc/978947/" id="a_1236">section 32</a> of POTA and section 15 of TADA are exceptions to

   in Kartar Singh (supra) the following additional safeguards/guidelines

   were issued by the Court to ensure that the confession obtained in the

   course of investigation by a police officer “is not tainted with any vice

   but is in strict conformity with the well-recognised and accepted

   aesthetic principles and fundamental fairness”:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_146">        “263…(1) The confession should be recorded in a free

        produced before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or the

        required to be sent under Rule 15(5) along with the

cities and elsewhere of a Deputy Superintendent of Police
or a police officer of equivalent rank, should investigate
any offence punishable under this Act of 1987.
</p>
<p id="p_376">This is necessary in view of the drastic provisions of this
Act. More so when the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_1251">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, 1988

judicial custody, must file an affidavit sworn by him

for the delay, if any, in seeking the police custody;

(6) In case, the person, taken for interrogation, on receipt
of the statutory warning that he is not bound to make a
confession and that if he does so, the said statement may
be used against him as evidence, asserts his right to

         reasonableness into the stringent provisions of POTA in

also. In fact, the fulfilment of such mandate is inherent in
the process of recording a confession by a statutory
authority. What is necessarily implicit is, perhaps, made
explicit. But the notable safeguards which were lacking in
TADA are to be found in sub-sections (4) and (5).

</p><p id="p_382">157. The lofty purpose behind the mandate that the maker
of the confession shall be sent to judicial custody by the
CJM before whom he is produced is to provide an
atmosphere in which he would feel free to make a
complaint against the police, if he so wishes. The feeling
that he will be free from the shackles of police custody
after production in court will minimise, if not remove, the
fear psychosis by which he may be gripped. The various
safeguards enshrined in <a href="/doc/1434671/" id="a_1260">Section 32</a> are meant to be
strictly observed as they relate to personal liberty of an
individual. However, we add a caveat here. The strict
enforcement of the provision as to judicial remand and the
invalidation of the confession merely on the ground of its
non-compliance may present some practical difficulties at
times. Situations may arise that even after the confession
is made by a person in custody, police custody may still
be required for the purpose of further investigation.
Sending a person to judicial custody at that stage may
retard the investigation. Sometimes, the further steps to
be taken by the investigator with the help of the accused
may brook no delay. An attempt shall however be made to
harmonise this provision in <a href="/doc/1434671/" id="a_1261">Section 32(5)</a> with the powers
of investigation available to the police. At the same time, it
needs to be emphasised that the obligation to send the
confession maker to judicial custody cannot be lightly
disregarded. Police custody cannot be given on the mere
asking by the police. It shall be remembered that sending
a person who has made the confession to judicial custody
after he is produced before the CJM is the normal rule
and this procedural safeguard should be given its due
primacy. The CJM should be satisfied that it is absolutely
necessary that the confession maker shall be restored to
police custody for any special reason. Such a course of
sending him back to police custody could only be done in
exceptional cases after due application of mind. Most
often, sending such person to judicial custody in
compliance with <a href="/doc/1434671/" id="a_1262">Section 32(5)</a> soon after the proceedings

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_159">                                                                 159</span>
are recorded by the CJM subject to the consideration of
the application by the police after a few days may not
make material difference to the further investigation. The
CJM has a duty to consider whether the application is only
a ruse to get back the person concerned to police custody
in case he disputes the confession or it is an application
made bona fide in view of the need and urgency involved.
We are therefore of the view that the non-compliance with
the judicial custody requirement does not per se vitiate the
confession, though its non-compliance should be one of
the important factors that must be borne in mind in testing
the confession.
</p>
<p id="p_383">158. These provisions of <a href="/doc/1434671/" id="a_1263">Section 32</a>, which are conceived
in the interest of the accused, will go a long way to screen
and exclude confessions, which appear to be involuntary.
The requirements and safeguards laid down in sub-
sections (2) to (5) are an integral part of the scheme
providing for admissibility of confession made to the police
officer. The breach of any one of these requirements
would have a vital bearing on the admissibility and
evidentiary value of the confession recorded under
<a href="/doc/1434671/" id="a_1264">Section 32(1)</a> and may even inflict a fatal blow on such
confession. We have another set of procedural
safeguards laid down in Section 52 of POTA which are
modelled on the guidelines envisaged by D.K.
</p><p id="p_384">Basu [(1997) 1 SCC 416]. <a href="/doc/1294540/" id="a_1265">Section 52</a> runs as under:

“52. (1) Where a police officer arrests a person, he shall
prepare a custody memo of the person arrested.
</p>
<p id="p_385">(2) The person arrested shall be informed of his right to
consult a legal practitioner as soon as he is brought to the
police station.
</p>
<p id="p_386">(3) Whenever any person is arrested, information of his
arrest shall be immediately communicated by the police
officer to a family member or in his absence to a relative
of such person by telegram, telephone or by any other
means and this fact shall be recorded by the police officer
under the signature of the person arrested.
</p>
<p id="p_387">


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_160">                                                               160</span>
          (4) The person arrested shall be permitted to meet the
          legal practitioner representing him during the course of
          interrogation of the accused person:
</p>
<p id="p_388">          Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall entitle the
          legal practitioner to remain present throughout the period
          of interrogation.”

          Sub-sections (2) and (4) as well as sub-section (3) stem
          from the guarantees enshrined in Articles 21 and 22(1) of
          the Constitution. <a href="/doc/1293832/" id="a_1266">Article 22(1)</a> enjoins that no person who
          is arrested shall be detained in custody without being
          informed, as soon as may be, of the grounds for such
          arrest nor shall he be denied the right to consult, and to
          be defended by, a legal practitioner of his choice. They
          are also meant to effectuate the commandment of <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_1267">Article
          20(3)</a> that no person accused of any offence shall be
          compelled to be a witness against himself.”

</p><p id="p_389">152.Thus, to arrive at the conclusion that a confessional statement made

    before an officer designated under <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_1268">section 42</a> or <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_1269">section 53</a> can be the

    basis to convict a person under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1270">NDPS Act</a>, without any non

Indira Banerjee, J.

persuade myself to agree that the officers invested with powers

under <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_1279">Section 53</a> of the Narcotic Drugs and <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1280">Psychotropic Substances

Act (NDPS Act</a>) are police officers within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1089586/" id="a_1281">Section 25</a> of

the indian <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1282">Evidence Act</a>, 1872 or that any confessional statement

made to them would be barred under the provisions of <a href="/doc/1089586/" id="a_1283">Section 25</a> or

26 of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_1284">Evidence Act</a>.          In my view, any statement made or

document or other thing given to an authorised officer referred to in

<a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_1285">Section 42</a> of the NDPS Act or an officer invested under <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_1286">Section 53</a>

with the powers of an Officer in Charge for the purpose of

investigation of an offence under the said Act, in the course of any

inquiry, investigation or other proceeding, may be tendered in

evidence in the trial of an offence under the said Act and proved in

accordance with law. I am also unable to agree that a statement

recorded under <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_1287">Section 67</a> of the NDPS Act cannot be used against an

accused offender in the trial of an offence under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1288">NDPS Act</a>.



</p><p id="p_402">2.     The illicit production, distribution, sale and consumption of

drugs and psychotropic substances, is a crime of multi-dimensional

magnitude, that imposes a staggering burden on the society. In an

Article “Narcotic Aggression and Operation Counter Attack” published

in the Mainstream dated March 7, 1992, V.R. Krishna Iyer, J. said:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_156">     “Religion is opium of the people, but today opium is the religion of the
     people, and like God, is omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient. Alas!
     Opium makes you slowly ill and eventually kills, makes you a new
     criminal to rob and buy the stuff, tempts you to smuggle at risk to
     become rich quick, makes you invisible trafficker of psychotropic
     substances and operator of a parallel international illicit currency and
     sub rosa evangelist mafia culture. Drug business makes you if not killed


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_165">                                                                           165</span>
     betimes, the possessor of pleasure, power and empire. What noxious
     menace is this most inescapable evil that benumbs the soul of student,
     teacher, doctor, politician, artists and professional, and corrupts
     innocent millions of youth and promising intellectuals everywhere.”



</blockquote><p id="p_403">3.     In the words of Krishna Iyer, J., “the global scenario in its

sombre macabre, devouring delinquency, is dominated by drug abuse

and narcotic trade. Trafficking in drugs and psychotropic substances

is not any local or regional crime confined only to India and third-

world countries, but is a worldwide phenomenon.                 All nations

including India, had huge drug abuse as a threat to the survival of

human beings.”




</p><p id="p_404">4.     Illicit   drug   trafficking   is   an   organised   crime,    highly

sophisticated and complex. This illicit traffic, cleverly carried out by

hardened criminals with dexterity and skill, not only violates national

drug laws and international conventions,          but also involves many

other criminal activities, including racketeering, conspiracy, bribery

and corruption of public officials, tax evasion, banking law violations,

illegal money transfers, import/export violations, crimes of violence

and terrorism.
</p>
<p id="p_405">


</p><p id="p_406">5.     Narcotics are often supplied for money and also in exchange

for weapons. There are numerous drug trafficking mafia yielding,

immense power in various regions of the world, including India. The

far-reaching consequences of illicit drug trade, even threatens the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_166">                                                                         166</span>
integrity and stability of governments and renders law enforcement

action vulnerable.
</p>
<p id="p_407">


</p><p id="p_408">6.     Considering the huge profits derived by drug barons from

rampant consumption of opium and other narcotic drugs, tycoons of

the drug cartels, who have international links, go to any extent, to

exploit and manipulate      unhealthy economic conditions, as well as

corruption and weaknesses in the administration, to push drugs into

the society, in complete disregard of the health, morality and well-

being of the people.
</p>
<p id="p_409">


</p><p id="p_410">7.     India has been directly engulfed in drug trafficking by virtue of

its geographical location, flanked on three sides by illicit narcotic drug

production regions. To the West lies the Golden Crescent, comprising

Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan, which illegally produce a huge volume

of opium, converted into heroin in illicit factories.     In the East, the

Golden Triangle is made up of Burma, Thailand and Laos, which

produce thousands of tons of opium, cultivated over thousands of

hectares of land. The third flank is along the 1,568 km border with

Nepal in the North. The Himalayan foot hills and the Terrai regions of

Nepal produce inter alia ‘cannabis restin’.     The long land border with

Pakistan and a network of airports and seaports linking India to other

countries has facilitated illegal trafficking in drugs.




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_167">                                                                       167</span>
</p><p id="p_411">8.       India is not only a transit point for the export of narcotic drugs

from the regions surrounding it, to Western and other countries.

India also provides a lucrative market for narcotic drugs and

psychotropic substances. That apart, there is widespread illicit

cultivation of plants yielding narcotic drugs, like opium and ganja in

India.
</p>
<p id="p_412">


</p><p id="p_413">9.       Illicit drugs from the Golden Crescent, the Golden Triangle, as

well as from Nepal and China, are smuggled into India for

consumption and sale and also onward transmission to other

countries. Illicit drugs find their way, inter alia, into metropolitan

cities of India like Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru etc. The amount of illicit

narcotic drugs that are seized in India by law enforcement

authorities, only constitute the tip of the iceberg.




</p><p id="p_414">10.      The menace of illicit, manufacture and sale of narcotic drugs

and psychotropic substances has been of international concern. As

early as in July 1906, Reverend Brent wrote a letter to President

Roosevelt expressing his anxiety over the increasing illicit traffic in

opium and the necessity of curbing the same. That was followed by a

series of meetings amongst various nations of the world, at regular

intervals, leading to the enactment of several Drug Laws in those

nations.
</p>
<p id="p_415"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_168">                                                                       168</span>
</p><p id="p_416">11.    An International Convention was held at Hague in 1912, to

inter alia regulate the preparation and sale of raw and prepared

opium and other derivatives like Morphine and Cocaine etc.

However, the enforcement of the said Convention was kept in

abeyance for nearly six years, presumably due to the first World War,

and came into force in the middle of 1919.
</p>
<p id="p_417">


</p><p id="p_418">12.    In 1920-1923, the Council of the League of Nations, entrusted

the control, manufacture, trade and traffic in drugs inter alia to the

Assembly and Council of the League of Nations, the Advisory

Committee on the subject relating to traffic in opium and other

dangerous drugs,   the Health Committee of the League of Nations

and its Supervisory Body.
</p>
<p id="p_419">


</p><p id="p_420">13.    The second International Opium Convention, held in Greece in

1925 led to the Geneva Opium Agreement, 1925 which came into

force in 1926. The Geneva Opium Agreement made elaborate

recommendations in respect, of the problems relating to intake and

illicit traffic of opium. The next Convention was held at Geneva in

1931 for limiting the manufacture as well as regulating the

distribution of Narcotic drugs. In 1936, another Convention for the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_169">                                                                  169</span>
suppression of illicit traffic in dangerous drugs was held in Geneva.

The Resolutions adopted in the convention came into force in 1939.




</p><p id="p_421">14.     In 1946, the United Nations established the Commission for

Narcotic Drugs as a functional Commission of the Economic and the

Social Council.     In 1953, the Commission formulated Protocols for

limiting and regulating the cultivation of opium plant, international

whole-sale trade in opium and the use of opium.
</p>
<p id="p_422">


</p><p id="p_423">15.     In 1961 a Single Convention of Narcotic Drugs was adopted by

the United Nations with the objects of: -

March 31, 1961 and came into force on December 13, 1964.

an International Drug Abuse Control Strategy and a five-year Action

Plan for 1982-86. In 1984 the U.N. General Assembly adopted the

declaration on the Control of Drug Trafficking and Drug Abuse. Again,

there was an International Conference on drug abuse and illicit

trafficking held in Vienna from June 17 to June 26, 1987.              The

principal document prepared before the Conference by the United

Nations was a comprehensive multi-disciplinary plan of future

and/or conventions. India had participated in the Second International

Opium Conference at Geneva on 17th November, 1924 and again on

19th February, 1925, and adopted the convention relating to

dangerous drugs. Being a signatory to the said Convention, which

resolved to take further measure to suppress the contraband traffic in

and abuse of Dangerous Drugs especially those derived from Opium,

Indian Hemp and Coca Leaf, the Indian Legislature passed the

Dangerous Drugs Act, 1930 to control certain operations relating to

dangerous drugs and provide for increased penalties for the offences

relating to such operations. The said Act was amended from time to

time by various legislations.
</p>
<p id="p_442">


</p><p id="p_443">22.    It may be pertinent to point out that, even before the

enactment of the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1930, there was statutory

control over Narcotic Drugs in India through enactments like the

<a href="/doc/912591/" id="a_1289">Opium Act</a>s of 1857 and 1878.
</p>
<p id="p_444">23.    With the developments in the field of illicit drug traffic and

drug abuse at the National and International level, many flaws were

noticed in the laws. It was realised that the provisions of the Acts

were not stringent enough to effectively control drug abuse and

related crimes like preparation, transport, sale etc. of narcotic drugs

and psychotropic substances.      The laws in existence were not a

deterrent to illicit business in narcotic drugs and psychotropic

substances. An urgent need was, therefore, felt for introducing a

comprehensive legislation on Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic

Substances.

laid before Parliament is as under:
</p>
<p id="p_451">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_157">      “The statutory control over narcotic drugs is exercised in India through
      a number of Central and State enactments. The Principal Central Acts,
      namely, the <a href="/doc/912591/" id="a_1296">Opium Act</a>, 1857, the <a href="/doc/912591/" id="a_1297">Opium Act</a>, 1878 and the Dangerous
      Drugs Act, 1930 were enacted a long time ago. With the passage of
      time and the developments in the field of illicit drug traffic and drug
      abuse at national and international level many deficiencies in the
      existing laws have come to notice, some of which are indicated below:</blockquote><p id="p_452">

</p><p id="p_453">      (i) The scheme of penalties under the present Acts is not
          sufficiently deterrent to meet the challenge of well
          organised gangs of smugglers. The Dangerous Drugs Act,
          1930 provides for a maximum term of imprisonment of three
          years with or without fine and four years imprisonment with or
          without fine with repeat offences. Further, no minimum

         punishment is prescribed in the present laws, as a result of which
         drug traffickers have been sometimes let off by the courts with
         nominal punishment. The country has for the last few years been
         increasingly facing the problem of transit traffic of drugs coming
         mainly from some of our neighbouring countries and destined
         mainly to western countries.
</p>
<p id="p_454">      (ii) The existing central laws do not provide for investing the officers
           of a number of important central enforcement agencies like
           narcotics, customs, central excise etc., with the power of
           investigation of offences under the said laws.

</p><p id="p_455">      (iii) Since the enactment of the aforesaid three <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_1298">Central Act</a>s a vast
           body of international law in the field of narcotics control has
           evolved through various international treaties and protocols. The
           Government of India has been a party to these treaties and
           conventions which entail several obligations which are not
           covered or are only partly covered by the present Acts.

</p><p id="p_456">      (iv) During the recent years new drugs of addiction which have come
          to be known as psychotropic substances have appeared on the
          scene and posed serious problems to national governments.
          There is no comprehensive law to enable exercise of control over
          psychotropic substances in India in the manner as envisaged in
          the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971 to which also

      recent years, India has been facing a problem of transit traffic in illicit
      drugs. The spill over from such traffic has caused problems of abuse
      and additction. The Narcotic Drugs and <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1348">Psychotropic Substances Act</a>,
      1985 provides deterrent punishments for drug trafficing offences. Even
      though the major offences are non-bailable by virtue of the level of
      punishments, on technical grounds, drug offenders were being released
      on bail. In the light of certain difficulties faced in the enforcement of
      the Narcotic Drugs and <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1349">Psychotropic Substances Act</a>, 1985, the need to
      amend the law to further strengthen it, has been felt.

      Psychotropic Substances.—The genesis and development of the
      Indian drug trafficking scenario are closely connected with the strategic
      and geographical location of India which has massive inflow of heroin
      and hashish from across the Indo-Pak border originating from “Golden
      Crescent” comprising of Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan which is one of
      the major illicit drug supplying areas of the world. On the North Eastern
      side of the country is the “Gold Triangle” comprising of Burma, Loas and
      Thailand which is again one of the largest sources of illicit opium in the
      world. Nepal also is a traditional source of cannabis, both herbal and
      resinous. Cannabis is also of wide growth in some states of India. As far
      as illicit drug trafficking from and through India is concerned, these
      three sources of supply have been instrumental in drug trafficking. Prior
      to the enactment of the Narcotic Drugs and <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1357">Psychotropic Substances
      Act</a>, 1985, the statutory control over narcotic drugs was exercised in
      India through a number of Central and State enactments. The principal
      Central Acts were (a) the Opium Act, 1857, (b) the Opium Act, 1878 and

and psychotropic substances, food adulteration, black marketing,

profiteering and hoarding, smuggling, tax evasion and the like, which

are “white collar crimes” affect the health and material welfare of

the community as a whole, as against that of an individual victim,

and are, by and large, committed not by disadvantaged low class

people, but by very affluent and immensely powerful people, who

often exploit the less advantaged, to execute their nefarious designs.

other crimes, committed by individual offenders against individual

victims.

trial, encompassing fair procedure is guaranteed under

<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_1358">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. It is too late in the day

to contend otherwise. The safeguards provided in a statute,

are always scrupulously to be adhered to, more so when the

punishment is very severe. However, in my view, each case

has to be decided taking into account all relevant factors,

particularly, the evidence against the accused.




</p><p id="p_506">52.    It is a well settled principle of criminal jurisprudence that an

accused    is   presumed   innocent,   unless   proved   guilty   beyond

reasonable doubt, except where the statute, on existence of certain

circumstances, casts a reverse burden on the accused, to dispel the

presumption of guilt, as in the case of <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_1359">Section 304B</a> of the Indian

Penal Code and many other statutes, particularly those dealing with

socio economic offences.     The Legislature may, in public interest,

create an offence of strict liability where mens rea is not necessary.

<blockquote id="blockquote_173">           “9. ….“Reason to believe” is another facet of the state of mind.
           “Reason to believe” is not the same thing as “suspicion” or
           “doubt” and mere seeing also cannot be equated to believing.
           “Reason to believe” is a higher level of state of mind. Likewise
           “knowledge” will be slightly on a higher plane than “reason to
           believe”. A person can be supposed to know where there is a direct
           appeal to his senses and a person is presumed to have a reason to
           believe if he has sufficient cause to believe the same.

interpreted as per its ordinary meaning, which may be ascertained by reference to

a dictionary.    As per the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (Eleventh Edition) the

word investigate means ‘carry out a systematic or formal enquiry into an incident

or allegation as to establish the truth’. Investigation, is the act of investigating.

The word “enquire” is, as per the same dictionary, to ask for information. It also

means “investigate”. Enquiry is the act of asking for information. It is an official

investigation.   Words and phrases in a statute have to be construed in

the context in which they have been used.                The statute has to be

read as a whole.

construe the meaning of the expression “inquiry” in <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_1624">Section 67</a> of the NDPS Act
and the difference, if any, between the expression “inquiry” as used in <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_1625">Section 67</a>

expression ‘inquiry’ in preference to investigation, in the statutes named above,

except the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1636">Cr.P.C</a>., may perhaps be linked to the definition of ‘inquiry’ in the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1637">Cr.P.C</a>.

to mean an inquiry other than a trial by a Magistrate or a Court, since inquiry under

“inquiry” may reasonably be construed as a generic expression,            which could

include the investigation of an offence.   An inquiry as contemplated in <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_1644">Section 67</a>

is the collection of information generally, to find out if there has been any

contravention of the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1645">NDPS Act</a>, whereas investigation is the probing of an offence

under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1646">NDPS Act</a> and collection of materials to find out the truth of the case

sought to be made out against an accused offender. However investigation may

follow an enquiry or be part of an enquiry. This is evident from a reading of the

reasonable grounds for believing that anything necessary for the

Extra-judicial confessions are those which are made by the party

elsewhere    than   before      a   Magistrate   or   Court.    Extra-judicial

confessions are generally those that are made by a party to or

before a private individual which includes even a judicial officer in

especially empowered to record confessions under <a href="/doc/497457/" id="a_1871">Section 164</a> of

the Code or a Magistrate so empowered but receiving the confession

at a stage when <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_1872">Section 164</a> does not apply. As to extra-judicial

       “An extra-judicial confession, if voluntary and true and made

in a fit state of mind, can be relied upon by the Court. The

confession will have to be proved like any other fact. The value of

the evidence as to confession, like any other evidence, depends

upon the veracity of the witness to whom it has been made. The

value of the evidence as to the confession depends on the reliability

of the witness who gives the evidence. It is not open to any court to

start with a presumption that extra-judicial confession is a weak

type   of   evidence.     It   would   depend    on   the   nature    of   the

circumstances, the time when the confession was made and the

      counsel for the respondent-accused, is a matter of prudence and not

      an invariable rule of law.”




</p><p id="p_757">      150. <a href="/doc/928028/" id="a_1873">In Gura Singh v. State of Rajasthan14</a> this Court held:-




</p><blockquote id="blockquote_230">          “6. It is settled position of law that extrajudicial confession, if
          true and voluntary, it can be relied upon by the court to convict
          the accused for the commission of the crime alleged. Despite
          inherent weakness of extrajudicial confession as an item of
          evidence, it cannot be ignored when shown that such confession
          was made before a person who has no reason to state falsely
          and to whom it is made in the circumstances which tend to
          support the statement. Relying upon an earlier judgment in <a href="/doc/1786180/" id="a_1874">Rao
          Shiv Bahadur Singh v. State of Vindhya Pradesh</a> [AIR 1954 SC

          <a href="/doc/70850146/" id="a_1875">Maghar Singh v. State of Punjab</a> [(1975) 4 SCC 234 : 1975 SCC
          (Cri) 479 : AIR 1975 SC 1320] held that the evidence in the form
          of extrajudicial confession made by the accused to witnesses
          cannot be always termed to be a tainted evidence. Corroboration
          of such evidence is required only by way of abundant caution. If
          the court believes the witness before whom the confession is
          made and is satisfied that the confession was true and
          voluntarily made, then the conviction can be founded on such
          evidence alone. <a href="/doc/416055/" id="a_1876">In Narayan Singh v. State of M.P</a>. [(1985) 4 SCC

          that it is not open to the court trying the criminal case to start

          weak type of evidence. It would depend on the nature of the

       circumstances, the time when the confession is made and the
       credibility of the witnesses who speak for such a confession. The
       retraction of extrajudicial confession which is a usual
       phenomenon in criminal cases would by itself not weaken the
       case of the prosecution based upon such a confession. <a href="/doc/955616/" id="a_1877">In Kishore
       Chand v. State of H.P</a>. [(1991) 1 SCC 286 : 1991 SCC (Cri) 172 :
</blockquote><p id="p_758">       AIR 1990 SC 2140] this Court held that an unambiguous
       extrajudicial confession possesses high probative value force as
       it emanates from the person who committed the crime and is
       admissible in evidence provided it is free from suspicion and
       suggestion of any falsity. However, before relying on the alleged
       confession, the court has to be satisfied that it is voluntary and
       is not the result of inducement, threat or promise envisaged
       under <a href="/doc/967059/" id="a_1878">Section 24</a> of the Evidence Act or was brought about in
       suspicious circumstances to circumvent <a href="/doc/1089586/" id="a_1879">Sections 25</a> and <a href="/doc/186683/" id="a_1880">26</a>. The
       court is required to look into the surrounding circumstances to
       find out as to whether such confession is not inspired by any
       improper or collateral consideration or circumvention of law
       suggesting that it may not be true. All relevant circumstances
       such as the person to whom the confession is made, the time
       and place of making it, the circumstances in which it was made
       have to be scrutinised. To the same effect is the judgment in
       <a href="/doc/1575757/" id="a_1881">Baldev Raj v. State of Haryana</a> [1991 Supp (1) SCC 14 : 1991
       SCC (Cri) 659 : AIR 1991 SC 37] . After referring to the judgment
       in <a href="/doc/1891900/" id="a_1882">Piara Singh v. State of Punjab</a> [(1977) 4 SCC 452 : 1977 SCC

       not obtained by coercion, promise of favour or false hope and is
       plenary in character and voluntary in nature can be made the
       basis for conviction even without corroboration.”

<p id="p_774">
</p><p id="p_775">        18. We now refer to certain aspects which lead us to
        consider that the expression “police officer” has not such
        a wide meaning as to include persons on whom certain
        police powers are conferred. The object of enacting
        <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_1898">Section 25</a> of the Evidence Act, whose provisions formerly
        formed part<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_1899"> of the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure, was to
        exclude from evidence confessions made to the regular
        police which had a very bad reputation for the methods it
        employed in investigation, especially in forcibly extracting
        confessions with the object of securing a conviction. The
        past conduct of the members of the police organization
        justified the provision. It is too much to suppose that the
        legislature did intend that all persons, who may have to
        investigate or arrest persons or seize articles in pursuance
        of any particular law of which at the time it had no
        conception, should be considered to be so unreliable that
        any confession made to them must be excluded just as a
        confession made to a regular police officer. If it could not
        contemplate the later creation of offences or of agencies
        to take action in respect to them under future legislation,
        it could not have intended the expression “police officer”
        to include officers entrusted in future with the duty of
        detecting and preventing smuggling and similar offences
        with the object of safeguarding the levying and recovery of
        Customs duties. If the legislature had intended to use the
        expression “police officer” for such a wide purpose, it
        would have used a more comprehensive expression. It
        could have expressed its intention more clearly by making

     of the Evidence Act would be whether the powers of a police officer

     which were conferred on him, or which were exercisable by him

     because he was deemed to be an officer in charge of a Police Station,

     established a direct or substantial relationship with the prohibition

     enacted by <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_1902">Section 25</a> of the Evidence Act. This Court held that the

     from consideration confession to an officer, who by virtue of his

     position could extract by force, torture or inducement, a confession.

     If the power of investigation established a direct relationship with

     prohibition under <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_1904">Section 25</a> of the Evidence Act, the mere fact that

     the officer might possess some other powers under some other law,

          argued that since the Act does not prescribe the procedure for

          Act must necessarily resort to the procedure under Chapter XII of the

          the submission appears at first blush, it cannot stand close scrutiny. In

            This clause makes it clear that if the investigation is conducted by the

            by an officer of any other department including the DRI, the Special Court

            that such a complaint would have to be under <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_1992">Section 190</a> of the Code.
            This clause, in our view, clinches the matter. We must, therefore, negative
            the contention that an officer appointed under <a href="/doc/1276310/" id="a_1993">Section 53</a> of the Act, other
            than a police officer, is entitled to exercise ‘all’ the powers under Chapter

     Act</a>, 1947. In construing the said Act, a penal statute, Subba Rao, J.

     stated:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_250">             9. “The Preamble indicates that the Act was passed as it was
             expedient to make more effective provisions for the prevention of
             bribery and corruption. The long title as well as the Preamble indicate
             that the Act was passed to put down the said social evil i.e. bribery
             and corruption by public servant. Bribery is a form of corruption. The
             fact that in addition to the word ‘bribery’ the word ‘corruption’ is used
             shows that the legislation was intended to combat also other evil in
             addition to bribery. The existing law i.e.<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2036"> the Penal Code</a> was found
             insufficient to eradicate or even to control the growing evil of bribery
             and corruption corroding the public service of our country. The
             provisions broadly include the existing offences under <a href="/doc/48127346/" id="a_2037">Sections 161</a>
             and <a href="/doc/126359453/" id="a_2038">165</a> of the Penal Code, 1860 committed by public servants and
             enact a new rule of presumptive evidence against the accused. <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_2039">The
             Act</a> also creates a new offence of criminal misconduct by public
             servants though to some extent it overlaps on the pre-existing
             offences and enacts a rebuttable presumption contrary to the well-
             known principles of criminal jurisprudence. It also aims to protect
             honest public servants from harassment by prescribing that the
             investigation against them could be made only by police officials of
             particular status and by making the sanction of the Government or
             other appropriate officer a pre-condition for their prosecution. As it is a
             socially useful measure conceived in public interest, it should be
             liberally construed so as to bring about the desired object i.e. to
             prevent corruption among public servants and to prevent harassment
             of the honest among them.

             any notion that there has been a slip, that there has been a casus
             omissus, that the thing is so clearly within the mischief that it must
             have been intended to be included if thought of. On the other hand, the
             person charged has a right to say that the thing charged, although
             within the words, is not within the spirit of the enactment. But where
             the thing is brought within the words and within the spirit, there a
             penal enactment is to be construed, like any other instrument,
             according to the fair commonsense meaning of the language used, and
             the Court is not to find or make any doubt or ambiguity in the language
             of a penal statute, where such doubt or ambiguity would clearly not be
             found or made in the same language in any other instrument.’
             In our view this passage, if we may say so, restates the rule of construction of a
             penal provision from a correct perspective.”

                  true that all penal statutes are to be strictly construed in the sense
                  that the court must see that the thing charged as an offence is

                      substantially the same rules. “All modern Acts are framed with
                      regard to equitable as well as legal principles.” “A hundred

                      CC 38 : 169 ER 1158] , “statutes were required to be perfectly
                      precise and resort was not had to a reasonable construction of
                      the Act, and thereby criminals were often allowed to escape.
                      This is not the present mode of construing Acts of Parliament.

protection of trade marks, patent, copyright, prevention of deceptive

practices, implementation of any treaty or convention etc. The

an aura of proceedings, akin to proceedings in a Court of Law.

However the admissibility of the statements and/or documents

obtained is not any higher only because the proceedings are judicial

proceedings and the expression “evidence” has been used.            The

prosecution would still have to prove its case at the time of trial by

adducing evidence.   The so called ‘evidence’ in the inquiry is not the

same as evidence in a trial.     Documents would still have to be

tendered and proved at the time of trial.    Whether any documents

and/or statements obtained in course of investigation would at all be

admissible in evidence at the trial and if so, the extent to which they

would be relevant, would be decided by the Court trying the offence,

having regard to the applicable law.

                value which is embodied in the fundamental freedoms embedded in

                personal liberty would operate on the right to privacy. Any
                curtailment or deprivation of that right would have to take place
                under a regime of law. The procedure established by law must be

        the terminology of “compelling State interest” originated, a strict
        standard of scrutiny comprises two things—a “compelling State
        interest” and a requirement of “narrow tailoring” (narrow tailoring
        means that the law must be narrowly framed to achieve the objective).
        As a term, “compelling State interest” does not have definite contours
        in the US. Hence, it is critical that this standard be adopted with
        some clarity as to when and in what types of privacy claims it is to be
        used. Only in privacy claims which deserve the strictest scrutiny is the
        standard of compelling State interest to be used. As for others, the just,
        fair and reasonable standard under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2250">Article 21</a> will apply. When the
        compelling State interest standard is to be employed, must depend

that in enacting a post constitutional law the legislative intent could

not have been to violate any fundamental right.




</p><p id="p_1083">246.   In ascertaining the intention of the legislature the Court is to

examine two aspects, the meaning of the words and phrases used in

the statute and the purpose and object or the reason and spirit

pervading through the statute.

<p id="p_1084">247.   Legislative intention, that is the true legal meaning of an

enactment, is deduced by considering the meaning of the words used

in the enactment, in the light of any discernible purposes or object of

the enactment. When any question arises as to the meaning of any

provision in a statute, it is proper to read that provision in the context

of the intention of the legislature.    The intention of the Legislature

must be found by reading the statute as a whole.

<p id="p_1085">248.   A statute or any statutory provision must be construed and

interpreted in a manner that makes the statute effective and

operative on the principle expressed in the maxim ut res magis

valeat quam pereat and/or in other words, the principle that courts

while pronouncing on the constitutionality of a statute starts with the

presumption in favour of constitutionality and prefer a construction

which keeps the statute within the competence of the legislature.

interpretation    that      keeps   the   statute   in   conformity   with   the

fundamental rights.           Similarly, if a statute is capable of two

interpretations one of which violates the fundamental rights and the

other of which protects the fundamental rights the court would opt

for the latter.

this Court cannot alter that provision by its interpretation.         To do so,

would be to legislate, which this Court is not competent to do.              If a

provision is free from ambiguity or vagueness, and is clear, but

violative of a fundamental right, the Court will have to strike the

same down. Any omission in a statute cannot be filled in by Court as

to do that would amount to the legislation and not construction. The

Court cannot      fill in   casus omissus and language permitting Court

should avoid creating casus omissus where there is none.                 In the
