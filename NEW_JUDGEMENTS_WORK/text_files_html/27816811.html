       The present application has been filed by the Plaintiff
seeking liberty under Order 2 rule 2 to sue the Defendant for
similar reliefs as prayed for in the suit in respect of other


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">IA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 &amp; 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013         Page 1 of 75</span>
 trademarks of the Plaintiff which are being infringed by the
Defendant        and of which the                Plaintiff        does   not   have
knowledge at present but may become aware in the future.
</p>
<p id="p_2">       The Plaintiff has contended that the Plaintiff has filed
the present suit in respect of only five trademarks of the
Plaintiff which are being infringed by the Defendant. It is
contended that the Plaintiff is not aware if the Defendant is
infringing any other trademark of the Plaintiff. Liberty is
sought to sue the Defendant                      in future in respect of
trademarks that are not subject matter of the present suit and
in respect of which the Plaintiff is not aware if the Defendant
is infringing the same.
</p>
<p id="p_3">       The present suit is restricted to the trademarks that are
subject matter of the present suit. The Plaintiff has contended
that the Plaintiff is not aware if any other trademark is being
infringed by the Defendant. In case the Plaintiff becomes
aware subsequently that the Defendant is infringing any
other trademark of the Plaintiff, cause of action would accrue
to the Plaintiff from the date of such knowledge. In the said
circumstances the application is allowed and the liberty is
granted to the Plaintiff under Order 2 rule 2.

<p id="p_9">2.     The case of the Plaintiff is that the Plaintiff was
       formerly        known        as     Rampur       Distillery        and      was
       established in the year 1943. In the year 1999, the
       Plaintiff       launched          its   brand       under        the     house
       mark/trademark Radico.
</p>
<p id="p_10">3.     As per the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff has state-of-the-art
       bottling lines          and       had set     up some            well -know n
       trademarks. The Plaintiff is stated to have set up
       bottling plants in various states. The Plaintiff claims to
       have strong presence in the market.
</p>
<p id="p_11">4.     In    the     year     2005       the   Plaintiff      acquired        several

        (hereinafter referred to as BMSS). Deed of assignment
       dated 5.10.2005 was executed in favour of the Plaintiff.
       The assignment is stated to cover all the intellectual
       property residing in the said trademarks including
       copyrights in the Logos/legends of the trademarks and
       the        packaging       material      being       used         with      those
       trademarks. The Plaintiff also has registrations in its
       favour in respect of some of the trademarks.
</p>
<p id="p_12">5.     As per the Plaintiff, the trademarks were first adopted
       by the Plaintiff's predecessor in interest since the year
       1994        or    thereabouts          and    were         used     by       them
       continuously and uninterruptedly before the trademarks
       were assigned to the Plaintiff in 2005. Thereafter the
       Plaintiff claims to have used the said trademarks and
       labels in respect of alcoholic beverages continuously
       since        then     and       has     been       using          the      marks
       uninterruptedly to date.
</p>
<p id="p_13">6.     It    is    the     case   of    the    Plaintiff      that       though        the
       advertisement of alcoholic beverages is not allowed ,
       the Plaintiff has promoted the alcoholic beverages
       under the mark and their labels throughout the country.
       As per the Plaintiff by virtue of such long, continuous



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">IA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 &amp; 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013                 Page 5 of 75</span>
        and uninterrupted use, excellent quality and extensive
       promotion of the said trademarks, they have come to be
       associated exclusively with the Plaintiff in respect of
       alcoholic beverages. It is contended that the t rademarks
       being arbitrary marks for alcoholic beverages are thus
       liable to be afforded the highest degree of protection
       under the Trademarks Act, 1999.
</p>
<p id="p_14">7.     As per the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff became aware in the
       month        of    April      2012      that     the       Defendant   was
       manufacturing and marketing BRIHAN'S DANZ NO. 1
       WHISKY in bottles that had an identical trademark to
       the Plaintiff's trademark for an identical product being
       an alcoholic beverage.
</p>
<p id="p_15">8.     The Plaintiff issued a legal notice dated 26.04.2012 to
       the Defendant calling upon them to cease and desist
       from using the bottles bearing the Plaintiff's registered
       trademarks. It is contended that the Defendant failed to
       respond to the said notice. The Plaintiff again came
       across       products       manufactured           and      marketed     by
       Defendant         under the         trademark          BRIHMA'S        GOA
       imprinted on their labels for their alcoholi c beverage. It
       is contended that upon performing due diligence it was



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">IA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 &amp; 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013          Page 6 of 75</span>
        found that Defendant were also advertising other
       products identical to that of the Plaintiff's products. By
       notice dated 30.07.2013, the Plaintiff called upon the
       Defendant to immediately cease and desist from using
       infringing trademarks. The Plaintiff thereafter has filed
       the present suit

</p><p id="p_16">9.     The Defendant has in its defence contended that the
       suit of the Plaintiff's is barred by delay, laches and
       acquiescence. It is contended that the Plaintiff knew
       about the use of the disputed marks by BMSS and the
       use by the Defendant since the year 2008. It is
       contended that BMSS by deed of assignment dated
       16.12.2010          assigned        certain      trademarks   to     the
       Defendant. It is contended that the Defendant had
       acquired the said trademarks along with their goodwill
       and as such was entitled to use the said trademarks.
</p>
<p id="p_17">10.    The Defendant apart from specific defences raised to
       the 5 trademarks in issue have raised the common
       defence in respect of all five marks i.e. (i) that the
       excise authorities have approved the mark and label of
       the Defendant and as such Defendant is entitled to use
       the same, (ii) further that BMSS was using the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">IA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 &amp; 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013      Page 7 of 75</span>
        trademarks since the year 2008 and the Defendant has
       been using them since 2011 and as such the Plaintiff
       being aware of the user is not entitled to the relief of
       injunction (iii) the Defendant has also applied for
       registration and/or is the registered proprietor of some
       of the marks.
</p>
<p id="p_18">11.    Apart from the general pleas applicable to all the
       impugned trademarks, the Defendant has also raised
       trademark specific pleas.

</p><p id="p_20"> 12.    It is      contended by the              Defendant         that the   said
       "BRIHAN‟S DANZ NO. 1 WHISKY" trademark was
       assigned to the Defendant under a deed of assignment
       dated 16.12.2010 for valuable consideration. It is
       contended that by virtue of the said deed of assignment
       the Defendant is exclusively entitled to use the said
       trademark. It is contended that the Defendant has
       already filed an application for registration of the
       trademark, which is in process. It is contended that
       BMSS since 02.12.2008 and thereafter the Defendant
       since 21.9.2011 is continuously using the said Mark
       and as such is entitled to use the same.

<p id="p_21"> 13.    The case of the Plaintiff on the contra is that BMSS by
       deed of assignment dated 05.10.2005 assigned various
       trademarks         along with their goodwill for a sale
       consideration of Rupees 17.5 Crores. The trademark
       BRIHAN'S NO. 1 WHISKY was one such trademark.
       It is contended that the Defendant has adopted a
       deceptively similar trademark BRIHAN'S DANZ NO.
       1 WHISKY, the only distinction being the word 'Danz'.
       It is submitted that the Plaintiff acquired the entire right,
       title and interest in the said Mark through deed of
       assignment dated 05.10.2005.
</p>
<p id="p_22">14.    It is contended that the assignment of trademark
       BRIHAN'S DANZ NO. 1 WHISKY by BMSS to the
       Defendant is patently wrong and illegal and BMSS
       could not have assigned the said trademark to the
       Defendant in the year 2010 in view of the earlier
       assignment of BRIHAN'S NO. 1 WHISKY AND
       BRIHAN'S NO. 1 in favour of the Plaintiff along with
       all goodwill, common law rights, labels, logo etc.

</p><p id="p_23">15.    It is contended that the two marks BRIHAN'S DANZ
       NO. 1 WHISKY and BRIHAN'S NO. 1 WHISKY are
       deceptively similar and since the Plaintiff is the sole



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">IA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 &amp; 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013   Page 10 of 75</span>
        and exclusive proprietor through prior assignment and
       has continuous and uninterrupted use r since 2005, the
       Defendant cannot use a deceptively similar mark. It is
       further contended that the Defendant's label clearly
       shows the mala fide intention in adoption of the said
       Mark as the word DANZ is written in small and
       inconsequential lettering as compared to the w ords NO.

</p><p id="p_25"> 16.    The Defendant in the Written Statement has contended
       that the impugned trademark was initially assigned by
       BMSS to the Plaintiff under the Assignment Deed
       dated 25.10.2005. It is contended that thereafter as the
       Plaintiff was not interested in acquiring the said
       trademark, therefore the Plaintiff agreed to reassign the
       said trademark in favour of BMSS vide letter dated
       July 2006. It is contended that the reassignment of
       trademark in favour of BMSS was further confirmed
       through the emails exchanged between the Plaintiff and
       BMSS. It is contended that after the assignment of the
       same in favour of BMSS on 03.07.2006, the Plaintiff
       never used the trademark either in the form of label or
       word per se.
</p>
<p id="p_26">17.    It is contended that after getting the reassignment of the
       said Mark, BMSS assigned the same in favour of the
       Defendant under the Deed of Assignment of 2010 and
       as such the Defendant claims to have become the
       owner of the said trademark.
</p>
<p id="p_27">18.    The Plaintiff has contended that though there were
       some discussions in the year 2006 between the Plaintiff
       and BMSS for the reassignment of the said Mark,



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">IA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 &amp; 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013   Page 12 of 75</span>
        however these never fructified and the mark was never
       reassigned to BMSS. It is contended that the Defendant
       has failed to show any Re-assignment Deed, assigning
       the mark back to B MSS. It is contended that the letter
       dated 03.07.2006 was a communication between the
       Plaintiff and BMSS which further stipulated that the
       parties would be entering into a Re-assignment Deed. It
       is contended that the email exchanged in 2011 rather
       confirmed the fact that the reassignment did not take
       place.
</p>
<p id="p_28">19.    It is submitted by the Plaintiff that since there is an
       admission that the Plaintiff was assigned the Mark by
       BMSS         in     2005       and     thereafter          there   was      no
       reassignment back to BMSS, the 2010 Assignment
       Deed under which the Defendant claims to have
       acquired rights is illegal and cannot be enforced. It is
       thus contended that the very adoption by BMSS and the
       subsequent         assignment         to the      Defendant        and the
       adoption by the Defendant is dishonest and in violation
       of the rights of the Plaintiff.

       BMSS         applied      for      registration     of     the   trademark
       BRIHAN'S GOA. On 20.07.2005 the said trademark
       was registered in favour of BMSS. On 29.05.2006, the

       contended that on 26.11.2009 rectification was filed in

        contended that the Defendant was using the mark
       BRIHMA'S GOA and not BRIHAN'S GOA in a
       different style. It is contended that the two marks are
       not deceptively similar, further it is contended that the

<p id="p_32">22.    The Plaintiff has contended that mere pendency of the
       rectification proceedings filed by a 3 rd party does not
       disentitled the Plaintiff from enforcing its rights against
       the Defendant. It is contended that the two marks and
       labels are deceptively similar and likely to cause
       confusion. It is contended that even geographical marks
       are entitled to protection. It is contended that the mark
       and the label used by the Defendant is identical to that
       of the Plaintiff and has been adopted to mislead the
       public. It is submitted by the Plaintiff that there are
       certain disputes that arose with BMSS in the year 2009
       for the use of the mark GOA by BMS S and some
       settlement terms were proposed but they were never
       finalized. It is contended that the emails relied upon by
       the Defendant further go on to show that BMSS was
       seeking permission of the Plaintiff to do certain acts for


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">IA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 &amp; 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013      Page 16 of 75</span>
        a limited purpose thereby acknowledging the Plaintiff
       to be the owner of the GOA trademarks. It is submitted
       that the said permission was never granted to BM SS. It
       is submitted that since BMSS and the Plaintiff shared a
       unique relationship, the discussion was being carried
       on but that would not entitle the Defendant to claim
       any benefit of the said discussion.
</p>
<p id="p_33">23.    It is contended by the Plaintiff, that the Plaintiff
       through its Assignor BMSS had been continuously
       using the mark GOA since 1994 and because of long
       extensive and continuous use of the said trademark , the
       consuming public associated the product of the Plaintiff
       bearing the trademark BRIHAN‟S GOA and the GOA
       LABEL with the Plaintiff. It is contended that the label
       of the Defendant is deceptively similar.
</p>
<p id="p_34">24.    It is contended by the Defendant, that the Defendant
       was the owner of the said trademark by virtue of the
       assignment by BMSS in the year 2010. It is submitted
       that the label NOVA GOA was approved by the excise
       authorities on 15.06.2009 and the Defendant was using
       the said label since 21.09.2011. It is submitted that the
       Plaintiff was aware of the use of the said Mark.

<p id="p_35"> 25.    It is contended by the Plaintiff that the Defendant's
       label was a colorable imitation of the Plaintiff's label
       amounting to infringement of copyright and is also
       likely to mislead the consuming public. It is submitted
       by the Plaintiff that the Defendant was relying on
       unsigned Minutes of Meeting and one-sided emails to
       try to mislead the Court. It is submitted that from the
       documents filed by the Defendant, it was clear that
       BMSS was seeking the Plaintiff's permission to do
       certain acts for a limited purpose. Further, it is
       contended that the said documents prima facie show
       that BMSS was acknowledging that the Plaintiff was
       the owner of the GOA trademark.
</p>
<p id="p_36">26.    It is submitted by the Plaintiff that the mark GOA was
       an essential feature of the mark NOVA GOA and
       therefore violates the rights of the Plaintiff.

       Statement that            on     04.06.1976 BMSS              applied for
       registration        of     the     said      trademark        BRIHAN‟S
       DOCTOR              BRANDY           and        claimed    users     since
       01.06.1972. O n 01.02.1978, the Mark was advertised in
       the trademark journal with the disclaimer that the
       registration shall give no right to the exclusive use of
       the word DOCTOR. On 29.07.1978 the mark was
       registered in favour of BMSS. On 29.05.2006, the
       Plaintiff became the subsequent proprietor. It is further
       contended by the Defendant that the registration of the
       Mark is subject to the disclaimer of the word DOCTOR
       and the Plaintiff does not have the exclusive right to
       use the word DOCTOR.
</p>
<p id="p_39">28.    It is contended that the Defendant was using a different

       BRANDY. It is contended that the use of the said label
       by     the    Defendant          with     the    registered    trademark
       BRIHMA‟S in no way amounts to infringement of the
       registered trademark BRIHAN'S DOCTOR (word per

       BRIHAN'S AND BRIHMA‟S are distinct and different.

<p id="p_40"> 29.    It is contended that the label used by the Defendant is
       distinct from the label used by the Plaintiff. It is
       contended that in the year 2009 some disputes arose
       between BMSS and the Plaintiff with regard to the use
       of    the     labels     BRIHMA‟S            ORIGINAL      DOCTOR
       BRANDY. It is contended that the disputes were
       resolved in the meeting held on 20.09.2009 and
       recorded in the Minutes of Meeting and according to
       the said Minutes of Meeting the labels were amended
       by BMSS to the satisfaction of the Plaintiff.

       objection or legal action against BMSS on the sale of
       the two brands BRIHMA‟S GOA and BRIHMA‟S

                     the Plaintiff have been adopted by the
                     Defendant, the fact that the get-up, packing
                     and other writing or marks on the goods or
                     on the packets shows marked differences, or
                     indicate clearly a trade origin different from
                     that of the registered proprietor of the mark

       iv.          Mere delay in filing                        of     a    suit      for
                   infringement is not fatal. 3

       v.          Phonetic similarity constitutes an important
                   index of whether a mark bears a deceptive
                   or misleading similarity to another. 4

      vi.          The Court must consider the usage of words
                   in India, the manner in which a w ord w ould
                   be written in Indian languages and the
                   similarity of pronunciation if the rival marks
                   are used.5

                   be considered with reference to the ear as
                   well as the eye. 5

    viii.          The rival marks have to be compared as a
                   whole. The two competing marks must be
                   judged both by their look and by their sound.
                   All the surrounding circumstances must be
                   considered.7

      ix.          Where the similarity between the Plaintiff's
                   and the Defendant's mark is so close either
                   visually, phonetically or otherwise and the

                   imitation, no further evidence is required to
                   establish that the Plaintiff's rights are

               with goods manufactured or sold by him or

               proof of the necessary facts, prevent an

<p id="p_52">37.    Rejecting the plea of abandonment of a mark because
       of addition and alteration to the original mark, the
       Bombay High Court in the case of SKOL B REWERIES
       (SUPRA ) laid down as under:
</p>
<p id="p_53">       19.     Mr. Bookwala contended that the Plaintiff
               had abandoned the registered label mark.
               Relying upon paragraph 8 of the plaint read
               with Exhibit "E" thereto he submitted that


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">IA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 &amp; 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013   Page 27 of 75</span>
                the mark actually used by the Plaintiff was
               entirely different from the registered mark.
               The registered mark he submitted had never
               been used and must therefore be deemed to
               have been abandoned. Exhibit "E" to the
               plaint is a photograph of a bottle with the
               label    affixed     thereon.   The    words
               "HAYWARDS 5000" form not only an
               important but a predominant part of the
               label. These letters and numerals are in the
               centre of the label and are about four times
               the size of the letters and numerals of the
               other material on the label. Reliance
               however is placed on the fact that the label
               in addition thereto contains considerable
               other material. Firstly the word PREMIUM
               is added to the registered mark. Below the
               mark "HAYWARDS 5000" are the words
               "PREMIU M SUPER STRONG BEER".
</p><p id="p_54">               Below these words is the device of a star
               within a circle and below the same the
               quantity is mentioned as 650 ml. Above the
               mark are the words "THE ORIGINAL". The
               use     of     this    additional    material,
               Mr.Bookwalla contended, established that it
               is not the registered trademark that has been
               used by the Plaintiff but another trademark
               altogether.
</p>
<p id="p_55">       20.     The added material in the present case does
               not indicate that the Plaintiff has abandoned
               the registered mark or the word mark
               "HAYWARDS 5000". Nor does it indicate
               that the label on the bottle containing the
               Plaintiffs product does not constitute the use


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">IA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 &amp; 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013   Page 28 of 75</span>
                of the registered label mark. The submission
               that any variation or deviation from the
               registered mark does not constitute use of
               the registered mark is not well founded.
               Indeed in most cases the label affixed on the
               products or packages containing the
               products would contain in addition to the
               trademark, registered or unregistered, other
               material. The added material may be of the
               proprietors volition as well as on account of
               statutory compulsion. For instance the
               labels may contain the name of the entity
               packing/bottling the goods, the name and
               address of the manufacturer and the quantity
               of the contents of the package upon which
               the label is affixed. The label may also
               contain certification obtained by the
               manufacturer       and     the     proprietors
               compliance with statutory requirements
               whether compulsorily required to be stated
               or not. If Mr. Bookwalla's submission is
               accepted it would lead to the absurd result
               that the mere introduction/mention of such
               material would lead to the conclusion that
               the registered mark has not been used and
               consequently must be deemed to have been
               abandoned by the proprietor thereof. So
               long as the registered mark is used in
               substantially the same manner in w hich it is
               registered it must be deemed/considered to
               constitute the use of the registered mark
               itself. Where the use of a mark, registered or
               unregistered, is apparent the mere addition
               of material on the label or other material on
               which it appears would not lead to the

                conclusion that the mark has not thereby
               been used. In either case the use of the mark
               must be apparent to wit, the Court must be
               satisfied that despite the added material the
               trademark has been used. The use of the
               mark must be as a trademark and must be
               obvious/perceptible. The mark must not be
               lost as a result of the added material for then
               it is not to the use of the mark for the
               purpose of an infringement or a passing of
               action.

<p id="p_66"> 41.    It is thus clear that there cannot be two assignments of
       a mark. If two assignments of a mark were permissible,
       then there would be confusion with regard to the origin
       of the goods or services. The basic principle underlying
       protection of intellectual property rights is that the
       purchaser of the goods should be clear as to the source
       of the goods. If the source of the goods is unclear or
       there is confusion as to the origin/source of the goods
       in the mind of the ultimate user than the very concept
       of protection of intellectual property right would be
       defeated.
</p>
<p id="p_67">42.    It is more in the interest of the general public than in
       the interest of the proprietors of the mark that the re
       should be no confusion as to the origin/source of the
       goods. If two assignments of a mark were permissible
       then there would be confusion in the mind of the
       ultimate user as to who is the proprietor of the goods.
       The consumer would never be certain about the quality
       of the goods sought to be purchased.
</p>
<p id="p_68">43.    Keeping in view the interest of ultimate consumers, the
       courts have laid down the principle of one mark one
       proprietor. However there may be situations where a

        proprietor of a mark being unaware of the prior mark
       honestly adopts a mark which is identical or similar to
       the earlier mark and puts the same to use, he may, in a
       passing of action, be                 entitled, in the         facts    and
       circumstances of the case, to set up the defence of
       honest concurrent use. Though in an infringement
       action of a registered mark, this defence may not be
       available.
</p>
<p id="p_69">44.    Where there is a dishonest adoption in the first instance,
       the period of use is of no consequence. If it prima facie
       appears that the adoption of a mark was dishonest then
       even if the Defendant has been using the mark for a
       considerably long period of time it would be of no
       consequence even in a passing off action. What is
       relevant is whether the adoption was honest or not.
       Only where the adoption of the mark is honest that the
       Defendant          would       be     entitled,      subject   to      other
       conditions being satisfied, to set up the defence of
       honest and concurrent user. Where the adoption of the
       mark is not honest then the defence of honest and

</p>
<p id="p_105">67.     Comparison of the two Assignment Deeds shows that
        the Assignor BMSS has sought to assign the same mark
        to both the Plaintiff and the Defendant. Once the
        Assignment in favour of the Plaintiff was complete, the
        Assignor did not have the power to give what was
        already given to the Plaintiff and was no longer it's to
        give. Further, the 2010 Assignment Deed to the extent
        it assigns the marks already assigned w ould be contrary

        to Section 40 of the Trademarks Act, 1999 as it results
       in the creation of concurrent exclusive rights in more
       than one person, which would be likely to deceive and
       cause confusion.
</p>
<p id="p_106">68.    In view of the law as laid down by the CLASSIC
       E QUIPMENTS CASE (SUPRA ) once the 2005 Assignment
       Deed was executed, BMSS ceased to have any right,
       title or interest in the trademarks assigned and as such
       could not re-assign them by the 2010 Assignment Deed.
       The 2010 Assignment Deed to the extent it seeks to
       assign the trademarks already assigned would be
       invalid and inoperative.
</p>
<p id="p_107">69.    The Defendant has not denied the execution and
       validity of the 2005 Assignment Deed on the contrary
       there is an admission that the same has been duly
       execute and it conveys the title in favour of the
       Plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_108">70.    The trademarks assigned by the 2005 Assignment Deed
       to the Plaintiff and relevant for the present controversy
       are BRIHANS PREMIUM WHISKY, BRIHANS NO.
       1 WHISKY, BRIHAN‟S NO. 1, BRIHAN‟S WHISKY,
       BRIHAN‟S PREMIUM BLUE WHISKY, BRIHANS

       BRIHAN‟S GOA SPECIAL DRY GIN.
</p>
<p id="p_109">71.    Once the abovementioned trademarks were assigned to
       the Plaintiff, BMSS could not have adopted, used or
       assigned, identical or deceptively similar trademarks.
       The      2010     Assignment          Deed seeks to assign the
       following trademarks to the Defendant that are claimed
       to be identical or deceptively similar: BRIHAN‟S
       PREMIU M BLUE, BRIHAN‟S DANZ NO. 1, NOVA
       GOA PREMIXED DRY GIN, BRIHMA‟S GOA, and
       BRIHMA‟S ORIGINAL DOCTOR BRANDY .
</p>
<p id="p_110">72.    Another important factor to be noticed in the 2010
       Assignment Deed is that for the impugned marks the
       user claimed by BMSS is that of 2008 onwards. From
       the own showing of the Defendant the adoption of the
       deceptively similar marks are much after the adoption
       of the mark by the Plaintiff coupled with the fact that
       the Plaintiff has purchased the said marks along with
       their goodwill and is entitled to take benefit of the user
       of the predecessor i.e. of BMSS. Since BMSS prior to
       the assignment of 2005 has claimed to been using the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">IA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 &amp; 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013   Page 47 of 75</span>
        marks for a considerably long period of time and has
       assigned the said marks along with goodwill to the
       Plaintiff, the benefit of the said user would inure to the
       Plaintiff      who       had     for    a    valuable      consideration
       purchased the said marks along with their goodwill.
</p>
<p id="p_111">73.    The adoption of the impugned marks by the Defendant
       coupled with the user of its predecessor i.e. BMSS
       would be that of 2008 or so, which is subsequent to the
       adoption of the marks by the Plaintiff coupled with the
       user of its predecessor.
</p>
<p id="p_112">74.    The fact that the 2010 Assignment Deed refers to the
       status of application for some of the impugned marks
       as "to be applied" and for other impugned marks the
       date as 04.12.2008, prima facie shows a conscious
       decision on the part BMSS and Defendant not to refer
       to any prior user as it was clear to them that the user of
       BMSS prior to the said period had been assigned to the
       Plaintiff. If there was any residual rights remaining in
       BMSS, then BMSS would not have shown the date of
       adoption of the said marks as 2008 rather it would have
       claimed user since 1974 or so.

<p id="p_113"> 75.    It is settled law that for comparing two marks for their
       deceptive similarity, the two marks as a whole have to
       be considered. The mark or words comprised in a mark
       cannot be split-up for the purposes of comparison. The
       test is, if the two competing marks when taken as a
       whole and compared, then whether there is any
       deceptive similarity between the two or not. The test is
       not that the words in the mark be split up to ascertain
       whether there are any dissimilarities or not. The rival
       marks have to be compared as a whole. The two
       competing marks must be judged both by their look and
       by their sound. All the surrounding circumstances must
       be      considered        (AMRITDHARA               PHARM ACY        CASE

       (SUPRA )).
</p>
<p id="p_114">76.    Even if some words comprised in a mark are generic,
       still    the     mark       taken      as     a    whole       can   attain
       distinctiveness of the product of the proprietor. For
       example the words „Premium‟ and „Whisky‟ may be
       generic words but when coupled with the other words
       like     BRIHAN‟S then the                  mark as        a   whole     i.e.
       BRIHAN‟S PREMIUM WHISKY w ould be capable of
       distinctiveness. More so when the mark is a registered
       mark.

<p id="p_115"> 77.    Concerted effort was made by the Defendant to point
       out to the various dissimilarities in the impugned marks.
       It was contended that there was difference in the colour
       of the background of the label, in one there was a
       single tree and in the other there was a double tree, the
       picture of the Castle was different, different font was
       being used, the word blue was missing and there were
       other visual dissimilarities.
</p>
<p id="p_116">78.    If the essential features of the trademark of the Plaintiff
       have been adopted by the Defendant, the fact that the
       get-up, packing and other writing or marks on the
       goods or on the packets shows marked differences, or
       indicate clearly a trade origin different from that of the
       registered proprietor of the mark, would still be
       immaterial (AMERICAN HOME PRODUCTS (SUPRA )).
       Broad and essential features of the two are to be
       considered. They should not be placed side by side to
       find out if there are any marked differences in the
       design and get up.
</p>
<p id="p_117">79.    The test laid down by the Supreme Court is that the two
       competing marks are not to be kept side -by-side to
       ascertain whether there are any dissimilarities but the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">IA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 &amp; 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013   Page 50 of 75</span>
        true test is that of an imperfect recollection of a person
       of average intelligence. Competing marks have to be
       compared keeping in mind an unwary purchaser of
       average         intelligence        and      imperfect           recollection
       (AM RITDHARA PHARMACY CASE (SUPRA )).
</p>
<p id="p_118">80.    If the above tests were to be applied to the impugned
       marks and the labels adopted by the Defendant, then it
       is clear that the test is fully satisfied in the facts of the
       present case.
</p>
<p id="p_119">81.    The plea raised by the Defendant that the Plaintiff is
       not entitled to any injunction as there is delay in
       approaching the court is not sustainable. The Plaintiff
       has contended that the Plaintiff on becoming aware of
       the     adoption        of    the     marks       by       the    Defendant
       immediately issued the cease and desist notice and
       approached the court. Further, it is contended that the
       adoption of the similar mark by B MSS was itself
       dishonest and the alleged subsequent assignment to the
       Defendant in 2010 was also malafide. In the facts of the
       present case, BMSS being the assignors of the mark to
       the Plaintiff in 2005 cannot claim that the alleged
       adoption of identical or deceptively similar marks in



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">IA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 &amp; 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013            Page 51 of 75</span>
        2008 was honest and as such cannot be permitted to set
       up the defence of honest and concurrent user. It is
       further contended by the Plaintiff that the Plaintiff
       became aware of the use by the Defendant in 2012 and
       issued a cease and desist notice to the Defendant in
       2012 who failed to respond to the same. Thereafter , it
       is contended that the products were not visible in the
       market and therefore the Plaintiff did not take any
       action. Plaintiff again came across the infringing
       products in July 2013 when the second cease and desist
       notice was issued and the present suit was filed. It is
       denied that the Plaintiff was aware of the disputed
       labels since 2008.
</p>
<p id="p_120">82.    The contention of the Defendant, that both parties i.e.
       BMSS and the Plaintiff were getting their products
       manufactured under similar trademarks and selling
       them through the same channel of suppliers and as such
       there was acquiescence on the part of the Plaintiff, is
       not sustainable without proof of the same. The mere
       fact that the bottling plant was common would not ipso
       facto imply that the Plaintiff were aware that BMSS
       was using an identical mark or that the Plaintiff had
       agreed to BMSS adopting a similar mark. Since the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_68">IA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 &amp; 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013   Page 52 of 75</span>
        Plaintiff has denied this fact and there is nothing prima
       facie on record to show that the Plaintiff consented to
       the same, it is a plea that would require the parties to
       lead     evidence        and      would       be    considered     at     an
       appropriate stage.
</p>
<p id="p_121">83.    It is an admitted position that the Plaintiff acquired
       rights under the 2005 Assignment Deed and BMSS had
       divested itself of all its rights under the said Deed.
       BMSS had also agreed not to use the Marks assigned to
       the Plaintiff or to use Marks that are deceptively
       similar to the Marks assigned to the Plaintiff. The plea
       that BMSS was also using a similar mark to that of the
       mark that was assigned would only go on to show that
       BMSS was using the mark in breach of the 2005
       Assignment Deed. It had agreed not to use any
       deceptively similar mark to the mark assigned to the
       Plaintiff. BMSS, itself being the Assignor of the m arks
       cannot set up a defence of an honest concurrent user.
       On the other hand, it would go on to show that the
       adoption of the marks that were deceptively similar to
       the marks assigned was dishonest. The fact that the
       mark was adopted dishonestly and put to use would not




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_69">IA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 &amp; 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013         Page 53 of 75</span>
        entitle the Defendant or its predecessor to claim the
       defence of honest concurrent user.
</p>
<p id="p_122">84.    Since BMSS was itself the assignor of the marks, it
       cannot claim that it adopted the deceptively similar
       marks without the knowledge of the existence of the
       marks of the plaintiff. The Plea that the Plain tiff by its
       silence and inaction permitted the marks of BMSS to
       grow cannot come to the aid of BMSS as the adoption
       was not without the knowledge of the marks of the
       Plaintiff. BMSS adopted deceptively similar marks
       with full knowledge and at its own risk. Since the
       adoption of the deceptively similar marks by BMSS
       was with the knowledge of the marks of the Plaintiff,
       the defendant being an assignee of the deceptively
       similar marks from BMSS cannot thus claim to be in a
       better position that its assignor.

<p id="p_123">BRIHAN'S DANZ NO. 1 WHISKY

</p><p id="p_124">85.    The defence raised by the Defendant in respect of
       BRIHAN‟S DANZ NO. 1 WHISKY is not sustainable.
       The contention that BRIHAN‟S was always secured
       and there is a disclaimer with regard to the words NO.
       1 WHISKY and that the Plaintiff is not using the word


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_70">IA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 &amp; 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013   Page 54 of 75</span>
        DANZ is also not sustainable. The Defendant is
       attempting to dissect the trademark into different words.
       The test is that the mark as a whole has to be
       considered. The mark is not to be dissected into its
       various components to see whether individually there is
       any similarity or distinctiveness. What is relevant is not
       to dissect the words but the trademarks as a whole
       along with its trade dress, layouts, color scheme, and
       other components that go into making a mark including
       logo, label, ticket etc. have to be considered. One has to
       see whether the mark when it is examined as a whole is
       capable of distinguishing the goods or services of the
       proprietor of the mark from the goods and services of
       the others. If the test is satisfied then the mark as a
       whole       would       be    a    distinctive       mark    capable     of
       protection. When the mark of the Plaintiff BRIHAN‟S
       NO. 1 WHISKY is looked at as a whole, it is prima
       facie clear that the mark is distinctive and thus capable
       of protection.

       The Defendant claims that the mark BRIHAN‟S DANZ
       NO. 1 WHISKY was assigned to it by BMSS.                               The

       WHISKY with the word DANZ in a much smaller font.
       The addition of the w ord DAN Z, in a much smaller
       font, has not made any substantial difference to the
       mark and it continues to remain deceptively similar.
       When the mark of the Defendant's BRIHAN‟S DANZ
       NO. 1 WHISKY is compared with the trademark of the
       Plaintiff's BRIHAN‟S NO. 1 WHISKY, and the test as
       laid down by the Supreme Court in AMRITDHARA
       PHARMACY CASE (SUPRA ) of an unwary purchaser of
       average        intelligence       and imperfect            recollection is
       applied, it is apparent that the mark of the Defendant is
       deceptively similar to that of the Plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_126">87.    The      contention of the             Defendant           that there was
       disclaimer to the use of the words "No. 1 &amp; Whisky"
       and that the Plaintiff has changed the labels from the
       ones that were assigned by BMSS does not further the
       case      of   the     Defendant.         The     Plaintiff    being     the
       proprietor of a mark or logo or a label is also entitled to
       use the marks, logos or labels that are modifications,
       variation       of    the    same.       The     contention      that    the
       registered label is not w hat is being put to use and that
       what was assigned is not being used also does not merit

        any consideration. The variations in the mark that is
       assigned and mark that is being presently used are very
       insignificant and minor. The mark when taken as a
       whole shows that what is being used is very similar to
       the one that was assigned. Further, for the plea of
       passing off, the registration would not be relevant what
       is relevant is the user.
</p>
<p id="p_127">88.    It has been laid down in the CADBURY INDIA L IM ITED
       (SUPRA ) that the disclaimer on a registration certificate
       does not prohibit, in any manner, the right given to a
       person to bring a passing off action in respect of a trade
       mark       which       though       registered,          but     contains       a
       disclaimer with regard to any portion thereof. The
       Supreme Court in ASHOK CHANDRA RAKHIT (SUPRA )
       laid down that the dis claimer is only for the purposes of
       the Act. It does not affect the rights of the proprietor,
       the special advantages which the Act gives to the
       proprietor by reason of the registration of his trade
       mark do not extend to the parts or matters which he
       disclaims. In short, the disclaimed parts or matters are
       not     within       the    protection        of     the       statute.    That
       circumstance,          however,        does        not     mean     that    the

        matters would not be protected otherwise than under
       the Act. If the proprietor has acquired any right by long
       user of those parts or matters in connection with goods

       Disclaimer does not affect those rights in any way.

<p id="p_128">89.    Since the two marks BRIHAN‟S NO. 1 WHISKY and
       BRIHAN‟S DANZ NO. 1 WHISKY are deceptively
       similar and the Plaintiff is admittedly the prior user of
       the     trademark        BRIHAN‟S            NO.     1     WHISKY,       the

       BLUE WHISKY, it is admitted by the Defendant, that
       the said mark was assigned by BMSS to the Plaintiff.
       What is contended by the Defendant is that the Plaintiff
       thereafter reassigned the mark back to B MSS. This
       contention        presupposes          the    validity     of   the   2005
       Assignment Deed. It presupposes that the deed was


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">IA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 &amp; 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013         Page 58 of 75</span>
        duly executed and all rights of BMSS in the said
       trademark were duly conveyed to the Plaintiff. What
       has to be seen thereafter is whether there was any re-
       conveyance or reassignment by the Plaintiff back to
       BMSS or not?
</p>
<p id="p_131">91.    The Defendant has not placed on record any deed of
       reassignment of the said mark in favour of BMSS by
       the     Plaintiff. Reliance           is      placed       on letter   dated
       03.07.2006. The said letter only states that the Plaintiff
       has      agreed      to    reassign        the    brand        "BRIHAN‟S
       PREMIU M BLUE WHISKY" to BMSS and would be
       entering into a supplemental agreement towards this. It
       further states that a draft agreement would be sent
       shortly. It is not the case of the Defendant that any
       Agreement          or     Deed     of      Re-assignment         was     ever
       executed between the Plaintiff and BMSS. The letter on
       the contrary confirms that the Plaintiff had become the
       owner/proprietor              of        the      mark.         Once        the
       assignment/conveyance was complete in favour of the
       Plaintiff the only way that BMSS could have adopted
       the mark was by way of a Re -assignment. The
       Defendant has neither pleaded nor relied upon any
       Deed of Re-assignment. As there is no Deed of Re-

<p id="p_132">        assignment so there is no question of B MSS adopting
       the same mark or assigning it to the Defendant by the
       2010 Assignment Deed.
</p>
<p id="p_133">92.    Even in the 2010 Assignment Deed, BMSS has stated
       that the registration of the said mark is still to be
       applied. BMSS, having assigned the mark to the
       Plaintiff and thereafter entering into negotiation with
       the Plaintiff for reassignment of the mark back to itself,
       can never take the plea of honest concurrent user. Since
       BMSS could not have adopted the mark there is no
       question of BMSS thereafter reassigning the mark to
       the Defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_134">93.    The contention of the Defendant that the Plaintiff is not
       entitled to an injunction as the Plaintiff has neither used
       the label nor the mark BRIHAN‟S PREMIUM BLUE
       WHISKY is not sustainable. It is an admitted position
       that the Plaintiff had purchased the said mark along
       with its goodwill from BMSS. BMSS ha d assigned the
       mark to the Plaintiff and agreed not to use any mark
       identical or similar to the marks assigned. Further , the
       Plaintiff has contended that it has been using the said
       mark uninterruptedly. Whether the Plaintiff has in fact



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">IA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 &amp; 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013   Page 60 of 75</span>

       which would be looked into after the parties have led
       that evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_135">94.    As per the Plaintiff the adoption of the mark by BMSS
       and the Defendant is not honest. It is contended that the
       Plaintiff was originally using the label with a windmill
       which was subsequently changed to a castle and the
       Defendant also changed their label to a castle which
       prima      facie establishes that the                 adoption by the
       Defendant was not honest.
</p>
<p id="p_136">95.    Further, the defence of the Defendant that the Plaintiff
       is    using       the    trademark         BRIHAN‟S         PREMIUM
       WHISKY and not                  BRIHAN‟S PREMIUM                BLUE
       WHISKY amounts to an admission that the Plaintiff is
       using the trademark BRIHAN‟S PREMIUM WHISKY.
       The trademark BRIHAN‟S PREMIU M WHISKY and
       BRIHAN‟S PREMIUM BLUE WHISKY are also
       deceptively similar. The use of the mark BRIHAN‟S
       PREMIU M BLUE WHISKY by the Defendant is likely
       to create an impression in the mind of the consumers
       that the proprietor of both the marks i.e. BRIHAN‟S
       PREMIU M             BLUE          WHISKY             and   BRIHAN‟S

        PREMIU M WHISKY is the same. Since the Plaintiff is
       admittedly the prior user of the trademark BRIHAN‟S

       the law as laid dow n in the cases of HI -T ECH PIPES
       L IM ITED (SUPRA ) and SUNDAR NAGAR ASSOCIATION
       (SUPRA ), a name originally purely geographical in its
       significance        may become             so associated with the
       Plaintiff‟s goods or services that its use on its own as a
       trade mark or name without adequate distinction will
       amount to passing off, especially if it is used in
       conjunction with get-up or other indicia similar to that
       used by the Plaintiff.

<p id="p_142">100. The word GOA by itself may not be capable of

       mark BRIHAN‟S the                    mark      prima       facie   becomes
       distinctive. The fact that the BMSS had adopted the
       word BRIHMA‟S as a prefix to the word GOA shows
       that it was aware that it could not us e the mark GOA
       with the prefix BRIHAN‟S as the same would be
       deceptively similar. The words BRIHAN‟S GOA and
       BRIHMA‟S GOA are also deceptively similar. The fact
       that the Defendant is claiming to be a successor from
       BMSS and is not claiming any independent right to the
       said mark, prima facie establishes that the Defendant
       cannot also use a deceptively similar mark.

</p>
<p id="p_144">102. However as regards the mark NOVA GOA of the

       The trade dress, getup, layout, colour scheme etc. of
       the two rival marks BRIHAN‟S GOA and NOVA GOA
       is also not similar.

<p id="p_145">103. Prima facie the Plaintiff has not been able to show that
       the mark NOVA GOA being used by the Defendant is

       would be deceptively similar. The words BRIHAN‟S
       DOCTOR BRANDY                      and BRIHMA‟S               ORIGINAL
       DOCTOR BRANDY are also deceptively similar.

<p id="p_151">108. The fact that the Defendant is claiming to be a

       independent         right to the said Mark, prima                       facie
       establishes that the Defendant cannot also use a
       deceptively similar mark.
</p>
<p id="p_152">109. Since the Plaintiff admittedly is the prior user of the

        BRIHAN‟S             DOCTOR           BRANDY               are   admittedly
       assigned to the Plaintiff. The fact that only for these
       two brands the prefix BRIHMA‟S is used implies that
       the BMSS and Defendant were aware that these two
       marks could not be used in their original form. This
       prima facie shows a deliberate attempt to circumvent
       the stipulation in the 2005 Assignment Deed.
</p>
<p id="p_154">111. The         prefixes       BRIHAN‟S             and     BRIHMA‟S              are
       deceptively similar. Comparing the rival marks as a
       whole (i.e. BRIHAN‟S GOA v/s BRIHMA‟S GOA &amp;
       BRIHAN‟S            DOCTOR            BRANDY           v/s       BRIHMA‟S
       ORIGINAL DOCTOR BRANDY) it is clear that the
       said two prefixes would not make much of a difference
       to the marks as a whole and that the two rival marks
       would continue to be deceptively similar.
</p>
<p id="p_155">112. Further, the email of 2009 exchanged between the
       Plaintiff and BMSS, relied upon by the Defendant,
       goes to show that BMSS was also aware that it could
       not use the Mark BRIHAN‟S GOA and BRIHAN‟S
       DOCTOR BRANDY without the permission of the
       Plaintiff. The email indicates that the BMSS was
       seeking permission for                 manufacture           of a    limited



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_84">IA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 &amp; 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013            Page 67 of 75</span>
        number of cases and was also negotiating for amending
       its label to the satisfaction of the Plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_156">113. Though the Minutes of Meeting dated 20.02.2009
       relied upon by the Defendant are disputed by the
       Plaintiff, they prima facie show that the Plaintiff was
       even in the year 2009 objecting to the adoption of the
       two similar marks by BMSS. The fact that BMSS under
       whom the Defendant is claimed to have acquired rights
       had entered into negotiations with the Plaintiff prima
       facie establishes that even BMSS was aware that the
       rival Marks were deceptively similar and it could not
       use the said Marks without the permission of the
       Plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_157">114. There is nothing on record filed by the Defendant to
       show, that the Plaintiff ever expressly agreed to the
       user by BMSS of the two impugned marks and if so on
       what        conditions.         However,           prima   facie     the
       email/minutes amount to an acknowledgment on the
       part of BMSS that the Plaintiff was the proprietor of
       the said Marks and BMSS could not have used the two
       impugned Marks without the permission and consent of
       the Plaintiff.

<p id="p_158"> 115. Where a trader adopts a deceptively similar mark being
       fully aware of the mark of another trader, then he does
       so at his own risk. He cannot be permitted to set up the
       defence of honest concurrent user who has adopted the
       deceptively similar mark being unaware of the earlier
       mark.
</p>
<p id="p_159">116. Further, the Bombay High Court in the case of SKOL
       B REWERIES (SUPRA ) laid down that so long as the
       registered mark is used in substantially the same
       manner        in    which        it    is   registered      it    must     be
       deemed/considered              to     constitute      the   use    of    the
       registered mark itself. Where the use of a mark,
       registered or unregistered, is appa rent the mere addition
       of material on the label or other material on which it
       appears would not lead to the conclusion that the mark
       has not thereby been used. In either case, the use of the
       mark must be apparent to wit, the Court must be
       satisfied that despite the added material the trademark
       has been used. The use of the mark must be as a
       trademark          and    must        be    obvious/perceptible.         The
       mark must not be lost as a result of the added material
       for then it is not to the use of the mark for the purpose
       of an infringement or a passing of action.

<p id="p_160"> 117. The plea of the Defendant that sale of liquor is licensed
       and it can be marketed only if there is a license granted
       and that it has a license duly approved by the excise
       authorities and as such it is entitled to use the
       impugned marks is also not sustainable. The mere fact
       that the excise authorities have granted license to the
       Defendant to market its product under a mark which is
       similar to that of the Plaintiff would not in any manner
       impinge upon the rights of the Plaintiff or dilute the
       mark of the Plaintiff. The use of a trademark is
       governed by the Trademarks Act, 1999 as also under
       the common law. The excise authorities are not
       authorities appointed under the Trademarks Act or
       vested with the powers under the Trademarks Act. The
       examination of a label by the authorities under the
       <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_12">Excise       Act</a>    is    for a purpose            different than that
       prescribed under the Trademarks Act for the Registrar
       of Trademarks. The mere fact that the label of the
       Defendant is approved by the excise authorities would
       not permit or entitle the Defendant to use a mark which
       is deceptively similar to the mark adopted by the
       Plaintiff.

<p id="p_161"> 118. Another relevant factor is that the 2005 Assignment
       Deed is         an assignment            of    39    trademarks   for a
       consideration of Rs. 17.50 Crores whereas the 2010
       Assignment Deed is an assignment of 74 trademarks
       and that also for a meager consideration of only
       Rs.1000/-. It is though contended by the Defendant that
       the 2010 Assignment Deed is part of a Business
       Transfer Agreement. The said contention would not
       prima facie make any difference as the said Assignment
       Deed does not mention that there was any other sale
       consideration coupled with the Rs. 1,000/- mentioned
       therein.
</p>
<p id="p_162">119. Further contention of the Defendant that Annexure C is
       blank is also of no consequence as the Defendant in its
       written statement has itself contended that the Plaintiff
       was using the logo or label different from the one that
       was assigned implying thereby that it admits that
       logos/labels were assigned even though they were not
       enumerated in the agreement in annexure C. Further
       there is nothing on record to show that the Logos/labels
       were not assigned.
