ACT:
 Sales	Tax-Assessment--Gross and net turnover--Purchase  of
copra--Sale  of	 oil  both inside  and	outside	 the  State-
Deductions- -Assessable turnover-Constitution of India, <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_1">Art.
286--</a>Travancore-Cochin	General Sales Tax Act, 1125 (Act  XI
of  1125  M.E.),  SS. 2 (j)  (k),  3,  26--Travancore-Cochin
General Sales Tax Rules, 1950, rr. 7 (k), 20 (2).



HEADNOTE:
  The business of the appellant consisted in the purchase of
copra,	manufacture of cocoanut oil and cake  therefrom	 and
sale  of  oil  and  cake to  parties  inside  the  State  of
Travancore-Cochin  and	sale of oil to parties	outside	 the
State.	Before the coming into force of the Constitution  of
India, under the provisions of the Travancore-Cochin General
Sales Tax Act, 1125, and the rules made thereunder, for	 the
purposes  of  assessment  to sales tax,	 the  appellant	 wag
entitled to include in his gross turnover the total value of
the oil sold by him whether inside the State or outside	 the
State and to deduct therefrom the whole of the value of	 the
copra purchased by him.	 Subsequently, in 1951, the Act	 was
amended	 by  the  addition  of	s.  26	which,	inter  alia,
provided:   "Notwithstanding  anything	contained  in	this
Act......  a tax on the sale or purchase of any goods  shall
not,  after  the 31st day of March, 1951, be  imposed  where
such  sale or purchase takes place in the course  of  inter-
,State trade......... For the year 1951-1952, the Sales	 Tax
Officer	 assessed  the	appellant  to sales  tax  on  a	 net
assessable turnover by taking the value of the whole of	 the
copra purchased by him, adding thereto the respective values
of the oil and the cake sold inside the State and  deducting
only  the value of the copra corresponding to the  oil	sold
inside	the State.  It was contended for the appellant	that
in  the calculation of the net turnover he was	entitled  to
include the total value of the oil sold by him, both  inside
and outside the State, and deduct therefrom the total  value
of  the copra purchased by him, and further that, under	 the
overriding provision of the Act under S. 26, he was entitled
to  have  the  value  of the  oil  sold	 outside  the  State
deducted.
Held, that the calculation made by the Sales Tax Officer  of
the net turnover was correct.
The non-obstante provision contained in S. 26 of the Act has
the  effect of taking transactions relating  to	 inter-State
trade out of the purview of the Act and they are excluded in
the calculation
108
838
of  the gross turnover as well as the net turnover on  which
sales tax can be assessed.

</p><p id="p_5">1957.  April 2. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
BHAGWATI J.-This appeal with a certificate of fitness  under
<a href="/doc/783690/" id="a_4">Art.  132  (1)</a> of the Constitution is directed	against	 the
order of the High Court of Travancore-Cochin dismissing	 the
Original  Petition  No. 53 of 1954 filed  by  the  appellant
under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_5">Art.  226</a>  for quashing the order of  the  Sales	 Tax
Officer, 2nd Circle, Quilon, assessing him to sales tax on a
net  assessable	 turnover of Rs. 7,54,144-8-4 for  the	year
1951-52	 (1st  April,  1951 to 31st  March,  1952)  and	 for
issuing	 proper directions to the Sales Tax  Authorities  to
assess the same according to law.
</p><p id="p_6">   The	appellant is a registered manufacturer	of  cocoanut
oil and cake who has obtained a certificate of	registration
in  Form  VI as per sub-r. (i) of r. 20 of  the	 Travancore-
Cochin	General Sales Tax Rules, 1950.	The business of	 the
appellant for the purposes of this appeal consisted in	the'
purchase of copra, manufacture of cocoanut oil and cake	 and
sale of the same to parties inside the State of	 Travancore-
Cochin and sale of the oil to parties outside the State.
  In the year 1951-52, the appellant purchased copra of	 the
value  of  Rs.	7,16,048-1-4  and  after  manufacturing	 oil
therefrom  in  his oil mills he sold the oil partly  in	 the
State and partly outside the State and the cake
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">839</span>
entirely within the State., The total value of the oil	sold
was  Rs.  6,76,719-0-11 out of which the sales	outside	 the
State  were of the value of Rs. 3,67,816-10-1 and the  value
of the cake sold in the State was Rs. 67,155-155.  The total
gross  turnover of the appellant was thus Rs.  14,59,923-1-8
and he claimed to deduct therefrom the whole of the purchase
price of the copra under r. 7 (1) (k) read with r. 20.	 The
net  turnover  according  to  him  was	therefore  only	 Rs.
7,43,875-0-4 and he claimed to deduct out of this a  further
sum  of	 Rs. 3,67,816- 10-1 being the sale price of  oil  in
inter-State transactions which could not be taxed under <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_6">Art.
286</a>  of	 the  Constitution, thus showing  a  net  assessable
turnover of only Rs. 3,76 058-6-3.
</p><p id="p_7">   The Sales Tax Officer,  2nd Circle, Quilon, however	fixed
the  net  assessable  turnover	of  the	 appellant  at	 Rs.
7,54,144-8-4.	He took the purchase value of the  copra  at
Rs. 7,16,048-1-4 but added thereto Rs. 3,08,902-6-10 and Rs.
67,155-15-5  being the respective values of the oil and	 the
cake  sold  inside the State, excluding the  sale  price  of
inter-State  sales of oil, namely, Rs.	3,67,816-10-1,	from
such  computation.  Having thus excluded the sale  price  of
inter-State sales of oil, he deducted only the value of	 the
copra corresponding to the oil sold inside the State namely,
Rs.  3,35,216-0-0,  as against the  sum	 of  Rs.7,16,048-1-4
deducted by the appellant.  He added a sum of Rs.  3,385-0-3
being the price of gum sold by the appellant and deducted  a
further sum of Rs. 6,130-15-6 being the sales tax  collected
by  him.  He thus arrived at the net assessable turnover  of
Rs. 7,54,144-8-4 and assessed the appellant for sales tax on
the same.
</p><p id="p_8"> The  appellant preferred an appeal to the  Assistant  Sales
Tax Commissioner (S.T.A. No. 1480 of 1953-54) who  dismissed
the  same  by  his  order dated May  10,  1954.	  A  further
petition  to  the Government for redress met with  the	same
fate  and the appellant thereupon filed the petition in	 the
High Court of Travancore.  Cochin being O.P. No. 53 of	1954
with the result indicated above.
</p><p id="p_9">The decision of this appeal turns on the construction of the

Travancore-Cochin  General  Sales  Tax	Rules,	1950,	made
thereunder which may be conveniently set out here.
 The  preamble	to  the Act stated that it  was	 enacted  to
provide	 for the levy of a general tax on the sale of  goods
in the United State of Travancore and Cochin.
<a href="/doc/218839/" id="a_8">Section 2</a> (j) defined a " sale " as under:

of the Act laid down inter alia the provisions in regard  to

</p><p id="p_21"> "  (1) Save as provided in sub-rule (2) the gross  turnover

</p><p id="p_25">(a)  to	 (k)  were,  subject  to  the  conditions  specified

Clause (k) is relevant for our purpose.	 It specified
"  all amounts which a registered manufacturer	of  cocoanut
and/or groundnut oil and cake may be entitled to deduct from
his  gross turnover under Rule 20 subject to the  conditions
specified in the rule.	"
</p><p id="p_26">    Rule  20  so  far  as it is	 material  for	our  purpose
provided:
</p><p id="p_27">"   1. Any dealer who manufactures cocoanut/  groundnut	 oil

to  the	 value	of the cocoanut and/or	copra  or  groundnut
and/or	kernel purchased and converted by him into  oil	 and
cake  provided that the amount for which the oil is sold  is
included in his turnover."
</p><p id="p_29">It  is	not  necessary to refer to any other  rule  for	 the
purposes of this appeal.
</p><p id="p_30">The  main  controversy between the parties  centres  on	 the
method	of calculation of the net turnover.   The  appellant
contends that in the calculation of such net turnover he  is
entitled to include the total value of the oil sold by	him,
viz.,  Rs. 6,76,719-0-11, irrespective of the  fact  whether
these  sales were effected inside the State or	outside	 the
State  and  deduct  therefrom  the  total  value  of   copra
purchased  by him from which the whole quantity of oil	sold
by  him	 was  manufactured,  viz.,  Rs.	 7,16,048-1-4.	 The
resultant  figure,  according  to him,	represents  the	 net
assessable turnover on which the Sales Tax Authorities would
be  entitled to assess him to sales tax if the	position  in
law  was as is stood before the amendment of the Act by	 the
Travancore-Cochin  General Sales Tax (Amendment) Act,  1951.
He  next contends that<a href="/doc/72944411/" id="a_21"> s. 26</a> which was added to the  Act  by
the  Travancore-Cochin	General Sales  Tax  (Amendment)	 Act
1951, prohibits the levy amongst others of a tax on the sale
or purchase of goods where such sale or purchase takes place
in the course of inter-State trade or commerce.	 This is  an
overriding provision which, it is contended, entitled him to
deduct	the value of the oil sold outside the  State,  viz.,
Rs.  3,67,816-10-1, from the assessable turnover arrived  at
as above.  The result of this mode of calculation is that he
claims	to deduct from the gross turnover the whole  of	 the
purchase price of copra, viz., Rs. 7,16,048-1-4 and not	 the
purchase price of copra which can be allocated to his  sales
of oil inside the State.
</p><p id="p_31">The  Sales Tax Authorities on the other hand,  contend	that
the appellant is not entitled to take into
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">844</span>
computation  at all his 'sales of oil outside the State	 and
is  also not entitled to deduct from his gross turnover	 the
purchase price of copra allocated to the oil sold to persons
outside	 the State.  They claim to lift the whole  of  these
sales  of  oil outside the State inclusive of  the  purchase
price of the copra which can be allocated to them out of the
calculations  of the net turnover because of the  provisions
of <a href="/doc/72944411/" id="a_22"> s.	26</a>  set out above,  relying  upon  the	non-obstante
provision contained therein, viz., "Notwithstanding anything
contained  in  this Act, a tax on the sale  or	purchase  of
goods shall not be imposed under this Act where such sale or
purchase takes place in the course of inter-State
trade or commerce."
</p><p id="p_32">We  have  to decide which of these calculations of  the	 net
turnover is correct having regard to the relevant provisions
of the Act and the rules made there-under.
</p><p id="p_33"> The  definition  of 'sale" contained in<a href="/doc/218839/" id="a_23"> s. 2</a>  (j)  is	wide
enough	to  include, the sales of oil  manufactured  by	 the
appellant whether these sales are effected inside the  State
or  outside  the  State.  The definition  of  "	 turnover  "
contained  in<a href="/doc/218839/" id="a_24"> s. 2</a> (k) of the Act also makes no	 distinction
between	 the sales inside the State and out,side the  State.
The  " turnover " is there defined as the  aggregate  amount
for  which goods are either bought or 3old by a dealer	and,
that definition comprises within its scope both these  types
of  sales  whether inside the State or	outside	 the  State.
This  turnover of a dealer is under<a href="/doc/1816198/" id="a_25"> s. 3</a>, sub-s. (4)  to  be
determined   in	 accordance  with  such	 rules	as  may	  be
prescribed.   Rule 4 made by the Government under the  rule-
making power prescribes that the gross turnover of a  dealer
for the purposes of the rules shall be the amount for  which
the goods are sold by him.  This rule also does not make any
distinction  between sales inside the State or	outside	 the
State.	After having thus provided for the inclusion of	 all
sales within the gross turnover, r. 7 provides that the	 tax
or taxes under<a href="/doc/1816198/" id="a_26"> s. 3</a> (which is the charging section) shall be
levied	on the net turnover of a dealer.  Such net  turnover
is to be arrived at after deducting from the gross  turnover
various
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">845</span>
amounts	 specified  in cls. (a) to (k) thereof and  cl.	 (k)
provides  that a registered manufacturer of cocoanut  and/or
groundnut  oil and cake will be entitled to deduct from	 his
gross  turnover	 such  amounts as are  mentioned  in  r.  20
subject to the conditions specified therein.   The-deduction
under  r.  20  is available to	a  dealer  who	manufactures
cocoanut/groundnut  oil	 and cake from cocoanut	 and  "	 /or
copra or groundnut and/or kernel purchased by him and he  is
entitled to deduct the value of the cocoanut and/or copra or
groundnut and/or kernel purchased and converted by him	into
oil  and cake provided that the amount for which the oil  is
sold  is  included in his turnover.  Here also	we  find  no
distinction  made between sales inside the State or  outside
the State.
</p><p id="p_34"> On  a prima facie reading of these provisions contained  in
the Act and the rules made thereunder it would appear that a
manufacturer of cocoanut or groundnut oil and cake would  be
entitled to include in his gross turnover the total value of
the oil sold by him Whether inside the State or outside	 the
State  and to deduct from such gross turnover the  whole  of
the  value of the copra purchased by him and converted	into
oil and	  cake irrespective of the fact whether such oil  or
cake was  sold by him inside the State or outside the State.
The  only  thing which he had to do under r.  20,  sub-r.(2)
was  to include the amount for which the oil is sold in	 his
turnover  and he would then under r. 7(1)(k) be entitled  to
deduct from his gross turnover the whole of the price of the
copra  purchased  and converted by him into  oil  and  cake,
again  irrespective  of the fact whether the same  had	been
sold by him inside the State or outside the State.
This was certainly the position as it obtained prior to	 the
addition  of the<a href="/doc/72944411/" id="a_27"> s. 26</a> to the Act by  the  Travancore-Cochin
General	  Sales	 Tax  (Amendment)  Act,	 1951.	  We   have,
therefore.,  to consider what is the impact of<a href="/doc/72944411/" id="a_28"> s. 26</a> on	 the
other provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder.
The High Court decided against the appellant observing	that
the  definitions  given	 in s. (2)(j) and  (k)	of  the	 Act
applied only in the absence of "anything
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">109</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">846</span>
repugnant  in the subject or context", and on a	 perusal  of
the  relevant  provisions  of the Act  and  the	 rules	made
thereunder,  it was of opinion that these  definitions	were
clearly inapplicable for the following reasons:
  "There  can be no doubt that what has been intended  is  a
taxation of copra at the purchase point and the avoidance of
sales  tax in respect of the oil extracted by  a  registered
manufacturer  from such copra to the extent of the value  of
the  copra used for the said manufacture in all those  cases
where  but for the concession he would have been  liable  to
pay both the purchase tax on copra and the sales tax on	 oil
under the Travancore-Cochin General Sales Tax Act, 1125.  In
other  words,  the  object  is the  avoidance  of  a  double
taxation  by the State, one at the purchase point  of  copra
and the other at the sale point of oil, and it is impossible
to invoke the definition and say that the concession will be
available  to a registered manufacturer even in those  cases
where  only one and not both the taxes can be realized	from
him under the provisions of the Act."
</p><p id="p_35"> The  answer given by the learned counsel for the  appellant
to the above reasoning was that in fiscal statutes what	 you
have got to look to is not the spirit of the statute but the
letter	of the law; and if you could not bring a  particular
tax  within the letter of the law, the subject could not  be
made  liable for the same.  Our attention was drawn in	this
connection  to the observations of Lord Russell of  Killowen
in Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Duke of Westminster(1) :
"I -confess that I view with disfavour the doctrine that  in
taxation  cases the subject is to be taxed if in  accordance
with  a Court's view of what it considers the  substance  of
the transaction, the Court thinks that the case falls within
the contemplation or spirit of the statute.  The subject  is
not  taxable  by inference or by analogy, but  only  by	 the
plain  words  of  a  statute applicable	 to  the  facts	 and
circumstances  of his case." As Lord Cairns said many  years
ago  in	 Partington  v.	 The  Attorney	General	 (1):-"As  I
understand the
(1) [1936] A.C. 1, 24.

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">847</span>
<p id="p_37">principle  of  all  fiscal legislation it is  this:  if	 the
person sought to be taxed comes within the letter of the law
he  must be taxed, however great the hardship may appear  to
the  judicial mind to be.  On the other hand, if the  Crown,
seeking to recover the tax, cannot bring the subject  within
the  letter  of	 the  law,  the	 subject  is  free,  however
apparently  within  the	 spirit of the law  the	 case  might
otherwise appear to be."
</p><p id="p_38">The passage was quoted with approval by the Privy Council in
the <a href="/doc/1065786/" id="a_29">Bank of Chettinad v. Income Tax Commissioner</a> (1) and the
Privy Council registered its protest against the  suggestion
that  in revenue cases "the substance of the matter" may  be
regarded  as distinguished from the strict  legal  position.
(See also F.   L. Smidth &amp; Co. v. F. Greenwood (2)).
  It is no doubt true that in construing fiscal statutes and
in  determining the liability of a subject to tax  one	must
have  regard to the strict letter of the law and not  merely
to  the spirit of the statute or the substance of  the	law.
If  the	 Revenue  satisfies the Court that  the	 case  falls
strictly  within the provisions of the law, the subject	 can
be  taxed.  If, on the other hand, the case is	not  covered
within	the  four corners of the provisions  of	 the  taxing
statute, no tax can be imposed by inference or by analogy or
by  trying to probe into the intentions of  the	 legislature
and by considering what was the substance of the matter.  We
must  of  necessity, therefore, have regard  to	 the  actual
provisions  of the Act and the rules made thereunder  before
we can come to the conclusion that the appellant was  liable
to assessment as contended by the Sales Tax Authorities.
It  may	 be noted at the outset that the main  bulk  of	 the
<a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_30">Sales	Tax   Act</a>s  enacted  by	  the	various	  Provincial
Legislatures  was  enacted before the  Constitution.   There
were  on the Statute Book various <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_31">Sales Tax Act</a>s enacted  by
the  Provincial	 Legislatures, viz., Bihar  Sales  Tax	Act,
1947,  Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941, Madhya  Pradesh
Sales  Tax  Act, 1947, Madras Sales Tax	 Act,  1939,  Mysore
Sales Tax Act, 1948, Orissa Sales Tax Act, 1947, East Punjab
General Sales Tax Act, 1948, and the Uttar Pradesh Sales Tax
Act,
(1) A.I.R. (1940) P.C. 183. (2) VIII T.C. 193, 206,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">348</span>
1948,---all  of	 which levied sales tax on a  more  or	less
uniform	 basis bringing within their ken not only the  sales
which  were actually effected within the territory but	also
sales  where  adopting	the nexus theory  eve1	one  of	 the
ingredients of sale was found to have taken place within the
territory.  The Assam Sales Tax Act, 1947, and the Hyderabad
General Sales Tax Act, 1950, also followed the same pattern.
When the Constitution came to be inaugurated on January	 26,
1950,  <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_32">Art.  286(2)</a>  laid down	restrictions  on  the  State
Legislatures  to  enact	 laws imposing	or  authorising	 the
imposition  of	tax  on the sale or  purchase  of  goods  in
certain	 cases therein specified, so that after January	 26,
1950, no State could impose a tax on the sale or purchase of
goods  falling within these categories.	 <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_33">The Sales Tax	Act</a>s
enacted	  by  the  various  Provincial	 Legislatures	had,
therefore, to be brought in line with this provision of	 the
Constitution  and  various expedients were  devised  by	 the
State Legislatures in order to effectuate this object.
 This  object was sought to be achieved in the main bulk  of
the  <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_34">Sales  Tax Act</a>s by adding towards the end of  the	Acts
sections  like s. 26 of the Travancore-Cochin General  Sales
Tax  Act, 1125, incorporating therein the terms of <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_35">Art.	 286</a>
of  the Constitution.  The non-obstante provision  was	thus
enacted	 in the main bulk of the <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_36">Sales Tax Act</a>s	 which	laid
down:  "Notwithstanding anything contained in this  Act	 the
tax  on the sales or purchase of goods shall not be  imposed
under  this Act where.................. (and the  provisions
of <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_37">Art. 286</a> were in terms incorporated therein)."
 A  different expedient was adopted in the Assam  Sales	 Tax
Act,  1947  and the Hyderabad General Sales Tax	 Act,  1950.
The  Assam Sales Tax Act, 1947, had incorporated therein  an
addition to the charging section (<a href="/doc/1816198/" id="a_38">section 3</a> of the Act)	 and
s. 3 (1-A) which was inserted by s. 3 of the Assam Sales Tax
(Amendment)  Act,  1947 <a href="/doc/941127/" id="a_39">(Assam Act</a> IV of 1951)	was  to	 the
following effect:
</p><p id="p_39">"Nothing in sub-section (1) shall,except in cases covered by
the  first proviso to sub-section (12) of <a href="/doc/218839/" id="a_40">section 2</a> of	this
Act be deemed to render any dealer
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">849</span>
liable	to  tax on the sale of goods-where such	 sale  takes
place:
</p><p id="p_40">(1) outside the State of Assam;
</p><p id="p_41">(2)  in	 the  course  of the import of the  goods  into,  or
export	of the goods out of, the territory of India; or
(3)   in the course of inter-State trade or commerce  except
in so far as Parliament may by law otherwise provide.
 The  Hyderabad	 General Sales Tax Act, 1950 had  a  similar
provision incorporated in its definition of sale given in<a href="/doc/218839/" id="a_41"> s.
2</a> (k) of the Act.  The Explanation (2) which was substituted
for  the original Explanation (2) by s. 2 of  the  Hyderabad
General Sales Tax (Amendment) Act, 1950 <a href="/doc/1666002/" id="a_42">(Hyderabad Act</a> XXXII
of 1950) read as under:
</p><p id="p_42">Explanation  (2)-" Notwithstanding anything to the  contrary
in any other law for the time being in force, a transfer  of
goods in respect of which no tax can be imposed by reason of
the provision contained in <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_43">Article 286</a> of the  Constitution,
shall not be deemed to be "sale" within the meaning of	this
clause.	 "
</p><p id="p_43">A further expedient which was adopted in this connection may
be  noted  in  r. 5 of the Bombay  Sales  Tax  Rules,  1952,
enacted	 under	the Bombay Sales Tax Act,  1952-(Bombay	 Act
XXIV  of  1952), which authorised the deduction	 of  certain
sales  coming  within  <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_44">Art. 286</a> of  the	 Constitution  while
calculating the taxable turnover of a dealer.
We are not called upon to express any opinion as to  whether
the  incorporation  of	the provisions of <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_45">Art.	286</a>  of	 the
Constitution  in the charging section as it was done in	 the
Assam Sales Tax Act, 1947, or in the definition of "sale" as
it was done in the Hyderabad General Sales Tax Act, 1950, or
even  in the rules in regard to the calculation	 of  taxable
turnover as it was done in the Bombay Sales Tax Rules, 1952,
had  the  effect  of taking the	 sales	falling	 within	 the
categories  specified in <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_46">Art. 286</a> out of the purview of	 the
respective  <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_47">Sales  Tax	Act</a>s,  so that	they  would  not  be
included  at all within the calculation of the net  turnover
on which only the sales tax could be levied.  What was	done
in the instant case before us as in the bulk of the Sales
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">850</span>
<a href="/doc/6749/" id="a_48">Tax  Act</a>s  above  noted	 was  the  incorporation  of   those
provisions of <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_49">Art. 286</a> of the Constitution therein by adding
a non-obstante provision at the end of the respective  <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_50">Sales
Tax  Act</a>s in the manner above indicated.  The definition  of
"sale"	was not amended nor was the charging  section.	 The
rules  as  to  the  calculation of  the	 net  turnover	also
remained the same, without any deduction in regard to  sales
coming	 within	  <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_51">Art.	286</a>  of	  the	Constitution   being
incorporated  therein,	with the result that the  Sales	 Tax
Authorities   founded  themselves  upon	  the	non-obstante
provision  incorporated in the Act by the addition of<a href="/doc/72944411/" id="a_52"> s.  26</a>
therein	  by   the  Travancore-Cochin  General	 Sales	 Tax
(Amendment) Act, 1951.
</p><p id="p_44">  What, then, is the effect of this non-obstante provision ?
This  Court in <a href="/doc/950735/" id="a_53">Aswani Kumar Ghosh v. Arabinda Bose</a> (1)	made
the following observations in connection
with the non-obstante clause:
</p><p id="p_45">"It  should first be ascertained what the enacting  part  of
the  section  provides on a fair construction of  the  words
used  according to their natural and ordinary  meaning,	 and
the non-obstante clause is to be understood as operating  to
set aside as no longer valid anything contained in  relevant
existing laws which is inconsistent with the new enactment."
 The  same  ratio applies to the construction  of  the	non-
obstante  provision  contained	in<a href="/doc/72944411/" id="a_54"> s. 26</a>  of  the  Act	with
reference  to  all  the other provisions  of  the  Act	that
preceded the same.
</p><p id="p_46"> In  our opinion,<a href="/doc/72944411/" id="a_55"> s. 26</a> of the Act, in cases falling  within
the categories specified under <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_56">Art. 286</a> of the	Constitution
has  the effect of setting at nought and of obliterating  in
regard thereto the provisions contained in the Act  relating
to  the	 imposition of tax on the sale or purchase  of	such
goods  and  in particular the provisions  contained  in	 the
charging  section and the provisions contained in r. 20	 (2)
and other provisions which are incidental to the process  of
levying	 such  tax.   So far as	 sales	falling	 within	 the
categories specified in <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_57">Art. 286</a> of the Constitution and the
corresponding<a href="/doc/72944411/" id="a_58"> s.    26</a>	of the Act are concerned, they	are,
as it were,
(1) [1953] S.C.R. 1, 21, 22.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">851</span>
<p id="p_47">taken  out of the purview of the Act and no effect is to  be
given  to those provisions which would otherwise  have	been
applicable if<a href="/doc/72944411/" id="a_59"> s. 26</a> had not been added to the Act.  If these
provisions  of the Act and the rules made thereunder do	 not
apply  to.  the sales falling within those  categories,	 the
value  thereof	cannot be included in the  turnover  of	 the
dealer	and no question would &amp;rise of the applicability  of
r.  7  (1)  (k) and r. 20 (2) at all to	 these	cases.	 The
amount	for  which the oil is sold in inter-State  trade  or
commerce  would not be lawfully included in the turnover  of
the  dealer  and if the amount for which such  oil  is	sold
cannot	thus be included in his turnover no  occasion  would
arise  for the deduction under r. 7 (1) (k) of the value  of
the  cocoanut  and/or  copra  or  groundnut  and/or   kernel
purchased  and	converted by the dealer into  such  oil	 and
cake.
</p><p id="p_48"> A  distinction was sought to be made between the  inclusion
of  the value of such oil in the turnover of the dealer	 for
the purpose of assessment and the levy of tax thereupon.  It
was urged that the inclusion of such oil in the turnover for
the  purpose  of  assessment was  quite	 distinct  from	 the
liability for tax which was the only thing prohibited by <a href="/doc/72944411/" id="a_60"> s.
26</a>  of the Act and therefore the value of such oil could  be
lawfully  included in the turnover involving as a  necessary
consequence  the  deduction  of	 the  value  of	 the   copra
purchased  by the dealer and converted by him into such	 oil
from  such  turnover, the resultant turnover being  the	 net
turnover  for the purposes of assessment, the value  of	 the
oil  sold  in the course of inter-State	 trade	or  commerce
being further deducted therefrom by reason of the  operation
of <a href="/doc/72944411/" id="a_61"> s.	26</a> of the Act, thus making in effect  a	 distinction
between assessable turnover and the taxable turnover.
 Reliance  was	placed in support of this  position  on	 the
observations  of this Court in Messrs.	 <a href="/doc/1290730/" id="a_62">Chatturam  Horilram
Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-Tax, Bihar and Orissa</a>(1):
" As has been pointed out by the Federal Court in  <a href="/doc/1290730/" id="a_63">Chatturam
v. C.I.T., Bihar</a>(,) (quoting from the

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">852</span>
<p id="p_49">judgment  of  Lord Dunedin in Whitney  v.  Commissioners  of
Inland Revenue (1) 'there are three stages in the imposition
of  a tax.  There is the declaration of liability,  that  is
the  part  of the statute which determines  what  person  in
respect	 of  what property are liable.	Next, there  is	 the
assessment.  Liability does not depend on assessment.  That,
ex-hypothesi,  has  already  been  fixed.   But	  assessment
particularises	the exact sum which a person liable  has  to
pay.   Lastly,	come the methods of recovery if	 the  person
taxed does not voluntarily pay"
</p><p id="p_50">  The  appellant, however, forgets that the three stages  in
the imposition of a tax which are laid down here  predicate,
in  the	 first instance, a declaration of liability  as	 the
starting  point.   If there is a liability to  tax,  imposed
under  the  terms  of the taxing statute,  then	 follow	 the
provisions  in regard to the assessment of  such  liability.
If  there  is  no  liability to	 tax  there  cannot  be	 any
assessment  either.  Sales or purchases in respect of  which
there  is no liability to tax imposed by the statute  cannot
at  all be included in the calculation of turnover  for	 the
purpose of assessment and the exact sum which the dealer  is
liable	to  pay must be ascertained  without  any  reference
whatever to the same'.
</p><p id="p_51"> There	is  a  broad  distinction  between  the	  provisions
contained in the statute in regard to the exemptions of	 tax
or refund or rebate of tax on the one hand and in regard  to
the  non-liability  to tax or non-imposition of tax  on	 the
other.	 In  the  former case, but  for	 the  provisions  as
regards the exemptions or refund or rebate of tax, the sales
or purchases would have to be included in the gross turnover
of the dealer because they are prima facie liable to tax and
the  only thing which the dealer is entitled to	 in  respect
thereof is the deduction from the gross turnover in order to
arrive at the net turnover on which the tax can be  imposed.
In the latter case, the sales or purchases are exempted from
taxation  altogether.	The Legislature cannot enact  a	 law
imposing  or authorising the imposition of a  tax  thereupon
and they are not liable to any such imposition
 (1) [1926] A.C. 37.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">853</span>
<p id="p_52">of  tax.  If they are thus not liable to tax, no tax can  be
levied	or imposed on them and they do not come	 within	 the
purview	 of  the Act at all.  The very fact  of	 their	non-
liability  to  tax is sufficient to exclude  them  from	 the
calculation  of	 the  gross  turnover as  well	as  the	 net
turnover on which sales tax can be levied or imposed.
If this distinction is borne in mind, it is clear that<a href="/doc/72944411/" id="a_64"> s. 26</a>
of the Act enacts a provision with regard to nonliability of
these  transactions  to	 tax  and  these  transactions	were
therefore taken out of the purview of the Act.
We are therefore of opinion that the non-obstante  provision
contained in<a href="/doc/72944411/" id="a_65"> s. 26</a> of the Act has the effect of taking these
transactions  out of the purview of the Act with the  result
that  the  dealer  is not required nor	is  he	entitled  to
include	 them in the calculations of his turnover liable  to
tax thereunder.
</p><p id="p_53">This  position is not at all affected by the provision	with
regard	to  registration and submissions of returns  of	 the
sales tax by the dealers under the Act.	 The legislature, in
spite  of its disability in the matter of the imposition  of
sales  tax  by virtue of the provisions of <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_66">Art. 286</a>  of	 the
Constitution, may for the purposes of the registration of  a
dealer	and submission of the returns of sales	tax  include
these	transactions   in  the	dealer's   turnover.	Such
inclusion,  however,  for the purposes aforesaid  would	 not
affect	the non-liability of these transactions to  levy  or
imposition of sales tax by virtue of the provisions of	<a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_67">Art.
286</a>  of	 the Constitution and  the  corresponding  provision
enacted in the Act, as above.
</p><p id="p_54">We are, therefore, of opinion that the conclusion reached by
We  are therefore therefore, of opinion that the  conclusion
reached	 by the High Court was correct; the calculations  of
the net turnover made by the Sales Tax Authorities were also
correct; and this appeal must stand dismissed with costs.
