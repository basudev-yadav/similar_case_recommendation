the war years.



HEADNOTE:
On March 26, 1954 the Income-tax authorities issued a notice
to the respondents under<a href="/doc/13870/" id="a_6"> s. 34(1)</a> (a) of the Indian  Income-
tax  Act, 1922 in respect of assessment year  1945-46.	 The
assessment made pursuant to the notice was set aside by	 the
appellate authorities on the ground that the notice under<a href="/doc/13870/" id="a_7"> s.
34(1)</a>  (a)  was time barred because the assessment  year  in
question  was  beyond the period of 8 years  covered  by <a href="/doc/13870/" id="a_8"> s.
34(1)(a)</a>.   Sub-ss. (1A) to (ID) were inserted in<a href="/doc/1306401/" id="a_9"> s.  34</a>  by
the  <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_10">Income-tax (Amendment) Act</a> 1954.  By sub-s. (1A)  power
was  given to the Income-tax authorities to issue notice  in
respect	 of escaped income of the previous years within	 the
period September 1, 1939 to March 31, 1946.  By the, <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_11">Finance
Act</a>  1956  with effect from April 1, 1956<a href="/doc/13870/" id="a_12"> s. 34(1)</a>  (a)	 was
amended	 so that notices in respect of escaped income  could
be  issued 'at any time' subject to certain conditions.	  On
July  25, 1958 the Income-tax Officer again issued a  notice
to  the respondents calling upon them to file a	 return	 for
the assessment year 1945-46.  An appeal to the Central Board
of  Revenue by some of respondents failed.   Thereupon	they
filed  a  petition  under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_13">Art.	 226</a>  of  the	Constitution
challenging  the  notice  on various  grounds.	 Their	main
contention  was that no notice under<a href="/doc/13870/" id="a_14"> s. 34(1)</a> (a)  could  be
issued in respect of the war years as the escaped income  of
the  said  war years was governed by<a href="/doc/1306401/" id="a_15"> s.	 34(1A)</a>,  whereunder
notices could be issued only up to March 31, 1956.  The High
Court having taken a view favourable to the respondents, the
Revenue appealed to this Court by special leave.
It  was contended on behalf of the appellant that the  terms
of <a href="/doc/13870/" id="a_16"> s. 34(1)</a> (a) after its amendment in 1956 were clear	 and
unambiguous  and the scope of the expression 'at  any  time'
could  not be curtailed by construction and that <a href="/doc/1306401/" id="a_17"> s.  34(lA)</a>
did not operate to restrict the operation of<a href="/doc/13870/" id="a_18"> s. 34(1)</a> (a) in
respect	 of the war years.  On behalf of the respondents  it
was contended that<a href="/doc/1306401/" id="a_19"> s. 34(lA)</a> was a species of which<a href="/doc/13870/" id="a_20"> s. 34(1)</a>
(a)  was genus that in respect of the war years there was  a
conflict  between the two subsections, and that in  view  of
the  maxim,  generalia specialibus non derogant, <a href="/doc/1306401/" id="a_21"> s.  34(1A)</a>
should prevail.
HELD:(i) It would not be appropriate to describe sub-s.
(1A)  as  one carved out of sub-s. (1) (a) or to call  it  a
species	 of  which  sub-s. (1) (a) is the  genus.   When <a href="/doc/1306401/" id="a_22"> s.
34(lA)</a>	was  enacted<a href="/doc/13870/" id="a_23"> s. 34(1)(a)</a> had practically  ceased  to
function  in  respect  of  the war  years.   Again  when <a href="/doc/13870/" id="a_24"> s.
34(1)(a)</a>  was  amended	with effect from April	1,  1956 <a href="/doc/1306401/" id="a_25"> s.
34(1A)</a> had practically ceased to operate as no notices under
it  could  be  issued after-March 31,  1956.   There  is  no
conflict between the two sub-sections after that date.	 The
wide phraseology of the amended<a href="/doc/13870/" id="a_26"> s. 34(1)(a)</a> takes
380
in  all the escaped concealed incomes during all  the  years
commencing  from  1941 and confers power on  the  Income-tax
Officer	 to  give notice thereunder in respect of  the	said
income without any bar of limitation. [390 C-F]
(ii)Sub-Section	 (1A) does not really prescribe any  period
of  limitation.	 It enables the Income-tax Officer  to	take
proceedings  within a particular time, though the period  of
limitation had expired.	 It conferred a special power on the
Income-tax Officer which expired on April 1, 1956.  The non-
obstante clause in sub-s. (1A) indicates that it was enacted
to  operate notwithstanding that the period of 8  years	 had
expired.  The said sub-section served its purpose only	when
the  period  of 8 years governed a notice under	 sub-s.	 (1)
(a).   But when that bar of limitation was ,removed,  sub-s.
(1A) had become otiose. [390 G-391 A]
Further	 sub-s. (1B) as amended by the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_27">Finance Act</a>  of	1956
and sub-s. 4 added by the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_28">Indian Income-tax Act	 (Amendment)
Act</a> 1959, also reinforces the construction that sub-s. 34(1)
(a)  as	 amended in 1956 was applicable to,  the  war  years
despite sub-s. 34(1A). [391 B., D-E]
(iii)The  reason  why sub-s. (1A) was retained	in  the
statute	 even after the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_29">Finance Act</a> of 1956 was that  though
no new notices could be issued under that sub-section  after
April 1, 1956, notices already issued before that date	were
pending.  They could be disposed of in the manner prescribed
by sub-ss. (1A), (1B), (1C), and (1D) of<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_30"> s. 34</a>.	 All the aid
sub-sections  formed  an integral  code.   The	legislature,
presumably,   intended	 to  keep  the	 said	sub-sections
whereunder  proceedings had already been initiated and	make
available  to the said proceedings the procedure  prescribed
under the said provisions.  It may also be that sub-s.	(1A)
was  kept in super abundant caution.  Whatever that may	 be,
it  cannot,  in the circumstances, detract  from  the  clear
provisions of sub-s. (1) (,a). [391 F, G]

<p id="p_7">The judgment of the Court was delivered by
Subba  Rao, J. These two appeals, one by special  leave	 and
the other by certificate, raise the question whether  notice
can  be	 issued	 at  any  time	for  reassessment  under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_31"> s.
34(1)(a)</a>, as amended by the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_32">Finance Act</a>, 1956, of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_33">Indian
Income-tax Act</a>, 1922, hereinafter called the Act, in respect
of a concealed income to which<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_34"> s. 34(1A)</a> thereof applied.
The  facts  may be briefly stated.   Messrs.   Shahzada	 and
Sons,  the  1st	 respondent  in both  the  appeals,  was  an
undivided  Hindu  Family firm and it was  assessed  in	that
capacity  up to the assessment year 1945-46.  It is  alleged
that subsequently there was a partition in the family and  a
new  firm came into existence, which took over the  business
of   the  family.   On	March  26,  1954,   the	  income-tax
authorities  issued a notice to the members of	the  defunct
Hindu	  undivided  family under<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_35"> s. 34(1)(a)</a> of the Act  in
respect	 of the assessment year 1945-46 on the	ground	that
certain income of the	 said family had escaped assessment.
Pursuant  to  the  proceedings so initiated, a	sum  of	 Rs.
3,63,000/- was added to the original assessment of the	said
family.	  The assessee took up the matter on appeal  to	 the
Appellate  Assistant  Commissioner, who held that  the	said
notice was barred by time, though on the merits he confirmed
the  order  of	the  Income-tax	 Officer.   The	  Income-tax
Department  as well as the 1st respondent preferred  appeals
against the said order to the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal.
The  Tribunal held that the notice was barred by  time	and,
therefore, the income-tax authorities had no jurisdiction to
give a finding on the merits.  Meanwhile<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_36"> s. 34(1)(a)</a> of	 the
Act  was amended by the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_37">Finance Act</a>, 1956, with effect	from
April 1, 1956, whereunder, subject to certain conditions,  a
notice	under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_38"> s.  34(1)(a)</a> could be  issued  at  any  time.
Thereafter, on July 25, 1958, the Income-tax Officer  issued
a notice to the 1st respondent calling upon the members	 who
constituted  the undivided family to file a return  for	 the
assessment  year 1945-46.  Respondents 2 to 5, who were	 the
members of the said undivided Hindu family, appealed to	 the
Central	 Board of Revenue for redress without  any  success.
Thereafter,  they  filed a petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_39">Art.	226</a>  of	 the
Constitution  in  the High Court of Punjab  challenging	 the
notice	on various grounds.  Their main contention was	that
no  notice under<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_40"> s. 34(1)(a)</a> could be issued in	 respect  of
the  war years, as the escaped income during the said  years
was  governed  by<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_41"> s. 34(1A)</a> of the Act whereunder  a  notice
could  be  issued  only before March  31,  1956.   The	writ
petition  came up before a single Judge of the	High  Court,
who referred the following question to a larger Bench :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	      "Whether	or not in the circumstances  of	 the
	      present  case  the  notice  under	 <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_42">section  34</a>
	      issued on 25th July 1958 was barred by time."
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">382</span>
<p id="p_8">The Division Bench, in its turn, referred the said  question
to  a Full Bench.  The Full Bench, inter alia, held that <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_43"> s.
34(1A)</a>	was  a special provision whereas<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_44"> s. 34(1)(a)</a>  was  a
general	 provision  and that, as the escaped income  of	 the
year 1945-46 was governed by<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_45"> s. 34(1A)</a>, no not-Ace under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_46"> s.
34(1)(a)</a>  could be issued.  In the result, after  expressing
that  view, the Full Bench sent back the case to the  single
Judge  before whom it came in the first instance.  Dua,	 J.,
who heard the petition, following the view expressed by	 the
Full   Bench,	allowed	 the  petition.	   The	 appellants,
thereafter,  preferred a Letters Patent appeal against	that
order to a Division Bench, which dismissed the same.   Civil
Appeal	No.  494  of 1964 has been Sled by  the	 Revenue  by
special	 leave	against the order of the  Full	Bench  dated
September 8, 1961, and Civil Appeal No. 495 of 1964 has been
filed,	by certificate, by the Revenue against the order  of
the Division Bench confirming that of Dua, J.
At  the	 outset it will be convenient to read  the  material
provisions  of	s. 34 of the Act as amended by	the  <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_47">Finance
Act</a>, 1956, and by the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_48">Income-tax (Amendment) Act</a>, 1959.

amended by the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_57">Finance Act</a>, 1956, with effect from April  1,
1956.  Sub-section (1B) of<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_58"> s. 34</a>, which was inserted by	 the
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_59">Income-tax (Amendment) Act</a>, 1954, was	also amended by	 the

<p id="p_21">section	 (1A)." Sub-section (4) was added by the  <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_61">Income-tax
(Amendment) Act</a>, 1959.
</p><p id="p_22">The gist of the relevant provisions may be stated thus:
Under<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_62"> s. 34(1)(a)</a>, before it was amended by the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_63">Finance Act</a>,
1956,  in  the	case of concealed income a  notice  for	 re-
assessment could be issued within 8 years of the end of	 the
relevant  year;	 and  after the said  amendment,  notice  in
respect of the said income could be issued at any time,	 but
it was subject to three conditions, namely, (i) it would not
be issued for any year prior to the year ending on March 31,
1941,  (ii)  such concealed income amounted to one  lakh  of
rupees	or more in the aggregate, and (iii)  the  Income-tax
Officer	 gave reasons for doing so and obtained the  consent
of the Central Board of Revenue.  Sub-section (IA) of<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_64"> s.  34</a>
did  not  undergo any change after the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_65">Finance	Act</a>,  1-956.
Escaped	 assessment  for any year in respect  of  which	 the
relevant  previous year fell within the period beginning  on
September  1, 1939, and ending on March 31, 1946,  could  be
reached by issuing a notice thereunder: but, it was  subject
to  the condition that the income which	 escaped  assessment
for  any year amounted to or was likely to amount to  rupees
one lakh or more; it was subject to a further condition that
no such notice should be issued after March 31, 1956.	Sub-
section	 (1B)  of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_66"> s. 34</a>, as amended  in  1956,	 enabled  an
assessee  to whom a notice has been issued under cl. (a)  of
sub-s.	(1)  or sub-s. (IA) for any of the years  ending  on
March  31 of the years 1941 to 1948 inclusive, to  apply  to
the Central Board of Revenue for a settlement of the  amount
of  tax payable by him, Sub-section (4), which was  inserted
in  1959, emphasized the fact that a notice could be  issued
under<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_67"> s. 34(1)(a)</a>, notwithstanding that the time of 8  years
had expired before the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_68">Finance Act</a>, 1956, came into force.
We may at this stage notice the arguments advanced by learn-
ed counsel on the interpretation of the said provisions.
The  arguments. of Mr. S. T. Desai, learned counsel for	 the
Revenue, may be summarized thus : The terms of<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_69"> s.  34(1)(a)</a>,
after its amendment by the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_70">Finance Act</a>, 1956, are clear	 and
unambiguous  and the scope of the expression "at  any  time"
cannot	 be  curtailed	by  construction.    So	  construed,
proceedings  for re-assessment in respect of escaped  income
contemplated by the said clause can be initiated without any
restriction  of	 time.	 The  legislative  history  of	 the
fasciculus  of sub-sections, namely, sub-ss.  (1)(a),  (1A),
(1B), (1C) and (1D) of<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_71"> s. 34</a>, supports the said construction
and  explains  the  relative scope of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_72"> s.  34(1)(a)</a>  and <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_73"> s.
34(1A)</a>--the  former,  as amended by the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_74">Finance	 Act</a>,  1956,
operated  after	<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_75"> s. 34(1A)</a> ceased to operate so far  as	 the
escaped	 concealed income of war years was  concerned.	 The
amendment of<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_76"> s. 34(1B)</a> by the said Act and the	introduction
of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_77"> s.	34(4)</a>  by  the	<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_78">Income-tax  (Amendment)	 Act</a>,  1959,
reinforces the said construction, namely,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">386</span>
that  the amended<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_79"> s. 34(1)(a)</a> lifted the ban  of  limitation
also in respect of the escaped income of the war years.	 The
retention  of<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_80"> S. 34(1A)</a> on the statute became  necessary  as
proceedings  taken thereunder were pending at the  time	 the
<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_81">Finance	 Act</a>,  1956, came into force and  the  consequential
provisions,  such as,<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_82"> s. 34(1B)</a> etc., with which <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_83"> s.  34(1A)</a>
was integrally connected could not be applied if the  latter
was  omitted.  Further, the said sub-sections still  applied
to  incomes  falling  under<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_84"> s. 34(1)(b)</a> in  respect  of	 war
years.	 In  any  view,	 it  must  have	 been  retained	  in
superabundant  caution and that fact could not restrict	 the
scope of an otherwise clearly expressed provision, viz., <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_85"> s.
34(1)(a)</a>.   The construction accepted by the High Court	 led
to  the anomalous position of the Legislature prescribing  a
shorter	 period	 of limitation in the  case  of	 tax-evaders
during the war years and no period of limitation for evaders
of  such income during the prewar and post-war years.	This
could not have been the intention of the Legislature, as the
evasion	 of tax during the war. years was  comparatively  of
larger	amounts than during the other periods and  for	that
very   reason	it  has	 passed	 the  <a href="/doc/1959284/" id="a_86">Taxation	 of   Income
(Investigation Commission) Act</a>, 1947, which was declared  to
be void by this Court.	This contention was accepted by	 the
Bombay and Calcutta High Courts in <a href="/doc/1823181/" id="a_87">Laxminarayan R. Rathi  v.
Income-tax  Officer</a>,  Poona  (1) and  <a href="/doc/1215097/" id="a_88">Mandanlal	 Jajodia  v.
Income-tax Officer, Dist</a>. II(1), Calcutta (2) respectively.
Mr.   Palkhivala,  learned  counsel  for  the	respondents,
answered  this criticism thus.	In a taxing Act one  has  to
look   merely	what   is  clearly  stated   and,   if	 the
interpretation	is  open  to doubt,  the  construction	most
beneficial   to	 the  subject  must  be	 adopted.    <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_89">Section
34(1)(a)</a>,  before it was amended in 1956, provided  for	 the
genus out of which, by the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_90">Income-tax (Amendment) Act</a>, 1959,
the species of r..  34(1A)   was  carved  out.	  While	 <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_91"> s.
34(1)(a)</a> was a general provision,<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_92"> s.	34(1A)</a> was a special
provision.   On the principle of generalia  specialibus	 non
derogant, the field covered by<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_93"> s. 34(1A)</a> should be  excluded
from  that  covered by<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_94"> s. 34(1)(a)</a>.  If that was  the  legal
position before the 1956 amendment, the argument  proceeded,
the  same position would continue thereafter, as  Parliament
retained <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_95"> s.  34(1A)</a>, along with its provisos, as  it  stood
before	the  amendment and amended only	<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_96"> S.  34(1)(a)</a>.	 The
lifting of the ban of limitation, therefore, should, on	 the
basis of the said doctrine, be confined to the field covered
by<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_97"> S. 34(1)(a)</a> before the amendment.  If Parliament intended
to  do away with the period of limitation in respect of	 the
escaped	 incomes  during the war period, it would  not	have
retained<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_98"> s. 34(1A)</a> on the statute book; for, in that event,'
it would serve no purpose.  It would be wrong to say that it
ceased	to be operative after April 1, 1956, for the  period
of limitation would still apply to proceedings in respect of
escaped incomes of the war years.  Sub-s. (4) added in<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_99"> s. 34</a>
in the year 1959 and<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_100"> s. 34(1B)</a>, as amended

<p id="p_24">in 1956, would not throw any light on the question, but in a
way  would  support the view that they were  concerned	only
with  the escaped incomes covered by<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_101"> s. 34(1)(a)</a>,  excluding
thereform those covered by<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_102"> s. 34(1A)</a>.  The argument based on
the alleged anomaly led nowhere and indeed the retention  of
s. 34(1A) on the statute book was intentionally done, as the
Parliament,  having  already placed a  particular  class  of
assessees  under a special and heavy burden, did  not  think
fit  to make any provision which was likely to	harass	them
further.   The ambiguity in the section, if any,  should  go
for  the benefit of the tax-payer and not the  tax-gatherer.
This argument was accepted by the Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat
High  Courts  in  <a href="/doc/1910580/" id="a_103">Rustomji v.  Income-tax  Officer,  Special
Investigation Circle</a>, Indore(1), and <a href="/doc/304545/" id="a_104">Mathurdas Govinddas  v.
G.  N.	Gadgil, Income-tax  Officer,  Special  Investigation
Office, Ahmedabad</a> (2).
</p><p id="p_25">Before	we  advert  to	the  said  arguments,  it  will	  be
convenient  to	notice the relevant rules  of  construction.
The  classic  statement	 of  Rowlatt,  J.,  in	Cape  Brandy
Syndicate v. I.R.C. (3). still holds the field.	 It reads :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">	      "In  a  Taxing Act one has to look  merely  at
	      what  is clearly said.  There is no  room	 for
	      any  intendment.	There is no equity  about  a
	      tax.   There  is no presumption as to  a	tax.
	      Nothing  is  to be read in, nothing is  to  be
	      implied.	 One  can only look  fairly  at	 the
	      language used."
</blockquote><p id="p_26">To  this  may  be added a rider': in a	case  of  reasonable
doubt, the construction most beneficial to the subject is to
be   adopted.	But  even  so,	the  fundamental   rule	  of
construction is the same for all statutes, whether fiscal or
otherwise.   "The underlying principle is that	the  meaning
and intention of a statute must be collected from the  plain
and unambiguous expression used therein rather than from any
notions which may be entertained by the court as to what  is
just  or expedient." The expressed intention must guide	 the
court.	 Another rule of construction which is	relevant  to
the  present  enquiry is expressed in the  maxim,  generalia
specialibus  non derogant, which means that when there is  a
conflict  between  a general and a  special  provision,	 the
latter shall prevail.  The said principle has been stated in
Craies on Statute Law, 5th Edn., at P. 205, thus
	      "The  rule  is,  that  whenever  there  is   a
	      particular  enactment and a general  enactment
	      in the same statute, and the latter, taken  in
	      its  most comprehensive sense, would  overrule
	      the  former, the particular enactment must  be
	      operative,  and the general enactment must  be
	      taken  to affect only the other parts  of	 the
	      statute to which it may properly apply."

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">388</span>
</pre><p id="p_27">But   this  rule  of  construction  is	not  of,   universal
application.   It is subject to the condition that there  is
nothing	 in  the general provision,  expressed	or  implied,
indicating  an	intention to the contrary : see	 Maxwell  on
Interpretation of Statutes, 11th Edn., at pp. 168-169.	When
the words of a section are clear, but its scope is sought to
be curtailed by construction, the approach suggested by Lord
Coke in Heydons case (1), yield better results :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">	      "To  arrive at the real meaning, it is  always
	      necessary	 to get an exact conception  of	 the
	      aim,  scope, and object of the whole Act :  to
	      consider,	 according to Lord Coke :  (1)	What
	      was  the	law before the Act was	passed;	 (2)
	      What was the mischief or defect for which	 the
	      law  had	not  provided  ;  (3)  What   remedy
	      Parliament has appointed ; and (4) The  reason
	      of the remedy."
</blockquote><p id="p_28">With these rules of construction in mind, let us now  tackle
the-problem  raised in this case.  Under<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_105"> s. 34(1)(a)</a>,  after
it was amended by the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_106">Finance Act</a>, 1956, a notice in respect
of an escaped concealed income could be issued at any  time.
The  terms of cl. (a) and the expression "at any  time"	 are
clear  and unambiguous and, if there is nothing in  the	 Act
detracting  from  the width of the said terms, it  is  clear
that  a notice can be issued at any time in respect  of	 the
concealed income of any year not being a year ending  before
March  31,  1941.  But<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_107"> s. 34(1A)</a> provides for the  issue  of
notice	in respect of escaped income of the  previous  years
within the period beginning on September 1, 1939, and ending
on  March 31, 1946.  Does this sub-section detract from	 the
generality  of	s.  34(1)(a)  ?	 The  history  of  the	said
provision  may	usefully  be noticed.	As  we	have  stated
earlier,  the  Parliament  passed  the	<a href="/doc/1959284/" id="a_108">Taxation  of  Income
(Investigation	Commission) Act</a>, 1947, mainly to  catch	 the
escaped incomes of the war profiteers.	This Court in  <a href="/doc/1623923/" id="a_109">Suraj
Mall  Mohta  and  Co. v. A. V.	Viswanatha  Sastri</a>  (2)	 and
Muthiah v. C.L.T. (3) held that<a href="/doc/949665/" id="a_110"> s. 5(4)</a> and <a href="/doc/949665/" id="a_111">5(1)</a> of the said
Act  became void on the commencement of the Constitution  as
offending  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_112">Art. 14</a> thereof.  The first decision led  to	 the
insertion of sub-ss. (IA) to (ID) in<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_113"> S. 34</a> by the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_114">Income-tax
(Amendment) Act</a>, 1954, with effect from July 17, 1954.	 The
object of the <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_115">Amending Act</a> was to provide for the assessment
or  re-assessment  of  persons who  had,  to  a	 substantial
extent, evaded payment of taxes during the war years and for
matters	 connected therewith.  But at the time	sub-s.	(IA)
was inserted in s.34, the period of limitation provided with
regard to issue of notices under<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_116"> s. 34(1)(a)</a> was 8 years and
for cases falling under<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_117"> s. 34(1)(b)</a> it was 4 years; but,  as
the  <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_118">Income-tax (Amendment) Act</a>, 1954, came into force	only
on July 17, 1954, the said periods of limitation  prescribed
in  respect  of escaped concealed incomes  during  the	said
period had run out except in respect
(1)  [1584] 3 Rep. 7b.			       (2) [1955]  1
S.C.R. 448.
</p><p id="p_29">(3)  [1955] 2 S.C.R. 1247.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">			    389</span>
<p id="p_30">of  one or two years.  So, with the twin object of  "tending
the  time and expediting the assessment, the second  proviso
was  introduced	 therein to the effect that no	such  notice
should be issued after March 31, 1956.	But, notwithstanding
the said Act, presumably notices could not have been  issued
against	 all the evaders of tax with incomes of	 rupees	 one
lakh or more during the said period.  Parliament also wanted
to bring to tax escaped concealed incomes during the  period
not covered by the said years.	With that object, in 1956<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_119"> s.
34</a>  was	 amended by the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_120">Finance Act</a>, 1956, by which  it	 Was
provided that notice under<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_121"> s. 34(1)(a)</a> can be issued at	 any
time.	But sub-s. (IA) was retained, including	 the  second
proviso.   This amendment, along with the other	 amendments,
made  by the said Act came into force on April 1, 1956.	  In
1959,  the  said  section was again amended  by	 the  <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_122">Indian
Income-tax  (Amendment)	 Act</a>, 1959.  Under  sub-s.  (4),  as
amended	 by  the  1959 amendment Act,  notice  under  sub-s.
(1)(a)	might be issued at any time notwithstanding that  at
the  time  of  the issue of notice the	period	of  8  years
specified  in that sub-section before its amendment  by	 the
<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_123">Finance	 Act</a>,  1956, had expired in respect of the  year  to
which  the notice related.  This amendment was	necessitated
by  the judgments of the Bombay and calcutta High Courts  in
<a href="/doc/1655740/" id="a_124">Debi  Dutt v. T. Belan</a>(1) and <a href="/doc/128548/" id="a_125">S. C. Prashar v.	Vasantsen</a>(2)
respectively  holding  that if the right of  the  Income-tax
Officer to reopen an assessment was barred under the law for
the  time being in force, no subsequent enlargement  of	 the
time could revive such right in the absence of "press  words
or necessary intendment.  Sub-section (4) was added to<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_126"> s. 34</a>
to  make it abundantly clear that notice under	s.  34(1)(a)
could  be issued at any time notwithstanding that  the	said
right  was  barred before the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_127">Amendment Act</a> of	1956.	This
history of the legislation loaves no room for doubt that the
intention  of  the  Legislature was  to	 bring	the  escaped
concealed income of rupees one lakh and more to tax  without
any time limit.	 Before the 1956 Act was passed, the  period
of  limitation prescribed for proceeding  against  concealed
incomes of rupees one lakh and more during the war years and
the  earlier years had expired.	 The Legislature stepped  in
to  prevent evasion of taxes on such incomes and lifted	 the
ban  of	 limitation in respect thereof, subject	 to  certain
conditions.
</p><p id="p_31">But  the  crucial question is, whether	the  Legislature  by
making	the relevant amendments has succeeded to  effectuate
its  intention.	  To state it differently,  do	the  amended
provisions carry out its intention ?
</p><p id="p_32"><a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_128">Section	 34(1)(a)</a>,  as it now stands on	 the  statute  book,
expressly states that in cases falling under cl. (a) of sub-
s. (1) notice can be served thereunder on an assessee at any
time.  The terms of<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_129"> s. 34(a)</a> read with the 2nd proviso, take
in the concealed incomes of all the,

years commencing from the year ending on March 31, 1941.  It
does not exclude the incomes of the war years, but the	said
incomes	 are  sought  to be excludes  on  the  principle  of
generalia specialibus non derogant.  As we have pointed	 out
earlier, the said doctrine embodies a rule of  construction,
but  it	 has no universal application.	To  invoke  it,	 the
general and special provisions shall occupy the same  field.
In this case, both during the period between the  amendments
of  1954  and 1956 and thereafter  they	 occupied  different
fields.	  By July 17, 1954, when sub-s. (IA) was  introduced
in <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_130"> s.	34</a>,  no	 proceedings  under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_131"> s.	 34(1)(a)</a>  could  be
initiated except for the assessment year 1946-47 in  respect
of the previous years that fell within the period  beginning
on September 1, 1939, and ending on March 31, 1946, for they
were  barred under the unmended section.  Sub-section  (IA),
therefore,  practically	 governed a situation that  was	 not
governed by the provisions of<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_132"> s. 34(1)(a)</a>.  It was  intended
to catch escaped incomes of the war years which were out  of
the reach of<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_133"> s. 34(1)(a)</a>.  It is not, therefore, appropriate
to  describe sub-s. (IA) as one carved out of sub-s.  (1)(a)
or to call it a species of which sub-s. (a)(1) is the genus.
Sub-section  (IA) operated where sub-s.	 (1)(a)	 practically
ceased to function.
</p><p id="p_34">Now,  coming to the period after the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_134">Finance Act</a>, 1956,	 was
passed,	 i.e.,	after April 1, 1956, a	different  situation
arose.	 The extended period given under the second  proviso
to sub-s. (IA) expired on March 31, 1956.  Thereafter,	sub-
s.  (IA) ceased to be operative in the sense that no  notice
could thereafter be given thereunder.  It worked itself out.
The  Legislature  could have extended the period  under	 the
second proviso to sub-s. (IA), but it did not do so. It	 did
not  give a further lease of life to it; instead it  removed
the period of limitation under sub-s. (1)(a), as sub-s. (IA)
had  become  practically defunct.  The wide  phraseology  of
sub-s.	(1)(a)	takes in all the escaped  concealed  incomes
during	all  the years commencing from 1941  and  confers  a
power  on the Income-tax ,Officer to give notice  thereunder
in   respect  of  the  said  incomes  without  any  bar	  of
limitation.  There is, therefore, no conflict after April 1,
1956,  between sub-s. (])(a) and sub-s. (]A), as the  latter
ceased to be operative.,
There is another way of looking at the problem.	 Sub-section
(IA) does not really prescribe any period of limitation.  It
enables the Income-tax Officer to take proceedings within  a
particular  time,  though  the	period	of  limitation	 had
expired.  In this view, no question of carving out a species
out of a genus arises.	It conferred a special power on	 the
Income-tax  Officer and the said power expired on  April  1.
1956.
</p><p id="p_35">There  is  yet another way of looking at the  problem.	 The
non-obstante  clause  in sub-s. (IA) indicates that  it	 was
enacted	 to  operate notwithstanding that the  period  of  8
years had expired.  The said
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">			    391</span>
sub-section  served  its purpose only when the period  of  8
years governed a notice under sub-s. (1)(a).  But when	that
bar  of	 limitation  was removed,  sub-s.  (IA)	 had  become
otiose.
</p><p id="p_36">Sub-section  (1B),  as amended by the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_135">Finance Act</a>  of  1956,
also  throws  some  light on the interpretation	 of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_136"> s.	 34</a>.
Before it was amended, an assessee to whom a notice had been
issued under sub-s. (1)(a) could apply to the Central  Board
of  Revenue for settlement of the amount of tax	 payable  by
him.  After the amendment, an assessee to whom a notice	 was
given  under sub-s. (1)(a) and under sub-s. (IA) for any  of
the  years ending on March 31, 1941 to 1948 could apply	 for
such  a relief to the Central Board of Revenue.	  The  years
1941   to  1948	 are  the  war	years.	 This	sub-section,
therefore, assumes that notice could be issued in respect of
the war years under sub-s. (1)(a).  The notice	contemplated
by sub-s. (1B) could only be a notice after the amendment of
1956,  for  such notice could not have been  issued  earlier
under  sub-s.  (1)(a)  in respect of the  said	years.	 The
notice	under  sub-s. (IA) obviously refers  to	 the  notice
issued before the amendment of 1956 and pending disposal.
Sub-section  (4) added by the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_137">Indian Income-tax	 (Amendment)
Act</a>,  1959,  also  reinforces  the  said  construction.	  As
indicated  earlier, that sub-section was added to  get	over
the legal objection that proceedings barred before 1956 were
not revived under the 1956 Act.	 It is true that sub-s.	 (4)
refers	only to sub-s. (1)(a), but the subsection  indicates
that  the  Legislature assumed that proceedings	 after	1956
could only be taken under sub-s. (1)(a).
</p><p id="p_37">It  was	 asked, with some plausibility, if  the	 Legislature
assumed that sub-s. (IA) ceased to be operative, why it	 was
retained  along	 with its proviso prescribing  a  period  of
limitation  in the amended section.  Though no	new  notices
could  be issued under that subsection after April 1,  1956.
notices already issued before that date were pending.	They
would  be  disposed of in the manner prescribed	 by  sub-ss.
(IA),  (1B),  (1C)  and (1D) of<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_138"> S. 34</a>.	All  the  said	sub-
sections  formed  an integral code.  The  Legislature,	pre-
sumably,  intended to keep the said-sub-sections  whereunder
proceedings had already been initiated and make available to
the said proceedings the procedure prescribed under the said
provisions.   It  may also be that sub-s. (1A) was  kept  in
super-abundant caution.	 Whatever that may be, it cannot, in
the  circumstances mentioned by us, detract from  the  clear
provisions of sub-s. (1)(a).
</p><p id="p_38">We have carefully gone through the judgments of the  various
High  Courts,  namely, Bombay, Madhya Pradesh,	Gujarat	 and
Calcutta,  cited at the Bar.  We received considerable	help
from the seasonings contained in the said judgments.  As  we
have   in  the	course	of  the	 judgment  dealt  with	 the
conflicting reasons given by
10 Sup.	 C. I./66-12.

<p id="p_39">the  High Courts, we do not think it necessary	to  consider
each  of  the  four judgments in detail.   For	the  reasons
mentioned  above we agree with the conclusion arrived at  by
the  Bombay and Calcutta High Courts in preference to  those
reached by the Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat High Courts.
In the result, the order of the High Court is set aside	 and
the  petition  filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_139">Art. 226</a> of the  Constitution  is
