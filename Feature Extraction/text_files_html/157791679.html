</p><p id="p_4"> 2.      Facts necessary to adjudicate the present appeal are briefly stated in

the succeeding paragraphs:
</p>
<p id="p_5">3.      The appellant is a pharmaceutical company incorporated under the

<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_1">Companies Act</a>, 1956 which markets drugs and formulations in India and

over 30 countries in the world under a wide range of distinctive

trademarks/brand names for the last several years. The appellant had an

annual turnover of `4000 crores for the year 2007-08 in the manufacturing of

specialty pharmaceuticals and active pharmaceutical ingredients. One of the

medicinal preparations marketed by the appellant is Oxcarbazepine, an

anticonvulsant and mood stabilizing drug used in the treatment of epilepsy

and bipolar disorder under the trade mark OXETOL.
</p>
<p id="p_6">4.      The appellant has been preparing and marketing this drug extensively

and commercially since October 2001. The appellant's trademark OXETOL

was registered in India in Class 5 under registration No. 1013231 on

31.05.2011 and No. 1232899 on 05.09.2003. The annual sales figure of the

medicine under the trademark OXETOL is `31.28 crores and approximately

`4.98 crores was spent on promotion and advertisement of this drug during

the year 2010-11.
</p>
<p id="p_7">


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">FAO (OS) 66/2014                                                     Page 2 of 18</span>
</p><p id="p_8"> 5.      Respondent No.1 adopted the trademark EXITOL which the appellant

came to know when Respondent No. 1's trademark application No. 1910625

dated 19.01.2010, on proposed to be used basis, was published in the Trade

Mark Journal No. 1455 dated 25.10.2010. The appellant sent legal notice to

respondent No.1 calling it to withdraw the impugned trademark application,

however the respondent did not give any reply and the appellant filed its

notice of opposition before the Registrar of Trade Marks.

</p><p id="p_9">6.      It is stated that the medicine under the impugned trademark EXITOL

is not available in any of the medicinal trade journals and/or markets.

Respondent No.1 through its counsel sent an e-mail dated 12.05.2011 to the

appellant offering to give an undertaking that they would confine the use of

the mark EXITOL to granules and syrups containing Lactitol Monohydrate

for treatment of constipation only and not use the mark towards any other

pharmaceutical product.
</p>
<p id="p_10">7.      The appellant wrote to the respondent's counsel seeking monetary

compensation proposing grant of regulating license for compensation/

license fee which was declined by the defendant's counsel. It is the case of

the appellant that the impugned trademark EXITOL of the respondent is

almost identical to the appellant's trademark OXETOL and thus the same




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">FAO (OS) 66/2014                                                   Page 3 of 18</span>
 amounts to infringement and the act of the respondent constitutes an unfair

competition as the respondents are using the trademark deceptively similar to

the trademark of the appellant and thus taking advantage of the financial and

human resources invested by the appellant since 2001 without incorporating

any cost themselves.
</p>
<p id="p_11">8.      The case of the respondent is that the respondent honestly adopted the

mark EXITOL for treatment of constipation since it contains the salt namely

Lactitol. The product is sold in syrup and granule form and there is

difference in the mark of the appellant and that of the defendant. Respondent

No.1 not only monitors the making of the products but also monitors the

finished products including the marketing of them and its products enjoy

great reputation and goodwill in the market.
</p>
<p id="p_12">9.      Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the appellant is a

registered proprietor of the trademark OXETOL and under <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_2">Section 28</a> of the

Trade Marks Act, 1999 is entitled to the exclusive right to use the same for

medicinal preparations which include all forms of drugs. The mark of the

defendant EXITOL being structurally and phonetically similar to the

trademark of the appellant is capable of causing deception and confusion and

constitutes infringement under <a href="/doc/1377106/" id="a_3">Section 29(1)</a> of the Trade Marks Act.

</p><p id="p_13"> 10.     Reliance is placed on the case reported as <a href="/doc/44364/" id="a_4">Franco Indian Research

Pvt. Ltd. v. Unichem Laboratories Ltd</a>.: 2005(30)PTC131(Bom) wherein it

was held:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">        â€•5. The Supreme Court in its Judgment in the case of Cadila
        Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (supra) has laid down the considerations that the
        Court has to keep in mind while considering the possibility of deception
        due to phonetic and/or visual similarity of trade mark in relation to
        pharmaceutical products. The Supreme Court observes thus:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">        "31. Trade mark is essentially adopted to advertise one's product and
        to make it known to the purchaser, it attempts to portray the nature
        and, if possible, the quality of the product and over a period of time
        the mark may become popular. It is usually at that stage that other
        people are tempted to pass off their products as that of the original
        owner of the mark. That is why it is said that in a passing-off action,
        the plaintiff's right is:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">              "against the conduct of the defendant which leads to or
              is intended or calculated to lead to deception. Passing-
              off is said to be a species of unfair trade competition or
              of actionable unfair trading by which one person,
              through deception, attempts to obtain an economic
              benefit of the reputation which another has established
              for himself in a particular trade or business. The action
              is regarded as an action for deceit." (<a href="/doc/330608/" id="a_5">See Wander Ltd. v.
              Antox India (P) Ltd</a>.)

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">        32. Public interest would support lesser degree of proof showing
        confusing similarity in the case of trade mark in respect of medicinal
        products as against other non-medicinal products. Drugs are poisons,
        not sweets. Confusion between medicinal products may, therefore,
        be life threatening, not merely' inconvenient. Nothing the frailty of
        human nature and the, pressures placed by society on doctors, there
        should be as many clear indicators as possible to distinguish two
        medicinal products from each other. It is not uncommon that in
        hospitals, drugs can be requested verbally and/or under
        critical/pressure situations. Many patients may be elderly, infirm or
        illiterate. They may not be in a position to differentiate between the

         medicine prescribed and bought which is ultimately handed over to
        them. This view finds support from McCarthy on Trade Marks, 3rd
        Edn., para 23.12 of which, reads as under:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">              "The tests of confusing similarity are modified when the
              goods involved are medicinal products. Confusion of
              source or product between medicinal products may
              produce physically harmful results to purchases and,
              greater protection is required than in the ordinary case.
              If the goods involved are medicinal products each with
              different effects and designed for even subtly different
              uses, confusion among the products caused by similar
              marks could have disastrous effects. For these reasons, it
              is proper to require a lesser quantum of proof of
              confusing similarity for drugs and medicinal
              preparations. The same standard has been applied to
              medical products such as surgical sutures and clavicle
              splints."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">        â€•It is clear from the above quoted observations of the Supreme Court
        that for the purposes of finding out possibility of deception due to
        similarity in the two trade marks, the Court has treated medicinal
        products as one class. The Supreme Court has also laid it down that the
        Court while considering trade marks in relation to any other goods,
        considers whether there is probability of confusion and/or deception but,
        insofar as medicinal preparations are concerned, the Court has to see
        whether there is a possibility of confusion or deception. The Supreme
        Court has observed that many patients may be elderly, infirm or
        illiterate, they may not be in a position to distinguish between two
        medicinal preparations. If one compares the registered trade mark of the
        plaintiffs 'EVACUOL' with the word mark of the defendants
        'EVACAL', it is clear that there is both, phonetic and visual similarity
        between the two marks. It is also not disputed that both are medicinal
        preparations. Therefore, applying the standards laid down by the
        Supreme Court referred to above, in my opinion, possibility of
        confusion and/or deception cannot be ruled out. Though it was
        submitted by the learned counsel appearing for defendants that the
        observations of the Supreme Court in Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd.'s case
        are too wide and that merely because the two goods involved are
        medicinal preparations, one cannot lose sight of the fact as to how the
        drug is to be administered, in what shops the drug is sold, for what




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">FAO (OS) 66/2014                                                           Page 6 of 18</span>
         ailment the drug is prescribed. However, considering the direct
        observations that have been made by the Supreme Court, it is -not
        possible for this Court to deviate from the law that has been laid down
        by the Supreme Court. So far as the reliance placed by the learned
        counsel on the Judgment in the case of Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd.
        (supra) is concerned, the observations regarding other surrounding
        circumstances to be considered by the Court in the matter of sale of the
        drug, size of the tablet etc. are after the Court recorded the finding that
        there is no phonetic similarity in the two trademarks. Therefore, those
        aspects were taken into consideration as additional facts for not granting
        an order of temporary injunction but once the Court comes to the
        conclusion that there is phonetic and visual similarity between the two
        marks, the Court cannot decline to grant injunction only because they
        are sold in different form, their wrappers are different and that they are
        prescribed for two different ailments. So far as the Judgment of the
        Division Bench relied on by the learned counsel for defendants in
        Medley Laboratories (P) Ltd.'s case is concerned, in my opinion, that
        Judgment cannot read to be laying down different law that the one laid
        down by the Supreme Court in Cadila's case as that Judgment has been
        referred to by the Division Bench. Once it is found that there is real
        possibility of there being deception because of the visual and phonetic
        similarity, in my opinion, the fact that the defendants might have
        adopted its trade mark honestly and bona fide, loses its significance.
        Even where the adoption, is honest and bona fide, but if it is likely to
        cause deception, then in my opinion, that the fact that the adoption was
        bona fide and honest would not come in the way of the Court granting
        temporary injunction in favour of the plaintiffs to prevent possibility of
        deception and/or confusion.â€–

</blockquote><p id="p_14">11.     It is submitted that the present case being an action for infringement,

the relevant consideration is only the similarity of the essential features of

the registered trademark and the impugned trademark as opposed to an

action for passing off wherein the defendant can escape liability by showing

dissimilar features. Differences between the appellant's mark and the

respondent's mark are therefore, irrelevant.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">FAO (OS) 66/2014                                                            Page 7 of 18</span>
</p><p id="p_16"> 12.     Per contra the respondent argues that the appellant's medicine under

the trademark OXETOL is used as anti-convulsant, mood stabilizing drug

for epilepsy, bipolar disorders, neurological disorders etc. The appellants

have never sold nor sell laxatives, have no presence in the laxatives business

at all. The respondents have invented the mark and honestly adopted the

same. The word â€•EXIâ€– is derived from â€•exitâ€– for constipation and â€•TOLâ€– is

derived from the generic name of the drug lactitol. EXITOL is thus an

invented word and not a dictionary word. Further there are major differences

between the mark of the appellant and the defendants, such as the name of

the product, word structure, active ingredient, product form, packaging,

artwork/ graphics, visual impression, disease condition, prescribing doctor,

purchasing public, consuming public and the price. It is therefore, highly

improbable that any confusion would persist between the two products.

</p><p id="p_17">13.     The learned Single Judge considering all the pleas raised on behalf of

the parties and on consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case

and both the competing marks held that the two trademarks are not similar

and are quite distinct. The said findings are vehemently challenged by the

appellants/plaintiffs in this appeal. In the light of the aforesaid submissions

and refutation of the same by the counsel appearing for the

reasons and findings thereon.

</blockquote><p id="p_20">16.     The guiding principles in an action for infringement are quite settled.

The Supreme Court has elaborately dealt with a case of infringement of

trademarks in pharmaceutical drugs in Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (supra)

and emphasized the need of a stricter standard in matters of infringement and

passing off involving pharmaceutical products.
</p>
<p id="p_21">17.     Counsel for the appellants has assailed the impugned order on two

broad arguments. The first being that in view of the observations made in

Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (supra) even the possibility of confusion

between competing trademarks is sufficient to arrive at a conclusion of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">FAO (OS) 66/2014                                                          Page 10 of 18</span>
 deception. In view of the varying infrastructure for supervision of physicians

and pharmacists of medical profession in our country due to linguistic,

urban, semi-urban and rural divide across the country and with high degree

of possibility of even accidental negligence, strict measures to prevent any

confusion arising from similarity of marks among medicines are required to

be taken. The second argument is that in an action for infringement, it is the

similarity in the competing trademarks that has to be considered and the

marks â€•OXETOLâ€– and â€•EXITOLâ€– are not only phonetically similar but also

capable of causing highly undesired confusion.
</p>
<p id="p_22">18.     The judgment of the Supreme Court in Cadila has to be read in its

entirety. The contours of the test laid down by the Supreme Court cannot be

restricted by an artificial process which focuses attention only upon the

factual aspect of both products being pharmaceutical preparations. A

subsequent part of the judgment, held thus:

similarity between two marks would automatically satisfy the test of

confusion to a man of average intelligence having imperfect recollection.

Both marks have to be seen as a whole. Admittedly, both the drugs are

schedule H drugs and are sold only on prescription. The word TOL is

prefixed by word â€—EXI' in the defendant's mark and by the word â€—OXE' in

the appellant's mark. It is common knowledge that the medicinal

single judge has rightly cited the case reported as <a href="/doc/1509899/" id="a_10">Astrazeneca UK Ltd. and

another v. Orchid Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals Ltd</a>.: 2007 (34) PTC

469 (Del) wherein similar words in competing marks being publici

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">               â€•21. In our considered opinion the facts of the said case
               are almost similar and squarely applicable to the facts
               of the present case. 'Meropenem' is the molecule which
               is used for treatment of bacterial infections. In that view
               of the matter, the abbreviation 'Mero' became a generic
               term, is publici Jurisdiction and it is distinctive in
               nature. Consequently, the appellants/plaintiffs cannot
               claim exclusive right to the use of 'Mero' as constituent
               of any trademark. The possibility of deception or
               confusion is also reduced practically to nil in view of
               the fact that the medicine is sold only on prescription by
               dealers. The common feature in both the competing
               marks i.e. 'Mero' is only descriptive and publici
               Jurisdiction and, Therefore, the customers would tend
               to ignore the common feature and would pay more
               attention to the uncommon feature. Even if they are
               expressed as a whole, the two did not have any phonetic
               similarity to make it objectionable. There are at least
               four other registered users of the prefix 'Mero' in India
               whereas the names of 35 companies using 'Mero'
               trademarks, which have been registered or applied for
               registration, have been furnished in the pleadings. The
               respondent/defendant      advertised      its    trademark
               'Meromer' after submitting its application for
               registration and at that stage, there was no opposition
               even from the appellants/plaintiffs. The trademark of
               the respondent/defendant was registered there being no
               opposition from any quarter, including the
               appellants/plaintiffs.

<blockquote id="blockquote_22">                22. Consequently, the two names, namely, 'Meromer'
               and 'Meronem' are found to be prima facie dissimilar to
               each other. They are Schedule-H drugs available only
               on doctor's prescription. The factum that the same are
               available only on doctor's prescription and not as an
               over the counter medicine is also relevant and has been
               rightly taken note of by the learned Single Judge. In our
               considered opinion, where the marks are distinct and
               the features are found to be dis-similar, they are not
               likely to create any confusion. It is also admitted by the
               parties that there is a difference in the price of the two
               products. The very fact that the two pharmaceutical
               products, one of the appellants/plaintiffs and the other
               of the respondent/ defendant, are being sold at different
               prices itself ensures that there is no possibility of any
               deception/confusion, particularly in view of the fact that
               customer who comes with the intention of purchasing
               the product of the appellants/plaintiffs would never
               settle for the product of the respondent/defendant which
               is priced much lower. It is apparent that the trademarks

different. The product of the appellant is available in capsules and tablets

two drugs are used for totally different purposes, as OXETOL is used as an

<blockquote id="blockquote_33">                   â€•12. Undoubtedly, while deciding the question of
                   infringement this court has to bear in mind that the
                   claim for infringement of the plaintiff is based on its
                   statutory right unlike a case of passing off. While
                   dealing with the trademarks ACICAL and ACUCAL

                   Anr. AIR 2012 Gujarat 142 the High Court noted that
                   the user of the two drugs was different, even the
                   relevant material and ingredients were different, the
                   chemical composition was different and so were the
                   mode of taking it, one being a chewable tablet while
                   the other a gulpable tablet. Applying the principal laid
                   down in Cadila Health Care it was held that prima
                   facie there was no such similarity in both the drugs
                   ACUCAL and ACICAL so that the same may cause
                   confusion in the mind of the chemist or the consumer.

                   (Del.) it was held that if a drug is ordered by hospital,
                   there is no reasonable likelihood that NIFTAS would
                   be passed off as NIFTRAN since the nurses and
                   doctors in the hospital are always in a position to
                   distinguish the drugs not only on account of difference
                   in the name but also on account of packaging, price of
                   the drugs and the form in which they are sold. In

                   that physicians are also not immune from confusion

                   while the other product was sold as intra-muscular
                   injection with huge difference in price. That being the
                   position, the balance of convenience was in favour of
