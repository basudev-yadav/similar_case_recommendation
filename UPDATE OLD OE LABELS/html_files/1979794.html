<p id="p_2">1.	Leave granted.
</p><p id="p_3">2.	The issue which arises for our consideration in these appeals relates to 
determination of situs of the High Court in which appeals would lie under 
<a href="/doc/116938606/" id="a_1">Section 35G(1)</a> of the Central Excise Act.  
</p><p id="p_4">3.	Appellant herein carries on business at Lucknow. It was assessed at 
the said place.  The matter, however, ultimately came up before Central 
Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT), New Delhi in 
Appeal No.E/2792/02-NBC.  The said Tribunal exercises jurisdiction in 
respect of cases arising within the territorial limits of the State of Uttar 
Pradesh, National Capital Territory of Delhi and the State of Maharashtra.  
</p><p id="p_5">4.	Having regard to the situs of the Tribunal, an appeal in terms of 
<a href="/doc/54762929/" id="a_2">Section 35G</a> of the Central Excise Act, 1944 was filed before the Delhi High 
Court.  A Division Bench of the said Court relying on or on the basis of an 
earlier Division Bench judgment in Bombay Snuff Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Union of 
India 2006 (194) ELT 264 opined that it had no territorial jurisdiction in the 
matter.
</p><p id="p_6">5.	Mr. C. Hari Shankar, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the 
appellant would submit that despite the fact that sub-section (9) of <a href="/doc/54762929/" id="a_3">Section 
35G</a> of the Act was brought to the notice of the High Court, the court 
refused to consider the effect thereof in determining the question of its 
jurisdiction.  Had the said provision been taken into consideration for 
determination of the issue, it was possible to hold that its decision in 
Bombay Snuff (supra) had been rendered per incurium.  Referring to the 
development of law governing the field, by reason of the amendment carried 
out by Parliament in the said Act as also other pari materia statutes, the 
learned counsel would submit that the High Court was wrong in arriving at 
the said conclusion. 
</p><p id="p_7">6.	Mr. G.E. Vahanvati, learned Solicitor General of India, on the other 
hand, would submit that the term 'cause of action' applicable in relation to a 
suit or a writ petition before the High Court having regard to clause 2 of 
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_4">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India cannot be the basis for determining 
the situs of the High Court to which an appeal shall lie under <a href="/doc/54762929/" id="a_5">section 35G</a> of 
the Act.  It was submitted that the situs of the Assessing Officer would be 
the determinative factor for the High Court to exercise its territorial 
jurisdiction in entertaining appeal thereunder and not the situs of the 
Tribunal alone. 
</p><p id="p_8">7.	We may, at the outset, notice some provisions of the Act which are 
relevant for our purpose:-
</p><p id="p_9">"35G. Appeal to High Court 
 (1) An appeal shall lie to the High Court from 
every order passed in appeal by the Appellate 
Tribunal on or after the 1st day of July, 2003 (not 
being an order relating, among other things, to the 
determination of any question having a relation to 
the rate of duty of excise or to the value of goods 
for the purposes of assessment), if the High Court 
is satisfied that the case involves a substantial 
question of law.
</p><p id="p_10">(2) The Commissioner of Central Excise or the 
other party aggrieved by any order passed by the 
Appellate Tribunal may file an appeal to the High 
Court and such appeal under this sub-section shall 
be---
</p><p id="p_11">(9) Save as otherwise provided in this Act, the 
provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908(5 
of 1908), relating to appeals to the High Court 
shall, as far as may be, apply in the case of appeals 
under this section." 
</p>
<p id="p_12"> 8.	In terms of the said provision, the questions involving "rate of duty of 
excise or the value of the goods" may be subjected to an appeal before the 
High Court, subject of course to its satisfaction that the matter involves a 
substantial question of law.  Sub-section (9) of <a href="/doc/54762929/" id="a_6">Section 35G</a>, prior to 1999, 
provided for application of the procedure of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 
mutatis mutandis to the appeals to the High Courts, recourse to which could 
be taken for challenging the final orders of the Tribunal before the High 
Court.  Post 1999, two provisions, namely, <a href="/doc/54762929/" id="a_7">Section 35G</a> and <a href="/doc/85476146/" id="a_8">Section 35H</a> 
were made available, the relevant provisions whereof are as under :-
"35G. Statement of case to High Court.--
</p><p id="p_13">(1) The Commissioner of Central Excise or the 
other party may, within sixty days of the date upon 
which he is served with notice of an order under

(not being an order relating, among other things, to 
the determination of any question having a relation 
to the rate of duty of excise or to the value of 
goods for purposes of assessment), by application 
in the prescribed form, accompanied, where the 
application is made by the other party, by a fee of 
two hundred rupees, require the Appellate Tribunal 
to refer to the High Court any question of law 
arising out of such order and, subject to the other 
provisions contained in this section, the Appellate 
Tribunal shall, within one hundred and twenty 
days of the receipt of such application, draw up a 
statement of the case and refer it to the High Court:
Provided that the Appellate Tribunal may, if it is 
satisfied that the applicant was prevented by 
sufficient cause from presenting the application 
within the period herein before specified, allow it 
to be presented within a further period not 
exceeding thirty days"
</p>
<p id="p_14">9.	<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_10">The Finance Act</a> of 2003, however, did away with the remedy of 
reference to the High Court, altogether, except in the case of final orders 
passed by the Tribunal on or before 1.7.2003.  Final orders passed after the 
said date by reason of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_11">Section 144</a> of the Finance Act, 2003 were made  
appealable to the High Court under an entirely substituted <a href="/doc/54762929/" id="a_12">Section 35G</a>, 
whereas <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_13">Section 145</a> of the Finance Act, 2003, amended  <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_14">Section 35H</a> of the 
Act to restrict its applicability to Final Orders passed after 1.7.2003.  <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_15">Section 
35H</a> as amended reads as under :-   
</p><p id="p_15">"35H. Application to High Court.--
</p><p id="p_16">(1) The Commissioner of Central Excise or the 
other party may, within one hundred and eighty 
days of the date upon which he is served with

[before the 1st day of July, 2003] (not being an 
order relating, among other things, to the 
determination of any question having a relation to

prescribed form, accompanied, where the 
application is made by the other party, by a fee of 
two hundred rupees, apply to the High Court to

Court any question of law arising from such order 
of the Tribunal.
</p><p id="p_17">(2) The Commissioner of Central Excise or the 
other party applying to the High Court under sub-
section (1) shall clearly state the question of law 
which he seeks to be referred to the High Court 
and shall also specify the paragraph in the order of 
the Appellate Tribunal relevant to the question 
sought to be referred. 
</p><p id="p_18">(3) On receipt of notice that an application has 
been made under sub-section (1), the person 
against whom such application has been made, 
may, notwithstanding that he may not have filed 
such application, file, within forty-five days of the 
receipt of the notice, a memorandum of cross-
objections verified in the prescribed manner 
against any part of the order in relation to which an 
application for reference has been made and such 
memorandum shall be disposed of by the High 
Court as if it were an application presented within 
the time specified in sub-section (1). 
</p><p id="p_19">(4) If, on an application made under sub-section 
(1), the High Court directs the Appellate Tribunal 
to refer the question of law raised in the 
application, the Appellate Tribunal shall, within 
one hundred and twenty days of the receipt of such 
direction, draw up a statement of the case and refer 
it to the High Court."
</p><p id="p_20">10.	Similar problems have arisen in respect of the decisions rendered by 
Tribunals constituted under different Acts, for example <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_17">Income Tax Act</a>.  
We are also not unmindful of a catena of decisions rendered by some High 
Courts that situs of the Tribunal is the determinative factor for reference 
and/or appeal before the High Court.
</p><p id="p_21">11.	The question incidentally came up for consideration before a 5 Judge 
Bench of this Court in Nasiruddin Vs. S.T.A. Tribunal AIR 1976 SC 331 
wherein, inter alia, it was held :-
</p><p id="p_22">"37. To sum up, our conclusions are as follows. 
First, there is no permanent seat of the High Court 
at Allahabad. The seats at Allahabad and at 
Lucknow may be changed in accordance with the 
provisions of the Order. Second, the Chief Justice 
of the High Court has no power to increase or 
decrease the areas in Oudh from time to time. The 
areas in Oudh have been determined once by the 
Chief Justice and, therefore, there is no scope for 
changing the areas. Third, the Chief Justice has 
power under the second proviso to paragraph 14 of 
the Order to direct in his discretion that any case or 
class of cases arising in Oudh areas shall be heard 
at Allahabad. Any case or class of cases are those 
which are instituted at Lucknow. The 
interpretation given by the High Court that the 
word "heard" confers powers on the Chief Justice 
to order that any case or class of cases arising in 
Oudh areas shall be instituted or filed at Allahabad 
instead of Lucknow is wrong. The word "heard" 
means that cases which have already been 
instituted or filed at Lucknow may in the discretion 
of the Chief Justice under the second proviso to 
paragraph 14 of the Order be directed to be heard 
at Allahabad. Fourth, the expression "cause of 
action" with regard to a civil matter means that it 
should be left to the litigant to institute cases at 
Lucknow Bench or at Allahabad Bench according 
to the cause of action arising wholly or in part 
within either of the areas. If the cause of action 
arises wholly within Oudh areas then the Lucknow 
Bench will have jurisdiction. Similarly, if the 
cause of action arises wholly outside the specified 
areas in Oudh then Allahabad will have 
jurisdiction. If the cause of action in part arises in 
the specified Oudh areas and part of the cause of 
action arises outside the specified areas, it will be 
open to the litigant to frame the case appropriately 
to attract the jurisdiction either at Lucknow or at 
Allahabad. Fifth, a criminal case arises where the 
offence has been committed or otherwise as 
provided in the Criminal Proceduce Code. That 
will attract the jurisdiction of the Court at 
Allahabad or Lucknow. In some cases depending 
on the facts and the provision regarding 
jurisdiction, it may arise in either place."
</p>
<p id="p_23">12.	The said decision proceeded on the basis that part of the cause of 
action may arise at the forum where the appellate order or the revisional 
order is sourced.  If, thus, a cause of action arises within one or the other 
High Court, the petitioner shall be the dominus litis.  Indisputably, if this set 
of reasoning is to be accepted, the impugned judgment as also the decision 
rendered in Bombay Snuff (supra) would not be correct.  Before dilating on 
the said proposition of law it may be noticed that the decision of a Tribunal 
would be binding on the Assessing Authority.  If the situs of the appellate 
Tribunal should be considered to be the determinative factor, a decision 
rendered by the Tribunal shall be binding on all the authorities exercising its 
jurisdiction under the said Tribunal.
</p><p id="p_24">13.	The Tribunal, as noticed hereinbefore, exercises jurisdiction over all 
the three States.  In all the three States there are High Courts.  In the event, 
the aggrieved person is treated to be the dominus litus, as a result whereof, 
he elects to file the appeal  before one or the other High Court, the decision 
of the High Court shall be binding only on the authorities which are within 
its jurisdiction.  It will only be of persuasive value on the authorities 
functioning under a different jurisdiction.  If the binding authority of a High 
Court does not extend beyond its territorial jurisdiction and the decision of 
one High Court would not be a binding precedent for other High Courts or 
Courts or Tribunals outside its territorial jurisdiction, some sort of judicial 
anarchy shall come into play.  An assessee, affected by an order of 
assessment made at Bombay, may invoke the jurisdiction of the Allahabad 
High Court to take advantage of the law laid down by it and which might 
suit him and thus he would be able to successfully evade the law laid down 
by the High Court at Bombay.
</p><p id="p_25">14.	Furthermore, when an appeal is provided under a statute, Parliament 
must have thought of one High Court.  It is a different matter that by way of 
necessity, a Tribunal may have to exercise jurisdiction over several States 
but it does not appeal to any reason that Parliament intended, despite 
providing for an appeal before the High Court, that appeals may be filed 
before different High Courts at the sweet will of the party aggrieved by the 
decision of the Tribunal.
</p><p id="p_26">15.	In a case of this nature, therefore, the cause of action doctrine may not 
be invoked.
</p><p id="p_27">16.	Sub-section 9 of Section 35G, whereupon Mr. C. Hari Shankar, 
learned counsel places strong reliance, in our opinion, does not answer the 
question placed before us.  Learned counsel contends that in terms of sub-
section 1 of Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the order of the 
First Appellate Court being a decree, a Second Appeal shall lie before the 
High Court subordinate thereto.
</p><p id="p_28"> 17.	There cannot be any doubt whatsoever that in terms of <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_18">Article 227</a> of 
the Constitution of India as also Clause (2) of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_19">Article 226</a> thereof, the High 
Court would exercise its discretionary jurisdiction as also power to issue writ 
of certiorari in respect of the orders passed by the Subordinate Courts within 
its territorial jurisdiction or if any cause of action has arisen therewithin but 
the same tests cannot be applied when the appellate court exercises a 
jurisdiction over Tribunal situated in more than one State.  In such a 
situation, in our opinion, the High Court situated in the State where the first 
court is located should be considered to be the appropriate appellate 
authority.  Code of Civil Procedure did not contemplate such a situation.  It 
provides for jurisdiction of each court.  Even a District Judge must exercise 
its jurisdiction only within the territorial limits of a State.  It is inconceivable 
under the Code of Civil Procedure that the jurisdiction of the District Court 
would be exercisable beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the District, save 
and except in such matters where the law specifically provides therefor. 
</p><p id="p_29">18.	The submission of Mr. C. Hari Shankar, learned counsel, as noticed 
hereinbefore, is inconsistent and contradictory.  The doctrine of dominus 
litus or doctrine of situs of the Appellate Tribunal do not go together.  
Dominus litus indicates that the suitor has more than one option, whereas the 
situs of an Appellate Tribunal refers to only one High Court wherein the 
appeal can be preferred.  We may consider two hypothetical cases in order to 
enable us to find out an answer.  A Tribunal may hear out a matter either at 
Allahabad or at Bombay and pass a judgment at that place.  Only because 
the head office is situated at Delhi, would it mean that a judgment delivered 
at Allahabad or at Bombay would not attain its finality then and there.  
</p><p id="p_30"> 19.	We may notice some incongruities if the contention of the appellant is 
taken to its logical conclusion.  It is possible that in a case of emergency 
while the Tribunal holding its sitting at Allahabad or Bombay may entertain 
a matter where the cause of action had arisen at Delhi.  But that would not 
mean that when the Tribunal pronounces its judgment at Allahabad or 
Bombay, although the cause of action had initially arisen at Delhi, the Delhi 
High Court would have no jurisdiction in relation thereto.
</p><p id="p_31">20.	The situs of a Tribunal may vary from time to time.  It could be Delhi 
or some other place.  Whether its jurisdiction would be extending to 3 States 
or more or less would depend upon the Executive order which may be 
issued.  Determination of the jurisdiction of a High Court on the touchstone 
of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_20">Sections 35G</a> and <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_21">35H</a> of the Act, in our opinion, should be considered 
only on the basis of statutory provisions and not anything else.  While 
defining High Court in terms of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_22">Section 36B</a> of the Act, the Parliament 
never, in our opinion, contemplated to have a situation of this nature.  
</p><p id="p_32">21.	An appeal may have to be filed by the Commissioner of Central 
Excise.  His office may be located in a different State.  If he has to prefer an 
appeal before the High Court, he would be put to a great inconvenience 
whereas, the assessee would not be. 
</p><p id="p_33">22.	We may, keeping in view the aforementioned backdrop, notice a few 
decisions.  In Commissioner of Income Tax, Madras Vs. S. Sivaramakrishna 
Iyer [AIR 1969 Mad 300], it was held :-
</p><p id="p_34">"On that view, we think that where a Tribunal has 
jurisdiction over more States than one, and it has 
got to make a choice, in the absence of a statutory 
provision, relating to the matter it must be guided 
by the principles of <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_23">Section 64</a>, that is to say, the 
place where the assessee carries on his business, 
profession or vocation or resides. On that test, it is 
the High Court of Kerala which will have 
jurisdiction.  There is also another approach to the 
question, namely, the subject-matter test As we 
mentioned, the penalty proceedings were originally 
initiated by the Income-tax Officer at Trichur and 
it was because of a directive by <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_24">Section 274(2)</a> he 
made a reference to the Inspecting Assistant 
Commissioner. But in effect, as we think, the 
penalty proceedings are but a continuation of the 
original assessment orders and the subsequent 
proceedings started by the Income-tax Officer at 
Trichur for levy of penalty. On that basis too, we 
are inclined to think that this court will have no 
jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_25">Section 66(2)</a>."
</p><p id="p_35"> 23.	A Division Bench of Delhi High Court in Seth Banarsi Dass Gupta 
Vs. Commissioner of Income Tax, 1978 (11) DLT 14, while construing 
<a href="/doc/711469/" id="a_26">Section 66</a> of the Income Tax Act, 1922, held as under :-
"The question then arises as to which High Court 
the Delhi Bench could refer the questions of law 
proposed in the applications under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_27">section 66(1)</a> of 
the Act. 
</p><p id="p_36">The only relevant provisions in the Act are those in 
<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_28">Section 66</a>. <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_29">Section 66(1)</a> merely states that within 
the time mentioned therein, the assessee or the 
Commissioner may require the Appellate Tribunal 
to refer to "the High Court" any question of law 
arising out of an order under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_30">Section 33</a>, and that 
the Appellate Tribunal shall within the time 
prescribed in the sub-section draw up a statement 
of case and refer the question to "the High Court" 
<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_31">Section 66(2)</a> provides that if the Appellate 
Tribunal refuses to state a case on an application 
under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_32">Section 66(1)</a> on the ground that no question 
of law arises, the assessee or the Commissioner, as 
the case maybe, may, within the time mentioned in 
the sub-section, apply to "the High Court", and 
"the High Court" if it is not satisfied with the 
correctness of the decision of the Appellate 
Tribunal, require the Appellate Tribunal to state 
the case and refer it. <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_33">Section 66(8)</a> provides that 
for the purposes of Section ' 66, "the High Court" 
means - (a) in relation to any State, the High Court 
of the State, and (b) in relations to the Union 
Territory of Delhi, the High Court of Delhi. 
The aforesaid provisions do not clearly indicate to 
which particular High Court the Appellate 
Tribunal has to make a reference under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_34">Section 
66(1)</a> or which High Court can call for a reference 
under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_35">Section 66(2)</a>, in a case where a Bench of 
the Appellate Tribunal has jurisdiction over more 
than one State."
</p>
<p id="p_37"> 24.	Referring to a judgment of Madras High Court, namely, 
Commissioner of Income Tax Vs. S. Sivaramakrishna Iyer 1968 (70) ITR 
860, the learned Judge opined :-
</p><p id="p_38">"The said provisions show that in a case where a 
reference is made to a High Court by a Bench of 
the Appellate Tribunal under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_36">section 66</a> of the Act 
the reference is just an intermediate stage, and the 
case (appeal before the Bench) would be finally 
disposed of by the Bench after receiving the 
judgment of the High Court in the reference. So, 
instead of adopting a different basis for that 
intermediate stage, if would be quite appropriate to 
adopt the same basis as the one adopted for 
determining the jurisdiction of the Bench. Thus, it 
would be appropriate and in consonance with the 
aforesaid provisions of the Act and the Standing 
Orders if the basis for the jurisdiction of the Bench 
is adopted, instead of adopting the basis mentioned 
in <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_37">Section 64</a> of the Act, as suggested in the 
decision of the Madras High Court in the case. 
<a href="/doc/1443432/" id="a_38">Commissioner of Income-tax, Madars v. S</a>. 
</p><p id="p_39">Sivaramakrishna Iyer."
</p> 
<p id="p_40"> 25.	Yet again in Suraj Woolen Mills Vs. Collector of Customs, 2000 
(123) ELT 471 (Del), Lahoti, J. as the learned Chief Justice of India then 
was, noticed the aforementioned decision as also other decisions operating in 
the field and held :-
</p><p id="p_41">"10. The Division Bench decision in the case of 
Seth Banarsi Dass Gupta has been followed by 
another Division Bench in Birla Cotton &amp; Spg 
Mills Ltd Vs. CIT Rajasthan (1980) 123 ITR 354. 
The assessee carried on business in Jaipur. It had 
its registered office in Delhi. The assessment 
orders were passed by ITO at Jaipur and appeals 
were disposed by the C at Jaipur. The matter came 
up before the Tribunal at Delhi and was heard by 
the Central Bench of the Income-tax Appellate 
Tribunal as there was no Tribunal at Jaipur. The 
Division Bench held that the court to which 
reference should be made would be the court 
having jurisdiction over the territory in which the 
office of the ITO was situated.
</p><p id="p_42">11. Recently the same principle has been followed 
by this Court in Suresh Desai &amp; Associates Vs. 
CIT [1991] 230 ITR 912. In this judgment, the 
Divi- sion Bench has assigned yet another reason 
why the High Court of that State wherefrom the 
matter arises would only be competent to hear the 
reference. A decision of one High Court is a 
binding authority within its territorial jurisdiction; 
but it is not a binding precedent for another High 
Court or Tribunal outside its territorial jurisdiction. 
The Division Bench has held as under :
</p><p id="p_43">	"On account of the abovesaid doctrine of 
precedents and the rule of binding efficacy of the 
law laid down by the High Court within its 
territorial jurisdiction, the questions of law arising 
for decision in a reference should be determined by 
the High Court which exercises territorial 
jurisdiction over the situs of the Assessing Officer. 
Else it would result in serious anomalies. An 
assessee affected by an assessment order at 
Bombay may invoke the jurisdiction of the Delhi 
High Court to take advantage of the law laid down 
by it and suited to him and thus get rid of the law 
laid down to the contrary by the High Court of 
Bombay not suited to the assessee. This cannot be 
allowed."
</p><p id="p_44">12. Having made a careful comparative reading of 
the provisions of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_39">Income-tax Act</a> and the 
<a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_40">Customs Act</a>, as also the relevant rules and orders 
of the Tribunal we are unhesitatingly of the 
opinion that the principles laid down in the 
abovesaid three Division Bench decisions of Delhi 
High Court can be applied and do apply to the 
facts and circumstances of the present case.
</p><p id="p_45">13. The present case arises out of the State of 
Bombay. The petitioner may have its factory 
establishment at Panipat in the State of Haryana 
but that is irrelevant. The adjudicating authority is 
at Bombay. Obviously it is bound by the law laid 
down under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_41">Customs Act</a> or 
any other law as interpreted by the High Court of 
Bombay. For the purpose of the case at hand, the 
petitioner must be held bound by the law as 
applicable and as prevailing in the State of 
Mahrashtra whereat the goods were to be imported 
and whereat the proceedings under the Act were 
concluded. In the case at hand if the CEGAT 
would have stated the case then the reference 
would have been made to the High Court of 
Bombay and in the event of the application for 
statement of case having been refused it is the 
High Court of Bombay which the petitioner should 
have approached for issuing a requi- sition to the 
Tribunal to state the case."

<p id="p_46"> 26.	In Commissioner of Central Excise, Delhi Vs. Enkay HWS India Ltd. 
2002 (139) E.L.T. 21, Arijit Pasayat &amp; D.K. Jain, JJ. in a case arising under 
<a href="/doc/85476146/" id="a_42">section 35H</a> of the Central Excise Act opined :-
"2. When the matter was placed for admission, we 
pointed out to learned counsel for the petitioner 
that this High Court does not have jurisdiction to 
deal with the matter, in view of the decision of this 
Court in Seth Banarsi Dass Gupta v. 
</p><p id="p_47">Commissioner of Income Tax (Central) [1978 
(113) ITR 817]. In the said case, white dealing 
with the scope of entertaining reference under the 
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_43">Income Tax Act</a>, 1961 (in short, 'the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_44">I.T Act</a>'), it 
was observed that this High Court, that the State 
within whose territorial jurisdiction original 
adjudicating authority functions would have 
jurisdiction to deal with the reference under the 
concerned Statute. The view was again reiterated 
in <a href="/doc/256177/" id="a_45">Suresh Desai and Associates v. Commissioner 
of Income Tax</a> [71 (1968) DLT 772]. That was 
also a case under <a href="/doc/1908938/" id="a_46">Section 256</a> (2) of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_47">I.T. Act</a>. In 
a petition for reference arising under the Act in 
Central Excise Case No. 5 of 1997 (<a href="/doc/250254/" id="a_48">Commissioner 
of Central Excise v. Technological Institute of 
Textile</a> decided on 9-11-1998, it was held that the 
High Court within whose jurisdiction adjudicating 
authority functions would have territorial 
jurisdiction to entertain the matter. We have also 
expressed similar view in <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_49">Central Excise Act</a> Case 
No. 7 of 2000 disposed of on 30-10-2000 taking 
note of decision of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/516106/" id="a_50">Stridewell 
Leather (P) Ltd. v. Bhankerpur Simbhaoli 
Beverages (P) Ltd</a>. [AIR 1944 SC 158], while 
dealing with the scope of expression "the High 
Court" under <a href="/doc/1609121/" id="a_51">Section 10F</a> of the Companies Act, 
1956 (in short, the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_52">Companies Act</a>').
</p><p id="p_48">3. We find no substance in the plea of learned 
counsel for petitioner that site of the 
Commissionerate or appellate authority determines 
the jurisdiction in view of what has been stated in 
the aforesaid decision."
</p>
<p id="p_49"> 27.	The said decisions were followed by the Division Bench of the High 
Court of  Bombay in Bombay Snuff (supra) to hold:-
"6. The only difference in the legal position that 
existed at the time the above decision was rendered 
and the position that prevails today is that instead 
of the law envisaging a reference from the 
Tribunal to the High Court, the law now provides 
for an appeal from every order passed by the 
Appellate Tribunal. That difference does not 
however affect the reasoning underlying the view 
taken by this Court in regard to its jurisdiction to 
entertain a petition under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_53">Section 35G</a>. If a petition 
seeking reference under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_54">Section 35G</a> was not 
maintainable in this court, there is no reason why 
an appeal under the said provision after its 
amendment can be said to be so maintainable. On 
the reasoning adopted by this court in 
Technological Institute of Textile's case (supra), an 
appeal under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_55">Section 35G</a> must also be filed only 
in the High Court who has jurisdiction over the 
authority from whose order the proceedings have 
originated. The fact that the main seat of the 
CESTAT is situated in Delhi or that the appeal was 
heard and decided at Delhi would not mean that all 
appeals arising from cases so decided regardless 
from Page 2522 which State the case has 
originated can be maintained in this court."
</p>
<p id="p_50"> 28.	Before the High Court, the decision of this Court in Kusum Ingots &amp; 
Alloys Ltd. Vs. Union of India 2004 (168) ELT 3, wherein one of us was a 
member, was strongly relied upon.  Therein, this Court while construing the 
provisions of clause 2 of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_56">Article 226</a>, held:-
"25. The said decision is an authority for the 
proposition that the place from where an appellate 
order or a revisional order is passed may give rise 
to a part of cause of action although the original 
order was at a place outside the said area. When a 
part of the cause of action arises within one or the 
other High Court, it will be for the petitioner to 
choose his forum."
</p><p id="p_51">  29.	The decisions operating in the field, which have been taken note of in 
Kusum Ingots &amp; Alloys Ltd. (supra), would clearly go to show how the situs 
doctrine had been given a go-bye by making constitutional amendments.  At 
one point of time writ petitions against the Union of India were being filed 
only before the Punjab &amp; Haryana High Court as the said Court exercised 
territorial jurisdiction over Delhi, which was the seat of the Central 
Government.  Experiencing difficulties, clause 1A of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_57">Article 226</a> was 
introduced.  The Constitution again underwent a change by way of insertion 
of clause 2 of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_58">Article 226.</a>  Bombay Snuff (supra) has been followed by 
Karnataka High Court in Big  Apple Computers Vs. Commissioner of 
Customs &amp; Central Excise, Hyderabad 2007 (207) ELT 36, wherein it was 
held :-
</p><p id="p_52">"10. This judgment clearly applies to the facts of 
this case. We also see a subsequent judgment of 
the Delhi High Court 2006 (194) ELT 264. In the 
said case, the High Court was considering as to 
whether in terms of <a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_59">Section 35(G)</a><a href="/doc/743985/" id="a_60">3</a> of the Customs 
Act the Delhi High Court could consider the 
appeal, filed by the assessee. The tribunal in para 6 
noticed as under;
</p><p id="p_53">6. The only difference in the legal position that 
existed at the time the above decision was rendered 
and the position that prevails today is that instead 
of the law envisaging a reference from the tribunal 
to the High Court, the law now provides for an 
appeal from every order passed by the appellate 
tribunal. That difference does not however affect 
the reasoning underlying the view taken by this 
court in regard to its jurisdiction to entertain a 
petition under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_61">Section 35G</a>. If a petition seeking 
reference under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_62">Section 35G</a> was not maintainable 
in this court, there is no reason why an appeal 
under the said provision after its amendment can 
be said to be maintainable. On the reasoning 
adopted by this amendment can be said to be so 
maintainable. On the reasoning adopted by this 
court in Technological Institute of Textile's case 
(supra), an appeal under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_63">Section 35G</a> must also be 
filed only in the High Court who has jurisdiction 
over the authority from whose order the 
proceedings have originated. The fact that the main 
seat of the CESTAT is situated in Delhi or that the 
appeal was heard and decided at Delhi would not 
mean that all appeals arising from cases so decided 
regardless from which State the case has originated 
can be maintained in this court." 
</p>
<p id="p_54"> 30.	In Nasiruddin (supra) and Kusum Ingots &amp; Alloys Ltd. (supra), the 
court was not dealing with a question of this nature.  Therefore, the same are 
not authorities for the proposition that the High Court, which is situated at 
the same place as the situs of the Tribunal, alone will have jurisdiction. If the 
cause of action doctrine, as analysed hereinbefore is given effect to, 
invariably more than one high Court may have jurisdiction, which is not 
contemplated.
</p><p id="p_55">31.	The learned Solicitor General relies upon the decision in Stridewell 
Leathers (P) Ltd. &amp; Ors. Vs. Bhankerpur Simbhaoli Beverages (P) Ltd. 
(1994) 1 SCC 34 wherein construing <a href="/doc/1904729/" id="a_64">Section 10A</a> vis-`-vis <a href="/doc/1609121/" id="a_65">Section 10F</a> of 
Companies Act, 1956, it was held that the High Court would mean the High 
Court having jurisdiction in relation to a place at which the registered office 
of the Company concerned is situated as indicated in <a href="/doc/1764790/" id="a_66">Section 2(11)</a> read with 
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_67">Section 1A</a> thereof.
</p><p id="p_56">32.	We are, however, of the view that in terms of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_68">Companies Act</a>, "the 
High Court" was clearly intended to specify the particular High Court 
identified by <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_69">Section 10F</a> itself, and therefore, it was held not to be a High 
Court indicated by the place at which Company Law Board passes the order 
under appeal.
</p><p id="p_57">33.	However, our attention has been drawn to Gurdit Singh &amp; Ors. Vs. 
Munsha Singh &amp; Ors. AIR 1977 SC 640, wherein this Court opined that no 
distinction could legitimately been drawn between the right to sue and cause 
of action unless so indicated in the relevant statute.  Yet again in M/s. M. 
Ramnarain Pvt. Ltd. &amp; Anr. Vs. State Trading Corpn. Of India Ltd.  (1983) 
3 SCC 75, a right to appeal was held to be carrying with it distinct cause of 
action stating :- 
</p>
<p id="p_58">"It is his submission that in considering the 
provisions of Order 23, Rule 1, the relevant fact to 
be borne in mind is the subject matter of the appeal 
and if the subject matter of the appeal be different, 
as in the present case it is the earlier appeal No. 36 
of 1981 being confined to the subject matter of 
instalment and the subsequent appeal No. 44 of 
1981 being against the decree on the merits of the 
claim,the withdrawal of the earlier appeal 
cannot, in any way, be a bar to the maintainability 
of the subsequent appeal. Mr. Nariman has in this 
connection referred to the decision of this Court in 
Vallabhdas v. Dr. Madan Lal and Ors. in which 
this Court "equated the meaning of the words 
"subject matter" in Order 23 Rule 1 with the 
meaning of the words "cause of action" in Order 
23 Rule 2. Relying on this decision, Mr. Nariman 
has argued that the "subject matter" of the appeal 
within the meaning of Order 23, Rule 1, must be 
considered in the light of the meaning of the words 
"cause of action" in Order 2, Rule 2; and it is his 
argument that as the "cause of action" in respect of 
the claim for instalment is entirely different from 
the "cause of action" in respect of decree which 
embraces within its fold the 'subject matter" of the 
respective claims of the parties in the suit, the 
withdrawal of the earlier appeal No. 36 of 1981 
against the instalments cannot in any way affect 
the maintain ability of the appeal No. 44 of 1981 
against the decree on the merits of the claim.  Mr. 
Nariman has next contended that the provisions of 
Order 2, Rule 2 of the Civil Procedure Code do not 
in any way affect the maintainability and the 
merits of the present appeal No. 44 of 1981. He 
has submitted that the said provisions have no 
application to an appeal and in any event, the cause 
of action and the subject matter of the present 
appeal are entirely different from the cause of 
action and the subject of the earlier appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_59"> 34.	As against this, the submission of the learned Attorney General was as 
under:
</p><p id="p_60">"It is his argument that the right of appeal which is 
no doubt a statutory right will also necessarily be 
governed by the provisions of Order 2, Rule 2 and 
as the appeal is filed not against the entire subject 
matter of appeal arising out of the cause of action 
in the appeal, the right to file another appeal 
against the decree is clearly lost."
</p>
<p id="p_61"> 35.	Accepting Mr. Nariman's submissions, this Hon'ble Court ruled thus:
</p>
<p id="p_62">"Even if the principles underlying Order 2, Rule 2 
can be considered to apply to an appeal, the 
maintainability of the instant case cannot be held 
to be affected in any way as the cause of action in 
respect of the present appeal is entirely different 
from the cause of action on the basis of which the 
earlier appeal had been filed."  (Emphasis 
supplied)

</p><p id="p_63"> 36.	In that case the jurisdiction of the High Court was not to be 
determined in order to give effect to the doctrine of 'cause of action' 
envisaged under the Code of Civil Procedure.
</p>
<p id="p_64">37.	However, we are not oblivious of another line of authority where the 
situs of the Tribunal was held to be the basis for determination of the 
jurisdiction of the High Court.  In the said decisions, however, the 
contentions which have been raised before us did not arise for consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_65"> 38.	We have noticed hereinbefore that if the decision of the High Court in 
the aforementioned question is taken to its logical conclusion, the same 
would lead to a great anomaly.  It would also give rise to the problem of 
forum shopping.  We may notice some examples to show that the 
determination of the appellate forum based upon the situs of the Tribunal 
would lead to an anomalous result.  For example, 'an assessee affected by an 
assessment order in Bombay may invoke the jurisdiction of the Delhi High 
Court to take advantage of the law laid down by it which may be contrary to 
judgments of the High Court of Bombay.  This cannot be allowed. [<a href="/doc/256177/" id="a_70">See 
Suresh Desai and Associates V. CIT</a> 1998 (230) ITR 912 at 915-<a href="/doc/250254/" id="a_71">917 and 
CCE V. M/s. Technological Institute of Textile</a> in 76 (1998) DLT 862 (DB].
</p>
<p id="p_66">39.	Section 20(c) of the Code of Civil Procedure reads as under:
</p>
<p id="p_67">"20. Other suits to be instituted where defendant 
reside or cause of action arises. Subject to the 
limitation aforesaid, every suit shall be instituted in 
a court within the local limits of whose 
jurisdiction
</p><p id="p_68">(c) the cause of act5ion, wholly, or in part, arises." 
</p>
<p id="p_69">40.	Although in view of Section 141 of the Code of Civil Procedure the 
provisions thereof would not apply to writ proceedings, the phraseology 
used in Section 20(c) of the Code of Civil Procedure and Clause (2) of 
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_72">Article 226</a>, being in pari materia, the decisions of this Court rendered on 
interpretation of Section 20(c) of CPC shall apply to the writ proceedings 
also.  Before proceeding to discuss the matter further it may be pointed out 
that the entire bundle of facts pleaded need not constitute a cause of action, 
as what is necessary to be proved, before the petitioner can obtain a decree, 
is material facts.  The expression material facts is also known as integral 
facts.
</p><p id="p_70">41.	Keeping in view the expression "cause of action" used in clause (2) of 
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_73">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, indisputably even if a small fraction 
thereof accrues within the jurisdiction of the Court, the Court will have 
jurisdiction in the matter though the doctrine of forum conveniens may also 
have to be considered.
</p><p id="p_71">42.	In Mussummat Chand Kour V. Partap Singh (15 1A 156), it was 
held:-
</p>
<p id="p_72">"....the cause of action has no relation whatever to 
the defence which may be set up by the defendant, 
nor does it depend upon the character of the relief 
prayed for by the plaintiff.  It refers entirely to the 
ground set forth in the plaint as the cause of action, 
or, in other words, to the media upon which the 
plaintiff asks the court to arrive at a conclusion in 
his favour."   
</p><p id="p_73">	For the reasons aforementioned, we are of the opinion that the High 
Court was correct in its view.  These appeals, therefore, being devoid of any 
merit, deserve to be dismissed.  However, in the facts and circumstances of 
this case, there shall be no order as to costs.
