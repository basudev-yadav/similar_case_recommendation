HEADNOTE:
    The	 First	Respondent was a Minister  and	subsequently
Chief  Minister	 of  Haryana State. Later  he  became  Union
Minister. On 12.11.1987 a complaint was presented before the
Haryana	 Chief	Minister, wherein serious  allegations	were
levelled against the First Respondent. The main	 allegations
were  that  he accumulated huge properties worth  crores  of
rupees	in  the names of his family members,  relations	 and
persons close to him by misusing his power and position	 and
by undervaluing the market price, and all those transactions
were  benami  in character. According  to  the	complainant,
since  the accumulation of the properties by the  First	 Re-
spondent, in the shape of buildings, land, shares, ornaments
etc. was far beyond his legal means, an investigation should
be directed against him.
260
    The Chief Minister's Secretariat marked the complaint to
the  Director  General of Police, who in turn  endorsed	 the
same  to  the  Superintendent of Police	 concerned.  On	 the
direction from the Superintendent of Police, the SHO  regis-
tered  a  case under <a href="/doc/48127346/" id="a_4">Sections 161</a> and <a href="/doc/126359453/" id="a_5">165</a>  of  Indian  Penal
Code,  1860  and  under <a href="/doc/1420677/" id="a_6">section 5(2)</a> of	 the  Prevention  of
Corruption Act, 1947 and took up the investigation.
    Meanwhile,	the First Respondent filed a  Writ  Petition
before	the  High Court for a direction to quash  the  First
Information  Report and for restraining the appellants	from
proceeding  further with the investigation. The	 High  Court
quashed	 the  entire criminal proceedings holding  that	 the
allegations  did  not constitute a  cognizable	offence	 for
commencing lawful investigation.
    Aggrieved by the judgment of the High Court, the  appel-
lants  preferred the present appeal by special	leave,	con-
tending	 that  the allegations contained in  the  complaint,
either individually or collectively, constituted a  cogniza-
ble offence warranting the registration of a case as contem-
plated under <a href="/doc/378667/" id="a_7">Section 154(1)</a> Cr. P.C., and a thorough  inves-
tigation  in  compliance with various  statutory  provisions ï7
3
    On	behalf of the Respondents, it was contended that  on
account	 of the deep rooted political animosity and  rivalry
entertained  by	 the then Chief Minister, he used  the	com-
plainant, who was stooge in his hands, to file the complaint
containing  false  and scurrilous  allegations	against	 the
First Respondent and hence the criminal proceedings  rightly
deserved to be quashed.
Disposing of the appeal, this Court,
    HELD:  1.  The judgment of the High Court  quashing	 the
First  Information Report is set aside as not being  legally
and factually sustainable in law. However, the	commencement
as well as the entire investigation, if any, so far done  is
quashed on the ground that the third appellant (SHO) is	 not
clothed with valid legal authority to take up the investiga-
tion and proceed with the same within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_8">Section
5A(1)</a> of the Prevention of Corruption Act. [319A-C]
     2.	 The observations made by the High Court are  unwar-
ranted	and  the historical anecdote is out of	context	 and
inappropriate.	If such a view is to be judicially  accepted
and  approved, then it will be tantamount to laying down  an
alarming proposition that an incoming
261
Government  under all circumstances, should put its seal  of
approval to all the commissions and omissions of the  outgo-
ing  Government	 ignoring even glaring	lapses	and  serious
misdeeds  and the deleterious and  destructive	consequences
that may follow therefrom. [318E-<a href="/doc/502277/" id="a_9">F]

    3.1. If any information disclosing a cognizable  offence
is  laid  before an officer-in-charge of  a  police  station
satisfying the requirements of Section 154(1) of the  Crimi-
nal<a href="/doc/1645922/" id="a_14">  Procedure	Code</a>, the said police officer has  no  other
option	except	to enter the substance thereof in  the	pre-
scribed	 form,	that is to say, to register a  case  on	 the
basis of such information. [279G]
    3.2.  Though a police officer cannot investigate a	non- ï7
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">3</span>
offence,  he can investigate a non-cognizable offence  under
the  order  of a Magistrate having power to  try  such	non-
cognizable  case  or commit the same for  trial	 within	 the
terms  under <a href="/doc/1062869/" id="a_15">Section 155(2)</a> of the Code but subject to	Sec-

Sub-section (4) to <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_17">Section 155</a>, where a case relates to	 two
offences to which atleast one is cognizable, the case  shall
be  deemed to be a cognizable case notwithstanding that	 the
other offences are non-cognizable and, therefore, under such
circumstances  the  police  officers  can  investigate	such
offences with the same powers as he has while  investigating
a cognizable offence. [279H; 280A-B]

of Criminal Procedure is that if a police officer has reason
to  suspect the commission of a cognizable offence, he	must
either proceed with the investigation or cause an investiga-
tion to be proceeded with by his subordinate; that in a case
where  the  police  officer sees no  sufficient	 ground	 for
investigation, he can dispense with the investigation  alto-
gether;	 that the field of investigation of  any  cognizable
offence	 is exclusively within the domain of the  investiga-
tion agencies over which the Courts cannot have

control	 and  have no power to stiffle or impinge  upon	 the
proceedings  in the investigation so long as the  investiga-
tion proceeds in compliance with the provisions relating  to
investigation and that it is only in a case wherein a police
officer decides not to investigate an offence, the concerned
Magistrate can intervene and either direct an  investigation
or in the alternative, if he thinks fit, he himself can,  at
once proceed or depute any Magistrate sub-ordinate to him to
proceed	 to hold a preliminary inquiry into or otherwise  to
dispose	 of  the case in the manner provided  in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_21">  the  Code</a>.

sagacity of rationally inferring the commission of a cogniz-

    5.2.  The  commencement  of investigation  by  a  police

ly,  the police officer should subjectively satisfy  himself
as to whether there is sufficient ground for entering on  an

</p><p id="p_6">    6.	The investigation of an offence is the field  exclu-
sively reserved for the police officers whose powers in that
field  are  unfettered so long as the power  to	 investigate
into  the cognizable offences is legitimately  exercised  in
strict compliance with the provisions falling under  Chapter
XII of the Code and the Courts are not justified in obliter-
ating  the  track of investigation  when  the  investigating
agencies  are well within their legal bounds.  A  noticeable
feature of the scheme under Chapter XIV of the Code is	that
a  Magistrate  is kept in the picture at all stages  of	 the
police	investigation but he is not authorised to  interfere
with  the actual investigation or to direct the	 police	 how
that  investigation  is	 to be conducted. But  if  a  police
officer transgresses the circumscribed limits and improperly
and  illegally exercises his investigatory powers in  breach
of any statutory provision causing serious prejudice to	 the
personal  liberty and also property of a citizen,  then	 the
Court,	on being approached by the person aggrieved for	 the
redress	 of  any grievance has to consider  the	 nature	 and
extent	of the breach and pass appropriate orders as may  be
called	for  without leaving the citizens to  the  mercy  of
police	echelons since human dignity is a dear value of	 our
Constitution. No one can demand absolute immunity even if he
is wrong and claim unquestionable right and unlimited powers

    7.1 The view of the High Court that the non-filing of  a
written	 statement  by a competent authority  of  the  State
Government  by	way of reply to the averments  in  the	Writ
Petition was serious flaw on the part of the appellants	 and
as such the averments of Respondent No. 1 should be held  as
having	disproved  the	entire crimination  alleged  in	 the
F.I.R., is neither conceivable nor comprehensible. [293D]
7.2. It is true that some of the allegations do suffer	from
misty
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">264</span>
vagueness  and	lack of particulars. Further, there  are  no
specific  averments  that  either Respondent No.  1  or	 his
relations and friends had no source of income to  accumulate
the properties now standing in their names and that Respond-
ent No. 1 showed any favour to them by misusing his official
position. [294B-C]
    These  are	all  matters which would  be  examined	only
during	the  course of investigation and thereafter  by	 the
court on the material collected and placed before it by	 the
investigating  agencies. The question whether the  relations
and friends of Respondent No. 1 have independently purchased
the properties out of their own funds or not, also cannot be
decided	 by the Court at this stage on the denial  statement
of Respondent No. 1 alone. [294C-<a href="/doc/1926500/" id="a_39">D]

</p><p id="p_17">    9.1. The entire matter is only at a premature stage	 and
the investigation has not proceeded with except some prelim-
inary  effort taken on the date of the registration  of	 the
case.  The  evidence  has to be gathered  after	 a  thorough
investigation  and placed before the Court on the  basis  of
which  alone the Court can come to a conclusion one  way  or
the other on the plea of mala fides. If the allegations	 are
bereft of truth and made maliciously, the investigation will
say  so. At this stage, when there are only allegations	 and
recriminations but no evidence, this Court cannot anticipate
the result of the investigation and render a finding on	 the
question  of mala fides on the materials at present  avail-.
able. Therefore, it cannot be said that the complaint should
be thrown overboard on the mere unsubstantiated plea of mala
fides.	Even  assuming	that the complainant  has  laid	 the
complaint only on account of his personal animosity that, by
itself,	 will not be a ground to discard the complaint	con-
taining	 serious  allegations which have to  be	 tested	 and
weighed after the evidence is collected. [307G-H; 308A-D] ï73

    10.2. In the instant case, the SP seems to have exhibit-
ed some over-enthusiasm, presumably to please 'some one' and
had  directed the SHO to register the case  and	 investigate
the  same even on the very first day of the receipt  of	 the
complaint  from the DGP, in whose office the  complaint	 was
lying  for merely 9 days. This unprecedented  overenthusiasm
shown by the S.P., without disclosing the reasons for making
an order entrusting the investigation to the SHO who is	 not
a  designated  officer under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_73">Section  5A(1)</a>,  really  shocks
ones' sense of justice and fair play even though the untest-
ed  allegations	 made in the complaint	require	 a  thorough
investigation. Still, it is an inexplicable riddle as to why
the  S.P. had departed from the normal rule and	 hastly	 or-
dered  the SHO to investigate the serious  allegations,	 le-
velled against a former Chief Minister and a Minister in the
Cabinet of the Central Government on the face of the  regis-
tration	 of  the case. However, this conduct of the  SP	 can
never serve as a ground for quashing the FIR. [298C-<a href="/doc/1147392/" id="a_74">E]

    11.1. A police officer not below the rank of an  Inspec-
tor of Police authorised by the State Government in terms of
the  First proviso can take up the investigation of  an	 of-
fence  referred	 to  in clause (e) of <a href="/doc/1229833/" id="a_76">Section  5(1)</a>  of	 the
Prevention  of Corruption Act, only on a separate and  inde-
pendent	 order of a police officer not below the rank  of  a
Superintendent of Police. A strict compliance of the  second
proviso	 is an additional legal requirement to that  of	 the
first  proviso for conferring a valid authority on a  police
officer	 not  below the rank of an Inspector  of  Police  to
investigate  an offence falling under clause (e) of  <a href="/doc/1229833/" id="a_77">Section
5(1)</a> of the Act. This is clearly spelt out from the  expres-
sion  "further	provided" occurring in the  second  proviso.
Thus, investigation by the designated Police Officers is the
rule  and investigation by an officer of a lower rank is  an
exception. [311H; 312A-B]

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">268</span>
<p id="p_19">tion of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_78">Corruption Act</a> authorising an officer of lower	rank
to  conduct  the  investigation is not to be  treated  by  a
Magistrate  as a mere matter of routine, but it is an  exer-
cise of his judicial discretion having regard to the  policy
underlying  and the order giving the permission	 should,  on
the  face  of  it, disclose the reasons	 for  granting	such
permission.  The  Superintendent  of Police  or	 any  police
officer	 of higher rank while granting permission to a	non-
designated police officer in exercise of his power under the
second	provision to <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_79">Section 5A(1)</a>, should  satisfy  himself
that  there are good and sufficient reasons to	entrust	 the
investigation  with such police officer of a lower rank	 and
record his reasons for doing so; because the very object  of
the  legislature in enacting <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_80">Section 5A</a> is to see  that	 the
investigation  of offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1149958/" id="a_81">Sections  16</a>  <a href="/doc/1500729/" id="a_82">1</a>,
<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_83">165</a>  or	 165A<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_84"> of Indian Penal Code</a> as well  as	those  under
<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_85">Section 5</a> of the Act should be done ordinarily by the  offi-
cers designated in clauses (a) to (d) of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_86">Section 5A(1)</a>.	 The
exception  should  be for adequate reasons which  should  be
disclosed  on the face of the order. Strict compliance	with
<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_87">Section	 5A(1)</a> becomes absolutely necessary because  it	 ex-
pressly prohibits police officers below certain ranks,	from
investigating into offences under <a href="/doc/48127346/" id="a_88">Sections 161</a>, <a href="/doc/126359453/" id="a_89">165</a> and <a href="/doc/54942699/" id="a_90">165A</a>

State  Government in this behalf and from effecting  arrests

    11.3.  The main object of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_92">Section 5A</a> is to	protect	 the

illegality but that illegality committed in the course of an
investigation does not affect the competence and the  juris-
diction	 of the Court for trial and where the cognizance  of
the case has in fact been taken and the case is proceeded to
termination the validity of the proceedings with the preced-
ing investigation does not vitiate the result unless miscar-
riage of justice has been caused thereby. [311C; 312D-E]
    11.4.  In the instant case, there is absolutely no	rea-
son,  given by the S.P. in directing the SHe to	 investigate
and  as such the order of the S.P. is directly in  violation
of the dictum laid down by this Court in several  decisions.
The  third appellant, SHO is not clothed with the  requisite
legal  authority within the meaning of the second  provision

al of Police to investigate only the offences failing  under
<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_105">Section	 5</a> of the Act. Therefore, the SHO who has  taken  up
the  investigation of the offences inclusive of those  under
<a href="/doc/48127346/" id="a_106">Section	 161</a>  and  <a href="/doc/126359453/" id="a_107">165</a> IPC is not at all  clothed  with	 any

the  Act.  However, as the question relating  to  the  legal
authority of the SHO is raised even at the initial stage, it
would  be proper and also desirable that the  investigation,
if  at all to be proceeded with in the opinion of the  State
Government,  should  proceed only on the basis	of  a  valid
order  in strict compliance with the mandatory provision  of
