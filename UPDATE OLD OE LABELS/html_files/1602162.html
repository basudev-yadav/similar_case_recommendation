Undertakings in	 <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_1">India) Act</a>,  1976-Company acquired  by	 the
Government and vested in a statutory corporation-Corporation
if State-Test for determining whether a body is State within
the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_2">article 12.</a>



HEADNOTE:
     Under a  voluntary retirement  scheme in  force in	 the
company the  petitioner, a clerk in Burmah Shell Oil Storage
Ltd., retired  voluntarily after qualifying for pension. The
pension payable to him was regulated by the terms of a trust
deed of	 1950 under  which a  pension fund  was set  up	 and
regulations were made for its administration. The petitioner
was also  covered by  a scheme under the Employees Provident
Fund and  <a href="/doc/269107/" id="a_3">Miscellaneous Provisions Act</a>, 1952 and to gratuity
under the <a href="/doc/553799/" id="a_4">Payment of Gratuity Act</a>, 1972.
     The annual	 pension to  which he was entitled under the
trust deed,  without making  the  authorised  deductions  as
provided under	regulation 16  of the trust deed, worked out
to a  sum of  Rs.  165.99  per	mensem.	 He  was  also	paid
supplementary retirement benefit of Rs. 86/- per month for a
period of  13 months  after his retirement which was stopped
thereafter.
     The employer  informed the	 petitioner that from out of
his pension  of Rs.  165.99 two deductions were made, one of
which was  on account  of employees  provident fund  payment
made to the pensioner and the other on account of payment of
gratuity with  the result  the pension	payable to  him	 was
shown as  Rs. 40.05.  The company  also cut  off the monthly
payment	 of   Rs.  86/-	 which	was  paid  as  supplementary
retirement benefit  on the  score that	it  was	 ex  gratia,
discretionary and  liable to  be stopped  at any time by the
employer.
     In the  meantime the company was statutorily taken over
by force of the Burmah Shell (Acquisition of Undertakings in
<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_5">India) Act</a>,  1976. Thereafter  the Central  Government	took
steps to  vest the undertaking in the second respondent, the
Bharat Petroleum,  which then became the statutory successor
of the	petitioner's employer. His pensionary rights such as
he  had,   therefore,  became	claimable  from	 the  second
respondent.
     A preliminary  objection was  raised on  behalf of	 the
corporation that  no  writ  would  lie	against	 the  second
respondent since it is neither a government department nor a
statutory corporation but just a company.
^
     HELD : By the Court :
     The petitioner  is entitled  to  the  payment  of	full
pension.
(per majority Krishna Iyer and Chinnappa Reddy, JJ Pathak, J
dissenting).
     1. The  Bharat Petroleum is State within the meaning of
<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_6">Article 12</a>  of the  Constitution and a writ will lie against
it under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_7">Article 32.</a> [128A]
112
     (a) The  settled position	in law is that any authority
under the  control of  Government of  India comes within the
definition of  State. On  the appointed	 day the right title
and interest  in  Burmah  Shell	 did  vest  in	the  Central
Government and by virtue of <a href="/doc/164300103/" id="a_8">section 3</a> the Central Government
was the	 transferee of	the undertaking.  While	 the  formal
ownership was  cast in	the  corporate	mould,	the  reality
reaches down  to State	control. The  core fact	 is that the
Central Government, through <a href="/doc/735354/" id="a_9">section 7</a> chose to make over its
own property  to its  own offspring.  Therefore, the  Burmah
Shell though  a government  company is	but the alter ego of
the Central  Government and  must, therefore,  be treated as
definitionally caught  in the  net of State since a juristic
veil worn  for certain	legal purposes cannot obliterate the
true character	of the entity for purposes of constitutional
law. [121A; G; 124 D-E]
     (b) Corporate  personality is  a  reality	and  not  an
illusion or  fictitious construction  of the  law. It  is  a
legal person. Merely because a company or other legal person
has functional	and jural individuality for certain purposes
and in	certain areas of law, it does not necessarily follow
that for  the effective	 enforcement of	 fundamental  rights
under the  constitutional scheme,  the Court should not scan
the real  character of	that entity.  In  the  instant	case
<a href="/doc/735354/" id="a_10">section 7</a> gives a statutory recognition and a status above a
mere government	 company. If  the entity  is no	 more than a
company under  the Company  Law or  society  under  the	 law
relating to  registered societies  or cooperative  societies
one cannot call it an authority. [124F; 125B, E]
     (c) An authority in administrative law is a body having
jurisdiction  in   certain  matters   of  a  public  nature.
Therefore, the ability conferred upon a person by the law to
alter, by  his own  will directed  to that  end, the rights,
duties, liabilities  or other  legal  relations,  either  of
himself or of other persons must be present ab extra to make
a person  an "authority".  When the  person is	an `agent or
instrument of  the functions  of the  State'  the  power  is
public. [125F-H]
     Sometimes the test is formulated, by asking whether the
corporation is	formed by  a statute or under a statute. The
true test  is not  how legal  person is	 born but  why it is
created. Apart	from discharging functions or doing business
as the	proxy of  the State  there must	 be  an	 element  of
ability to  affect legal relations by virtue of power vested
in it by law. [126A-B]
     (d) In  the instant  case <a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_11">sections	 3</a> and	<a href="/doc/735354/" id="a_12">7</a> clothe the
company with  State functions.	<a href="/doc/735354/" id="a_13">Section 7</a>  contemplates that
the company  should step  into the  shoes of  the  executive
power  of   the	 State.	  The  legislative  history  of	 the
corporation shows  that it  is	more  than  a  mere  company
registered under  the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_14">Companies Act</a>. Matters like conditions
of service  of employees,  adjudication of disputes relating
to employees, superannuation and welfare funds and so on are
regulated  statutorily	 unlike	 in  the  case	of  ordinary
companies. <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_15">Sections  9</a> and <a href="/doc/492977/" id="a_16">10</a> create rights and duties vis a
vis the	 government company  itself apart from the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_17">Companies
Act</a>. <a href="/doc/1678224/" id="a_18">Section 11</a> specifically gives the Act primacy vis a vis
other laws.  <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_19">Section 12</a>	 clothes the Government company with
power to  take delivery of the property of Burmah Shell from
every person  in whose	possession, custody  or control such
property may  be. Whatever  its character  antecedent to the
Act all	 the relevant provisions have transformed it into an
instrumentality of  the Central	 Government  with  a  strong
indicia of  power to make it an "authority". It is a limb of
the Government, an agency of the State, a vicarious creature
of statute. [126C-H, 127B-C]
113
     2. Some  of the  tests laid  down	by  this  Court	 for
deciding whether  a body  is State  within  the	 meaning  of
<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_20">Article 12</a> are :
     (i) If  the entire	 share capital of the corporation is
held  by   Government,	it  would  go  a  long	way  towards
indicating that	 the corporation  is an	 instrumentality  or
agency of the Government;
     (ii) A  finding of	 State	financial  support  plus  an
unusual degree	of control  over the management and policies
might lead,  one  to  characterise  an	operation  as  State
action.
     (iii) The existence of deep and pervasive State control
may afford  an indication  that the  Corporation is  a State
agency or instrumentality.
     (iv) Whether  the corporation  enjoys  monopoly  status
which is  State conferred  or State  protected is a relevant
factor.
     (v) If  the functions  of the corporation are important
public functions  and related  to governmental	functions it
would be a relevant factor in classifying the corporation as
instrumentality or agency of the Government.
     (vi) If  a department of Government is transferred to a
corporation, it	 would be  a strong factor supportive of the
inference that it is an instrumentality of the State. [137E-
H]
     (vii) Where the chemistry of the corporate body answers
the test  of State it comes within the definition of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_21">Article
12.</a> [136D]
     (viii)  Whether  the  legal  person  is  a	 corporation
created by  a statute, as distinguished from under a statute
is  not	 an  important	criterion  although  it	 may  be  an
indicium. [144H]

India</a> [1975] 3 S.C.R. 616 distinguished.
     3(a) Having  regard to  the directive in <a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_27">Article 38</a> and
the amplitude  of the  other articles  in part IV Government
may appropriately embark upon almost any activity which in a
non-socialist republic	may fall  within the private sector.
Any person's  employment, entertainment,  travel,  rest	 and
leisure,  hospital  facility  and  funeral  service  may  be
controlled by  the State  and if  all these  enterprises are
executed through  government companies,	 bureaus, societies,
councils, institutes  and homes, the citizen may forfeit his
fundamental freedoms  vis a  vis these	strange beings which
are government	in fact	 but  corporate	 in  form.  If	only
fundamental rights  were forbidden  access to  corporations,
companies, bureaus,  institutes, councils and kindred bodies
which act  as agencies	of the administration there may be a
breakdown of the rule of law and the constitutional order in
a large sector of governmental activity carried on under the
guise of `jural persons'. It may
114
pave the  way for  a new tyranny by arbitrary administrators
operated from behind by Government but unaccountable to part
III of	the Constitution.  The Court  cannot  assent  to  an
interpretation which  leads to	such a disastrous conclusion
unless	the   language	of   <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_28">Article  12</a>   offers  no  other
alternative. [147C-F]
     (b) It  is dangerous to exonerate corporations from the
need  to   have	 constitutional	  conscience;  and  so	that
interpretation,	   language    permitting,    which    makes
governmental agencies,	whatever  their	 mein,	amenable  to
constitutional limitations  must be  adopted by the court as
against the alternative of permitting them to flourish as an
imperium in imperio. [148A-B]
     (c) The  common-sense signification  of the  expression
"other authorities  under the  control of  the Government of
India" is plain and there is no reason to make exclusions on
sophisticated grounds  such as that the legal person must be
a statutory  corporation, must have power to make laws, must
be created by and not under a statute and so on. [148C]
     4(a) It  is clear	from <a href="/doc/492977/" id="a_29">section 10</a> which relates to the
provident fund,	 pension, welfare fund and the like that the
second respondent  has made  provision for  the	 rights	 and
interests of  the beneficiaries	 of the trust established by
Burmah Shell for the benefit of persons employed by it. Sub-
section (1)  puts this	matter beyond doubt. This obligation
of the	second respondent  is a	 statutory  one	 and  having
regard to  the	provisions  of	<a href="/doc/1678224/" id="a_30">section	 11</a>,  it  cannot  be
affected by  any instrument or decree or order. The stautory
continuation of	 a pre-existing	 liability to  pay  pension,
provident fund	or gratuity, cannot be avoided having regard
to <a href="/doc/492977/" id="a_31">section 10</a>. [150D-E]
     (b) Assuming  that regulation  16 authorities deduction
and that  discretionary payments,  although enjoyed  by	 the
employees are  liable  to  be  stopped	<a href="/doc/1724879/" id="a_32">section	 12</a>  of	 the
Provident Fund	Act forbids  any such reduction or deduction
out of	the benefits in the nature of old age pension on the
score of  the payment of contribution to the provident fund.
The benignant provision contained in <a href="/doc/1216959/" id="a_33">section 12</a> must receive
a benignant construction and even if two interpretations are
permissible,  that  which  furthers  the  beneficial  object
should be  preferred. From that perspective the inference is
reasonable that	 the total quantum of benefits in the nature
of old age pension, gratuity or provident fund, shall not be
reduced by  reason only of the liability of the employer for
payment of  contribution to  the fund.	The section prevails
over the trust deed. The provident fund accrues by statutory
force and  <a href="/doc/1216959/" id="a_34">section 12</a>  overrides any  agreement	 authorising
deductions. The expression `instrument' contained in <a href="/doc/1173330/" id="a_35">section
15</a> covers  a trust  deed and  notwithstanding the  deduction
that may  be sanctioned	 by the	 trust deed,  the overriding
effect of  <a href="/doc/865734/" id="a_36">section 14</a> preserves the pension and immunises it
against any  deduction attributable to the statutory payment
of the	provident fund.	 The deduction	made by	 the  second
respondent is in that event illegal. [151A-H]
     (c) If regulation 16 is a provision which imposes a cut
in certain  eventualities it  is possible  to hold  that the
employee has  a certain	 pensionary right.  But if  he draws
provident fund	or gratuity  that pension will be pared down
by a separate rule of deduction from the pension. It follows
that  there   is  no   straining  of  the  language  of	 the
regulations to	mean, firstly, a right to pension quantified
in certain  manner and,	 secondly, a right in the Management
to make	 deduction from out of that pension if other retiral
benefits are  drawn by	the employee. That appears to be the
pension scheme.
115
If this	 be correct,  there is	no substance in the argument
that the  pension itself  is automatically  reduced  into  a
smaller scale  of pension  on the drawl of provident fund or
gratuity. Pension  is one  thing, deduction  is another. The
latter is independent of pension and operates on the pension
to amputate  it, as  it were.  If a  law forbids such cut or
amputation the pension remains intact. [152B-D]
     (d) The  payment of  gratuity or  provident fund should
not occasion  any deduction from the pension as a "set-off".
Otherwise,  the	  solemn   statutory   provisions   ensuring
provident fund	and gratuity  become illusory.	Pensions are
paid out  of regard  for past meritorious services. The root
of  gratuity  and  the	foundation  of	provident  fund	 are
different. Each	 one is	 a salutary  benefaction statutorily
guaranteed independently of the other. Even assuming that by
private treaty	parties had  otherwise agreed  to deductions
before the  coming into force of these beneficial enactments
they cannot  now be  deprivatory. It  is precisely  to guard
against such  mischief that  the non-obstante and overriding
provisions are engrafted on these statutes. [152F-G]
     (e) It  is not  open to the second respondent to deduct
from the  full pension any sum based upon regulation 16 read
with regulation	 13. If regulation 16 which now has acquired
statutory flavour,  having been	 adapted  and  continued  by
statutory rules,  operates contrary to the provisions of the
P.F. Act  and the  <a href="/doc/553799/" id="a_37">Gratuity Act</a>,  it must  fail as  invalid.
[153C]
     (f) What  is discretionary depends on the discretion of
the employer.  But that power when exercised by an agency of
government like	 the second  respondent, must  be based upon
good faith  and due  care. If  as a  measure of	 reprisal or
provoked by  the drawl	of gratuity,  or by  resort to legal
authorities, such  supplementary benefit  is struck  off, it
will cease to be bona fide or valid. [153D-E]
Pathak, J. (dissenting)
     On the  merits the	 petitioner should be granted relief
as proposed by the majority. [154 G]
     It is  difficult to  accept the  proposition  that	 the
Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited is a "State" within the
meaning of  <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_38">Article 12</a>	of the	Constitution, but the matter
appears to  be concluded  because of  the direction taken by
the law since <a href="/doc/1281050/" id="a_39">Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. International Airport
Authority</a> [1979] 3 S.C.R. 489 a wider range of debate on the
fundamental principles involved in the issue would have been
welcomed in  view  of  the  implications  flowing  from	 the
definition of  a "government  company" in the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_40">Companies Act</a>,
1956. [154 D]
     The provisions  of the  Burmah  Shell  (Acquisition  of
Undertakings in	 <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_41">India) Act</a>,  1976 do  not alter  the  basic
nature of  a "government company". They are provisions which
could well  have been  applied to  a private corporation, if
the Act	 had selected one for vesting the undertaking in it.
Had that  been done,  they would  not have  made the private
corporation a State. [154F]

Shell Oil  Storage  Ltd.,  (Burmah  Shell,  for	 short)	 and
retired betimes	 (at 50)  after qualifying for a pension, on
April 1,  1973. He  was also  covered by  a scheme under the
Employees Provident  Funds and Family Pension Fund Act, 1952

Government, acting  under the  statute, took necessary steps

administration.	 Regulations   13  and	 15   entitled	 the
petitioner  to	 pension  and	contained  the	formula	 for
quantification. Regulation  13 has  a significant  clause  :
"less the authorised deductions specified in reg. 16, namely
......". The bone of contention between the parties is about
these
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">118</span>
deductions and	we may	set out	 this  Regulation  (relevant
part) even here :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">	  16.  The  authorised	deductions  to	be  made  in
     calculating the  amount of	 a non-contributing member's
     pension shall be as follows :
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">	  (1) A	 sum equal  to four  per cent of such amount
     standing to  the credit  of the  member at the relevant
     date in  any Provident Fund as represents any Company's
     contributions to  that fund in respect of the period of
     the member's  Accredited Service (including bonuses and
     interest on such contributions upto that date).
	  (2) A	 sum equal  to four  per cent  of any amount
     which before the relevant date the member has withdrawn
     from a  Provident Fund  in so far as such withdrawal is
     under the	Rules of  the Provident Fund charged against
     the  period   of  the   member's	Accredited   Service
     (including bonuses	 and interest  thereon) or  has been
     paid out to him during his Accredited Service under the
     Rules of Provident Fund, together with interest thereon
     from the  date of	such withdrawal	 or receipt  to	 the
     relevant date.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">	  (3) If  the Company so elects, a sum not exceeding

     in connection  with the termination of his service with
     that company  together with  interest thereon  from the
     date of payments down to the relevant date.</blockquote>
<p id="p_16">     The Pension  Fund, on  the vesting	 of Burmah  Shell in
Respondent 2,  came to	be administered	 by the latter under
the Burmah  Shell (Acquisition	of  Undertakings  in  India)
(Administration of Fund) Rules, 1976. The Rules provided for
the  Government	  company,  viz.   Respondent  2  acting  in
accordance with	 the provisions of the rules and regulations
applicable  to	or  of	any  law  governing  the  respective
Provident Fund,	 Welfare Fund  or other	 fund and  in  force
immediately before the 24th day of January, 1976.
</p><p id="p_17">     If	 any   legal  provision	  overrode  the	  regulation
authorising deductions	the 2nd	 respondent could and should
act according  to the legislation. Thus, the statutory rules
for administering  pensionary matters direct Respondent 2 to
conform to  `any law'  governing  provident  fund  and	like
items. And if, as is contended before us by the petitioner,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">119</span>
such law exists, the regulation based deduction ceases to be
an `authorised deduction'.
</p><p id="p_18">     By virtue	of reg. 13, the petitioner was entitled to a
pension of  Rs. 165.99	subject to  certain deductions which
form the  controversy in  this case.  He was also being paid
Supplementary Retirement Benefit of Rs. 86/- per month for a
period of  13 months  after his retirement which was stopped
thereafter. This stoppage is also assailed before us.
</p><p id="p_19">     By	 letter	 dated	September  25,	1974,  the  employer
(Burmah Shell) explained that from out of the pension of Rs.
165.99 two  deductions were  authorised by reg. 16. One such
deduction was  based on	 reg.  16(1)  because  of  Employees
Provident Fund payment to the pensioner and the other rested
on  reg.   16(3)  on   account	of   payment  of   gratuity.
Resultantly, the `pension payable' was shown as Rs. 40.05.
</p><p id="p_20">     The case  becomes clear  if one more fact is mentioned.
The petitioner	claimed	 and  received	his  Provident	Fund
amount under  the PF Act and recovered a gratuity amount due
under the  <a href="/doc/553799/" id="a_47">Payment of  Gratuity Act</a>,  1972 (for	 short,	 the
<a href="/doc/553799/" id="a_48">Gratuity Act</a>).	It is necessary to mention that Burmah Shell
was refused  exemption, under <a href="/doc/1766793/" id="a_49"> s. 5</a>,  from the	operation of
this Act  (vide Annexure  F to the Writ Petition). In short,
two sums,  one under  the PF  Act and  the other  under	 the
<a href="/doc/553799/" id="a_50">Gratuity Act</a>,  were drawn  by the  pensioner. Consequent  on
this, Burmah  Shell made  2 deductions from the petitioner's
pension, taking	 its stand  on reg.  16 read  with  reg.  13
already referred  to. Indeed,  the company  went even beyond
this, in  its letter  of May  8, 1974,	by cutting  off	 the
monthly payment of Rs. 86/- paid as Supplementary Retirement
Benefit on  the score  that it	was ex gratia, discretionary
and liable to be stopped any time by the employer.
</p><p id="p_21">     The petitioner  was intimated  by the Burmah Shell that
consequent on  his drawal  of provident	 fund  and  gratuity
benefits, the  quantum of  his pension	would suffer  a	 pro
tanto shrinkage, leaving a monthly puny pension of Rs. 40/-.
Since no superannuated soul can survive, in Indian indigence
and  inflationary   spiral,  on	 Rs.  40/-  per	 month,	 the
petitioner has come to this court challenging the deductions
from  his  original  pension  as  illegal  and	inhuman	 and
demanding  restoration	 of  the   full	 sum  which  he	 was
originally drawing.  His right to property under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_51">Art. 19</a> has
been violated, he claims.
</p><p id="p_22">     It may  well be,  as urged	 by the Corporation, that if
reg. 16 does govern, the deductions are warranted. Likewise,
if the	Supplementary Retiral  Benefit	is  purely  a  mercy
gesture, savouring  of no  manner of  right nor	 subject  to
restrictions on discretionary exercise, the sudden
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">120</span>
stoppage  of  that  sum	 perhaps  not  illegal.	 It  may  be
heartless, but	not necessarily	 lawless, for  a  prosperous
undertaking, now  in the  public sector,  which	 pays  over-
generous salaries  to higher  officials and  liberal  scales
even to	 its lesser  employees, to  destroy  the  pensionary
survival of an erstwhile employee who had served 28 long and
fruitful years of his limited span of life for the profit of
his employer.
</p><p id="p_23">     Justice according to law being the rule, let us examine
the validity  of the  rival contentions. The employer relies
on reg.	 16  and  the  pensioner  rests	 his  claim  on	 its
invalidity. The	 mantle of  `Burmah Shell'  has	 statutorily
fallen on  `Bharat Petroleum'  and it cannot be controverted
that if	 reg. 16,  read with  reg. 13,	be valid  the second
respondent can	insist on  its `pound  of flesh'  and  claim
lawfully that  the deductions  made are `authorised' and the
discretion to  stop supplementary  pension is  charity which
can be choked off at pleasure or anger.
</p><p id="p_24">     A preliminary  objection has  been raised by Shri G. B.
Pai that  no writ  will lie  against the  second  respondent
since it  is neither a government department nor a statutory
corporation but	 just a	 company and  so  the  court  should
reject out  of hand this proceeding under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_52">Art. 32.</a> We do see
the  force   of	  this	 contention,   notwithstanding	 the
observations in	 the Airport Authority Case, that the status
of `State'  will attach to the government companies like the
second respondent.
</p><p id="p_25">     Let us  first look	 at the	 facts emerging from the Act
and the	 superimpose the law in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_53">Art. 12</a> which conceptualises
`State' for  the purposes  of Part  III. After all, cynicism
apart, Mark Twain is good chewing gum for lawyers :(3)
	  Get your  facts first,  and then  you can  distort
     them as much as you please.
</p><p id="p_26">It is common ground that the present writ petition, invoking
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_54">Art. 32</a>, is limited to issuing directions or orders or writs
for the	 enforcement of	 fundamental rights and the question
is whether  the addressee  is the `State' within the meaning
of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_55">Art.	 12</a>  of	 the  Constitution.  We	 will  examine	this
position more closely a little later, but granting that <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_56">Art.
19</a> is  aimed  at  State	 action	 the  contours	of  `State',
conceptually speaking,	are largely  confined to <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_57">Art. 12.</a> We
have to	 study the anatomy of the Corporation in the setting
of the	Act and	 decide whether it comes within the scope of
that Article.  We have	only an	 inclusive definition, not a
conclusive definition.	One thing  is clear.  Any  authority
under
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">121</span>
the control  of the  Government of  India comes	 within	 the
definition. Before  expanding on this theme, we may scan the
statutory scheme, the purpose of the legislative project and
the nature  of the  juristic instrument	 it has	 created for
fulfillment   of    that   purpose.   Where   constitutional
fundamentals, vital  to the survival of human rights, are at
stake functional  realism, not facial cosmetics, must be the
diagnostic  tool.   Law,  constitutional   law,	 seeks	 the
substance, not	merely the  form. For, one may look like the
innocent flower	 but be	 the serpent under it. The preamble,
which ordinarily  illumines the object of the statute, makes
it  plain   that  what	 is   intended	 and   achieved	  is
nationalisation of an undertaking of strategic importance :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">	  AND WHEREAS it is expedient in the public interest
     that the  undertakings in	India, of  Burmah Shell	 Oil
     Storage and  Distributing	Company	 of  India  Limited,
     should  be	  acquired  in	order  to  ensure  that	 the
     ownership	and   control  of   the	 petroleum  products
     distributed and  marketed in  India by the said company
     are vested	 in the	 State and thereby so distributed as
     best to subserve the common good;
</blockquote><p id="p_27">It is true that what is nationalised is a private enterprise
motivated, undoubtedly,	 by the	 need for  transferring	 the
ownership and  control of  the	company	 and  its  petroleum
products distributed  and marketed  in India.  <a href="/doc/309888/" id="a_58">Section 3</a>  is
important from this angle :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">	  3. On	 the appointed	day, the  right,  title	 and
     interest  of   Burmah  Shell,   in	 relation   to	 its
     undertakings in  India, shall stand transferred to, and
     shall vest in the Central Government.</blockquote>
<p id="p_28">     This provision  lays bare	the central object of making
the Central Government the proprietor of the undertaking. It
hardly needs  argument to convince a court that by virtue of
s. 3,  the Central  Government	is  the	 transferee  of	 the
Undertaking. Had a writ proceeding been commenced during the
period of  vesting in  the Central  Government, it could not
have been  resisted on	the score  that the  employer is not
"the State".  The appointed  day did  arrive and  the right,
title and  interest in	Burmah Shell did vest in the Central
Government.
</p><p id="p_29">     A commercial  undertaking although	 permitted to be run
under our constitutional scheme by Government, may be better
managed with professional skills and on business principles,
guided, of  course, by social goals, if it were administered
with  commercial   fexibility	and   celerity	 free	from
departmental rigidity, slow motion procedures and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">122</span>
hierarchy of  officers. That  is why  a considerable part of
the public undertakings is in the corporate sector.
</p><p id="p_30">     It is  interesting that  with the industrial expansion,
economics was  assisted by jurisprudence and law invented or
at  least  expanded  the  corporate  concept  to  facilitate
economic development consistently with the rule of law. Said
Woodrow Wilson, several decades back :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">	  There was  a time when corporations played a minor
     part in  our business  affairs, but  now they  play the
     chief  part,   and	 most	men  are   the	servants  of
     corporations.
</blockquote><p id="p_31">And Franklin D. Roosevelt mourned :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">	  Concentration of  economic power  in all embracing
     corporations.....represents private enterprise become a
     kind of  private  government  which  is  a	 power	unto
     itself-a regimentation  of	 other	people's  money	 and
     other people's lives.
</blockquote><p id="p_32">This legal  facility of corporate instrument came to be used
by the	State in  many countries  as a	measure	 of  immense
convenience  especially	 in  its  commercial  ventures.	 The
trappings  of	personality,  liberation  from	governmental
stiffness and  capacity for  mammoth growth,  together	with
administrative elasticity, are the attributes and advantages
of corporations.
</p><p id="p_33">	  A corporation	 is an	artificial being, invisible,
     intangible, and  existing only  in the contemplation of
     the law.  Being  the  mere	 creature  of  the  law,  it
     possesses only  those properties  which the  charter of
     its creation  confers on  it, either  expressly, or  as
     incidental to its very existence. Those are such as are
     supposed best calculated to effect the object for which
     it	 was   created.	 Among	 the  most   important	 are
     immortality,  and,	  if  the   expression	be  allowed,
     individuality;  properties	  by   which   a   perpetual
     succession of many persons are considered the same, and
     may act as a single individual.
</p><p id="p_34">Although corporate  personality is  not a  modern invention,
its adaptation	to embrace  the wide  range of	industry and
commerce has  a modern	favour.	 Welfare  States  like	ours
called upon to execute many economic projects readily resort
to  this   resourceful	legal  contrivance  because  of	 its
practical advantages  without a	 wee-bit  of  diminution  in
ownership and  control of the Undertaking. The true owner is
the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">123</span>
State, the  real operator  is the  State and  the  effective
controllerate  is  the	State  and  accountability  for	 its
actions to  the community and to Parliament is of the State.
Nevertheless, a	 distinct juristic  person with	 a corporate
structure conducts  the business,  with the added facilities
enjoyed by  companies and  keeping the	quasi-autonomy which
comes  in   handy  from	  the  point  of  view	of  business
management. Be	it remembered  though that  while the formal
ownership is  cast  in	the  corporate	mould,	the  reality
reaches down  to State control. With this background we have
to read<a href="/doc/1974722/" id="a_59"> s. 7</a> of the Act which runs thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">	  7.  (1)   Notwithstanding  anything  contained  in
     <a href="/doc/309888/" id="a_60">sections 3</a>,  <a href="/doc/1934248/" id="a_61">4</a> and	 <a href="/doc/1766793/" id="a_62">5</a>, the	 Central Government  may, if
     satisfied that  a	Government  company  is	 willing  to
     comply, or	 has complied with such terms and conditions
     as that  Government may  think fit to impose, direct by
     notification that the right, title and interest and the
     liabilities of  Burmah Shell  in relation to any of its
     undertakings in  India, shall  instead of continuing to
     vest in  the Central Government, vest in the Government
     company....</blockquote>
<p id="p_35">					    (emphasis added)
The core  fact is  that the Central Government, through this
provision, chooses  to make over, for better management, its
own property to its own offspring. A government company is a
mini-incarnation of  Government itself, made up of its blood
and bones  and given  corporate shape and status for defined
objectives, not beyond.
</p><p id="p_36">     Nor is  this  any	isolated  experiment  in  government
formally transferring  ownership to  a company.	 There are a
number	of   statutory	take-overs  in	India  as  in  other
countries, where  the  initial	vesting	 is  in	 government,
followed by  a later transfer to another instrumentality-may
be an  existing government  company or a corporation created
by statute  or even  a society or other legal person. In the
present case,  a government  company was  created anteriorly
and by	virtue of  a notification  under<a href="/doc/1974722/" id="a_63"> s.  7</a> it became the
transferee of  the right,  title and interest as well as the
liabilities of Burmah Shell.
</p><p id="p_37">     The device	 is too	 obvious for  deception that what is
done is	 a formal  transfer from government to a government-
company as the notification clearly spells out :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">	  In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section
     (1) of  <a href="/doc/1413712/" id="a_64">Section 7</a>	of the	Burmah Shell (Acquisition of

     Central Government,  being satisfied  that Burmah-Shell
     Refineries Ltd.,  a Government  company is	 willing  to
     comply with such terms and conditions as may be imposed
     by the Central Government
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">124</span>
     hereby directs  that the  right, title and interest and
     the  liabilities	of  Burmah-Shell   Oil	Storage	 and

     undertakings in  India, shall, instead of continuing to
     vest in  the Central  Government vest  with effect from
     the twenty fourth day of January, 1976, in Burmah-Shell
     Refineries Ltd.
</blockquote><p id="p_38">This is	 the well-worn	legal strategy for government to run
economic and  like enterprises.	 We live in an era of public
sector corporations, the State being the reality behind, Law
does not  hoodwink itself  and what is but a strategy cannot
be used as a stratagem :
</p><p id="p_39">     These are	the facts when we come to brass tacks. Facts
form the  raw material	out of which the finished product of
judicial finding  is  fabricated  after	 processing  through
established legal  principles. Indeed, in life as in law "it
is as  fatal as	 it is	cowardly to blink facts because they
are not	 to our	 taste". What,	then, are  the	basic  facts
available from the Act ? Constitutional law is not a game of
hide  and  seek	 but  practical	 real-life  conclusions.  So
viewed, we  are constrained  to hold  that  Burmah-Shell,  a
government company  though, is	but the	 alter	ego  of	 the
Central	 Government  and  must,	 therefore,  be	 treated  as
definitionally caught in the net of 'State' since a juristic
veil worn  for certain	legal purposes cannot obliterate the
true  character	  of  the   entity  for	  the  purposes	  of
constitutional law.
</p><p id="p_40">     If we  distil the	essence of  <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_66">Art.  12</a>  textually	 and
apprehend the  expanded meaning	 of "State"  as	 interpreted
precedentially, we  may solve  the dilemma as to whether the
Bharat Petroleum is but a double of Bharat Sarkar. Let us be
clear that  the jurisprudence bearing on corporations is not
myth but reality. What we mean is that corporate personality
is a  reality and not an illusion or fictitious construction
of the	law. It	 is a legal person. Indeed, 'a legal person'
is any	subject matter other than a human being to which the
law attributes	personality. "This  extension, for  good and
sufficient reasons,  of the  conception of personality....is
one of	the most noteworthy feats of the legal imagination."
Corporations are  one species  of legal	 persons invented by
the law	 and invested  with a variety of attributes so as to
achieve certain	 purposes sanctioned  by the  law. For those
purposes, a corporation or company has a legal existence all
its own.  The characteristics  of corporations, their rights
and liabilities,  functional autonomy  and juristic  status,
are jurisprudentially  recognised as  of a  distinct  entity
even where  such corporations  are  but	 State	agencies  or
instrumentalities. For	purposes of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_67">Companies Act</a>, 1956,
a government company has a distinct personality which cannot
be con-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">125</span>
<p id="p_41">fused with  the State.	Likewise,  a  statutory	 corporation
constituted to	carry on  a commercial	or other activity is
for many  purposes a distinct juristic entity not drowned in
the sea	 of State, although, in substance, its existence may
be but	a projection of the State. What we wish to emphasise
is that	 merely because	 a company or other legal person has
functional and	jural individuality for certain purposes and
in certain areas of law, it does not necessarily follow that
for the	 effective enforcement	of fundamental	rights under
our constitutional  scheme, we	should	not  scan  the	real
character of  that entity;  and if  it is found to be a mere
agent or surrogate of the State, in fact owned by the State,
in  truth   controlled	by   the  State	 and  in  effect  an
incarnation of	the State,  constitutional lawyers  must not
blink at  these	 facts	and  frustrate	the  enforcement  of
fundamental rights  despite the inclusive definition of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_68">Art.
12</a> that	 any authority controlled by the Government of India
is itself  State. Law  has many	 dimensions and	 fundamental
facts must govern the applicability of fundamental rights in
a given situation.
</p><p id="p_42">     Control by	 Government of the corporation is writ large
in the	Act and in the factum of being a government company.
Moreover,  here, <a href="/doc/1974722/" id="a_69"> s.  7</a>	 gives	to  the	 government  company
mentioned in  it  a  statutory	recognition,  a	 legislative
sanction and  a status	above a	 mere government company. If
the entity  is no  more than a company under the Company Law
or society under the law relating to registered societies or
co-operative societies	you cannot  call it  an authority. A
ration	shop   run  by	 a  cooperative	 store	financed  by
Government is  not an authority being a mere merchant, not a
sharer of  State power.	 'Authority' in	 law belongs  to the
province of power:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">	  Authority (in Administrative Law) is a body having
     jurisdiction in certain matters of a public nature.</blockquote>
<p id="p_43">     Therefore, the  "ability conferred upon a person by the
law to	alter, by  his own  will directed  to that  end, the
rights, duties, liabilities or other legal relations, either
of himself  or of other persons" must be present ab extra to
make a	person an  'authority'. When the person is an 'agent
or instrument  of the  functions of  the State' the power is
public. So  the search	here must  be to see whether the Act
vests authority,  as agent  or instrument  of the  State, to
affect the legal relations of oneself or others.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">126</span>
<p id="p_44">     Sometimes	the   test  is	formulated,  over-simplified
fashion, by  asking whether  the corporation  is formed by a
statute or under a statute. The true test is functional. Not
how the	 legal person  is born	but why	 it is	created. Nay
more. Apart  from discharging functions or doing business as
the proxy  of the  State, wearing  the corporate  mask there
must be	 an element  of ability to affect legal relations by
virtue of power vested in it by law.
</p><p id="p_45">     In the  present instance,	the source  of both, read in
the light of<a href="/doc/309888/" id="a_70"> ss. 3</a> and <a href="/doc/1974722/" id="a_71">7</a>, is saturated with State functions.
Avowedly, the statutory contemplation, as disclosed by<a href="/doc/1974722/" id="a_72"> s. 7</a>,
is that	 the company  should step  into	 the  shoes  of	 the
executive power	 of the	 State. The  legislative  milieu  in
which the  second respondent  came to  be the  successor  of
Burmah Shell  suggests that  the former	 is more than a mere
company	 registered  under  the	 <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_73">Companies  Act</a>.  It  has  a
statutory flavour  acquired under<a href="/doc/1974722/" id="a_74"> s. 7</a>. Moreover, everything
about the  second respondent  in the  matter  of  employees,
their  provident,   superannuation  and	 welfare  funds,  is
regulated  statutorily	 unlike	 in  the  case	of  ordinary
companies. <a href="/doc/610587/" id="a_75">Sections  9</a> and <a href="/doc/1781928/" id="a_76">10</a> deal with these aspects. These
two provisions	which regulate the conditions of service and
even  provide  for  adjudication  of  disputes	relating  to
employees indicate  that some of the features of a statutory
corporation attach  to this  government company.  <a href="/doc/610587/" id="a_77">Sections 9</a>
and <a href="/doc/1781928/" id="a_78">10</a>,	 in terms,  create rights  and duties  vis a vis the

not the	 obligation cast  on the  second respondent by<a href="/doc/1549225/" id="a_80"> ss. 9</a>
and <a href="/doc/1907423/" id="a_81">10</a>.	 And s.11  specifically gives  the Act primacy vis a
vis other  laws. <a href="/doc/1216959/" id="a_82">Section  12</a>, although	it has no bearing on
the specific  dispute we  are concerned	 in this  case, is a
clear pointer  to the  statutory character of the government
company and  the  vesting  of  an  authority  therein.	This
provision clothes  the government company with power to take
delivery of  the property  of Burmah Shell from every person
in whose  possession, custody  or control  such property may
be. There  are other  powers akin  to this one in<a href="/doc/1216959/" id="a_83"> s. 12</a>. The
provision for  penalties if  any  person  meddles  with	 the
property of  the second	 respondent emphasises	the  special
character of  this government company. Equally unique is the
protection conferred  by<a href="/doc/365890/" id="a_84"> s. 16</a> on the government company and
its officers  and employees  "for anything which is, in good
faith, done  or untended to be done under this Act". Such an
immunity  does	 not  attach   to  employees   of  companies
simpliciter, even if they happen to be government companies.
In the same strain is the indemnity conferred by<a href="/doc/1488438/" id="a_85"> s. 18</a>. This
review, though	skeletal, is  sufficient strikingly to bring
home the point that the Corporation we are concerned with is
more than a mere government company. Whatever its character
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">127</span>
antecedent to  the Act,	 the provisions	 we have adverted to
have transformed  it into  an instrumentality of the Central
Government with	 a strong  statutory flavour super-added and
clear indicia  of power	 to make it an "authority". Although
registered as  a company under the <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_86">Indian Companies Act</a>, the
second respondent  is clearly a creature of the statute, the
Undertaking having vested in it by force of<a href="/doc/914339/" id="a_87"> s. 7</a> of the Act.
The various  provisions to which our attention was drawn, an
elaboration of	which is  not called for, emphasise the fact
that the  second respondent  is not  a mere company but much
more than that and has a statutory flavour in its operations
and  functions,	 in  its  powers  and  duties,	and  in	 its
personality  itself,   apart  from  being  functionally	 and
administratively under the thumb of government. It is a limb
of government,	an agency of the State, a vicarious creature
of statute  working on the wheels of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_88">Acquisition Act</a>. We
do not	mean to	 say  that  for	 purposes  of  <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_89">Art.  309</a>  or
otherwise this	government company  is State  but limit	 our
holding to <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_90">Art. 12</a> and Part III.
</p><p id="p_46">     We may  now proceed  to examine  the authorities  cited
before us by both sides on this point with special reference
to  <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_91">Art.  12</a>  of  the  Constitution  vis  a  vis  government
companies and  like bodies. Shri G. B. Pai concedes that the
recent trend  of rulings  of this  Court has  broadened	 the
concept	 of   "authorities....	under  the  control  of	 the
Government of  India." For  instance, the  Airport Authority
Case  and   the	 U.P.	Warehousing  Corporation  case.	 His
submission is  that  the  core	question  which	 called	 for
decision in  those cases did not demand pronouncement on the
larger issue  of what  is "State" under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_92">Art. 12</a> and also ran
counter to  the earlier	 rulings by  larger benches. True, a
tour of	 the case-law  runs zigzag,  but guided by principle
and jurisprudential discernment, it is possible to reach the
same destination  to which the two rulings referred to above
take us.  Shri G. B. Pai pressed us to reconsider the latest
decisions  in	view  of   their  error	 when  read  in	 the
perspective of	prior rulings  by referring  the issue	to a
larger bench.  We will	presently explain  by examining	 the
earlier cases  why we  hold the recent decisions to be right
and reconcilable  with	the  broad  approach  in  the  older
authorities. Moreover,	rulings of this court are calculated
to settle  the law and not to unsettle it by reconsideration
in season  and out  merely because it hurts one party or the
other or  tastes  sour	for  one  judge	 or  the  other.  If
incompatibility between	 the ratios stares us in the face we
must clear  the confusion  by the  process suggested by Shri
Pai. But we are satisfied that the Airport Authority
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">128</span>
(supra) has  been consistently	and correctly  decided	and,
being bound  by it,  hold that	a writ	will lie against the
second respondent  under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_93">Art.  32.</a> An explanatory journey is
necessary to make good this assertion.
</p><p id="p_47">     The UP  Warehousing Corporation case (supra)-the latest
on the	point-related to  a statutory  corporation  and	 the
litigation was by an employee for wrongful dismissal. One of
the questions  considered there was the maintainability of a
writ  petition	 against  a  statutory	corporation  at	 the
instance of  an employee. The court reviewed many decisions,
Indian and  English, and  upheld the  employee's  contention
that the  writ could  and should  issue to  such a  body  if
illegality were	 established. It is significant that pointed
reference has  been made to Sukhdev Singh, Airport Authority
(supra), and  the judgment  of the House of Lords in Malloch
v.  Aberdeen   Corpn.,	Sarkaria,   J.	 adverted   to	 the
observations of	 Lord Wilberforce  that in cases where there
is an element of public employment or service, or support by
statute or  something in  the nature  of  public  office  or
status, the court would correct illegal acts. Of course, the
specific question  as  to  whether  such  a  body  could  be
regarded as  'State' did  not and  could not  arise  in	 the
English case.  But it  did arise  in the  Airport  Authority
(supra) where  Bhagwati, J.  launched  on  an  international
survey of  this branch	of jurisprudence and highlighted the
factors which made a legal person-a statutory corporation, a
government company  or even  a registered society-"an agency
or  instrumentality   of  government"	and   therefore	  an
'authority' for	 purposes of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_94">Art. 12.</a> The forensic focus was
turned sharply	by one	of us  (Chinnappa Reddy,  J. who was
party to  that decision) on the target issue of what it "the
State" for  purposes of	 Part III.  The crucial observations
which have  pertinence to the point argued before us deserve
excerption and enjoy our affirmation:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">	  I  find  it  very  hard  indeed  to  discover	 any
     distinction on  principle	between	 a  person  directly
     under the	employment of  the government  and a  person
     under the employment of an agency or instrumentality of
     the government or a corporation, set up under a statute
     or incorporated  but wholly owned by the government. It
     is self-evident  and trite	 to say that the function of
     the State	has long  since ceased to be confined to the
     preservation of the public peace, the exaction of taxes
     and the  defence  of  its	frontiers.  It	is  now	 the
     function of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">129</span>
     State  to	 secure	 'social,   economic  and  political
     justice', to  preserve 'liberty of thought, expression,
     belief, faith  and worship', and to ensure 'equality of
     status and of opportunity'. That is the proclamation of
     the people	 in the	 preamble to  the Constitution.	 The
     desire  to	 attain	 these	objectives  has	 necessarily
     resulted in  intense governmental	activity in manifold
     ways. Legislative	and executive  activity have reached
     very far  and have	 touched  very	many  aspects  of  a
     citizen's life. The government, directly or through the
     corporations, set	up by it or owned by it, now owns or
     manages, a large number of industries and institutions.
     It is  the biggest	 builder in the country. Mammoth and
     minor irrigation  projects, heavy and light engineering
     projects, projects	 of various  kinds are undertaken by
     the government.  The government  is  also	the  biggest
     trader in	the country. The State and the multitudinous
     agencies  and   corporations  set	up  by	it  are	 the
     principal purchasers of the produce and the products of
     our  country  and	they  control  a  vast	and  complex
     machinery of distribution. The government, its agencies
     and  instrumentalities,  corporations  set	 up  by	 the
     government	 under	 the   statutes	  and	corporations
     incorporated under	 the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_95">Companies	Act</a> but owned by the
     Government have  thus become  the biggest	employers in
     the country. There is no good reason why, if government
     is	 bound	to  observe  the  equality  clauses  of	 the
     Constitution in  the matter  of employment	 and in	 its
     dealings with the employees, the corporations set up or
     owned by the government should not be equally bound and
     why, instead,  such corporations  could become citadels
     of patronage  and arbitrary  action. In  a country like
     ours which	 teems with population, where the State, its
     agencies, its  instrumentalities and  its	corporations
     are the  biggest  employers  and  where  millions	seek
     employment and  security, to  confine the applicability
     of	 the   equality	 clauses  of  the  Constitution,  in
     relation to  matters of  employment, strictly to direct
     employment under  the government  is perhaps to mock at
     the Constitution  and the	people.	 Some  the  employee
     beyond the reach of the rule which denies him access to
     a court  to enforce a contract of employment and denies
     him the  protection  of  Articles	14  and	 16  of	 the
     Constitution. After all employment in the public sector
     has grown	to vast	 dimensions  and  employees  in	 the
     public sector  often discharge  as	 onerous  duties  as
     civil servants and parti-

<blockquote id="blockquote_15">     cipate in activities vital to our country's economy. In
     growing realisation  of the importance of employment in
     the public	 sector, Parliament  and the Legislatures of
     the States	 have declared	persons in  the	 service  of
     local authorities,	 government companies  and statutory
     corporations as  public servants  and, extended to them
     by express enactment the protection usually extended to
     civil servants  from  suits  and  prosecution.  It	 is,
     therefore,	 but   right  that   the  independence	 and
     integrity of those employed in the public sector should
     be secured as much as the independence and integrity of
     servants.
</blockquote><p id="p_48">The compelling force of this reasoning in the Indian setting
and constitutional matrix cannot be missed.
</p><p id="p_49">     Let us  dilate  a	little	on  the	 living	 essence  of
constitutional	fundamentals   if  we	are  not  to  reduce
fundamental rights  to paper  hopes and people's dupes ! The
judicial branch	 shall not  commit breach  of faith with the
bill of	 rights by  interpretative exoneration	of the State
from observance	 of these founding faiths. The higher values
enacted into Part III of the Constitution certainly bind the
State in  its executive	 and legislative  branches. They are
constitutional guarantees to the Indian people, not fleeting
promises in  common enactments.	 So long as they last in the
National Charter  they should  not  be	truncated  in  their
application unless  a contra-indication	 is clearly  written
into the  prescription, a la Arts. 31A, 31B and 31C. <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_96">Art. 12</a>
is a  special definition  with	a  broader  goal.  Far	from
restricting the	 concept of  State it  enlarges the scope to
embrace all authorities under the control of Government. The
constitutional	philosophy   of	 a   democratic,   socialist
Republic mandated  to undertake a multitude of socioeconomic
operations inspires  Part IV  and so  we must  envision	 the
State  entering	  the  vast   territory	 of  industrial	 and
commercial activity,  competitively or monopolistically, for
ensuring the  welfare of  the people. This expansive role of
the State  under Part IV is not played at the expense of the
cherished rights  of the people entrenched in Part III since
both the  sets of imperatives are complementary and co-exist
harmoniously. Wherever the Constitution has felt the need to
subordinate Part  III to Part IV it has specificated it and,
absent such  expression provision,  both the  Parts must and
can  flourish	happily	 together   given  benign   judicial
comprehension a	  <a href="/doc/1130169/" id="a_97">Kerala  v. Thomas</a>.  There is	no  inherent
conflict between  the two parts if orchestrated humanely. We
are at	pains to  emphasise  this  perspective	because	 the
substance of  Part III, save where the Constitution says so,
shall not  be sacrificed  at the  altar of  Part IV  by	 the
stratagem of incorporation. It is well known, and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">131</span>
surely	within	the  erudite  and  experienced	ken  of	 our
'founding fathers', that Government embarks on myriad modern
commercial activities  by resort to the jurisprudential gift
of personification  through incorporation.  This contrivance
of carrying  on business  activities by	 the  State  through
statutory  corporations,   government  companies  and  other
bodies with  legal personality,	 simplifies and	 facilitates
transactions and operations beyond the traditional and tardy
processes of  governmental desks  and cells  noted for their
red  tape  exercise  and  drowsy  dharma.  But	to  use	 the
corporate methodology  is not to liberate the State from its
basic obligation  to obey  Part III.  To don  the mantle  of
company is to free the State from the inevitable constraints
of governmental	 slow-motion, not  to play  truant with	 the
great rights. Otherwise, a cunning plurality of corporations
taking over  almost every  State business-the  post and	 the
rail-road, the T.V. and the radio, every economic ministry's
activity, why,	even  social  welfare  work-will  cheat	 the
people of  Part III  rights by	the easy plea: "No admission
for the	 bill of  rights; no  State here." From Indian Posts
and  Telegraphs	 Limited  to  Indian  Defence  Manufacturers
Limited, from  Social  Welfare	Board  to  Backward  Classes
Corporation the	 nation will  be told  that 'the  State	 has
ceased	to   be,  save	 for  the  non-negotiable  sovereign
functions; and fundamental rights may suffer eclipse only to
be viewed  in museum glass cases. Such a situation will be a
treachery  on	the  founding  fathers,	 a  mockery  of	 the
Constitution and  a government by puppetry because the crowd
of corporations	 which have  carved out	 all functions	will
still be  controlled completely	 by  the  switch  boards  of
bureaucrats and	 political bosses  from remote control rooms
in Government  Secretariats. The extended definition of "the
State" in  <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_98">Art. 12</a>  is not  to be  deadened but quickened by
judicial  construction.	  Before  our	eyes  the  corporate
phenomenon is becoming ubiquitous. What was archaically done
yesterday by  government departments is alertly executed to-
day by government companies, statutory corporations and like
bodies and  this tribe	may legitimately  increase tomorrow.
This efficiency	 is not	 to be	purchased at  the  price  of
fundamental rights.  As Mathew J. stated in <a href="/doc/764006/" id="a_99">V. Punnan Thomas
v. State of Kerala</a>:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">	  The Government,  is not  and should not be as free

     inherent in  its position	in a  democratic society.  A

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_20">	  So far  as India  is concerned, the genesis of the
     emergence	of   corporations  as  instrumentalities  or
     agencies of Government is to be found in the Government
     of India Resolution on Industrial Policy dated April 6,
     1948 where it was stated inter alia that "management of
     State enterprise  will as	a rule be through the medium
     of public	corporation under  the statutory  control of
     the Central  Government who  will assume such powers as
     may be  necessary to  ensure this". It was in pursuance
     of	 the   policy  envisaged   in  this  and  subsequent
     resolutions on industrial policy that corporations were
     created by	 Government for setting up and management of
     public  enterprises   and	carrying  out  other  public
     functions. Ordinarily  these functions  could have been
     carried out  by Government	 departmentally through	 its
     service personnel,	 but the instrumentally or agency of
     the corporations  was resorted to in these cases having
     regard to	the nature  of the task to be performed. The
     corporations acting  as instrumentality  or  agency  of
     Government would  obviously  be  subject  to  the	same
     limitations  in   the  field   of	constitutional	 and
     administrative law	 as Government itself, though in the
     eye of  the law, they would be distinct and independent
     legal  entities.	If  Government	acting	through	 its
     officers  is  subject  to	certain	 constitutional	 and
     public law	 limitations, it must follow a fortiori that

<p id="p_52">     (emphasis added)

without unduly stretching the meaning of "the State" to rope
in whatever  any autonomous  body which	 has some nexus with
government. A wide expansion coupled
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">134</span>

bodies	which	are   agencies	 or   instrumentalities	  of
Government, the court, in Airport Authority, observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">	  A corporation	 may be	 created in one of two ways.
     It may be either established by statute or incorporated
     under a  law such	as the	<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_102">Companies Act</a>,	1956 or	 the
     <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_103">Societies Registration  Act</a>, 1860.	 Where a corporation
     is wholly	controlled by  Government not  only  in	 its
     policy-making but	also in	 carrying out  the functions
     entrusted to  it by  the law  establishing it or by the
     charter of	 its incorporation,  there can	be no  doubt
     that it  would  be	 an  instrumentality  or  agency  of
     Government........ When  does such a corporation become
     an instrumentality	 or agency  of Government  ? Is	 the
     holding of	 the entire share capital of the corporation
     by	 Government  enough  or	 is  it	 necessary  that  in
     addition, there  should be	 a certain  amount of direct
     control exercised by Government and, if so, what should
     be the  nature of	such control  ? Should the functions
     which the	corporation is	charged to carry out possess
     any particular  characteristic or	feature, or  is	 the
     nature of	the functions immaterial ? Now, one thing is
     clear  that   if  the   entire  share  capital  of	 the

     possible to  formulate an	all-inclusive or  exhaustive
     test which would adequately answer this question. There
     is no  cut and  dried formula  which would	 provide the
     correct division  of corporations	into those which are
     instrumentalities or  agencies of	Government and those
     which are not.</blockquote>
<p id="p_54">     (emphasis added)
     The  court	  proceeded  to	 crystallise  the  tests  to
determine the 'State' completion of corporate bodies, beyond
furnishing the full share capital:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">	  But "a  finding of State financial support plus an
     unusual degree  of	 control  over	the  management	 and
     policies might
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">135</span>
     lead one to characterise an operation as State action".
     Vide Sukhdev  v. Bhagatram.  So also  the existence  of
     deep  and	 pervasive  State   control  may  afford  an
     indication that  the Corporation  is a  State agency or
     instrumentality. It  may also  be a  relevant factor to
     consider whether the corporation enjoys monopoly status
     which is  State conferred or State protected. There can
     be little doubt that State conferred or State protected
     monopoly status  would be	highly relevant in assessing
     the aggregate  weight of  the corporations' ties to the
     State.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_23">	  There is also another factor which may be regarded
     as having a bearing on this issue and it is whether the
     operation of  the corporation  is an  important  public
     function. It  has been  held in  the United States in a
     number of cases that the concept of private action must
     yield to  a conception  of State  action  where  public
     functions are  being performed. Vide Arthur S. Millers:
     The Constitutional Law of the 'Security State.
	  If the  functions of the corporation are of public
     importance	 and   closely	 related   to	governmental
     functions, it would be a relevant factor in classifying
     the corporation  as an  instrumentality  or  agency  of
     Government. This  is precisely  what was pointed out by
     Mathew, J.	 in Sukhdev  v. Bhagatram  (supra) where the
     learned  Judge   said  that  "institutions	 engaged  in
     matters of	 high public  interest or  performing public
     functions are  by virtue of the nature of the functions
     performed government agencies. Activities which are too

     important not to be considered government functions."
</blockquote><p id="p_55">Bhagwati, J. dwelt on the functional formula and reasoned:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_24">	  But the  decisions show  that even  this  test  of
     public or governmental character of the function is not
     easy of application and does not invariably lead to the
     correct inference	because the  range  of	governmental
     activity is  broad and  varied and	 merely	 because  an
     activity may  be such as may legitimately be carried on
     by Government,  it does  not mean	that a	corporation,
     which is  otherwise  a  private  entity,  would  be  an
     instrumentality or	 agency of  Government by  reason of
     carrying on  such activity.  In fact it is difficult to

<blockquote id="blockquote_25">     uish   between    governmental   functions	  and	non-
     governmental functions. Perhaps the distinction between
     governmental  and	non-governmental  functions  is	 not
     valid any	more in	 a social  welfare State  where	 the
     laissez  faire  is	 an  outmoded  concept	and  Herbert
     Spencer's social  statics has  no place.......  But the
     public nature  of the  function,  if  impregnated	with
     governmental  character   or  "tied  or  entwined	with
     Government"  or  fortified	 by  some  other  additional
     factor, may  render the  corporation an instrumentality
     or agency	of Government. Specifically, if a department
     of Government is transferred to a corporation, it would
     be a strong factor supportive of this inference.</blockquote>
<p id="p_56">     The conclusion is impeccable that if the corporate body
is but	an 'instrumentality  or agency'	 of Government, then
Part III will trammel its operations. It is a case of quasi-
governmental beings,  not of  non-State entities. We have no
hesitation to hold that where the chemistry of the corporate
body answers  the test	of 'State'  above outlined  it comes
within the  definition in  <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_104">Art. 12.</a>  In	 our  constitutional
scheme where  the commanding  heights belong  to the  public
sector of  the national	 economy,  to  grant  absolution  to
government companies  and their	 ilk from  Part III  may  be
perilous. The  court  cannot  connive  at  a  process  which
eventually makes  fundamental rights  as rare  as "roses  in
December, ice  in June".  <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_105">Article  12</a>  uses  the  expression
"other authorities" and its connotation has to be clarified.
On this	 facet also,  the Airport  Authority case supplies a
solution:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_26">	  If  a	  statutory  corporation,   body  or   other
     authority	is  an	instrumentality	 or  agency  of	 the
     Government, it  would be  an 'authority'  and therefore
     'State'  within  the  meaning  of	that  expression  in
     <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_106">Article 12.</a></blockquote>
<p id="p_57">     The decisions  are not  uniform as	 to whether being an
instrumentality or  agency of  Government ipso	jure renders
the company  or	 other	similar	 body  'State'.	 This  again
involves a navigation through precedents and Bhagwati, J. In
Airport Authority  (supra) has	spoken for  the Court, after
referring  to  <a href="/doc/459864/" id="a_107">Rajasthan  Electricity  Board  v.  Mohan	 Lal
Sukhdev</a> v.  Bhagatram,	Praga  Tool  Corporation  v.  C.  A.

     sense that	 whatever it  does should  be binding on the
     Government. It is not the relationship of principal and
     agent which  is relevant  and material  but whether the
     corporation is  an instrumentality of the Government in
     the sense	that a	part of	 the governing	power of the
     State is  located in  the Corporation  and	 though	 the

<p id="p_58">     Let us  cull out  from Airport  Authority	(supra)	 the
indicia of  "other authorities.........under  the control of
the Government	of India"  bringing a corporation within the
definition of  "the State".  The following factors have been
emphasised in  that ruling as telling, though not clinching.
These characteristics  convert a  statutory  corporation,  a
government  company,   a  cooperative	society	 and   other
registered society  or body  into a  State and	they are not
confined to  statutory corporations alone. We may decoct the
tests for ready reference:
</p><p id="p_59">     1. "One thing is clear that if the entire share capital
of the corporation is held by Government, it would go a long
way  towards   indicating  that	  the  corporation   is	  an
instrumentality or agency of Government."
</p><p id="p_60">     2. Existence  of "deep  and pervasive State control may
afford an  indication that the Corporation is a State agency
or instrumentality."
</p><p id="p_61">     3. "It  may also  be a  relevant factor........ whether
the corporation	 enjoys monopoly  status which	is the State
conferred or State protected."
</p><p id="p_62">     4. "If  the functions  of the corporation are of public
importance and closely related to governmental functions, it
would be a relevant factor in classifying the corporation as
an instrumentality or agency of Government."
</p><p id="p_63">     5. "Specifically,	if a  department  of  Government  is
transferred to	a corporation,	it would  be a strong factor
supportive of this inference"
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">138</span>
<p id="p_64">of the	corporation being  an instrumentality  or agency  of
Government."
</p><p id="p_65">     The finale is reached when the cumulative effect of all
the relevant  factors above set out is assessed and once the
body is	 found to  be an instrument or agency of Government,
the further  conclusion emerges	 that it  is 'State'  and is
subject	 to   the   same   constitutional   limitations	  as
Government.
</p><p id="p_66">     This divagation  explains	the  ratio  of	the  Airport
Authority (supra)  in its  full	 spectrum.  There  the	main
contention  was	  that	the   said  authority,	a  statutory
corporation, was  not State  and enforcement  of fundamental
rights against such a body was impermissible. As is apparent
from the  extensive discussion	above, the  identical  issue
confronting us	as  to	what  are  the	"other	authorities"
contemplated by	 <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_110">Art. 12</a>  fell for consideration there. Most
of the	rulings relied	on by  either side received critical
attention there	 and the guidelines and parameters spelt out
there must  ordinarily govern  our decision. A careful study
of the	features of  the Airport  Authority and a government
company covered	 by<a href="/doc/914339/" id="a_111"> ss. 7</a>, <a href="/doc/1549225/" id="a_112">9</a>, <a href="/doc/1907423/" id="a_113">10</a> and <a href="/doc/1216959/" id="a_114">12</a> of the Act before us
discloses a close parallel except that the Airport Authority
is created  by a  statute while	 Bharat Petroleum  (notified
under<a href="/doc/914339/" id="a_115"> s.  7</a> of	the Act)  is recognised	 by and clothed with
rights and duties by the statute.
</p><p id="p_67">     There is no doubt that Bhagwati, J. broadened the scope
of State  under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_116">Art.  12</a> and according to Shri G. B. Pai the
observations spill  over beyond the requirements of the case
and must  be dismissed	as obiter.  His submission  is	that
having regard  to the  fact that  the International  Airport
Authority is  a corporation  created by statute there was no
occasion to  go beyond the narrow needs of the situation and
expand upon  the theme	of  State  in  <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_117">Art.  12</a>	 vis  a	 vis
Government companies,  registered societies and what not. He
assails the  decision also  on another	ground, namely,	 the
contradiction between Sukhdev and Airport Authority. We will
examine both  these contentions	 and, incidentally, consider
what the  law laid down in the other rulings is. We are free
to confess  that  the  propositions  have  not	been  neatly
chiselled and  presented in  any of the rulings and further,
some measure  of incongruity may be noticed if we search for
the same;  but our  approach is not to detect contradictions
but to discover a broad consensus if there be any and distil
the law in accordance therewith.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">139</span>
<p id="p_68">     We may first deal with Tewary's case where the question
mooted was as to whether the C.S.I.R. (Council of Scientific
and Industrial	Research) was  'State' under  <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_118">Art.  12.</a>	 The
C.S.I.R. is  a registered  society with	 official  and	non-
official members appointed by Government and subject to some
measure of  control by Government in the Ministry of Science
and Technology. The court held it was not 'State' as defined
in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_119">Art.	 12.</a> It	 is significant	 that the  court  implicitly
assented to  the proposition that if the society were really
an agency  of the Government it would be 'State'. But on the
facts and  features present there the character of agency of
Government  was	  negatived.  The  rulings  relied  on	are,
unfortunately, in  the province	 of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_120">Art. 311</a> and it is clear
that a body may be 'State' under Part III but not under Part
XIV. Ray,  C. J.,  rejected the argument that merely because
the Prime  Minister was	 the President	or  that  the  other
members were  appointed and  removed by	 Government did	 not
make the  Society a  'State'. With  great respect,  we agree
that in	 the absence  of the  other features  elaborated  in
Airport Authority case the composition of the Governing Body
alone may  not be  decisive. The  laconic discussion and the
limited ratio in Tewary hardly help either side here.
</p><p id="p_69">     Shri G. B. Pai hopefully took us through Sukhdev's case
at length  to demolish	the ratio  in Airport  Authority.  A
majority of  three judges  spoke through  Ray, C.  J.  while
Mathew,	 J.  ratiocinated  differently	to  reach  the	same
conclusion.  Alagiriswamy,  J.	struck	a  dissenting  note.
Whether certain	 statutory corporations	 were 'State'  under
<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_121">Art. 12</a> was the question mooted there at the instance of the
employees who  invoked Arts.  14 and 16. The judgment of the
learned Chief  Justice sufficiently  clinches the  issue  in
favour of the petitioner here. The problem was posed thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_28">	  In short  the question  is whether these statutory
     corporations are  authorities  within  the	 meaning  of
     <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_122">Article 12.</a>
</blockquote><p id="p_70">The answer was phrased thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_29">	  The employees	 of these  statutory bodies  have  a
     statutory status  and they	 are entitled to declaration
     of being  in employment when their dismissal or removal
     is in  contravention of statutory provisions. By was of
     abundant caution  we state that these employees are not
     servants of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">140</span>
     the Union	or the	State. These  statutory	 bodies	 are
     "authorities" within  the meaning	of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_123">Article 12</a> of the
     Constitution.
</blockquote><p id="p_71">Thus, the  holding was that the legal persons involved there
(three	corporations,	viz.  The   Oil	 and   Natural	 Gas
Commission, the	 Industrial Finance Corporation and the Life
Insurance Corporation)	were  'State'  under  <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_124">Art.  12.</a>	 The
reasoning adopted  by Ray, C. J. fortifies the argumentation
in Airport Authority.
</p><p id="p_72">     Repelling the  State's plea  that these bodies were not
'other authorities' under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_125">Art. 12.</a> Ray, C. J. observed :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_30">	  The  State   undertakes  commercial  functions  in
     combination with  Governmental functions  in a  welfare
     State. Governmental  function  must  authoritative.  It
     must be  able to  impose decision	by or under law with
     authority. The  element of	 authority is  of a  binding
     character. The  rules and regulations are authoritative
     because these  rules and regulations direct and control
     not only the exercise of powers by the Corporations but
     also all persons who deal with these corporations.....</blockquote>
<p id="p_73">	  The expression  "other authorities"  in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_126">Article 12</a>
     has  been	 held  by   this  Court	  in  the  Rajasthan
     Electricity Board	to be  wide enough to include within
     it every authority created by a statute and functioning
     within the	 territory of India, or under the control of
     the  Government  of  India.  This	Court  further	said
     referring to  earlier  decisions  that  the  expression
     "other  authorities"   in	<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_127">Article	  12</a>   include	 all
     constitutional or	statutory authorities on whom powers
     are conferred  by law.  The State	itself is  envisaged
     under <a href="/doc/1174818/" id="a_128">Article 298</a> as having the right to carry on trade
     and business.  The State  as defined  in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_129">Article  12</a> is
     comprehended to  include bodies created for the purpose
     of promoting  economic interests  of  the	people.	 The
     circumstance that	the statutory  body is	required  to
     carry on  some activities	of the	nature of  trade  or
     commerce does  not indicate  that	the  Board  must  be
     excluded from  the	 scope	of  the	 word  'State'.	 <a href="/doc/701121/" id="a_130">The
     Electricity Supply	 Act</a> showed that the Board had power
     to	 give  directions,  the	 disobedience  of  which  is
     punishable as  a criminal	offence. The  power to issue
     directions and  to enforce	 compliance is	an important
     aspect

Dealing with  governmental purposes  and public authorities,
the court clarified:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_31">	  In the  British Broadcasting	Corporation v. Johns
     (Inspector of  Taxes) (1965)  (1 Ch.  32), it  was said
     that persons  who are created to carry out governmental
     purposes enjoy immunity like Crown servants. Government
     purposes	include	  the	traditional   provinces	  of
     Government as  well  as  non-traditional  provinces  of
     Government if  the Crown  has constitutionally asserted
     that  they	  are  to   be	within	 the   province	  of
     Government.....
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_32">	  A public  authority is  a body which has public or
     statutory duties  to perform  and which  performs those
     duties and carries out its transactions for the benefit
     of the public and not for private profit.</blockquote>
<p id="p_74">					    (emphasis added)
Taking up  each statute	 and analysing	its  provisions	 the
learned Chief Justice concluded:
</p><p id="p_75">     The  structure   of  the	Life  Insurance	 Corporation
indicates  that	  the  Corporation   is	 an  agency  of	 the
Government  carrying  on  the  exclusive  business  of	life
insurance. Each	 and every  provision shows  in no uncertain
terms that  the voice  is of  the Central Government and the
hands are also of the Central Government.
</p><p id="p_76">	  xx	      xx	  xx
     These provisions  of the <a href="/doc/1958646/" id="a_131">Industrial Finance Corporation
Act</a> show  that the  Corporation is  in	effect	managed	 and
controlled by the Central Government.
</p><p id="p_77">					    (emphasis added)
     The italicised  portion pithily sums up the meat of the
matter. If  the voice  is of  the Government and so also the
hands, the  face will not hide the soul. There is nothing in
this judgment  which goes against a government company being
regarded as  'State'. On  the contrary,	 the thrust  of	 the
logic and the generality of the law are far from restrictive
and apply to all bodies which fill the bill.
</p><p id="p_78">     Mathew, J.	 is  more  positive  in	 his  conception  of
'State' under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_132">Art. 12:</a>
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">142</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_33">	  The concept of State has undergone drastic changes
     in recent	years. Today  State cannot  be conceived  of
     simply as a coercive machinery wielding the thunderbolt
     of authority.  It has  to be viewed mainly as a service
     corporation.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_34">	  "If we clearly grasp the character of the state as
     a social  agent, understanding  it rationally as a form
     of service	 and not mystically as an ultimate power, we
     shall differ  only in  respect of	the  limits  of	 its
     ability to	 render service." (see Mac Iver, "The Modern
     State" 183).

	  A state  is an  abstruct entity.  It can  only act
     through the  instrumentality or  agency of	 natural  or
     judicial persons.	Therefore, there  is nothing strange
     in the notion of the state acting through a corporation
     and making	 it an	agency	or  instrumentality  of	 the
     State........
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_36">	  The tasks of government multiplied with the advent
     of the welfare state and consequently, the framework of
     civil  service   administration   became	increasingly
     insufficient for  handling the  new  tasks	 which	were
     often of  a specialised and highly technical character.
     At the same time, 'bureaucracy' came under a cloud. The
     district of  government by	 civil service, justified or
     not, was  a powerful  factor in  the development  of  a
     policy  of	  public  administration   through  separate
     corporation which	would operate  largely according  to
     business principles and be separately accountable.
	  The public  corporation, therefore, became a third
     arm of the Government. In Great Britain, the conduct of
     basic industries  through giant  corporation is  now  a
     permanent feature of public life.
</blockquote><p id="p_79">The Indian  situation is  an a fortiori case, what with Part
IV  of	 the  Constitution   and  the  Government  of  India
Resolution on Industrial policy of 1956 ?
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_37">	  Accordingly, the State will progressively assume a
     pre-dominant and  direct responsibility  for setting up
     new  industrial   undertakings   and   for	  developing
     transport facilities.  It	will  also  undertake  State
     trading on an increasing scale.</blockquote>
<p id="p_80">     Of course,	 mere State  aid to  a company will not make
its actions  State actions.  Mathew, J.	 leaned to  the view
that:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">143</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_38">	  ....... State	 financial support  plus an  unusual
     degree of	control over  the  management  and  policies
     might lead	 one to	 characterise an  operation as state
     action.
</blockquote><p id="p_81">Indeed, the learned Judge went much farther:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_39">	  Another  factor   which  might  be  considered  is
     whether the  operation is an important public function.
     The combination  of state	aid and the furnishing of an
     important public  service may  result in  a  conclusion
     that the  operation should	 be classified	as  a  state
     agency.  If   a  given   function	is  of	such  public
     importance	 and  so  closely  related  to	governmental
     functions as to be classified as a governmental agency,
     then even	the presence  or absence  of state financial
     aid might	be irrelevant  in making  a finding of state
     action. If	 the function  does not	 fall within  such a
     description, then	mere addition  of state	 money would
     not influence the conclusion.</blockquote>
<p id="p_82">     It	 must	be  noticed   that  the	  emphasis   is	  on
functionality plus  State control  rather on  the  statutory
character of the Corporation:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_40">	  Institutions engaged	in matters  of	high  public
     interest or  performing Public  functions are by virtue
     of the  nature of	the  function  performed  government
     agencies. Activities  which are  too fundamental to the
     society are  by definition	 too  important	 not  to  be
     considered government functions.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_41">     We may  read the  ratio from the judgment of Mathew, J.
</blockquote><p id="p_83">where he says:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_42">	  It is	 clear from  the provisions that the Central
     Government has  contributed the original capital of the
     Corporation, that part of the profit of the Corporation
     goes to  that Government,	that the  Central Government
     exercises control	over the  policy of the Corporation,
     that the Corporation carries on a business having great
     public importance	and that it enjoys a monopoly in the
     business. I  would draw  the same	conclusions from the
     relevant	provisions   of	  the	<a href="/doc/1958646/" id="a_133">Industrial   Finance
     Corporation Act</a> which have also been referred to in the
     aforesaid judgment.  In these  circumstances, I  think,
     these corporations are agencies or instrumentalities of
     the 'State'  and are,  therefore,	'State'	 within	 the
     meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_134">Article 12.</a> The fact that these corporations
     have independent personalities in the eye of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">144</span>
     law does  not mean	 that they  are not  subject to	 the
     control  of   government	or   that   they   are	 not
     instrumentalities of the government. These corporations
     are instrumentalities  or agencies	 of  the  State	 for
     carrying on  businesses which otherwise would have been
     run by  the State	departmentally.	 If  the  state	 had
     chosen to	carry on these businesses through the medium
     of government  departments, there	would have  been  no
     question that  actions of	these departments  would  be
     'state actions'.  Why then	 should the  actions be	 not
     state actions ?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_43">	  xx	      xx	  xx
	  ....... merely  because a  corporation  has  legal
     personality of  its own,  it does	not follow  that the
     corporation cannot	 be an	agent or  instrumentality of
     the state, if it is subject to control of government in
     all important  matters of policy. No doubt, there might
     be some  distinction  between  the	 nature	 of  control
     exercised by  principal  over  agent  and	the  control
     exercised by  government over public corporation. That,
     I think  is only  a distinction  in degree. The crux of
     the matter	 is that public corporation is a new type or
     institution which	has sprung  from the  new social and
     economic functions	 of government and that it therefore
     does not  neatly fit into old legal categories. Instead
     of forcing it into them, the later should be adapted to
     the needs of changing times and conditions.</blockquote>
<p id="p_84">     There is  nothing in  these observations to confine the
concept of  State to  statutory corporations. Nay, the tests
are common  to any agency or instrumentality, the key factor
being  the   brooding  presence	 of  the  State	 behind	 the
operation of the body, statutory or other.
</p><p id="p_85">     A	study	of  Sukhdev's  case  (a	 Constitution  Bench
decision of  this Court)  yields the  clear result  that the
preponderant considerations  for pronouncing  an  entity  as
State agency  or instrumentality  are financial resources of
the  State   being  the	 chief	funding	 source,  functional
character being	 governmental in  essence,  plenary  control
residing in  Government, prior	history of the same activity
having been  carried on	 by Government	and made over to the
new body  and some  element of authority or command. Whether
the legal  person is  a corporation created by a statute, as
distinguished from  under a  statute, is  not  an  important
criterion although it may be an indicium. Applying

     The Rajasthan  Electricity	 Board	case  (the  majority
judgment of  Bhargava, J.)  is perfectly compatible with the
view we take of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_135">Art. 12</a> or has been expressed in Sukhdev and
the Airport  Authority. The  short question  that  fell	 for
decision was as o whether the Electricity Board was 'State'.
There was  no debate,  no discussion  and no decision on the
issue of  excluding from the area of 'State', under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_136">Art. 12</a>,
units incorporated  under a statute as against those created
by a  statute. On  the other  hand, the controversy was over
the exclusion  from the	 definition  of	 State	in  <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_137">Art.  12</a>
corporations engaged in commercial activities. This plea for
a narrow  meaning was  negatived by Bhargava, J. and in that
context the  learned Judge  explained the  signification  of
"other authorities" in <a href="/doc/624769/" id="a_138">Art. 12:(1)</a>
	  The meaning  of  the	word  "authority"  given  in
     Webster's Third New International Dictionary, which can
     be applicable,  is "a  public administrative  agency or
     corporation  having   quasi-governmental	powers	 and
     authorised to  administer	a  revenue-producing  public
     enterprise."  This	  dictionary  meaning  of  the	word
     "authority" is  clearly  wide  enough  to	include	 all
     bodies  created  by  a  statute  on  which	 powers	 are
     conferred	to   carry  out	  governmental	 or   quasi-
     governmental   functions.	  The	expression    "other
     authorities" is  wide enough to include within it every
     authority created	by a  statute and functioning within
     the territory  of India,  or under	 the control  of the
     Government of  India; and	we do  not see any reason to
     narrow down  this meaning	in the	context in which the
     words "other  authorities" are  used in  <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_139">Art. 12</a> of the
     Constitution.

	  These decisions of the Court support our view that
     the expression  "other authorities"  in  <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_140">Art.  12</a>	will
     include all  constitutional on statutory authorities on
     whom  powers  conferred  may  be  for  the	 purpose  of
     carrying	on    commercial   activities.	 Under	 the
     Constitution, the	State is  itself envisaged as having
     the right to carry on trade or business as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">146</span>
     mentioned in  <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_141">Art. 19(1)(g).</a>  In Part IV, the State has
     been given	 the same  meaning as  in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_142">Art. 12</a> and one of
     the Directive  Principles laid  down in <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_143">Art. 46</a> is that
     the  State	  shall	 promote   with	 special   care	 the
     educational  and	economic  interests  of	 the  weaker
     sections of  the people.  The State, as defined in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_144">Art.
     12</a>, is  thus comprehended to include bodies created for
     the purpose  of promoting	the educational and economic
     interests of  the people.	The State, as constituted by
     our Constitution,	is  further  specifically  empowered
     under <a href="/doc/1174818/" id="a_145">Art.	 298</a> to	 carry on any trade or business. The
     circumstance  that	 the  Board  under  the	 <a href="/doc/701121/" id="a_146">Electricity
     Supply Act</a>	 is required  to carry on some activities of
     the nature	 of trade  or commerce	does not, therefore,
     give any  indication that	the Board  must be  excluded
     from the scope of the word "State as used in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_147">Art. 12.</a>
The meaning  of the  learned judge is unmistakable that "the
State" in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_148">Art. 12</a> comprehends bodies created for the purpose
of  promoting  economic	 activities.  These  bodies  may  be
statutory  corporations,  registered  societies,  government
companies or  other like  entities. The court was not called
upon to	 consider this	latter aspect,	but to the extent to
which the  holding  goes,  it  supports	 the  stand  of	 the
petitioners.
</p><p id="p_88">     We are  not disposed  to discuss more cases because two
constitution benches  and two  smaller benches	have already
pronounced on  the amplitude  of "other authorities" in Art.
</p><p id="p_89">12. Even  so, a	 passing reference may be made to a few more
cases. In Praga Tools Corporation v. Immanuel this court was
called upon to consider the enforceability of two industrial
settlements against  the management which was a company with
substantial share-holding  for the  Union Government and the
Government  of	 Andhra	 Pradesh.   There  was	no  specific
reference to <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_149">Art. 12</a> as such although it was mentioned early
in the judgment that the company was a separate legal entity
and could not be said to be "either a government corporation
or an  industry run  by or  under the authority of the Union
Government." It	 must be  noticed that	12%  shares  in	 the
company were held by private individuals and nothing more is
known about  the plenary  control by  Government  and  other
features we  have referred  to earlier	in this judgment. On
the other  hand, the  short passage,  part of  which we have
extracted, almost suggests that a government corporation may
stand on  a different  footing from  Praga Tools Corporation
(supra). If  so, it  supports the  view we  have taken.	 The
Hindustan
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">147</span>
Steel case  which was  cited  at  the  bar,  considered	 the
question as  to whether	 an employee  of  that	company	 was
holding a post under the Union or a State so as to claim the
protection of  <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_150">Art. 311.</a> This claim was negatived, if we may
say so,	 rightly. In  the present  case, <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_151">Art. 12</a> is in issue
and not	 <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_152">Art. 311</a> and, therefore, that citation is an act of
supererogation.	 The   Vaish  College  case  which  too	 was
referred, related to the status of the managing committee of
a college  and the  enforceability of the contractual rights
of a  teacher by  a writ  under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_153">Art.  226.</a> That	 problem  is
extraneous to our case and need not detain us.
</p><p id="p_90">     Imagine  the   possible  result   of  holding   that  a
government company,  being just	 an entity  created under  a
statute, not  by a statute, it is not 'State'. Having regard
to the	directive in  <a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_154">Art. 38</a> and the amplitude of the other
Articles in Part IV Government may appropriately embark upon
almost any  activity which  in a  non-socialist republic may
fall within  the private  sector. Any  person's	 employment,
entertainment, travel,	rest and  leisure, hospital facility
and funeral  service may  be controlled by the State. And if
all  these   enterprises  are  executed	 through  government
companies,  bureaus,  societies,  councils,  institutes	 and
homes, the citizen may forfeit his fundamental freedoms vis-
a-vis these  strange beings which are government in fact but
corporate in form. If only fundamental rights were forbidden
access	to  corporations,  companies,  bureaus,	 institutes,
councils and  kindred bodies  which act	 as agencies  of the
Administration, there  may be a breakdown of the rule of law
and  the   constitutional  order   in  a   large  sector  of
governmental activity  carried on  under the guise of 'jural
persons'. It may pave the way for a new tyranny by arbitrary
administrators	operated   from	 behind	 by  Government	 but
unaccountable to  Part III  of the  Constitution. We  cannot
assent to an interpretation which leads to such a disastrous
conclusion unless  the language	 of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_155">Art.  12</a> offers no other
alternative.
</p><p id="p_91">     It is well known that "corporations have neither bodies

Louis D. Brandeis's observation will be proved true:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_44">	  The main  objection to  the very large corporation

<p id="p_92">It is  dangerous to  exonerate corporations from the need to

permitting them to flourish as an imperium in imperio.
</p><p id="p_93">     The common-sense signification of the expression "other

plain  and   there  is	no  reason  to	make  exclusions  on
sophisticated grounds  such as that the legal person must be
a statutory  corporation, must have power to make laws, must
be created  by and  not under  a  statute  and	so  on.	 The

<p id="p_94">     Having concluded  the discussion  on the amenability of

questions  raised   by	the  petitioner	 to  invalidate	 the
deductions from	 his original  pension on  the ground of his
drawal of provident fund and gratuity. The justification for
such deduction	is claimed  to	be  regulation	16  and	 its
antidote is  urged to  be a  provision in the two respective
enactments  relating   to  provident  fund  and	 payment  of
gratuity, namely,<a href="/doc/1216959/" id="a_156"> ss. 12</a> and <a href="/doc/865734/" id="a_157">14</a>.
</p><p id="p_96">     The petitioner  retired  voluntarily  under  an  extant
voluntary retirement  scheme. The  quantum  of	pension	 was
regulated by  that scheme.  The petitioner was also a member
of the	statutory scheme  framed within	 the  scope  of	 the
Employees Provident  Fund and  <a href="/doc/269107/" id="a_158">Miscellaneous Provisions Act</a>,
1952  and   was	 entitled   to	Provident  Fund	 payment  on
retirement. Likewise,  he was  entitled to payment under the
<a href="/doc/553799/" id="a_159">Gratuity Act</a>, 1972. These were the statutory rights which he
enjoyed. Being a non-contributory member of the Pension Fund
of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">149</span>
Burmah Shell  under the	 Trust Deed  set up by it, he earned
his pension.  But the Trust Deed contained many regulations.
The normal  annual pension  under the regulations worked out
to a  sum of  Rs.  165.99  per	month  for  the	 petitioner.
Regulation 16  provided for  certain "authorised deductions"
from the  amount of pension of non-contributing members. The
quantification of  these deductions  was provided for in the
said regulation.  If these  deductions were  not to be made,
the petitioner	would be  eligible for	his pension  of	 Rs.
165.99	and  Rs.  86  per  month  by  way  of  Supplementary
Retirement Benefits  which, he	asserted was  a part  of the
pensionary benefits. This was being paid by the Burmah Shell
to its	employees and  naturally this obligation devolved on
the successor  second respondent  under the  statutory rules
framed	in   this  behalf   [Burmah  Shell  (Acquisition  of
Undertakings  of  India)  (Administration  of  Fund)  Rules,
1976]. But,  by letter dated August 10, 1973, the petitioner
was informed that a sum of Rs. 56.12 would be deducted as an
'authorised deduction'	pursuant to reg. 16 mentioned above.
The cause  for this  was the  drawal of	 the provident	fund
amount.	 Likewise,  when  the  gratuity	 was  drawn  by	 the
petitioner, another letter dated October 24, 1973 was issued
to him	that there  would be  a	 further  reduction  of	 the
pension. When  the petitioner  complained to the appropriate
authority  that	 Burmah	 shell	was  declining	to  pay	 the
gratuity, a  direction was  issued the management to pay the
sum of	gratuity due.  Thereupon, a further deduction of Rs.
68.81  from  the  monthly  pension  of	the  petitioner	 was
effected as  an 'authorised deduction' under reg. 16(3). The
discretionary payment by way of retirement benefits, namely,
Rs. 86/-  per month  was also  stopped,	 maybe	because	 the
petitioner  litigatively  withdrew  gratuity  and  provident
fund. The  pitiable position  was that	the petitioner found
himself with  a miserable  amount of  Rs. 40.06 per month, a
consequence directly attributable to his receiving provident
fund and  gratuity amounts.  Of course,	 legality cannot  be
tested on the size of the sum and the court must examine the
merits de hors any sympathy.
</p><p id="p_97">     The petitioner's  attempt to  recover his	full pension
under<a href="/doc/483633/" id="a_160"> s.  33C(2)</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act failed since

<p id="p_99">					    (emphasis added)
Follow-up steps	 were accordingly  taken  and  there  is  no
quarrel over  it. It  is clear,	 therefore, that  the second
respondent has	made provision	for the rights and interests
of the	beneficiaries of  the Trust  established  by  Burmah
Shell for the benefit of the persons employed by it. <a href="/doc/1100501/" id="a_165">Section
10(1)</a> puts  this matter beyond doubt. This obligation of the
second respondent  is a	 statutory one	and having regard to
the provisions	of<a href="/doc/1080390/" id="a_166"> s.  11</a>, it  cannot  be  affected  by	 any
instrument or decree or order. The statutory continuation of
a pre-existing	liability to  pay pension, provident fund or
gratuity, cannot be avoided having regard to<a href="/doc/1907423/" id="a_167"> s. 10</a>.
</p><p id="p_100">     Shri Pai  contends that  the very	root of the claim to
pension is  the Trust  Deed which  is to be read integrally.
Regulation 16 is part and parcel of the right to pension and
cannot be  divorced from  reg. 13. Indeed, these regulations
are so	intertwined that  the "authorised deductions" are an
inextricable part  of the right to pension. If this approach
be correct  and if  there be  no other	legal prohibition in
making the deductions, the conclusion is convincing that the
quantum of  pension must  sustain the  authorised  deduction
immediately provident  fund  and  gratuity  are	 drawn.	 The
counter argument of Shri Parekh is that there is a statutory
prohibition against  any deduction  from the  pension if the
ground is  drawal of  provident fund  or gratuity amount. In
view of	 the statutory taboo he contends, that the deduction
is unauthorised	 even if  the contract	or trust may provide
so. So, the crucial question is whether there is a statutory
ban on	any diminution	in the	pension because of provident
fund and  gratuity benefits  having been  availed of. The PF
Act  and   the	<a href="/doc/553799/" id="a_168">Gratuity   Act</a>	contain	 certain  protective
provisions whose  true import  falls for construction and is
decisive of the point in dispute.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">151</span>
<p id="p_101">Let  us	  assume  for  a  moment  that	reg.  16  authorises
deductions and that discretionary payments, although enjoyed
by the	employees, is  liable to be stopped. The question is
whether s.  12 of  the PF  Act forbids any such reduction or
deduction out  of the  benefits in  the nature	of  old	 age
pension on  the score  of the payment of contribution to the
provident fund.	 We may extract<a href="/doc/1216959/" id="a_169"> s. 12</a> here for, according to
Shri Parekh, the language speaks for itself.
</p><p id="p_102">	  12. No employer in relation to an establishment to
     which any scheme or the insurance scheme applies shall,
     by reason	only of his liability for the payment of any
     contribution to  the Fund	or the Insurance Fund or any
     charges under  this Act  or the  scheme, reduce whether
     directly or  indirectly the  wages of  any employee  to
     whom the  scheme of the Insurance Scheme applies or the
     total quantum  of benefit	in the	nature	of  old	 age
     pension gratuity  provident fund  or Life	Insurance to
     which the	employee is  entitled under the terms of his
     employment, express or implied. (emphasis added)
We take	 the view that this benignant provision must receive
a benignant  construction and,	even if	 two interpretations
are permissible,  that which  furthers the beneficial object
should be  preferred From that perspective, the inference is
reasonable that	 the total quantum of benefits in the nature
of old age pension, gratuity or provident fund, shall not be
reduced by  reason only of the liability of the employer for
payment of  contribution to  the fund.	The Section prevails
over the Trust Deed. The provident fund accrues by statutory
force  and  <a href="/doc/1216959/" id="a_170"> s.	 12</a>   overrides	 any  agreement	 authorising
deductions, argues Shri Parekh.
</p><p id="p_103">     A similar	result holds  good even	 under the  <a href="/doc/553799/" id="a_171">Gratuity
Act</a>. <a href="/doc/1639036/" id="a_172">Section 14</a> of that Act reads thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_47">	  14. The  provisions of  this Act  or any rule made
     there under  shall have effect notwithstanding anything
     inconsistent therewith contained in any enactment other
     than this	Act or	in any instrument or contract having
     effect by virtue of any enactment other than this Act.
</blockquote><p id="p_104">The expression	"instrument" certainly	covers a  Trust Deed
and, notwithstanding the deduction that may be sanctioned by
the Trust Deed, the overriding effect of<a href="/doc/1639036/" id="a_173"> s. 14</a> preserves the
pension and  immunises it against any deduction attributable
to  the	  statutory  payment  of  the  provident  fund.	 The
deduction made	by the	second respondent is, in that event,
illegal.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">152</span>
<p id="p_105">     Shri Pai argues that no reduction of retiral benefit is
effected because the entitlement to pension under reg. 13 is
itself conditioned  by the  clause for	deduction and has no
separate amplitude  de hors the `authorised deduction' spelt
out in	reg. 16	 Let us	 examine these rival contentions. If
reg. 16	 is a  provision which	imposes	 a  cut	 in  certain
eventualities it is possible to hold that the employee has a
certain pensionary  right. But	if he draws P.F. or gratuity
that pension  will be  pared down  by  a  separate  rule  of
deduction from	the pension.  It follows  that there  is  no
straining of  the  language  of	 the  regulations  to  mean,
firstly, a  right to  pension quantified  in certain  manner
and, secondly,	a right	 in the Management to make deduction
from out of that pension if other retiral benefits are drawn
by the	employee. That	appears to be the pension scheme. If
this be	 correct, there is no substance in the argument that
the pension  itself is	automatically reduced into a smaller
scale  of  pension  on	the  drawal  of	 provident  fund  or
gratuity. Pension  is one  thing, deduction  is another. The
latter is independent of pension and operates on the pension
to amputate  it, as  it were.  If a  law forbids such cut or
amputation the pension remains intact.
</p><p id="p_106">     The public	 policy behind	the provisions	of ss.10, 12
and 14	of the	respective statutes  is clear.	We live in a
welfare	 State,	  in  a	  `socialist'  republic,   under   a
Constitution with  profound concern  for the  weaker classes
including  workers   (Part  IV)	 welfare  benefits  such  as
pensions, payment  of provident	 fund and  gratuity  are  in
fulfillment of	the Directive  Principles.  The	 payment  of
gratuity or provident fund should not occasion any deduction
from the  pension as  a "set  off".  Otherwise,	 the  solemn
statutory provisions  ensuring provident  fund and  gratuity
become illusory.  Pensions are	paid out  of regard for past
meritorious  services.	 The  root   of	 gratuity   and	 the
foundation of  provident fund  are different  Each one	is a
salutary benefaction statutorily guaranteed independently of
the other.  Even assuming that by private treaty parties had
otherwise agreed  to deductions before the coming into force
of  these   beneficial	enactments   they  cannot   now	  be
deprivatory. It	 is precisely to guard against such mischief
that  the   non-obstante  and	overriding  provisions	 are
engrafted on these statutes.
</p><p id="p_107">     We must  realise that  the	 pension  scheme  came	into
existence  prior   to  the   two  beneficial   statutes	 and
Parliament  when   enacting  these  legislations  must	have
clearly	 intended   extra  benefits   being   conferred	  on
employees. Such	 a consequence	will follow only if over and
above the normal pension, the benefits of provident fund and
gratuity are  enjoyed. On  the other  hand, if consequent on
the receipt of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">153</span>
these benefits	there is  a proportionate  reduction in	 the
pension, there	is no  real benefit  to the employee because
the Management	takes away by the left hand what it seems to
confer by  the right,  making the  legislation itself  left-
handed. To  hold that  on receipt  of gratuity and provident
fund the pension of the employee may be reduced pro tanto is
to frustrate  the supplementary	 character of  the benefits.
Indeed, that  is why  by<a href="/doc/1102534/" id="a_174"> ss.  12</a> and <a href="/doc/1639036/" id="a_175">14</a> overriding effect is
imparted and reduction in the retiral benefits on account of
provident fund	and gratuity  derived  by  the	employee  is
frowned upon.  We, accordingly,	 hold that it is not open to
the second  respondent to  deduct from	the full pension any
sum based  upon reg.  16 read with reg. 13. If reg. 16 which
now has	 acquired statutory flavour, having been adapted and
continued by  statutory	 rules,	 operates  contrary  to	 the
provisions of  the P.F.	 Act and  the <a href="/doc/553799/" id="a_176">Gratuity	Act</a>, it must
fail as invalid. We uphold the contention of the petitioner.
</p><p id="p_108">     The only  point that  survives turns on the stoppage of
the discretionary  supplementary pensionary benefit. What is
discretionary depends on the discretion of the employer. But
that power  when exercised  by an  agency of government like
the second respondent, must be based upon good faith and due
care. If  as a measure of reprisal or provoked by the drawal
of  gratuity,  or  by  resort  to  legal  authorities,	such
supplementary benefit  is struck  off, it  will cease  to be
bona fide  or valid.  We have  no material  to hold that the
second respondent  has independently  considered this matter
and so	we direct  that if  the petitioner  moves the second
respondent stating  his case  for  the	continuance  of	 the
supplementary benefit,	it will	 be considered on its merits
uninfluences by extraneous factors. We do not think it right
or necessary to issue any further direction.
</p><p id="p_109">     We hold  that the	petitioner is  entitled to  his full
pension of  Rs. 165.99. We further hold that, on appropriate
representation by  him, the second respondent shall consider
the  grant  or	stoppage  of  the  supplementary  pensionary
benefit on  its merits.	 The petition  is allowed with costs
which we quantify at Rs. 2,000/- Shri Parekh represents that
this sum may be directed to be paid to the Legal Aid Society
in the	Supreme Court. We appreciate this gesture of counsel
and direct the Registry to act accordingly.
</p><p id="p_110">     Social justice  is the  conscience of our Constitution,
the State  is the promoter of economic justice, the founding
faith which  sustains the  Constitution and  the country  is
Indian humanity.  The public sector is a model employer with
a social conscience not an artificial person without soul to
be  damned  or	body  to  be  burnt.  The  stance  that,  by
deductions  and	 discretionary	withholding  of	 payment,  a
public sector
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">154</span>
company may  reduce an old man's pension to Rs. 40/-from Rs.
250/- is  unjust, even if it be assumed to be legal. Law and
justice must  be on talking terms and what matters under our
constitutional	scheme	is  not	 merciless  law	 but  humane
legality. The  true strength  and stability of our polity is
society's  credibility	 in  social   justice,	not  perfect
legalise; and  this case  does disclose indifference to this
fundamental value. We are aware that, Shri G.B. Pai, for the
Management, did	 urge that `principle' was involved and that
settlements had	 been reached  between Labour and Management
on many issues. We do appreciate the successful exercises of
the  Management	  in  reaching	just  settlements  with	 its
employees but  wonder whether  the highest  principle of our
constitutional culture	is not	empathy	 with  every  little
individual.
</p><p id="p_111">     PATHAK,  J.-I   must  confess  to	some  hesitation  in
accepting  the	 proposition  that   the  Bharat   Petroleum
Corporation Limited  is a "State" within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_177">Art.
12</a> of  the Constitution.  But in view of the direction taken
by the	law in	this Court  since <a href="/doc/1281050/" id="a_178">Ramana  Dayaram Shetty  v.
International Airport  Authority</a>. I  find  I  must  lean  in
favour of  that conclusion.  I would  have welcomed  a wider
range of  debate before	 us on	the  fundamental  principles
involved in  the issue	and on the implications flowing from
the definition	in the	<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_179">Companies Act</a>, 1956 of a "Government
Company", but perhaps a future case may provide that.
</p><p id="p_112">     As	  regards   the	  Burmah   Shell   (Acquisition	  of
Undertakings in	 <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_180">India) Act</a>,  1976 I  am unable	 to see	 any
support for  the proposition  in the provisions of that Act.
The provisions	will apply  to any  Government Company,	 and
they do not alter the basic nature of that company. They are
provisions which  could well  have been applied to a private
corporation, if	 the Act  had selected	one for	 vesting the
undertaking  in	  it.  Would  that  have  made	the  private
corporation a "State"?
</p><p id="p_113">     On the  merits of	the petitioner's claim I need say no
more than  that I  agree with  my learned  brothers that the
petitioner should be granted the relief proposed by them.
