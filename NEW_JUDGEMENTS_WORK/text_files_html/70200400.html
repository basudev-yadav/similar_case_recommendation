</p><p id="p_3">2.                  Having considered the main ground of challenge, which is of not

giving sufficient opportunity of hearing to the appellant and also the relevant

facts and circumstances of the case, I am of the view that  limited relief can be

granted to the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.                  Accordingly,   appeal   is   allowed.     The   impugned   order   is   hereby

quashed   and   set   aside.     The   matter   is   remitted   back   to   the   trial   Court   for

considering   the   application   (Exhibit   5)   afresh   in   accordance   with   law.     The

application shall be disposed of within one month from the date of appearance

of the parties. Both the parties shall cooperate with the trial Court in expeditious

disposal of the application within a time frame fixed by this Court and shall not

seek any adjournment unless the same is required to be sought for the reason

beyond   their   control.     Both   the   parties   to   appear   before   the   trial   Court   on

12.6.2017.     However,   by   way   of   ad-interim   injunction,   the   appellant   shall

refrain from using in any manner the duplicate trade mark till final disposal of

the application  (Exhibit 5) by  the  trial Court.   It is made clear that the  ad-

interim injunction has been granted by this Court only to protect interests of

both the parties and, therefore, the trial Court shall not be influenced by the

order   of   this   Court   granting   such   ad-interim   injunction   in   favour   of   the

respondent.
