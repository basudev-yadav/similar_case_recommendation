</pre><p id="p_6">1.       The captioned appeals pertain to assessment years 1997-98

and 1998-99.                The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter

referred to as the „Tribunal‟) had by a common judgment dated

29.12.2005            disposed        of    three      appeals       pertaining        to      the

aforementioned assessment years. Out of the three appeals, two

appeals had been filed by the revenue, while the third appeal had

been filed by the assessee. The revenue had filed appeals for both

the assessment years, i.e., 1997-98 and 1998-99, while the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">ITA 1110/2006 &amp; 1111/2006                                                            Page 1 of 17</span>
 assessee had filed an appeal only qua assessment year 1997-98.

However, before us the common ground is that the appeals

pertained to a singular issue, though the amounts involved differ in

each of the captioned assessment years.           Therefore, we have

framed the following questions of law for assessment years 1996-97

and 1998-99, which, as would be evident, apart from the amounts

involved are otherwise identical:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">       Assessment year 1998-99
       Whether ITAT was correct in law in holding that the
       expenditure of Rs 1,70,68,811/- incurred by the assessee
       on account of software and professional expenses was a
       revenue expenditure?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">       Assessment year 1997-98
       Whether ITAT was correct in law in holding that the
       expenditure of Rs 1,36,77,664/- incurred by the assessee
       on account of software and professional expenses was a
       revenue expenditure?
</blockquote><p id="p_7">2.       Given aforesaid circumstances, following facts are required to

be noticed in order to adjudicate upon the issues culled out above:

2.1      The assessee it appears had installed a software in the

financial year 1996-97, relevant for assessment year 1997-98. The

software was installed by Arthur Anderson &amp; Associates, which is an

accounting and consulting firm, pursuant to an agreement dated

25.06.1996 executed with the assessee. The software was based on

application software, commonly known as, oracle application.                In

respect of this, an agreement appears to have been executed

between the assessee and Oracle Software India Pvt. Ltd.              The

agreement between the assessee and Arthur Anderson &amp; Associates
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">ITA 1110/2006 &amp; 1111/2006                                    Page 2 of 17</span>
 inter alia adverted to the manner in which oracle application had to

be implemented.
</p>
<p id="p_8">3.       In the assessment year 1997-98, the assessee had amortized

an expenditure amounting to Rs 1,36,77,664/- towards software and

professional           expenses       under   the   head   "deferred    revenue

expenditure". It is pertinent to note that the assessee had not

written off any part of this expenditure in its books of accounts,

during the assessment year 1997-98; though, while computing its

taxable income the assessee claimed the entire amount as

expenditure on revenue account.                In the succeeding assessment

year, i.e., 1998-99, an additional expenditure in the sum of Rs 1.71

crores        was      claimed   as    deduction.    During   the   assessment

proceedings conducted in respect of assessment year 1997-98, the

assessing officer noticed the aforementioned aspect and, therefore,

called upon the assessee to give details of the nature of software

purchased and, the period by which it was likely to be replaced. The

assessee responded to the query raised, by broadly stating as

follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">         "a) that software technology is very rapidly changing and
         hence there is no enduring benefit.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">         b)     In the instant case, software has been installed for
         carrying on the assessee's business more efficiently and
         that the said expenditure has not brought into existence
         any asset which is capable of being source of income.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">         c) that the software installed in F.Y. 96-97, due to various
         deficiencies, had to be upgraded in the following F.Y. and



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">ITA 1110/2006 &amp; 1111/2006                                              Page 3 of 17</span>
          an additional expenditure of Rs 1.71 crores was incurred
         for this purpose."
</blockquote><p id="p_9">3.1      The       Assessing   Officer,   however,   did   not   accept      the

explanation given by the assessee, and thus, proceeded to disallow

the deduction claimed by the assessee.               Briefly, the reasons for

doing so were as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_10">(i) the expense was incurred by the assessee towards an „intensive

project‟ with the idea of overhauling the method accountancy, and

to efficiently train the accounting staff of the assessee;

</p><p id="p_11">(ii)     the project spanned over a period of 18-24 months;

</p><p id="p_12">(iii)    the expenditure incurred by the assessee had accorded long

term benefit to it - since it would serve the assessee‟s purpose for a

number of years as also the fact that it would enhance the income

of the assessee;
</p>
<p id="p_13">3.2      The fact that the assessee had incurred an expenditure in the

succeeding year as well weighed with the Assessing Officer in

coming to the conclusion that the expenditure incurred had brought

about enduring benefit to the assessee.
</p>
<p id="p_14">3.3      Towards this end, the Assessing Officer also observed that the

expenditure incurred in the financial year 1997-98 (assessment year

1998-99) was towards a "project" and not for „upgradation of an

existing project or for rectification of mistakes‟.

3.4      The Assessing Officer, broadly for the foregoing reasons, as

indicated above, rejected the claim for deduction and, as a matter of

fact also denied, it appears, the depreciation allowance to the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">ITA 1110/2006 &amp; 1111/2006                                          Page 4 of 17</span>
 assessee on the ground that there was no clarity as to whether in

the relevant period the assessee had put the software to use.

3.5      In the assessment year 1998-99 the Assessing Officer followed

the rationale adopted by his predecessors in the earlier assessment

year, i.e., 1997-98 and for the reasons given therein (i.e., that the

expenditure was incurred towards an ongoing project) disallowed

the deduction claimed, by treating the expenditure incurred, in the

sum of Rs 1,70,68,811/-, as capital expenditure. It appears that for

the very same reason that there was no material to show that the

software had been used in the relevant period, i.e., assessment

years 1998-99, depreciation was also disallowed to the assessee.

However, the assessee was allowed deduction under Section 80IA,

after taking into account the aforementioned disallowance.

</p><p id="p_15">4.       Being aggrieved, the assessee preferred appeals with the

Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) [hereinafter referred to as

„CIT(A)‟] in respect of orders passed by the Assessing Officer for

both the assessment years, i.e., 1997-98 and 1998-99. The CIT(A),

in respect of both appeals passed a common order. After noticing at

great length the terms of the agreement entered into between the

assessee and Arthur Anderson &amp; Associates, the submissions of the

parties and, the judgments cited on the issue; he came to the

conclusion that the assessee‟s claim for both the assessment years,

i.e., 1997-98 and 1998-99 had to be allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_16">5.       The revenue being aggrieved by the decision of the CIT(A)

preferred an appeal to the Tribunal.       The Tribunal, as indicated

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">ITA 1110/2006 &amp; 1111/2006                                    Page 5 of 17</span>
 above,         passed         a    common       judgment     after     noticing      the

aforementioned facts in respect of the said assessment years. The

Tribunal returned the following finding of facts.

</p><p id="p_17">(i)      The assessee was in the business of manufacturing of

automobile safety glass; broadly of two types, tampered and

laminated, and that its main source of income was from the said

activity.
</p>
<p id="p_18">(ii)     During the financial year 1996-97 (assessment year 1997-98)

the     assessee            had    embarked    upon    a   major     computerization

programme             in     the   area   of   financial   accounting,    purchases,

inventory, production, planning and control.

</p><p id="p_19">(iii)    Arthur Anderson &amp; Associates presented a software package

produced by Oracle Corporation, USA, distributed through its

associates Oracle Software India Pvt. Ltd., vide its offer letter dated

25.06.1996.             The said letter set out the contours of what the

software application envisaged.                 The software application broadly

dealt with financial accounting, inventory and purchase.                            The

assessee in terms of the arrangement arrived at with Arthour

Anderson &amp; Associates was required to pay professional fee to it,

and that on the assessee accepting the offer of Aurthor Anderson &amp;

Associates was required to enter into an agreement dated

28.06.1996 with Oracle Software India Pvt. Ltd. The said agreement

was titled as "Master Software Licence and Service Agreement".




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">ITA 1110/2006 &amp; 1111/2006                                                  Page 6 of 17</span>
</p><p id="p_20"> (iv)     The software supplied to the assessee was not used as a part

of any production process.        The agreement with Oracle was a

licence agreement which enabled the assessee to use the software.

</p><p id="p_21">(v)      The assessee did not acquire any ownership in the software

application; all rights, title and interest in the application remained

in Oracle.
</p>
<p id="p_22">(vi)     In return for a right to use the software application, the

assessee paid licence fee and „not any purchase price‟.

</p><p id="p_23">(vii)    In addition to the above, the agreement with Oracle was also

provided for extension of maintenance services, for which, the

assessee was required to pay an additional fee over and above, the

licence fee.
</p>
<p id="p_24">(viii) The licence was terminable under the provisions of the

agreement.
</p>
<p id="p_25">(ix)     The assessee did not acquire any tangible asset or an asset

which created a new source of income or augmented the existing

source of income.
</p>
<p id="p_26">(x)      The expenses incurred facilitated, management and the

conduct of the assessee‟s business and, thus was not in the nature

of a capital expenditure, and

</p><p id="p_27">(xi)     Lastly, the expenditure incurred by the assessee allowed it to

run its business „more efficiently‟ and perhaps „more profitably‟.

5.1      The expenditure incurred in the aforementioned assessment

years was found as having been broadly incurred under following

sub-heads:
</p>
<p id="p_28"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">ITA 1110/2006 &amp; 1111/2006                                    Page 7 of 17</span>
</p><pre id="pre_3">          (a)        Licence fee;

         (b)       Annual technical support fee;

         (c)       Professional charges;

         (d)       Data entry operator charges;

         (e)       Training charges; and

         (f)       Travelling expenses.

5.2      Therefore, none of these expenses, according to the Tribunal

</pre><p id="p_29">resulted in creation of new asset or a new source of income. The

expenses incurred were as per the Tribunal recurring in nature,

expended either to upgrade the system or run the system.

</p><p id="p_30">6.       Being aggrieved by the aforementioned judgment of the

Tribunal, the revenue preferred an appeal to this court.

6.1      On behalf of the revenue arguments were advanced by Mr

Sanjiv Rajpal, while on behalf of the assessee submissions were

made by Mr M.S. Syali, learned senior counsel. The learned counsel

for the revenue in support of his arguments relied upon the orders

passed by the assessing officer in the two assessment years to

demonstrate that the expenditure incurred was of a capital nature

as it would enure to the benefit of the assessee for a long period of

time.
</p>
<p id="p_31">6.2      Mr Rajpal submitted that the very fact that a huge expense

had been incurred in the financial year 1997-98 (assessment year

1998-99) would show that the expenditure was not incurred for the

purposes of upgradation or for correction of deficiencies, as has

been found by the Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_32"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">ITA 1110/2006 &amp; 1111/2006                                   Page 8 of 17</span>
 6.3      The learned counsel, thus, contended that the deduction as

claimed by the assessee ought to be disallowed and the view taken

by the Tribunal and the CIT(A) on the said issue, consequently, be

reversed.
</p>
<p id="p_33">6.4      In support of his submissions Mr Rajpal also highlighted the

fact that the assessee in its books of accounts had not debited the

expenditure and, as a matter of fact, had attempted to amortize the

expenditure over a number of years. This, according to Mr Rajpal,

was a clear indicator that the expenditure as per the assessee‟s own

understanding was not made on revenue account.

</p><p id="p_34">7.       On the other hand Mr Syali appearing for the assessee

contended that it is well settled in a catena of judgments, both of

this court and of the Supreme Court, that merely because an

expenditure results in an enduring benefit would not be a sufficient

reason to treat the expenditure incurred as one expended on capital

account. Mr Syali submitted that what had to be deciphered in the

facts and circumstances of each case, the real intent and purpose of

the expenditure, to ascertain as to whether it resulted in bringing

into existence a capital asset. In support of his submissions learned

counsel relied upon the following judgments:

</blockquote><p id="p_35">8.       Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, what has

emerged on facts as found by the authorities below is as follows:

The assessee is in the business of manufacturing safety glass which

is used in automobiles.     Thus the main source of income of the

assessee is from the said activity. The assessee appears to have

entered into an agreement with Arthur Anderson &amp; Associates in the

financial year 1996-97 (assessment year 1997-98) for installation of

a software application for assistance in areas related to financial

accounting, inventory and purchase. It has emerged that an offer

was made in respect of such a software application by Arthur

Anderson &amp; Associates, which find a reflection in a letter dated

25.06.1996. The said agreement between the assessee and Arthur

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">ITA 1110/2006 &amp; 1111/2006                                 Page 10 of 17</span>
 Anderson &amp; Associates also required the assessee to enter into a

back-to-back agreement with Oracle.            The reasons perhaps being

that the software application supplied by the Aurthor Anderson &amp;

Associates worked on oracle application.           It is precisely for this

reason that Arthur Anderson &amp; Associates required the assessee to

enter into a licence agreement with oracle titled Master Software

Licence and Services Agreement. The assessee was thus, required

to pay : apart from the fee to Arthur Anderson &amp; Associates qua its

agreement with it; licence fee to Oracle. As a matter of fact Oracle

also offered support and maintenance services for which a further

additional fee was required to be paid to Oracle.

8.1      The assessee thus admittedly in respect of the aforesaid

transactions incurred an expenditure to the tune of Rs 1,36,77,664/-

and Rs 1,70,68,811/- in assessment years 1997-98 and 1998-99

respectively.           In the books of accounts for the assessment years

1997-98 the assessee had not written off any sum, while in the

succeeding assessment year, i.e., 1998-99 the assessee had written

off a part of the expenditure amounting to Rs 9,91,228/-.

8.2      Given these facts, could it be said that the expenditure

incurred by the assessee in the aforementioned assessment years

was in the nature of capital expenditure.
</p>
<p id="p_36">9.       The revenue in support of its stand has taken recourse to the

test of enduring benefit. It is in our view now somewhat trite to say

that the test of enduring benefit is not a certain or a conclusive test

which the courts can apply almost by rote. What is required to be

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">ITA 1110/2006 &amp; 1111/2006                                        Page 11 of 17</span>
 seen is the real intent and purpose of the expenditure and whether

the expenditure results in creation of fixed capital for the assessee.

It is important to bear in mind that what is required to be seen is not

whether the advantage obtained lasts forever but whether the

expense incurred does away with a recurring expense(s) defrayed

towards running a business as against an expense undertaken for

the benefit of the business as a whole.         In other words, the

expenditure which is incurred, which enables the profit making

structure to work more efficiently leaving the source of the profit

making structure untouched, would in our view be an expense in the

nature of revenue expenditure. Fine tuning business operations to

enable the management to run its business effectively, efficiently

and profitably; leaving the fixed assets untouched would be an

expenditure in the nature of revenue expenditure even though the

advantage may last for an indefinite period.        Test of enduring

benefit or advantage would thus collapse in such like cases.                 It

would in our view be only truer in cases which deal with technology

and software application, which do not in any manner supplant the

source of income or added to the fixed capital of the assessee. [<a href="/doc/1805387/" id="a_10">See

Alembic Chemical Works Co. Ltd. vs CIT</a> (1989) 177 ITR 377;

Vs. Indian Visit.com (supra)].
</p>
<p id="p_37">9.1.     This is the approach which the Supreme Court has applied

even in cases where there is a once for all or a lump sum payment.

What is to be seen in the facts of this case, as already noticed by us

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">ITA 1110/2006 &amp; 1111/2006                                    Page 12 of 17</span>
 hereinabove, that the assessing officer as a matter of fact has

returned a finding that the expenditure undertaken was for

overhauling the accountancy of the assessee and to efficiently train

the accounting staff of the assessee.           The Tribunal, which is

decidedly the final fact finding authority has after noticing the

material on record observed that the expenditure was incurred

under various sub-heads, which included licence fee, annual

technical support fee, professional charges, data entry operator

charges, training charges and travelling expenses. The final figure

was a consolidation of expenses incurred under these sub-heads.

The Tribunal, in our view, and rightly so, came to the conclusion that

none of these resulted in either creation of a new asset or brought

forth a new source of income for the assessee.             The Tribunal

classified the said expenses as being recurring in nature to upgrade

and/or to run the system.
</p>
<p id="p_38">10.      In the background of the aforementioned findings, it cannot be

said that the expenses brought about in an enduring benefit to the

assessee.          The assessing officer was perhaps swayed by the fact

that in the succeeding financial year, i.e., 1997-98 (assessment year

1998-99), the amount spent was large. First of all, the extent of the

expenditure cannot be a decisive factor in determining its nature.

As observed by the Tribunal, the assessee in the relevant

assessment year had a turnover of Rs 150 crores and that even

without this expenditure it would have continued to achieve the said

turnover; though the expenditure incurred in issue would have

 enabled it to run its business more efficiently.                  Therefore, the

rationale supplied by the assessing officer in support of its order

which found resonance in submissions of the learned counsel for the

revenue is, in our view flawed and, hence it would have to be

rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_39">10.1. Secondly, the mere fact that the assessing officer records that

the expenditure, in financial year 1997-98 (assessment year 1998-

</p><p id="p_40">99), was incurred towards what he terms as an „on-going project‟

would not ipso facto give it a colour of capital expenditure.                           A

careful reading of the Tribunal‟s judgment show that after noticing

the submission of the assessee that the expenditure incurred in the

said assessment year was for removing deficiencies which were

found in the software installed in the earlier assessment year, and

that, out of a sum of Rs 1.71 crores a sum of Rs 49 lacs was incurred

to modify, customize and upgrade the software installed, while the

balance expenditure was used for development and implementation

</p><p id="p_41">- it returned a finding that the expenses were incurred to upgrade

and run the system. In view of these findings we are of the opinion

that assessing officer discovered an erroneous principle on the basis

of which he denied the exemption to the assessee.

</p><p id="p_42">11.      Software           is   nothing   but   another   word   for   computer

programmes, i.e., instructions, that make the hardware work.

Software is broadly of two types, i.e., the systems software, which is

also known as the operating system which controls the working of

the computer; while the other being applications such as word

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">ITA 1110/2006 &amp; 1111/2006                                               Page 14 of 17</span>
 processing programs, spread sheets and data base which perform

the tasks for which people use computers. Besides these there are

two other categories of software, these being: network software and

language software.             The network software enables groups of

computers to communicate with each other, while language

software provides with tools required to write programmes.              (See

Microsoft Computer Dictionary, 5th Edition "Software" at page 489).

</p><p id="p_43">12.      The aforesaid would show that what the assessee acquired

through Arthur              Anderson and Associates was an application

software which, enabled it to execute tasks in the field of

accounting, purchases and inventory maintenance.            The fact that

the application software would have to be updated from time to

time based on the requirements of the assessee in the context of

the advancement of its business and/or its diversification, if any;

the changes brought about due to statutory amendments by law or

by professional bodies like the Institute of Chartered Accountants of

India,      which are        given the   responsibility of conceiving and

formulating the accounting standards from time to time, and

perhaps also, by reason of the fact that expenses may have to be

incurred on account of corruption of the software due to unintended

or intended ingress into the system - ought not give a colour to the

expenditure incurred as one expended on capital account.              Given

the fact that there are myriad factors which may call for expenses to

be incurred in the field of software applications, it cannot be said

that either the extent of the expense or the expense being incurred

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">ITA 1110/2006 &amp; 1111/2006                                       Page 15 of 17</span>
 in close proximity, in the subsequent years, would be conclusively

determinative of its nature. The assessing officer has, in our view,

erred precisely for these very reasons.
</p>
<p id="p_44">13.      Before we conclude, we may also deal with the one last issue

raised by the learned counsel for the revenue which is that in the

books of accounts, the assessee had not written off the expense in

issue, while in the succeeding assessment year only a part of the

expense had been written off and, therefore, the assessee‟s own

understanding of the nature of the expense involved was that it was

expended on capital account.
</p>
<p id="p_45">13.1 The aforesaid submission is only to be stated to be rejected.

The reason being: that the treatment of a particular expense or, a

provision in the books of accounts can never be conclusively

determinative of the nature of the expense. An assessee cannot be

denied a claim for deduction which is otherwise tenable in law on

the ground that the assessee had treated it differently in its books.

The observation of the Supreme court in the case of <a href="/doc/1011/" id="a_12">Kedar Nath Jute

Manufacturing Co. Ltd. vs CIT</a> (1971) 82 ITR 363 puts this beyond

doubt.        The relevant observations of the Supreme court on this

aspect of the matter are extracted hereinbelow: "......Whether the

assessee is entitled to a particular deduction or not will depend on

the provision of law relating thereto and not on the view which the

assessee might take of his rights nor can the existence or absence

of entries in the books of accounts be decisive or conclusive in the

matter"......

 13.2 Therefore, the aforesaid contention is of no avail to the

revenue.
</p>
<p id="p_47">14.      For the foregoing reasons, we are of the view that the

questions of law for each of the aforementioned assessment years

have to be answered in the affirmative and in favour of the

assessee. Resultantly, the aforementioned appeals are dismissed.
