ARIJIT PASAYAT, J



	These two appeals relate to the common judgment rendered by a 
learned Single Judge of the Madhya Pradesh High Court at Jabalpur Bench 
upholding conviction of the appellants (hereinafter referred to as the 
accused by their respective names) for commission of offence punishable 
under <a href="/doc/325366/" id="a_1">Section 18</a> of the Narcotic Drugs and <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_2">Psychotropic Substances Act</a>, 
1985 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Act'). In addition to custodial 
sentence of 10 years, a fine of Rs.1,00,000/- was imposed. 
</p>
<p id="p_2">Prosecution version as unfolded during trial is as under:
	On 3.11.1998 S.B. Shrivastava (PW-6) received information that two 
persons in possession of opium were going on scooter No.M.P.-04-R-7693 
from the side of new jail to Gandhi Nagar. This information was recorded 
at Serial No.216 in Roznamcha and transmitted to the C.S.P. as per Ex.P-
</p><p id="p_3">1. The accused persons were stopped and apprised through the notices 
Ex.P-10 and Ex.P-11 that if they so desire, can be taken to a Magistrate 
or a gazetted officer for search. They opted to be searched by him. On 
their search 200 grams of opium was found on the "person" of each of 
them. It was seized as per seizure memos Ex.P-4 and Ex.P-6. Samples of 
10 grams each were taken and sealed. The seized opium in sealed 
condition was deposited in Malkhana of the police station. The crime was 
registered as per Ex.P-12. The information relating to search and arrest 
of the accused persons was sent to the superior officer on 5.11.1998 as 
per Ex.P-2. The sealed samples were sent to the Forensic Science 
Laboratory and as per report Ex.P-14, the commodity which was seized was 
found to be opium. The accused persons pleaded not guilty. Their defence 
was that they have been falsely implicated. 
</p>
<p id="p_4">	The trial Court held that the testimony of the investigating 
officer to be reliable and unbreakably supported by the Onkar Singh 
Kushwaha (PW-1) and Rajindra Singh Yadav (PW-3)-Police Constable, who 
accompanied him though the two panch witnesses Ramesh (PW-4) and Yakoob 
Khan (PW-5) did not support the prosecution version. The trial Court 
held that there was full compliance with the statutory requirements 
contained in <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_3">Sections 42</a>, <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_4">50</a>, <a href="/doc/1363838/" id="a_5">55</a> and <a href="/doc/669884/" id="a_6">57</a> of the Act and, therefore, 
convicted and sentenced the appellants as afore-noted. Appeals before 
the High Court as indicated at the threshold did not bring any relief to 
the accused-appellants.  
</p>
<p id="p_5">	In support of the appeals, learned counsel appearing for the 
accused-appellants mainly focused on alleged non-compliance with the 
requirements of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_7">Section 50</a> of the Act. According to them, mere asking 
the accused as to whether they would like to be searched by the Gazetted 
Officer or the Magistrate is not sufficient compliance of the 
requirements embodied in <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_8">Section 50</a> of the Act. By merely asking them 
what is to be done is seeking their opinion and not making them aware of 
their right. Great emphasis is laid on certain observations made by a 
Constitution Bench in <a href="/doc/1098587/" id="a_9">State of Punjab v. Baldev Singh</a> (1999 (6) SCC 
</p><p id="p_6">172). With reference to the questions that were formulated for 
determination in Baldev Singh's case (supra), it was submitted that the 
sanctity that is attached to the compliance with the requirements has to 
be culled out from references made to the principles under the 
Preventive Detention Laws, The Fifth Amendment to the American 
Constitution and the imperative and obligatory nature of the duty as 
indicated in <a href="/doc/501198/" id="a_10">D.K. Basu v. State of West Bengal</a> (1997 (1) SCC 416). <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_11">The 
Act</a> provides stringent measures attached for infraction. That itself 
brings in the necessity to ensure strict compliance with the 
requirements. What has been done in the instant case is not in any way 
compliance with the requirements as there was no specific information 
given about the right. It is pointed out that in some cases, this Court 
has said that substantial compliance would be sufficient which is 
against the settled position in law that in respect of penal statutes 
substantial compliance will not be sufficient. 
</p>
<p id="p_7">	In response, learned counsel for the State submitted that the 
purpose of informing the accused is to ensure that there is transparency 
and is aimed at ruling out allegations of false implication. There is no 
specific manner in which the information/intimation is required to be 
given. The accused did not opt to be searched by the Gazetted Officer or 
the Magistrate even though it was pointed out to him that he had the 
choice. It was not as if he had limited option. The search could be 
conducted in the presence of the named officers to the exclusion of the 
officer making the offer for the search if accused so chose. According 
to learned counsel, before the Constitution Bench in Baldev Singh's case 
(supra) the form of information/intimation aspect was not under 
consideration. 
</p>
<p id="p_8">	In order to appreciate rival submissions, some of the observations 
made by the Constitution Bench in Baldev Singh's case (supra) are 
required to be noted. It is also to be noted that the Court did not in 
the abstract decide whether <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_12">Section 50</a> was directory or mandatory in 
nature. It was held that the provisions to the Act implicitly make it 
imperative and obligatory and cast a duty on the investigating officer 
(empowered officer) to ensure that search of the person (suspect) 
concerned is conducted in the manner prescribed by <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_13">Section 50</a> by 
intimating to the person concerned about the existence of his right that 
if he so requires, he shall be searched before a Gazetted Officer or a 
Magistrate and in case he so opts, failure to conduct his search before 
a Gazetted Officer or a Magistrate would cause prejudice to the accused 
and render the recovery of the illicit articles suspect and vitiate the 
conviction and sentence of the accused. Where the conviction has been 
recorded only on the basis of the possession of the illicit article, 
recovered during a search conducted in violation of the provisions of 
<a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_14">Section 50</a> of the Act, it was illegal. It was further held that the 
omission may not vitiate the trial as such, but because of the inherent 
prejudice which would be caused to an accused by the omission to be 
informed of the existence of his right, it would render his conviction 
and sentence unsustainable. 	In paragraph 32 of the judgment (at page 
</p><p id="p_9">200) this position was highlighted. In para 57, inter alia the following 
conclusions were arrived at:
</p>
<p id="p_10">	"(1)	That when an empowered officer or a duly 
authorized officer acting on prior information is 
about to search a person, it is imperative for him to 
inform the person concerned of his right under sub-
section (1) of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_15">Section  50</a> of the Act of being taken 
to the nearest gazetted officer or nearest Magistrate 
for making the search. However, such information may 
not necessarily be in writing.
</p> 
<p id="p_11">	(2)	That failure to inform the person 
concerned about the existence of his right to be 
searched before a gazetted officer or a Magistrate 
would cause prejudice to an accused.
</p> 
<p id="p_12">	(3)	That a search made by an empowered 
officer, on prior information, without informing the 
person of his right that if he so requires, he shall 
be taken before a gazetted officer or a Magistrate 
for search and in case he so opts, failure to conduct 
his search before a gazetted officer or a Magistrate, 
may not vitiate the trial but would render the 
recovery of the illicit article suspect and vitiate 
the conviction and sentence of an accused, where the 
conviction has been recorded only on the basis of the 
possession of the illicit article, recovered from his 
person, during a search conducted in violation of the 
provisions of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_16">Section 50</a> of the Act. 
</p>
<p id="p_13">	(5)	That whether or not the safeguards 
provided in <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_17">Section 50</a> have been duly observed would 
have to be determined by the court on the basis of 
the evidence led at the trial. Finding on that issue, 
one way or the other would be relevant for recording 
an order of conviction or acquittal. Without giving 
an opportunity to the prosecution to establish, at 
the trial, that the provisions of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_18">Section 50</a> and, 
particularly, the safeguards provided therein were 
duly complied with, it would not be permissible to 
cut short a criminal trial. 
</p><p id="p_14">	(6)	That in the context in which the 
protection has been incorporated in <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_19">Section 50</a> for 
the benefit of the person intended to be searched, we 
do not express any opinion whether the provisions of 
<a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_20">Section 50</a> are mandatory or directory, but hold that 
failure to inform the person concerned of his right 
as emanating from sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_21">Section 50</a> and 
render the recovery of the contraband suspect and the 
conviction and sentence of an accused bad and 
unsustainable in law. 
</p>	
<p id="p_15">(7) That an illicit article seized from the 
person of an accused during search conducted in 
violation of the safeguards provided in <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_22">Section 50</a> of 
the Act cannot be used as evidence of proof of 
unlawful possession of the contraband on the accused 
though any other material recovered during that 
search may be relied upon by the prosecution, in 
other proceedings, against an accused, 
notwithstanding the recovery of that material during 
an illegal search." 
</p>
<p id="p_16">	It is not disputed that there is no specific form prescribed or 
intended for conveying the information required to be given under 
<a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_23">Section 50</a>. What is necessary is that the accused (suspect) should be 
made aware of the existence of his right to be searched in presence of 
one of the officers named in the Section itself. Since no specific mode 
or manner is prescribed or intended, the Court has to see the substance 
and not the form of intimation. Whether the requirements of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_24">Section 50</a> 
have been met is a question which is to be decided on the facts of each 
case and there cannot be any sweeping generalization and/or strait-
jacket formula. 
</p>
<p id="p_17">	<a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_25">Section 50</a> does not involve any self-incrimination. It is only a 
procedure required to protect the rights of an accused (suspect) being 
made aware of the existence of his right to be searched if so required 
by him before any of the specified officers. The object seems to be to 
ensure that at a later stage the accused (suspect) does not take a plea 
that the articles were planted on him or that those were not recovered 
from him. To put it differently, fair play and transparency in the 
process of search has been given the primacy. <a href="/doc/1587721/" id="a_26">In Raghbir Singh v. State 
of Haryana</a> (1996 (2) SCC 201), the true essence of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_27">Section 50</a> was 
highlighted in the following manner:
</p>
<p id="p_18">	"8. The very question that is referred to us came to 
be considered by a Bench of two learned Judges on 
22.1.1996 in Manohar Lal v. State of Rajasthan 
(Crl.M.P.No.138/96 in SLP(Crl.)No.184/1996). One of us 
(Verma, J), speaking for the Bench, held:
</p>
<p id="p_19">	"It is clear from <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_28">Section 50</a> of 
the NDPS Act that the option given 
thereby to the accused is only to choose 
whether he would like to be searched by 
the officer making the search or in the 
presence of the nearest available 
Gazetted Officer or the nearest 
available Magistrate. The choice of the 
nearest Gazetted Officer or the nearest 
Magistrate has to be exercised by the 
officer making the search and not by the 
accused".
</p>
<p id="p_20"> 9.	We concur with the view taken in Manohar Lal's 
case supra. 
</p>
<p id="p_21">10.	Finding a person to be in possession of 
articles which are illicit under the provisions of 
the Act has the consequence of requiring him to prove 
that he was not in contravention of its provisions 
and it renders him liable to severe punishment. It 
is, therefore, that the Act affords the person to be 
searched a safeguard. He may require the search to be 
conducted in the presence of a senior officer. The 
senior officer may be a Gazetted Officer or a 
Magistrate, depending upon who is conveniently 
available. 
</p>
<p id="p_22">11.	The option under <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_29">Section 50</a> of the Act, as it 
plainly reads, is only of being searched in the 
presence of such senior officer. There is no further 
option of being searched in the presence of either a 
Gazetted Officer or of being searched in the presence 
of a Magistrate. The use of the word 'nearest' in 
<a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_30">Section 50</a> is relevant. The search has to be 
conducted at the earliest and, once the person to be 
searched opts to be searched in the presence of such 
senior officer, it is for the police officer who is 
to conduct the search to conduct it in the presence 
of whoever is the most conveniently available, 
Gazetted Officer or Magistrate".
</p>

<p id="p_23">	As has been highlighted in Baldev Singh's case (supra) it has to 
be seen and gauzed whether the requirements of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_31">Section 50</a> have been met. 
<a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_32">Section 50</a> in reality provides for additional safeguards which are not 
specifically provided by the statute. The stress is on the adoption of a 
reasonable, fair and just procedure. No specific words are necessary to 
be used to convey existence of the right. In the case at hand the 
information was conveyed in the following manner:
</p>
<p id="p_24">	"By way of this notice you are informed that we 
have received information that you are illegally 
carrying opium with you, therefore, we are required 
to search your scooter and you for this purpose. You 
would like to give me search or you would like to be 
searched by any gazetted officer or by a 
magistrate".
</p>
<p id="p_25">In response to the aforesaid intimation each of the accused gave in 
writing as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_26">	"Sir, I have no objection if you search me or 
my scooter".
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">Sd/-			Sd/-					Sd/-
Ram Vilas		Prabhashankar		at 14.20 P.M. 
		3.11.1998		3.11.98			Thana Shahjaibad
							at 14.25 P.M.
									Thana Shahjaibad".



</pre><p id="p_27">	The notice in the present case has great similarity with what was 
conveyed to the accused in <a href="/doc/1291537/" id="a_33">Joseph Fernandez v. State of Goa</a> (2000 (1) 
SCC 707). It was inter alia held in the said case as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_28">	"2. Learned counsel tried to highlight a point 
that <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_34">Section 50</a> of the Act has not strictly been 
complied with by PW-8, the officer who conducted the 
search. According to the learned counsel for the 
appellant the searching officer should have told the 
person who was subjected to search that he had a 
right to be searched in the presence of a gazetted 
officer or a Magistrate. In this case PW-8 has 
deposed that she told the appellant that if he wished 
he could be searched in the presence of the gazetted 
officer or a Magistrate to which the appellant had 
not favourably reciprocated. According to us the said 
offer is a communication about the information that 
the appellant has a right to be searched so. It must 
be remembered that the searching officer had only 
<a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_35">Section 50</a> of the Act then in mind unaided by the 
interpretation placed on it by the Constitution 
Bench. Even then the searching officer informed him 
that "if you wish you may be searched in the 
presence of a gazetted officer or a Magistrate". 
This according to us is in substantial compliance 
with the requirement of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_36">Section 50</a>. We do not agree 
with the contention that there was non-compliance 
with the mandatory provision contained in <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_37">Section 50</a> 
of the Act". 
</p>

<p id="p_29">			(Underlined for emphasis)



Though, learned counsel for the appellants submitted that this was a 
case where the Court erroneously held that substantial compliance would 
be sufficient, we find that the underlined portion is what was held by 
the Court to be information of the right. The offer in the present case 
is almost a replica of what was said in that case.
</p>
<p id="p_30">Though there cannot be any quarrel with the general principle 
highlighted by learned counsel for the appellants that if a thing is 
required to be done in a particular way it should be done in that way, 
the position here is different in view of our conclusions that the 
requirements of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_38">Section 50</a> of the Act were sufficiently complied with. 
The general principle as noted has been stated illuminatingly in <a href="/doc/1107594/" id="a_39">Nazir 
Ahmad v. King-Emperor</a> (AIR 1936 P.C. 253), and later by this Court in 
<a href="/doc/407511/" id="a_40">State of Uttar Pradesh v. Singhara Singh and Ors</a>. (1964 (4) SCR 485).  
What the concerned officer is required to do is to convey about the 
choice the accused had. The accused (suspect) has to be told in a way 
that he becomes aware that the choice is his and not of the concerned 
officer, even though there is no specific form. The use of the word 
'right' at relevant places in the decision of Baldev Singh's case 
(supra) seems to be to lay effective emphasis that it is not by the 
grace of the officer the choice has to be given but more by way of a 
right in the 'suspect' at that stage to be given such a choice and the 
inevitable consequences that have to follow by transgressing it.
</p>
<p id="p_31">	The use of the expression 'substantial compliance' was made in the 
background that the searching officer had <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_41">Section 50</a> in mind and it was 
unaided by the interpretation placed on it by the Constitution Bench in 
Baldev Singh's case (supra). A line or a word in a judgment cannot be 
read in isolation or as if interpreting a statutory provision, to impute 
a different meaning to the observations. 
</p>
<p id="p_32">Above being the position, we find no substance in the plea that 
there was non-compliance with the requirements of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_42">Section 50</a> of the Act. 
</p>
<p id="p_33">It was pleaded that the requirements of <a href="/doc/669884/" id="a_43">Section 57</a> have not been 
complied with. There was no material placed either before the trial 
Court or the High Court to substantiate such a plea. The grievance in 
this regard does not merit any consideration, leave alone the impact of 
it on the guilt and conviction of the accused.   
</p>
<p id="p_34">	Additionally, it may also be noticed that while giving statement 
under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_44">Section 313</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short the 
'Code'), the accused did not say that he was unaware of his rights or 
that he was misled on that account in any manner. On the contrary, in 
general and vague manner it was only said that he did not know or he had 
no idea of the allegations. Though that by itself is not sufficient to 
convict accused, in view of the procedural safeguards required to be 
observed by compliance with the requirements of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_45">Section 50</a>, yet that is 
of some relevance in appreciating the grievance, now sought to be 
ventilated. There is no infirmity in the impugned judgment to warrant 
interference. The appeals are accordingly dismissed. 
</p>
