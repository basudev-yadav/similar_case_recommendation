                       In re : Subrata Ghosh &amp; Anr.                    ... Petitioners.

                        Mr. Rajdeep Majumder,

                          This is an application for grant of anticipatory bail in a case

                  under <a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_8">Sections 406</a>, <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_9">420</a>, <a href="/doc/1599401/" id="a_10">341</a>, <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_11">323</a>, <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_12">506</a> and <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_13">120B</a> of the Indian

                  Penal Code.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                          We have heard the learned Counsel for the Petitioners as

                  well as the learned Counsel for the State and perused the Case

                  Diary. Learned Counsel for the Informant has also appeared.

     ALLOWED              During the course of submissions, learned Counsel for the

                  State pointed out that the Petitioners have been twice served with

                  notice under <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_14">Section 41A</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the

                  first of which was on 13.10.2014 and the second being on

                  21.11.2014.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                          Learned Counsel for the Petitioners points out that it is

                  true that notice under <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_15">Section 41A</a> was received on 13.10.2014 and

                  the Petitioners did meet the Investigating Officer, but in spite
 thereof, the said Investigating Officer once again issued the second

notice in a routine manner. His further contention is that the

Investigating Officer is attempting to compel the Petitioners to

compromise the matter with the Informant.

</p><p id="p_5">        Learned Counsel has also drawn our attention to a

judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court passed in the case of

Hridaya Ranjan Prasad Verma Vs State of Bihar &amp; Another reported

in 2000 C Cr. LR (SC) 293 in support of his contention that in the

face of the allegations, an offence under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_16">Section 420</a> and/or the

other sections is not made out as there is a civil dispute.

</p><p id="p_6">        Considering the aforementioned submissions and also the

judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court passed in the case of

Arnesh Kumar Vs State of Bihar reported in 2014 (5) Supreme 324

= AIR 2014 SC 2756 and specially paragraph 14 thereof, we are of

the view that the Petitioners, in the event of their arrest, should be

enlarged on bail.
</p>
<p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">        Accordingly, we direct that in the event of arrest, the

Petitioners shall be released on bail upon furnishing a bail bond of

Rs.10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand only) each with two sureties of

the like amount, one of whom must be local, to the satisfaction of

the arresting officer and also subject to the conditions laid down in

sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1783708/" id="a_17">Section 438</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure,

1973 and on further condition that the Petitioners will both meet

not the Investigating Officer, but the Officer-in-charge of the

concerned police station so that the investigation is not hampered
 in any way.
</p>
<p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">        The application for anticipatory bail stands allowed.
