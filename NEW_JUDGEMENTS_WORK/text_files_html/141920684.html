                           JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">MANMOHAN, J


</p><p id="p_2">1.    Present petition has been filed under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">Article 227</a> of

Constitution of India challenging the order dated 21st February,

2009 by virtue of which petitioners-plaintiffs two applications

filed under Order 7 Rule 14 of Code of Civil Procedure

(hereinafter referred to „CPC‟) have been dismissed. While by

virtue of first application, petitioners-plaintiffs wanted to bring

on record fourteen volumes of documents, by subsequent

application petitioners wanted to bring on record two volumes

of documents.
</p>
<p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">2.    Relevant observations of the trial Court while rejecting

applications filed by the petitioners are reproduced hereinbelow

for ready reference:
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">          "The suit had been instituted in the year 1991.
          Since then both the parties have been filing one
          application or the other. All the applications filed
          by each other are being contested very hotly.
          The parties have even gone to the Hon‟ble High
          Court and also to the Hon‟ble Supreme Court
          twice/thrice. There is a neck and neck fight
          between the parties. They are litigating with
          each other diligently, vigorously and without any
          deterence. The parties have been taking all
          precautions in filing applications and documents.
          Therefore, can it be said that these documents
          could not be filed earlier due to oversight and
          inadvertence or there was a human error in not
          doing so earlier or that the error, if any, was on
          the part of the functionary or the advisors of the
          plaintiffs? Certainly not. All the documents
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">          except the documents as detailed at Sr. Nos. 83</span>
          to 99 of the application dated 28-01-09 were in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CM(M) No. 231 of 2009                                     Page 2 of 15</span>
           the custody of the plaintiffs since long and the
          documents pertaining to the years 2002, 2006
          and 2007 were in their custody for the last
          seven/three/two years.            Therefore, when
          according to the plaintiffs themselves their
          photocopies have already been filed in 1996 or
          1999 or in 2003, it cannot be said that the
          original documents or the certified copies could
          not be filed earlier. What was the hitch for the
          plaintiffs in not filing the original/certified copies
          of the documents in 1996, 1999 and 2003 itself.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">          Secondly, in the application dated 20-01-09 the
          plaintiffs have also submitted that the framing of
          additional issues by this court on 14-11-08 has
          also cast a duty on the plaintiffs to file additional
          documents in order to prove and discharge the
          onus of the additional issues and, hence, they
          made urgent and immediate search for
          documents. Firstly, the said additional issues
          have been framed on the basis of the existing
          pleadings of the parties. Parties are required to
          file the documents before framing of the issues.
          Secondly, this stand contradicts the stand taken
          by the plaintiffs that the documents could not be
          filed due to inadvertence and oversight. Had the
          plaintiffs made an honest search for the
          documents now sought to be filed before framing
          of issues/additional issues they would have
          certainly laid their hands on the same and filed
          them without any delay. Therefore, I fail to
          understand under what provision of law the
          plaintiffs can now be permitted to file the
          documents after the framing of additional issues.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">          Quite strangely enough, the plaintiffs have even
          gone to the extent of saying that one of the
          grounds for not filing the documents at an earlier
          stage is on account of immediate directions of the
          Apex court. During the course of arguments at
          the bar the Ld Counsel for the plaintiffs has
          contended that the Hon‟ble Supreme Court has
          passed an order dated 1-10-08 in SLP (c) Nos.
          22728-22729/2007 - Haldiram Bhujiawala &amp; Anr.
          Vs. Haldiram (India) Pvt. Ltd. in a hurry. When
          he was asked to explain what did he mean by the
          words immediate or hurry, he could not give any
          answer.     In my considered opinion, the Ld
          Counsel for the plaintiffs was /is not justified in
          making accusations against the highest court of
          the country before this court. Vide the said


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CM(M) No. 231 of 2009                                       Page 3 of 15</span>
           order, the Hon‟ble Supreme Court has issued
          certain directions including a direction to this
          Court of dispose off the suit as early as possible
          and preferably within six months from 01-10-08.
          Therefore, the plaintiffs have even gone to the
          extent of making accusations against the Apex
          Court of this country. The said conduct on the
          part        of       the        plaintiffs      is
          reprehensible........................
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">          Even otherwise, the plaintiffs were required to
          file their original documents on or before the
          date of settlement of issues as stipulated in order
          13 rule 1 CPC. However, the plaintiffs also did
          not do so. Therefore, in my considered opinion,
          the plaintiffs have failed to show any good cause
          for not filing the documents at the earlier stage.
          Therefore, these documents cannot be allowed to
          be filed at this highly belated stage.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">          Vide order dated 1-10-08 passed in SLP (C)
          No.22728-22729 of 2007 - Haldiram Bhujiawala
          &amp; Anr. Vs. M/s. Haldiram (India) Pvt. Ltd., the
          Hon‟ble Supreme Court of India has directed this
          court to hear and dispose the suit as early as
          possible and preferably within six months form 1-
          10-08. The court has also been directed not to
          show any leniency in the matter of adjournment
          and to proceed with the trial on day to day basis.

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">          Now, this court has also received a copy of the

          155/99 - M/s. Haldiram Bhujiawala &amp; Anr. Vs.
          M/s. Anand Kumar Deepak Kumar &amp; Anr. wherein
          the following order has been passed:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">             "By the order of 1st October, 2008, the
             Hon‟ble Supreme Court directed the
             Learned District Judge to dispose of the Suit
             No.188/03 preferably within six months
             from 1st October, 2008. The said period
             expires on 1st April, 2009. We naturally
             expect the Hon‟ble Supreme Court‟s order
             to be honoured.

</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">          However, it is a matter of great sorrow and
          anguish that after the passing of said order by
          the Hon‟ble Supreme Court the plaintiffs have

           started moving one application or the other and
          are thus not allowing this court to proceed
          further. The intention seems to be quite clear.
          As submitted by the ld Counsel for the
          defendants, their intention is to delay the
          disposal of the suit as they have been enjoying
          the fruits of a stay order passed in 1999.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">          However, I am of the considered opinion that
          since the plaintiffs have received the certified
          copies of the documents filed in suit no.35/08 -
          Kamla Devi Aggarwal Vs. Shiv Kishan Aggarwal
          on 22-01-09, the plaintiffs can be allowed to file
          these documents on the record subject to their
          proof according to law of evidence. Therefore,
          the plaintiffs are permitted to file the said
          documents only subject to their proof according
          to law of evidence.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">          In view of the above discussion, I do not find any
          merit in the application so far as the same relate
          to filing of the document other than the certified
          copies of the documents filed in suit no.35/08 -
          Kamla Devi Aggarwal Vs. Shiv Kishan Aggarwal
          same."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_6">3.    Mr. Sandeep Sethi, learned senior counsel for petitioners

stated that as the present suit was filed in the year 1992,

petitioners-plaintiffs in accordance with CPC prevailing then

had only to file along with their plaint, documents on which

plaintiffs sued upon.    He submitted that petitioners-plaintiffs

prior to 2002 amendment had not to file along with their plaint,

documents relied upon.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">4.    Mr. Sandeep Sethi, submitted that the impugned order

was untenable in law as trial Court failed to appreciate that the

time for filing of documents was not yet over, as in the present

case issues had not been framed. In this context, he relied upon

Order 13 Rule 1 CPC which reads as under:

<p id="p_9">

       settlement of issues, all the documentary evidence
       of every description in their possession or power, on
       which they intend to rely, and which has not already
       been filed in Court, and all documents which the
       Court has ordered to be produced."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_10">5.     He also stated that admission /denial of documents is yet

to take place and therefore, petitioners-plaintiffs had a right to

file documents.         He further stated that trial Court failed to

appreciate that suit was at the initial stage and till 01st October,

2008    there was uncertainty         as to   whether respondents-

defendants amended written statement would be taken on

record or not and, therefore, petitioners-plaintiffs had not taken

steps to file their documents.
</p>
<p id="p_11">

</p><p id="p_12">6.     Mr. Sethi, further submitted that by virtue of 2002

amendment in CPC, petitioners-plaintiffs had a right to file

documents even at the stage of final hearing of the suit. In this

context, he referred to Order 7 Rule 14 sub-rule 3 of CPC, which

provision has been introduced in the year 2002. Order 7 Rule

14 sub-rule 3 of CPC is reproduced hereinbelow for ready

reference:
</p>

       the plaint but is not produced or entered
       accordingly, shall not, without the leave of the
       Court, be received in evidence on his behalf at the
       hearing of the suit."

<p id="p_14"> 7.    Mr. Sethi, stated that documents now being sought to be

filed by petitioners along with their two applications under

Order 7 Rule 14 CPC were not in power and possession of

petitioners and, therefore, trial Court should have granted leave

for taking the said documents on record. He also submitted that

trial Court erred in law by not enquiring as to whether the

documents now being sought to be produced by petitioners-

plaintiffs were relevant or not and whether production of the

same would cause any prejudice to respondents-defendants.




</p><p id="p_15">8.    Lastly, Mr. Sethi submitted that trial Court ought to have

granted leave to produce the documents because their veracity

and authenticity was beyond doubt as the same had been issued

either by public or statutory authorities or by Courts.



</p><p id="p_16">9.    Mr. C. Mukund, learned counsel for respondents, at the

outset, submitted that petitioners-plaintiffs had essentially filed

two applications under Order 7 Rule 14 CPC to overcome and

circumvent the orders dated 08th September, 2008 and 22nd

December, 2008 passed by trial Court while rejecting the two

applications filed by petitioners-plaintiffs under Order 11 Rule

14 CPC for summoning of records from various authorities from

all over the country. He stated that the documents now being

sought to be produced by petitioners-plaintiffs in sixteen

volumes running into thousands of pages were essentially those

 documents whose summoning stood rejected by trial Court vide

orders dated 08th September, 2008 and 22nd December, 2008 --

which orders had not been challenged and had attained finality.



</p><p id="p_17">10.   Mr. Mukund, further stated that applications under Order

7 Rule 14 CPC had also been filed by the petitioners to

overcome their loss of original dissolution deed dated 16th

November, 1974. Mr. Mukund, pointed out that as petitioners-

plaintiffs application under <a href="/doc/487818/" id="a_2">Section 65</a> of Indian Evidence Act

had also been rejected vide another order dated 26th February,

2009, the intent of present proceedings was to place those

documents on record for which permission to lead secondary

evidence had been sought but rejected. He submitted that one

of the motives behind filing the present applications was to

circumvent     and      render   redundant   the   order   passed      in

application under <a href="/doc/487818/" id="a_3">Section 65</a> of Indian Evidence Act.



</p><p id="p_18">11.   Mr. Mukund, stated that issues in the present case had

already been framed by the trial Court on 08th September, 2008

and the same had been re-cast and additional issues had been

framed on 04th November, 2008 and 14th November, 2008 on

applications filed by petitioners-plaintiffs under Order 14 Rules

3 and 5 CPC. He contended that petitioners-plaintiffs had filed

two applications under Order 7 Rule 14 on 20th and 28th January,

2009 respectively- that is much after not only the issues but

additional issues had been framed.

</p><p id="p_20"> 12.     Mr.   Mukund          further   stated   that   the   question     of

admission/denial of documents already stands foreclosed vide

order dated 14th November, 2008 wherein additional issues had

been lastly re-cast and learned counsel for petitioners-plaintiffs

had admitted, "that all original documents in the power and

possession of the plaintiffs have been filed on record of this case

or in the connected case titled Kamla Devi Aggarwal Vs. Shiv

Kishan Aggarwal bearing Suit No.35/08".                 Mr. Mukund also

stated that order dated 22nd December, 2008 showed that

admission/denial of documents was confined only to Suit

No.35/08      titled    "Kamla     Devi   Aggarwal      Vs.   Shiv    Kishan

Aggarwal" and that the same had nothing to do with the present

suit. He also further pointed out that petitioners-plaintiffs had

already filed their evidence by way of affidavit on 20th January,

2009.
</p>
<p id="p_21">

</p><p id="p_22">13.     Mr. Mukund, further contended that the two applications

filed by petitioners-plaintiffs under Order 7 Rule 14 CPC did not

contain any averment that documents now sought to be filed by

petitioners-plaintiffs were not in power and possession of the

plaintiffs.   He extensively referred to application dated 28th

January, 2009 to show that petitioners-plaintiffs had sought

permission      to     file   documents     on   the    ground   of    their

inadvertence and oversight.

</p><p id="p_24"> 14.   Mr. Mukund also referred to the new documents sought to

be produced by petitioners-plaintiffs to dispute the contention

that most of these documents had been issued by statutory or

public authorities.     For instance, he referred to an affidavit

dated 05th January, 2002 of Shri Radhey Shyam Aggarwal and

documents pertaining to businesses of M/s. Shivrattan Kamal

Kumar, M/s. Gangabishan Moolchand and M/s. Anand Kumar

Deepak Kumar.

      produced by a party or a witness should be left to be

<p id="p_30">16.   After having heard the parties at length, I am of the view

that Mr. Sethi‟s contention that the time for filing of documents

was not yet over is contrary to facts and untenable in law. It is

settled position that all the parties have to produce all

documents       in      their     power      and        possession       before

settlement/framing of issues. Order 13 Rule 1 CPC is very clear

and categorical in this regard.
</p>
<p id="p_31">
</p><p id="p_32">17.   Since in the present case issues had been framed by the

trial Court on 08th         September, 2008 and they had been

subsequently      re-cast       and    reframed    at     the   instance       of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">CM(M) No. 231 of 2009                                                Page 11 of 15</span>
 petitioners-plaintiffs   on    04th   November,   2008   and     14th

November, 2008, the petitioners-plaintiffs cannot now seek to

file additional documents as a matter of right.              Further,

petitioners‟ reliance on the fact that admission/denial of

documents is yet to take place is misconceived and irrelevant as

the petitioners-plaintiffs have admittedly already filed their

affidavit by way of evidence on 20th January, 2009.          In fact,

petitioners/plaintiffs on 14th November, 2008 had admitted that

all the original documents in their power and possession were

on    record.      Moreover,     after   seventeen    long     years

petitioners/plaintiffs cannot complain that they did not have

enough/sufficient time to file documents they wish to rely upon.


</p><p id="p_33">18.   Mr. Sandeep Sethi‟s further argument that by virtue of

2002 amendment, the petitioners-plaintiffs had been conferred a

new right to file documents is not correct. Mr. Sethi‟s argument

that in the year 1992, the petitioner-plaintiffs had neither to

produce nor file list of relied upon documents, is also not

correct.
</p>
<p id="p_34">

</p><p id="p_35">19.   In fact, even when the petitioners-plaintiffs filed their suit

in 1992, Order 7 Rule 14 sub-rule(2) CPC mandated that

documents on which plaintiffs rely upon should be entered in a

list which should be added or annexed to the plaint. The said

list was to specifically state whether such documents are in

power and possession of the plaintiffs. Further Order 7 Rule 18




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">CM(M) No. 231 of 2009                                    Page 12 of 15</span>
 sub-rule (1) CPC prior to its omission on 01st July, 2002,

mandated that documents which were not produced or added or

annexed in the list attached with the plaint, shall not without

leave of the Court be received in plaintiffs‟ evidence at the

hearing of the suit. Order 7 Rule 18 sub-rule (1) of CPC prior to

2002 amendment is reproduced hereinbelow:
</p>
<p id="p_36">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">      "18. Inadmissibility of document not produced when
      plaint filed. - (1) A document which ought to be
      produced in Court by the plaintiff when the plaint is
      presented, nor to be entered in the list to be added
      or annexed to the plaint, and which is not produced
      or entered accordingly, shall not, without the leave
      of the Court, be received in evidence on his behalf at
      the hearing of the suit."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_37">20.   In my view,       Order 7 Rule 18 sub-rule (1) after being

deleted on 01st July, 2002, has been incorporated in identical

terms in Order 7 Rule 14 sub-rule (3) CPC. Consequently, no

new right has been bestowed upon the petitioners by Order 7

Rule 14 sub-rule (3) CPC.
</p>
<p id="p_38">
</p><p id="p_39">21.   In any event, both under the old Order 7 Rule 18 sub-rule

(1) and new Order 7 Rule 14 sub-rule (3) CPC a new document

can certainly be produced on behalf of plaintiff at the final

hearing of suit, but the same has to be done with leave of the

Court. It is not that the plaintiff has a legal vested right to file a

document at a belated stage i.e. at the final hearing of the suit.

The said provision gives a discretionary power to the          Court,

which needless to say has to be exercised in a reasonable and

legal manner. In fact, this power has to be exercised sparingly



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">CM(M) No. 231 of 2009                                      Page 13 of 15</span>
 and for some overpowering reason and not as a matter of

routine. If petitioners‟ interpretation of Sub Rule 3 is accepted,

it would make it impossible for the trial court to conclude the

hearing of any suit.
</p>
<p id="p_40">
</p><p id="p_41">22.   Moreover, in the present case on perusal of applications

filed by petitioners-plaintiffs under Order 7 Rule 14 CPC, I am of

the view that discretionary power with the trial Court to file

additional documentary evidence has been rightly refused.           I

may mention that in the said applications filed by petitioners-

plaintiffs, the only reason given for filing of these documents at

a belated stage was, "on account of human error and

inadvertence and oversight that the said documents escaped the

notice of the Advocate."      Consequently, it is not open to the

petitioners-plaintiffs to now contend in the present proceedings

that the documents could not be filed initially as they were not

in their power and possession.        In fact, from perusal of

documents sought to be filed by the petitioners-plaintiffs, it is

apparent that majority of these documents were all throughout

in power and possession of petitioners-plaintiffs.


</p><p id="p_42">23.   On a careful perusal of the file, I am also in agreement

with Mr. Mukund‟s argument that the present two applications

had been filed by petitioners-plaintiffs under Order 7 Rule 14

CPC to overcome and circumvent the orders of trial Court

rejecting the petitioners-plaintiffs‟ applications under Order 11

Rule 14 CPC and under <a href="/doc/487818/" id="a_7">Section 65</a> of Indian Evidence Act.            I



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">CM(M) No. 231 of 2009                                   Page 14 of 15</span>
 further agree with the trial Court that the intent in filing the

present petition was to somehow delay the disposal of suit

despite a categorical direction by Hon‟ble Supreme Court on 1st

October, 2008 to dispose of the same expeditiously preferably

within   six    months.     Accordingly,     in   my    view,     present

applications are not even bonafide. Consequently, the case law

cited by the petitioners is clearly inapplicable to the facts of the

present case.
</p>
<p id="p_43">
</p><p id="p_44">24.   Further, in my view, the impugned order neither suffers

from any material irregularity nor the same is in excess of

jurisdiction and, consequently, it calls for no interference in

<a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_8">Article 227</a> jurisdiction.
</p>
<p id="p_45">
</p><p id="p_46">25.   Accordingly,      present   petition    and      application      are

dismissed with costs of Rs. 15,000/- to be paid to respondents.

The receipt of costs shall be filed before trial Court within a

period of two weeks from today.
