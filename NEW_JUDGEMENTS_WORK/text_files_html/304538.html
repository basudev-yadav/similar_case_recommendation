C.K. THAKKER, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">1.		Leave granted.
</p><p id="p_3">2.		In the present appeal, we are called 
upon to decide the correctness or otherwise of 
the proposition of law by the High Court of 
Judicature at Bombay whether issuance of 
process in a criminal case is one and the same 
thing or can be equated with taking cognizance 
by a Criminal Court? And if the period of 
initiation of criminal proceedings has elapsed 
at the time of issue of process by a Court, the 
proceedings should be quashed as barred by 
limitation?
</p><p id="p_4">3.		To appreciate the controversy raised 
in the appeal instituted by the Chief 
Enforcement Officer, Enforcement Directorate, 
Government of India (appellant herein), few 
relevant facts may be noted.
</p><p id="p_5">4.		Respondent No.1M/s. Videocon 
International Ltd. (Company for short) is a 
Public Limited Company incorporated under the 
<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_1">Companies Act</a>, 1956 having its business at 
Mumbai and Aurangabad in the State of 
Maharashtra. On October 13, 1989, the Company 
entered into an agreement with Radio Export 
(Moscow) for the supply of colour tubes, 
electrolytic capacitors, transformers, etc., 
for Rs.44,04,00,000/-. The payment was made by 
respondent No.1 Company to Japanese and Korean 
suppliers. But before any payment could be 
received by respondent No.1 from the USSR 
Company, there was political turmoil in the 
USSR and payment to foreign suppliers was 
disrupted. On January 5, 1993, Additional 
Director General, Directorate of Revenue 
Intelligence, Mumbai addressed a letter to the 
appellant alerting him about the activities of 
the Company in connection with the agreement to 
supply television sets to Radio Export, Moscow. 
Based on the information forwarded by the 
Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Bombay, 
the appellant addressed two letters to the 
Chief Manager of Indian Bank, Nariman Point, 
Bombay requesting the Bank to supply details of 
the export outstanding of the Company. Indian 
Bank supplied necessary information and 
indicated that the export outstanding of the 
Company was Rs.16,60,00,000/-. The Reserve Bank 
of India turned down the request of the Company 
for reimbursement of differential amount 
remaining unpaid on the ground that the exports 
were effected from Korea and Japan and not from 
India and the Company was not entitled to 
reimbursement. In pursuance of the summons 
issued under <a href="/doc/1396893/" id="a_2">Section 40</a> of the Foreign Exchange 
Regulation Act, 1973 (hereinafter referred to 
as FERA), Raj Kumar Dhoot, Director of the 
Company appeared before the Department on April 
25, 1999 and made a statement that there was an 
agreement between the Company and M/s Radio 
Export, Moscow for supply of two lakh 
television sets and other equipments for 
Rs.44,04,00,000/-. The amount was received by 
the Company through State Bank of India, 
Overseas Branch, Bombay. He further stated that 
the television sets had been procured from 
Korea and Japan who had been paid equivalent to 
Rs.19,00,00,000/- in foreign exchange. Export 
bills raised from the sale to M/s Radio Export, 
Moscow were equivalent to Rs.16,00,00,000/-. 
Whereas the contract with the suppliers in 
Korea and Japan stipulated payment in US 
Dollars, the contract with the USSR Company 
required payment in Indian Rupees. Since the 
value of Rupee against the US Dollar fell down, 
the Company had to pay more Rupees to their 
foreign suppliers. On June 1, 2000, FERA was 
replaced by the <a href="/doc/600757/" id="a_3">Foreign Exchange Management 
Act</a>, 1999 (hereinafter referred to as FEMA).
</p><p id="p_6">5.		On May 24, 2002, the appellant-
complainant in the capacity as Chief 
Enforcement Officer, Government of India, filed 
Criminal Complaint No. 1149/S/2002 against the 
Company alleging that the Company had received 
an amount of Rs.44,04,00,000/- through State 
Bank of India, Bombay but it failed to take 
steps to realize export proceeds amounting to 
Rs.16,60,00,000/- within the stipulated period 
of six months. It thereby contravened <a href="/doc/1322048/" id="a_4">Section 
18(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/634172/" id="a_5">18(3)</a> read with <a href="/doc/1106814/" id="a_6">Section 68(1)</a>, 
punishable under Section 56(1)(ii) of FERA. On 
the same day, i.e. on May 24, 2002, after 
hearing the learned counsel for the Department, 
the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Esplanade, 
Mumbai took cognizance of the offence and 
issued summons to the accused. On February 3, 
2003, the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate issued 
process requiring the respondents to appear 
before the Court and answer the charge under 
FERA.
</p><p id="p_7">6.		In October, 2004, the respondents 
filed a petition being Criminal Writ Petition 
No. 476 of 2005 in the High Court of Judicature 
at Bombay by invoking <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_7">Article 227</a> of the 
Constitution as also <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_8">Section 482</a> of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred 
to as the Code) seeking quashing of criminal 
proceedings initiated vide complaint dated May 
24, 2002 on the ground that cognizance was 
taken by the Court after the period of 
limitation and the proceedings were, therefore, 
liable to be quashed. The High Court, by the 
impugned order dated April 26, 2006, quashed 
the proceedings initiated against the 
respondents on the ground that cognizance could 
be said to have been taken when process was 
issued and since process was issued in 
February, 2003, the proceedings were time-
barred. The complaint was, therefore, quashed 
by the High Court. The said order is challenged 
by the appellant in the present appeal.
</p><p id="p_8">7.		Notice was issued by this Court on 
September 29, 2006. The respondents appeared. 
Counter affidavit and rejoinder affidavit were 
then filed. The Registry was directed to place 
the matter for final hearing on a non-
miscellaneous day and that is how the matter is 
placed before us.
</p><p id="p_9">8.		We have heard the learned counsel for 
the parties.
</p><p id="p_10">9.		The learned counsel for the appellant 
contended that the High Court was in clear 
error in equating taking cognizance of an 
offence with issuance of process and in holding 
that the cognizance was taken after the period 
of limitation and hence the proceedings were 
time-barred and liable to be quashed. It was 
submitted that FEMA came into force from June 
1, 2000 and under sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/13250/" id="a_9">Section 49</a> 
of FEMA, cognizance of an offence under FERA 
could have been taken within a period of two 
years from the date of commencement of the new 
Act. It was submitted that cognizance was taken 
by the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Mumbai on 
May 24, 2002, i.e. the day when complaint was 
filed which was well within the period of 
limitation provided by <a href="/doc/1873271/" id="a_10">Section 49(3)</a> of FEMA 
and as such the Criminal Court was within its 
power in issuing process and in proceeding with 
the matter and the High Court was not justified 
in quashing the proceedings on the ground that 
cognizance was taken by the Court on February 
3, 2003 when process was issued by the Chief 
Metropolitan Magistrate, Mumbai. It was 
alternatively submitted by the learned counsel 
that the relevant date for counting the period 
of limitation is not the date of taking 
cognizance or issuance of process by the Court 
but the date of filing complaint. It was stated 
that the point has been concluded by various 
decisions of this Court. Since the complaint 
was filed on May 24, 2002, which was within the 
period of limitation, the High Court was wrong 
in treating the criminal complaint as barred by 
limitation and in quashing it. The order passed 
by the High Court, thus, deserves to be set 
aside by directing the Chief Metropolitan 
Magistrate, Mumbai to proceed with the case and 
decide it in accordance with law.
</p><p id="p_11">10.		The learned counsel for the 
respondents, on the other hand, supported the 
order passed by the High Court. It was 
submitted that the High Court was wholly right 
in quashing the proceedings. Admittedly, 
process was issued in February, 2003 while 
under <a href="/doc/1873271/" id="a_11">Section 49(3)</a> of FEMA, proceedings under 
the old Act (FERA) could not have been 
initiated after the expiry of two years from 
the commencement of the new Act (FEMA). FEMA 
came into force on June 1, 2000 and hence 
cognizance of an offence under FERA could have 
been taken under FEMA latest by June 1, 2002. 
Issuance of process in February, 2003, 
therefore, was clearly time-barred and the High 
Court was right in quashing the proceedings. It 
was also submitted that the appellant was not 
right in submitting that the relevant date for 
computing the period of limitation is date of 
filing of complaint. The material date is the 
date of taking cognizance by a competent 
Criminal Court. Sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/13250/" id="a_12">Section 49</a> 
of FEMA is a special provision, which must be 
given effect to and even on that ground, the 
complaint was barred by time. Finally, it was 
submitted that though the High Court had not 
considered the merits of the matter, the 
provisions of FERA had no application to the 
facts of the case as it cannot be said that the 
accused had committed any offence under FERA. 
Considering the said fact also, this Court may 
not interfere with the order passed by the High 
Court in exercise of discretionary jurisdiction 
under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_13">Article 136</a> of the Constitution. It was, 
therefore, submitted that the appeal may be 
dismissed.
</p><p id="p_12">11.		Having heard learned counsel for the 
parties and having perused the relevant 
provisions of law as also various judicial 
pronouncements, we are of the view that the 
High Court was in error in equating issuance of 
process with taking cognizance by a Criminal 
Court and in quashing the proceedings treating 
them as time-barred.
</p><p id="p_13">12.		The expression cognizance has not 
been defined in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_14"> the Code</a>. But the word 
(cognizance) is of indefinite import. It has no 
esoteric or mystic significance in criminal 
law. It merely meansbecome aware of and when 
used with reference to a Court or a Judge, it 
connotes to take notice ofjudicially. It 
indicates the point when a Court or a 
Magistrate takes judicial notice of an offence 
with a view to initiating proceedings in 
respect of such offence said to have been 
committed by someone. Taking cognizance does 
not involve any formal action of any kind. It 
occurs as soon as a Magistrate applies his mind 
to the suspected commission of an offence. 
Cognizance is taken prior to commencement of 
criminal proceedings. Taking of cognizance is 
thus a sine qua non or condition precedent for 
holding a valid trial. Cognizance is taken of 
an offence and not of an offender. Whether or 
not a Magistrate has taken cognizance of an 
offence depends on the facts and circumstances 
of each case and no rule of universal 
application can be laid down as to when a 
Magistrate can be said to have taken 
cognizance. Chapter XIV (<a href="/doc/600757/" id="a_15">Sections 190-199</a>)<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_16"> of 
the Code</a> deals with Conditions requisite for 
initiation of proceedings. <a href="/doc/600757/" id="a_17">Section 190</a> 
empowers a Magistrate to take cognizance of an 
offence in certain circumstances. Sub-section 
(1) thereof is material and may be quoted in 
extenso.
</p><p id="p_14">1) Subject to the provisions of this 
Chapter, any Magistrate of the first 
class, and any Magistrate of the 
second class specially empowered in 
this behalf under sub-section (2), may 
take cognizance of any offence
 
</p><p id="p_15">(a) upon receiving a complaint of 
facts which constitute such offence; 
</p> 
<p id="p_16">(b) upon a police report of such 
facts; 
</p> 
<p id="p_17">(c) upon information received from any 
person other than a police officer, or 
upon his own knowledge, that such 
offence has been committed.
</p>
<p id="p_18">13.		Chapter XV (<a href="/doc/600757/" id="a_18">Sections 200-203</a>) relates 
to Complaints to Magistrates and covers cases 
before actual commencement of proceedings in a 
Court or before a Magistrate. <a href="/doc/444619/" id="a_19">Section 200</a> of 
the Code requires a Magistrate taking 
cognizance of an offence to examine the 
complainant and his witnesses on oath. <a href="/doc/600757/" id="a_20">Section 
202</a>, however, enacts that a Magistrate is not 
bound to issue process against the accused as a 
matter of course. It enables him before the 
issue of process either to inquire into the 
case himself or direct an investigation to be 
made by a Police Officer or by such other 
person as he thinks fit for the purpose of 
deciding whether there is sufficient ground for 
proceeding further. The underlying object of 
the inquiry under <a href="/doc/600757/" id="a_21">Section 202</a> is to ascertain 
whether there is prima facie case against the 
accused. It thus allows a Magistrate to form an 
opinion whether the process should or should 
not be issued. The scope of inquiry under 
<a href="/doc/600757/" id="a_22">Section 202</a> is, no doubt, extremely limited. At 
that stage, what a Magistrate is called upon to 
see is whether there is sufficient ground for 
proceeding with the matter and not whether 
there is sufficient ground for conviction of 
the accused.
</p><p id="p_19">14.		Then comes Chapter XVI (Commencement 
of proceedings before Magistrates). This 
Chapter will apply only after cognizance of an 
offence has been taken by a Magistrate under 
Chapter XIV. <a href="/doc/600757/" id="a_23">Section 204</a>, whereunder process 
can be issued, is another material provision 
which reads as under:
</p><p id="p_20">204.Issue of process.- (1) If in the 
opinion of a Magistrate taking 
cognizance of an offence there is 
sufficient ground for proceeding, and 
the case appears to be 
 
</p><p id="p_21">(a) a summons-case, he shall issue his 
summons for the attendance of the 
accused, or
 
</p><p id="p_22">(b) a warrant-case, he may issue a 
warrant, or, if he thinks fit, a 
summons, for causing the accused to be 
brought or to appear at a certain time 
before such Magistrate or (if he has 
no jurisdiction himself) some other 
Magistrate having jurisdiction.
</p> 
<p id="p_23">(2) No summons or warrant shall be 
issued against the accused under sub-
section (1) until a list of the 
prosecution witnesses has been filed.
</p> 
<p id="p_24">(3) In a proceeding instituted upon a 
complaint made in writing, every 
summons or warrant issued under sub-
section (1) shall be accompanied by a 
copy of such complaint.
</p> 
<p id="p_25">(4) When by any law for the time being 
in force any process-fees or other 
fees are payable, no process shall be 
issued until the fees are paid and, if 
such fees are not paid within a 
reasonable time, the Magistrate may 
dismiss the complaint.
</p> 
<p id="p_26">(5) Nothing in this section shall be 
deemed to affect the provisions of 
<a href="/doc/600757/" id="a_24">section 87</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_27">15.		From the above scheme<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_25"> of the Code</a>, in 
our judgment, it is clear that Initiation of 
Proceedings, dealt with in Chapter XIV, is 
different from Commencement of Proceedings 
covered by Chapter XVI. For commencement of 
proceedings, there must be initiation of 
proceedings. In other words, initiation of 
proceedings must precede commencement of 
proceedings. Without initiation of proceedings 
under Chapter XIV, there cannot be commencement 
of proceedings before a Magistrate under 
Chapter XVI. The High Court, in our considered 
view, was not right in equating initiation of 
proceedings under Chapter XIV with commencement 
of proceedings under Chapter XVI.
</p><p id="p_28">16.		Let us now consider the question in 
the light of judicial pronouncements on the 
point.
</p><p id="p_29">17.		In Superintendent &amp; Remembrancer of 
Legal Affairs Vs. Abani Kumar Banerjee, AIR 
1950 Calcutta 437, the High Court of Calcutta 
had an occasion to consider the ambit and scope 
of the phrase taking cognizance under <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_26">Section 
190</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 
which was in pari materia to <a href="/doc/600757/" id="a_27">Section 190</a> of the 
present Code of 1973. Referring to various 
decisions, Das Gupta, J. (as His Lordship then 
was) stated:
</p><p id="p_30">What is taking cognizance has not 
been defined in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_28"> the Criminal Procedure 
Code</a>, and I have no desire now to 
attempt to define it. It seems to me 
clear, however, that before it can be 
said that any Magistrate has taken 
cognizance of any offence under 
<a href="/doc/600757/" id="a_29">Section 190(1)(a)</a>, Criminal P. C., he 
must not only have applied his mind to 
the contents of the petition, but he 
must have done so for the purpose of 
proceeding in a particular way as 
indicated in the subsequent provisions 
of this Chapter,-proceeding under 
<a href="/doc/600757/" id="a_30">Section 200</a>, and thereafter sending it 
for enquiry and report under Section 
</p><p id="p_31">202. When the Magistrate applies his 
mind not for the purpose of proceeding 
under the subsequent sections of this 
Chapter, but for taking action of some 
other kind, e.g., ordering 
investigation under <a href="/doc/600757/" id="a_31">Section 156(3)</a>, or 
issuing a search warrant for the 
purpose of the investigation, he 
cannot be said to have taken 
cognizance of the offence.
</p><p id="p_32">18.		<a href="/doc/1591771/" id="a_32">R.R. Chari v. State of Uttar Pradesh</a>, 
1951 SCR 312 was probably the first leading 
decision of this Court on the point. There, the 
police, having suspected the appellant-accused 
to be guilty of offences punishable under 
<a href="/doc/48127346/" id="a_33">Sections 161</a> and <a href="/doc/126359453/" id="a_34">165</a> of the Indian Penal Code 
(IPC) as also under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_35">Prevention of 
Corruption Act</a>, 1947, applied to the District 
Magistrate, Kanpur to issue warrant of arrest 
on October 22, 1947. Warrant was issued on the 
next day and the accused was arrested on 
October 27, 1947. On March 25, 1949, the 
accused was produced before the Magistrate to 
answer the charge-sheet submitted by the 
prosecution. According to the accused, on 
October 22, 1947, when warrant for his arrest 
was issued by the Magistrate, the Magistrate 
was said to have taken cognizance of offence 
and since no sanction of the Government had 
been obtained before that date, initiation of 
proceedings against him was unlawful. The 
question before the Court was as to when 
cognizance of the offence could be said to have 
been taken by the Magistrate under <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_36">Section 190</a> 
of the Code. Considering the circumstances 
under which cognizance of offence under sub-
section (1) of <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_37">Section 190</a> of the Code can be 
taken by a Magistrate and referring to Abani 
Kumar Banerjee, the Court, speaking through 
Kania, C.J. stated:
</p><p id="p_33">It is clear from the wording of the 
section that the initiation of the 
proceedings against a person commences 
on the cognizance of the offence by 
the Magistrate under one of the three 
contingencies mentioned in the 
section. The first contingency 
evidently is in respect of non-
</p><p id="p_34">cognizable offences as defined in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_38"> the 
Criminal Procedure Code</a> on the 
complaint of an aggrieved person. The 
second is on a police report, which 
evidently is the case of a cognizable 
offence when the police have completed 
their investigation and come to the 
Magistrate for the issue of a process. 
The third is when the Magistrate 
himself takes notice of an offence and 
issues the process. It is important to 
remember that in respect of any 
cognizable offence, the police, at the 
initial stage when they are 
investigating the matter, can arrest a 
person without obtaining an order from 
the Magistrate. Under <a href="/doc/1687975/" id="a_39">section 167(b)</a> 
of the Criminal Procedure Code the 
police have of course to put up the 
person so arrested before a Magistrate 
within 24 hours and obtain an order of 
remand to police custody for the 
purpose of further investigation, if 
they so desire. But they have the 
power to arrest a person for the 
purpose of investigation without 
approaching the Magistrate first. 
Therefore in cases of cognizable 
offence before proceedings are 
initiated and while the matter is 
under investigation by the police the 
suspected person is liable to be 
arrested by the police without an 
order by the Magistrate.
</p><p id="p_35">19.		Approving the observations of Das 
Gupta, J. in Abani Kumar Banerjee, this Court 
held that it was on March 25, 1949 when the 
Magistrate issued a notice under <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_40">Section 190</a> of 
the Code against the accused that he took 
cognizance of the offence. Since before that 
day, sanction had been granted by the 
Government, the proceedings could not be said 
to have been initiated without authority of 
law.
</p><p id="p_36">20.		Again in <a href="/doc/151029/" id="a_41">Narayandas Bhagwandas 
Madhavdas v. State of West Bengal</a>, (1960) 1 SCR 
93, this Court observed that when cognizance is 
taken of an offence depends upon the facts and 
circumstances of each case and it is impossible 
to attempt to define what is meant by taking 
cognizance. Issuance of a search warrant for 
the purpose of an investigation or a warrant of 
arrest of accused cannot by itself be regarded 
as an act of taking cognizance of an offence. 
It is only when a Magistrate applies his mind 
for proceeding under <a href="/doc/600757/" id="a_42">Section 200</a> and subsequent 
sections of Chapter XV or under Section 204 of 
Chapter XVI of the Code that it can be 
positively stated that he had applied his mind 
and thereby had taken cognizance of an offence 
[see also <a href="/doc/61274/" id="a_43">Ajit Kumar Palit v. State of W.B. &amp; 
Anr</a>., (1963) Supp (1) SCR 953; <a href="/doc/85087/" id="a_44">Hareram Satpathy 
v. Tikaram Agarwala &amp; Anr</a>., (1978) 4 SCC 58].
</p><p id="p_37">21.		<a href="/doc/446498/" id="a_45">In Gopal Das Sindhi &amp; Ors. v. State of 
Assam &amp; Anr</a>., AIR 1961 SC 986, referring to 
earlier judgments, this Court said:
We cannot read the provisions of 
<a href="/doc/600757/" id="a_46">Section 190</a> to mean that once a 
complaint is filed, a Magistrate is 
bound to take cognizance if the facts 
stated in the complaint disclose the 
commission of any offence. We are 
unable to construe the word may in 
<a href="/doc/600757/" id="a_47">Section 190</a> to mean must. The reason 
is obvious. A complaint disclosing 
cognizable offences may well justify a 
Magistrate in sending the complaint 
under <a href="/doc/600757/" id="a_48">Section 156(3)</a> to the police for 
investigation. There is no reason why 
the time of the Magistrate should be 
wasted when primarily the duty to 
investigate in cases involving 
cognizable offences is with the 
police. On the other hand, there may 
be occasions when the Magistrate may 
exercise his discretion and take 
cognizance of a cognizable offence. If 
he does so then he would have to 
proceed in the manner provided by 
Chapter XVI of the Code.
</p><p id="p_38">22.		<a href="/doc/1379027/" id="a_49">In Nirmaljit Singh Hoon v. State of 
West Bengal &amp; Anr</a>., (1973) 3 SCC 753, the Court 
stated that it is well settled that before a 
Magistrate can be said to have taken cognizance 
of an offence under <a href="/doc/600757/" id="a_50">Section 190(1)</a> (a)<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_51"> of the 
Code</a>, he must have not only applied his mind to 
the contents of the complaint presented before 
him, but must have done so for the purpose of 
proceeding under <a href="/doc/600757/" id="a_52">Section 200</a> and the provisions 
following that section. Where, however, he 
applies his mind only for ordering an 
investigation under <a href="/doc/600757/" id="a_53">Section 156(3)</a> or issues a 
warrant for arrest of accused, he cannot be 
said to have taken cognizance of the offence.
</p><p id="p_39">23.		<a href="/doc/78734/" id="a_54">In Darshan Singh Ram Kishan v. State 
of Maharashtra</a>, (1972) 1 SCR 571, speaking for 
the Court, Shelat, J. stated that under <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_55">Section 
190</a> of the Code, a Magistrate may take 
cognizance of an offence either (a) upon 
receiving a complaint, or (b) upon a police 
report, or (c) upon information received from a 
person other than a police officer or even upon 
his own information or suspicion that such an 
offence has been committed. As has often been 
said, taking cognizance does not involve any 
formal action or indeed action of any kind. It 
occurs as soon as a Magistrate applies his mind 
to the suspected commission of an offence. 
Cognizance, thus, takes place at a point when a 
Magistrate first takes judicial notice of an 
offence.
</p><p id="p_40">24.		<a href="/doc/412326/" id="a_56">In Devarapalli Lakshminarayana Reddy &amp; 
Ors. v. V. Narayana Reddy &amp; Ors</a>., (1976) 3 SCC 
252, this Court said:
</p><p id="p_41">It is well settled that when a 
Magistrate receives a complaint, he is 
not bound to take cognizance if the 
facts alleged in the complaint, 
disclose the commission of an offence. 
This is clear from the use of the 
words "may take cognizance" which in 
the context in which they occur cannot 
be equated with must take cognizance". 
The word "may" gives a discretion to 
the Magistrate in the matter. If on a 
reading of the complaint he finds that 
the allegations therein disclose a 
cognizable offence and the forwarding 
of the complaint to the police for 
investigation under <a href="/doc/600757/" id="a_57">Section 156(3)</a> 
will be conducive to justice and save 
the valuable time of the Magistrate 
from, being wasted in enquiring into a 
matter which was primarily the duty of 
the police to investigate, he will be 
justified in adopting that course as 
an alternative to taking cognizance of 
the offence, himself.
</p><p id="p_42">This raises the incidental question : 
What is meant by "taking cognizance of 
an offence" by a Magistrate within the 
contemplation of <a href="/doc/600757/" id="a_58">Section 190</a>?. This 
expression has not been defined in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_59"> the 
Code</a>. But from the scheme<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_60"> of the Code</a>, 
the content and marginal heading of 
<a href="/doc/600757/" id="a_61">Section 190</a> and the caption of Chapter 
XIV under which <a href="/doc/600757/" id="a_62">Sections 190</a> to <a href="/doc/600757/" id="a_63">199</a> 
occur, it is clear that a case can be 
said to be instituted in a Court only 
when the Court takes cognizance of the 
offence alleged therein. The ways in 
which such cognizance can be taken are 
set out in Clauses (a), (b) and (c) of 
<a href="/doc/600757/" id="a_64">Section 190(1)</a>. Whether the Magistrate 
has or has not taken cognizance of the 
offence will depend on the 
circumstances of the particular case 
including the mode in which the case 
is sought to be instituted and the 
nature of the preliminary action, if 
any, taken by the Magistrate. Broadly 
speaking, when on receiving a 
complaint, the Magistrate applies his 
mind for the purposes of proceeding 
under <a href="/doc/600757/" id="a_65">Section 200</a> and the succeeding 
sections in Chapter XV of the Code of 
1973, he is said to have taken 
cognizance of the offence within the 
meaning of <a href="/doc/600757/" id="a_66">Section 190(1)(a)</a>. If, 
instead of proceeding under Chapter 
XV, he has in the judicial exercise of 
his discretion, taken action of    
some other kind, such as issuing a 
search warrant for the purpose       
of investigation, or ordering 
investigation by the police under 
<a href="/doc/600757/" id="a_67">Section 156(3)</a>, he cannot be said to 
have taken cognizance of any offence. 
[see also <a href="/doc/340501/" id="a_68">M.L. Sethi v. R.P. Kapur &amp; 
Anr</a>., (1967) 1 SCR 520].
</p><p id="p_43">25.		In the case on hand, it is amply clear 
that cognizance of the offence was taken by the 
Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Mumbai on May 
24, 2002, i.e., the day on which the complaint 
was filed, the Magistrate, after hearing the 
counsel for the department, took cognizance of 
the offence and passed the following order:
Mr. S.A.A. Naqvi, counsel for the 
department is present. Complainant is 
public servant. Cognizance is taken. 
Issue summons to accused under Section 
18(2)(3) of FERA, 73 read with Central 
Notification and r/w <a href="/doc/600757/" id="a_69">Section 68(1)</a> of 
the said Act and r/w 56 (1)(i) and r/w 
<a href="/doc/1873271/" id="a_70">Section 49(3)</a> (4) of FEMA, 1999.
Summons returnable on 7.2.2003 at 3 
p.m.              (emphasis supplied)
</p><p id="p_44">26.		Undoubtedly, the process was issued on 
February 3, 2003. In our judgment, however, it 
was in pursuance of the cognizance taken by the 
Court on May 24, 2002 that a subsequent action 
was taken under <a href="/doc/600757/" id="a_71">Section 204</a> under Chapter XVI. 
Taking cognizance of offence was entirely 
different from initiating proceedings; rather 
it was the condition precedent to the 
initiation of the proceedings. Order of 
issuance of process on February 3, 2003 by the 
Court was in pursuance of and consequent to 
taking cognizance of an offence on May 24, 
2002. The High Court, in our view, therefore, 
was not right in equating taking cognizance 
with issuance of process and in holding that 
the complaint was barred by law and criminal 
proceedings were liable to be quashed. The 
order passed by the High Court, thus, deserves 
to be quashed and set aside.
</p><p id="p_45">27.		It was also contended by the learned 
counsel for the appellant that the relevant 
date for considering the question of limitation 
is the date of filing of complaint and not 
taking cognizance or issuance of process by a 
Court of law. In this connection, our attention 
was invited by the counsel to <a href="/doc/853622/" id="a_72">Bharat Damodar 
Kale &amp; Anr. v. State of A.P</a>., (2003) 8 SCC 559 
and a recent decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1432851/" id="a_73">Japani 
Sahoo v. Chandra Sekhar Mohanty</a>, (2007) 7 SCC 
</p><p id="p_46">394. In Japani Sahoo, one of us (C.K. Thakker, 
J.), after considering decisions of various 
High Courts as also Bharat Damodar Kale, 
stated:
</p><p id="p_47">52. The matter can be looked at from 
different angle also. Once it is 
accepted (and there is no dispute 
about it) that it is not within the 
domain of the complainant or 
prosecuting agency to take cognizance 
of an offence or to issue process and 
the only thing the former can do is to 
file a complaint or initiate 
proceedings in accordance with law.  
If that action of initiation of 
proceedings has been taken within the 
period of limitation, the complainant 
is not responsible for any delay on 
the part of the Court or Magistrate in 
issuing process or taking cognizance 
of an offence. Now, if he is sought to 
be penalized because of the omission, 
default or inaction on the part of the 
Court or Magistrate, the provision of 
law may have to be tested on the 
touchstone of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_74">Article 14</a> of the 
Constitution.  It can possibly be 
urged that such a provision is totally 
arbitrary, irrational and 
unreasonable. It is settled law that a 
Court of Law would interpret a 
provision which would help sustaining 
the validity of law by applying the 
doctrine of reasonable construction 
rather than making it vulnerable and 
unconstitutional by adopting rule of 
litera legis.  Connecting the 
provision of limitation in <a href="/doc/1599077/" id="a_75">Section 468</a> 
of the Code with issuing of process or 
taking of cognizance by the Court may 
make it unsustainable and ultra vires 
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_76">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.
</p> 
<p id="p_48">28.		The learned counsel for the 
respondent, on the other hand, tried to 
distinguish Bharat Damodar Kale and Japani 
Sahoo submitting that in both the decisions, 
this Court was called upon to consider, inter 
alia, <a href="/doc/1599077/" id="a_77">Section 468</a> of the Code providing for 
limitation for taking cognizance of certain 
offences. According to the counsel, <a href="/doc/1599077/" id="a_78">Section 468</a> 
of the Code starts with the expression Except 
as provided elsewhere in this Code. <a href="/doc/1873271/" id="a_79">Section 
49(3)</a> of FEMA, on the other hand, starts with a 
non-obstante clause (Notwithstanding anything 
contained in any other law for the time being 
in force). It was, therefore, submitted that 
the ratio laid down in the above two cases 
would not be applicable to the instant case.
</p><p id="p_49">29.		In our opinion, it would not be 
necessary for us to express any opinion one way 
or the other on the larger question. We have 
already held in the earlier part of the 
judgment that in the case on hand, cognizance 
of an offence had already been taken by the 
Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Mumbai on May 
24, 2002, well within the period prescribed by 
sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/13250/" id="a_80">Section 49</a> of FEMA within 
two years of coming into force of the Act from 
June 1, 2000. We, therefore, express no opinion 
on the question raised by the learned counsel 
for the respondent.
</p><p id="p_50">30.		As regards quashing of proceedings on 
merits, the learned counsel for the appellant 
is right in submitting that the High Court has 
not at all touched the merits of the case and 
proceedings were not quashed on the ground that 
the provisions of FERA do not apply to the case 
before the Court. The High Court dealt with 
only one point as to whether the proceedings 
were liable to be quashed on the ground that 
they were time-barred and upholding the 
contention of the accused, passed the impugned 
order. As we are of the view that the High 
Court was not right in quashing the proceedings 
on the ground of limitation, the order deserves 
to be set aside by remitting the matter to the 
Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Mumbai to be 
decided in accordance with law. We may, 
however, clarify that it is open to the 
respondents to take all contentions including 
the contention as to applicability or otherwise 
of FERA to the facts of the case. As and when 
such question will be raised, the Court will 
pass an appropriate order in accordance with 
law.
</p><p id="p_51">31.		For the foregoing reasons, the appeal 
is allowed. The order passed by the High Court 
is set aside and it is held that cognizance of 
the offence had already been taken by the 
competent Criminal Court i.e. Chief 
Metropolitan Magistrate, Mumbai on May 24, 2002 
and it could not be said that the proceedings 
were barred by <a href="/doc/1873271/" id="a_81">Section 49(3)</a> of FEMA. The Chief 
Metropolitan Magistrate will now proceed to 
consider the matter in accordance with law. All 
contentions of all parties are kept open except 
the one decided by us in this appeal. Since the 
matter is very old, the Court will give 
priority and will decide it as expeditiously as 
possible, preferably before June 30, 2008.
</p><p id="p_52">32.		Ordered accordingly.
