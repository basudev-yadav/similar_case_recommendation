Reportable   BY THE COURT:(Per Hon'ble Dinesh Maheshwari,J.)</pre>



<p id="p_1">                   The petitioner, having pursued the Bachelor of Arts (B.A.)

             course with a college affiliated to the respondent No.1, Maharaja

             Ganga    Singh   University,   Bikaner    ('the   respondent-University'

             hereafter), has filed this writ petition in challenge to a condition

             occurring in the "Regulation for Obtaining Certified Copy of Answer-

             book under <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_1">RTI Act</a>-2005", as framed by the respondent-University

             insofar it requires payment of a non-refundable fee of Rs.1,000/- per

             answer-book for obtaining certified copy thereof.

</p><p id="p_2">                   The factual aspects of the matter are not of dispute and could

             be taken note of, in brief, as follows:     The petitioner, said to be

             having in the background a good academic record, has been

             pursuing her B.A. course as a regular student at Sri Atam Vallabh

             Jain Girls College, Sriganganagar,         which is affiliated to the

             respondent-University, with the optional subjects: Political Science,
                                          D.B. Civil Writ Petition No.12471/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     2</span>

English Literature and Philosophy.            After having successfully

completed Part-I and Part-II of the said course, the petitioner

appeared in B.A. Part-III Examination held this year i.e., 2012; and in

the result declared by the respondent-University, she was awarded

47 marks in English Literature Paper-I. Being dissatisfied with the

marks so awarded, the petitioner sought re-evaluation of her answer-

book of English Literature Paper-I; and, in the re-evaluation, her

marks were shown as reduced from 47 to 28.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      After getting such unfavourable result in the re-evaluation, the

petitioner filed an application on 15.10.2012 with reference to

<a href="/doc/1581683/" id="a_2">Section 7(1)</a> of the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_3">Information Act</a>, 2005 ('the Act of 2005'

hereafter)   seeking certified copy of her answer-book of English

Literature Paper-I with the application fee of Rs.10/-. Then, for the

concerned Public Information Officer having failed to provide the

requisite certified copy within time, the petitioner preferred an appeal

under <a href="/doc/593162/" id="a_4">Section 19</a> of the Act of 2005.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      It appears from the material placed on record that after filing of

the   application   by   the    petitioner,   the    respondent-University

proceeded to notify the regulations framed by it for the purpose of

supplying of the certified copy of answer-books under the provisions

of the Act of 2005 under the notification dated 26.10.2012 (Annex.9);

and these regulations were also uploaded on the website of the

respondent-University.    The     Information       Officer   informed     the

petitioner about publication of such regulations by his communication

dated 05.11.2012 (Annex.7) and thereafter, the Vice-Chancellor of

the University proceeded to dispose of the appeal filed by the

petitioner by the   order dated 08.11.2012 (Annex.8) whereby the

petitioner was directed to apply in accordance with the new
                                           D.B. Civil Writ Petition No.12471/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                      3</span>

regulations and the concerned Information Officer was also directed

to decide the application for information within time.

</p><p id="p_5">      After having noted the contents of the regulations so framed by

the respondent-University, the petitioner filed this writ petition on

21.11.2012 while questioning condition No.2 thereof, whereby and

whereunder, a fees of Rs.1,000/- is to be paid for obtaining certified

copy of the answer-book,          as being contrary to        the overriding

provisions of the Act of 2005 and the rules framed thereunder. The

questioned condition No.2 in the regulations of the respondent-

University reads as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "2. Application for obtaining certified copy of the answer book(s)
      of one or more papers can be submitted alongwith a non-
      refundable fee of Rs. 1,000/- per answer book. The fee should be
      deposited only through Account-payee Demand Draft in favour of
      the Registrar, Maharaja Ganga Singh University Bikaner payable
      at Bikaner. Postal orders/Money orders/Cheques/Cash will not be
      accepted. Applicant must attach his/her attested photo copy of
      marksheet along with the application."</blockquote><p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">      In this petition, notices for final disposal were issued on

26.11.2012 while directing the respondents to keep intact the

answer-book in question.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      The respondents have filed a reply seeking to justify the

questioned condition as regards charging of Rs.1,000/- as the fees

for providing copy of the answer-book.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      While challenging the aforementioned condition No.2 in the

regulations, the learned counsel for the petitioner has contended that

such a condition requiring a candidate to make payment of an

amount of Rs.1,000/- for the purpose of obtaining certified copy of

his/her answer-book remains illegal for being contrary to the rules

framed by the State Government under the Act of 2005 i.e., the

Rajasthan Right to Information Rules, 2005 ['the Rajasthan Rules of

2005' hereafter] and so also by the Central Government i.e., the
                                       D.B. Civil Writ Petition No.12471/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  4</span>

Right to Information (Regulation of Fee and Cost) Rules, 2005 ['the

Central Rules of 2005' hereafter]. The learned counsel submitted

that as per Rule 4 of the Rajasthan Rules of 2005, the rate

chargeable for providing information under sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1831074/" id="a_5">Section

7</a> is Rs.2/- for each page (A-4 or A-3 size paper) or actual cost or

cost price of a copy in large size paper but not beyond; and the

same nature charges are provided in Rule 4 of the Central Rules of

2005 too. The learned counsel submitted that cost of a copy of the

answer-book     carrying about 32 pages, in no case could be

Rs.1,000/-.   The learned counsel further submitted that per <a href="/doc/1971086/" id="a_6">Section

22</a>, the Act of 2005 has an overriding effect and the respondent-

University is not entitled to frame any regulation that contradicts the

requirements of the Act of 2005. It is submitted that exorbitant fees

to tune of Rs.1,000/- has been provided only in order to discourage

the students from asking for copies of the answer-books; that the

annual examination fee in total is Rs.450/- that includes even the

practical papers and the entire process of examination; and that

there cannot be even a remote justification for charging Rs.1,000/-

per answer-book only for the purpose of providing copy thereof. It is

submitted that the petitioner belongs to a poor family and is

practically unable to deposit such an excessive fee for obtaining the

copy of her answer-book. The learned counsel has also referred to

the fees as regards similar nature information as charged by the

other Universities in country.
</p>
<p id="p_10">      Per contra, the learned counsel for the respondent-University

submitted that the University has prescribed Rs.1,000/- as fee for

providing certified copy of the answer-book as per resolution

No.10/2008 dated 08.06.2012, as adopted by the Academic Council
                                      D.B. Civil Writ Petition No.12471/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                 5</span>

and as approved by the Board of Management under its resolution

dated 21.07.2012; and the notification has also been forwarded to

the State Government for information.          The learned counsel

submitted that in an academic session, lacs of answer-books are

preserved by the respondent-University and such preservation and

maintenance of record entails huge expenditure; and the fee has

been provided keeping in view such costs incurred by the University.

According to learned counsel for the respondent-University, neither

the fee as provided is exorbitant nor could be said to be suffering

from any want of authority. The learned counsel has referred to the

fees charged by the other Universities in Rajasthan for furnishing

similar nature information.
</p>
<p id="p_11">      After having given thoughtful consideration to the rival

submissions, having examined the material placed on record and

having taken into comprehension the law applicable, we are clearly

of the view that the questioned condition in the regulation framed by

the respondent-University requiring payment of a fee of Rs.1,000/-

per answer-book for the purpose of obtaining its copy under the Act

of 2005 cannot be sustained.
</p>
<p id="p_12">      It needs hardly any elaboration that the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_7">Information

Act</a>, 2005, having been enacted with the avowed object of setting out

the practical regime of right to information in order to promote

transparency and accountability in the working of every public

authority, takes within its sweep an examinee's right to inspect

his/her evaluated answer-book and to obtain certified copy thereof.

The doubts in this regard, if any, were set at rest with the

authoritative pronouncement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the

case of Central Board of Secondary Education &amp; Anr. Vs. Aditya
                                           D.B. Civil Writ Petition No.12471/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                      6</span>

Bandopadhyay &amp; Ors.: (2011) 8 SCC 497. Of course, such right was

pronounced by the Hon'ble Supreme Court as being conditioned with

relevant limitations and safeguards.
</p>
<p id="p_13">       The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Aditya Bandopadhyay's case

(supra) declared that the provisions of the Act of 2005 will prevail

over the provisions of bye-laws/rules of examining bodies in regard

to the examination; and observed that unless the examining body

was able to demonstrate that answer-book fell under the exempted

category of information as described in clause (e) of <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_8">Section 8</a> (1) of

the Act of 2005, the examining body will be bound to provide access

to an examinee to inspect and take copies of his evaluated answer-

book. The Hon'ble Supreme Court said,-
</p>
<p id="p_14">   "36. <a href="/doc/1971086/" id="a_9">Section 22</a> of the RTI Act provides that the provisions of the said Act
   will have effect, notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained
   in any other law for the time being in force. Therefore the provisions of
   the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_10">RTI Act</a> will prevail over the provisions of the bye-laws / rules of the
   examining bodies in regard to examinations. As a result, unless the
   examining body able to demonstrate that the answer books fall under the
   exempted category of information described in clause (e) of <a href="/doc/758550/" id="a_11">Section 8</a> (1)
   of the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_12">RTI Act</a>, the examining body will be bound to provide access to an
   examinee to inspect and take copies of his evaluated answer books,
   even if such inspection or taking copies is barred under the rules/bye-
   laws of the examining body governing the examinations........"




      The Hon'ble Supreme Court further considered the question as

to whether any     exemption under clause (e) of <a href="/doc/1001313/" id="a_13">Section 8(1)</a> was

available to the examining body in such a matter; and answered in

the negative as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">     "51. We, therefore, hold that an examining body does not hold the
     evaluated answer books in a fiduciary relationship. Not being
     information available to an examining body in its fiduciary
     relationship, the exemption under <a href="/doc/1001313/" id="a_14">Section 8(1)</a> (e) is not available
     to the examining bodies with reference to the evaluated answer
     books. As no other exemption under <a href="/doc/758550/" id="a_15">Section 8</a> is available in
     respect of the evaluated answer books, the examining bodies will
     have to permit inspection sought by the examinees."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">      Thus, there remains nothing to doubt that the respondent-
</blockquote>
<p id="p_15">University is bound to provide certified copy of the answer-book as
                                            D.B. Civil Writ Petition No.12471/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                       7</span>

sought for by the petitioner. The only question is about the legality of

charging a fee of Rs.1,000/- per answer-book under the questioned

condition No.2 of the regulations framed by the respondent-

University. In our view, only a glimpse of the basic provisions of the

Act of 2005 is sufficient to declare the questioned condition as

invalid. <a href="/doc/1971086/" id="a_16">Section 22</a> of the Act of 2005 makes it clear, in no uncertain

terms, that this enactment is having overriding effect over any other

law for the time being in force or any instrument having effect by

virtue of any law. <a href="/doc/1971086/" id="a_17">Section 22</a> of the Act of 2005 reads as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">     "22. Act to have overriding effect.- The provisions of this Act
     shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith
     contained in the <a href="/doc/61492784/" id="a_18">Official Secrets Act</a>, 1923 (19 of 1923) and any
     other law for the time being in force or in any instrument having
     effect by virtue of any law other than this Act."</blockquote><p id="p_16">



</p><p id="p_17">      Then, for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the Act

of 2005, <a href="/doc/773502/" id="a_19">Section 27</a> thereof has invested the appropriate

Government with the power to make the necessary rules by

notification in the official gazette. Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/773502/" id="a_20">Section 27</a> in

particular makes it clear that such rules may provide for the matters

relating, inter alia, to the fee payable under sub-section (1)                of

<a href="/doc/1910806/" id="a_21">Section 6</a> and the fee payable under sub-section (1) and (5) of

the purpose of making application under <a href="/doc/1910806/" id="a_39">Section 6</a> and for the

purpose of providing information under <a href="/doc/1831074/" id="a_40">Section 7</a> is the one which is

governed by the rules under <a href="/doc/773502/" id="a_41">Section 27</a> of the Act of 2005. Any rule

or regulation framed by the respondent-University, to the extent

standing at contradiction to such rules cannot be regarded as valid.

</p><p id="p_24">      We may observe for the present purpose that the respondent-

University is a public authority within the meaning of the Act of 2005

for having been established by a law made by the State Legislature

i.e., Maharana Ganga Singh University Act, 2003.                    As per the

averments taken, the Governor of State of Rajasthan is Chancellor of

the University and the Vice-Chancellor is appointed by the

Chancellor upon the advice of the State Government. The Registrar

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                     10</span>

of the respondent-University is appointed by the State Government

on deputation from amongst the officers serving in the State

services.    For all its practical purposes, it being a University

established in the State of Rajasthan is essentially governed for the

present purpose by the Rajasthan Rules of 2005, or at any rate, by

the principles thereof. The regulations regarding charge of fees by

the respondent-University, therefore, cannot operate over and above

the fees prescribed in Rules 3 and 4 ibid.         As noticed, even in the

Central Rules of 2005, the scale of fees is similar to that of the

Rajasthan Rules of 2005.
</p>
<p id="p_25">      Having regard to the purpose of the enactment and the nature

and purport of the provisions therein, we are of the view that even if

the respondent-University were to make independent regulations for

the purpose of providing certified copies, so far the fields covered by

the Rajasthan Rules of 2005 are concerned, the respondent-

University cannot make any such regulation that could stand at

conflict with such rules.
</p>
<p id="p_26">      It may be observed that even under the proviso to sub-section

(5) of <a href="/doc/1831074/" id="a_42">Section 7</a>, the Legislature has contemplated in no uncertain

terms that the fees to be prescribed for the purpose of <a href="/doc/1910806/" id="a_43">Sections 6</a> &amp;

<a href="/doc/1831074/" id="a_44">7</a> of the Act should be reasonable and is not to be charged at all

from the persons who are of below poverty line. The proviso reads

as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_27">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_30">             "Provided that the fee prescribed under sub-section (1) of
      <a href="/doc/1910806/" id="a_45">section 6</a> and sub-sections (1) and (5) of <a href="/doc/1831074/" id="a_46">section 7</a> shall be
      reasonable and no such fee shall be charged from the persons
      who are of below poverty line as may be determined by the
      appropriate Government."</blockquote><p id="p_28">

</p><p id="p_29">      Viewed from any angle, charging of exorbitant fees of

Rs.1,000/- for the purpose of providing copy of answer-book to a
                                         D.B. Civil Writ Petition No.12471/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                  11</span>

student by the respondent-University does not stand in conformity

with the object and purpose of the Act of 2005, stands at stark

conflict with the rules governing the field, and appears to be highly

unreasonable.
</p>
<p id="p_30">      So far incurring of the extra expenditure by the University is

concerned, the submissions have only been noted to be rejected.

Any such vague reference to the alleged expenditure cannot, by any

stretch of imagination, be the justification for the respondent-

University to flout the requirements of the applicable statutory

provisions; and the University cannot claim any special treatment

than the other public authorities as regards the operation of the Act

of 2005.   So far the operation of the Act of 2005 is concerned,

particularly as regards costs of providing information, such

submissions on the part of the respondent-University who is

supposed to be an agency of the welfare State, appear to be rather

illogical and unreasonable apart from being totally baseless.

</p><p id="p_31">       Charging of fees of Rs.1,000/- for providing copy of answer-

book, in the ultimate analysis, appears to be an ill-intended attempt

on the part of the respondent-University to somehow discourage the

students from seeking certified copies of their answer-books.          Such

strange regulations only demonstrate scant respect shown by the

respondent-University to the cherished object of the Act of 2005 and

the principles expounded by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Aditya

Bandopadhyay's case (supra).           The offending condition in the

regulation is required to be quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_32">      Before concluding, we may notice that during the course of

submissions, while the learned counsel for the petitioner has referred

to some of the Regulations on the same subject by certain
                                         D.B. Civil Writ Petition No.12471/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                 12</span>

Universities like Banaras Hindu University and University of Delhi

and submitted that such exorbitant fees as charged by the

respondent-University is not charged by these Universities. On the

other hand, the learned counsel of the respondent attempted to

submit that some other Universities in Rajasthan are charging the

fees in the range of Rs. 500/- to Rs. 1000/- for providing similar

nature information and has referred to the circulars issued by Dr.

Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan Rajasthan Ayurved University, University

of Rajasthan, and University of Kota.
</p>
<p id="p_33">      In regard to these submissions, we may observe that while it is

noticeable from the regulations of Banaras Hindu University and

University of Delhi that such Universities have provided for the fees

squarely in conformity with the fees as prescribed and as provided in

the aforesaid Rules of 2005 whereas Dr.Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan

Rajasthan Ayurved University, Jodhpur has provided a fees of

Rs.1,000/- so as to show the answer-book to the candidate; the

University of Rajasthan has provided a fees of Rs.580/- for obtaining

certified copy of answer-book; and the University of Kota has

provided for such fees for certified copy at Rs.500/- per answer-

book. Though we have noticed these different scales of fees but in

our view, nothing much turns upon them either way and merely

because some University has chosen to provide a higher fees, that

by itself does not invest the respondent-University with any right to

charge such kind of fees which is otherwise not in conformity with the

requirements of overriding the provisions of the Act of 2005 and rules

framed thereunder, operating in the field of quantum of fees.

</p><p id="p_34">      In the ultimate analysis, we are         clearly of view that the

impugned condition i.e., condition No.2 as reproduced hereinabove
                                             D.B. Civil Writ Petition No.12471/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                       13</span>

     in the regulations framed by the respondent-University deserves to

     be quashed as illegal and the respondent-University deserves to be

     directed to provide the certified copy of the answer-book            to the

     petitioner after charging the fees as prescribed under the Rajasthan

     Rules of 2005 and not beyond.
</p>
<p id="p_35">           As a result of the aforesaid, the writ petition succeeds and is

     allowed.    The questioned condition in the regulations of the

     respondent-University i.e., condition No.2 as regards charging of

     Rs.1,000/- as fees for providing copies of the answer-books is

     declared illegal and is quashed. The respondent University shall be

     required to provide the necessary information after charging the fee

     as contemplated by the Rajasthan Rules of 2005 and not beyond.

</p><p id="p_36">           Having regard to the circumstances of the case and

     particularly when we find that a student has unnecessarily been

     driven to this avoidable litigation, we allow costs of the litigation to

     the writ petitioner, quantified at Rs.11,000/- (eleven thousand).
