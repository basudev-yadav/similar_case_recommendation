HEADNOTE:
     After  obtaining	the  requisite	 sanction  from	 the
Governor on  19th February, 1979, a chargesheet in Vigilance
P.S. case  no. 9  (2) 78  was filed  by the  State of  Bihar
against Respondent  No 2  (Dr. Jagannath Mishra), Respondent
no. 3 (Nawal Kishore Sinha), Respondent no. 4 (Jiwanand Jha)
and three  others (K.P.	 Gupta since  deceased, M.A. Haidari
and A.K.  Singh who  later became  approvers)  for  offences
under  <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_5">Sections	  420</a>/<a href="/doc/1053937/" id="a_6">466</a>/<a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_7">471</a>/<a href="/doc/513074/" id="a_8">109</a>/<a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_9">120-B</a>	 I.P.C.	  and  under
<a href="/doc/1227639/" id="a_10">Section 5</a> (1) (a), 5 (1) (b) and 5 (1) (d) read with <a href="/doc/1227639/" id="a_11">Section
5</a> (2) of the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_12">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, 1947. Inter alia,
the gravamen of the charge against the respondent no. 2, was
that all  times material  he was  either a  Minister or	 the
Chief Minister	of Bihar and in that capacity by corrupt and
or illegal  means or  by otherwise abusing his position as a
public servant, he, in conspiracy with the other accused and
with a	view to	 protect Nawal Kishore Sinha, in particular,
sought to subvert criminal prosecution and surcharge
62
proceedings against  Nawal Kishore  Sinha  and	others,	 and
either obtained	 for himself  or conferred on them pecuniary
advantage to the detriment of Patna Urban Co-operative Bank,
its members,  depositors and creditors and thereby committed
the offence  of criminal  misconduct under <a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_13">Section 5</a> (1) (d)
read with <a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_14">Section 5</a> (2) of the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_15">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>,
1947 and  in  that  process  committed	the  other  offences
specified in  the charge-sheet,	 including the	offences  of
forgery under  <a href="/doc/1053937/" id="a_16">section 466</a> I.P.C. Cognizance of the case was
taken on  21st November,  1979 by the learned Chief Judicial
Magistrate-cum-Special Judge  (Vigilance)Patna,	 who  issued
process against	 the accused, but before the trial commenced
the State  Government, at  the instance of Respondent no. 2,
who in	the meantime  had come	to power  and had become the
Chief Minister; took a decision in February 1981 to withdraw
from the prosecution for reasons of State and Public Policy.
Though initially  Shri Awadesh	Kumar Dutt,  Senior Advocate
Patna High  Court, had	been appointed	as a  Special Public
Prosecutor by  the previous  Government for  conducting	 the
case, the  State Government (now headed by Respondent no. 2)
without cancelling Shri Dutt's appointment as Special Public
Prosecutor, on	24th February 1981 constituted a fresh panel
of lawyers  for conducting  cases  pertaining  to  Vigilance
Department. Sri	 Lalan Prasad Sinha, one of the Advocates so
appointed on  the fresh panel was allotted the said case and
was informed  of the  Government's said decision and on 26th
March, 1981,  he was  further requested	 to take  steps	 for
withdrawal of  the case	 after he  had considered the matter
and satisfied  himself about  it. On  17th June,  1981,	 Sri
Lalan Prasad  Sinha made  an application  under Section	 321
Crl. P.C.  1973 to  the Special	 Judge seeking permission to
withdraw from  the prosecution of Respondent Nos. 2, 3 and 4
in the case on four grounds: namely, (a) Lack of prospect of
successful prosecution	in the	light of  the evidence,	 (b)
Implication of	the persons  as a  result of  political	 and
personal vendetta,  (c) Inexpediency  of the prosecution for
the reasons  of the State and Public Policy; and (d) Adverse
effects that  the continuance  of the prosecution will bring
on public  interest in	the light  of the changed situation.
The learned  Special Judge by his order dated 20th June 1981
granted the  permission.  A  Criminal  Revision	 No.  874/81
preferred by  the  appellant  against  the  said  order	 was
dismissed in  limine by	 the High  Court on  14th September,
1981. Hence the approval by Special Leave of the Court.
     Allowing the Appeal, the Court
^
     HELD: (i)	Lalan Prasad Sinha was the competent officer
entitled to  apply for	the withdrawal from the prosecution,
there being no infirmity in his appointment. [155 B-C]
     (ii) He  did  apply  his  mind  and  came	to  his	 own
conclusions before making the application for the withdrawal
from the prosecution. [149 G]
     Per majority (Baharul Islam and Misra JJ, Tulzapurkar J
dissenting)
     The executive  function of the Public Prosecutor and or
the supervisory	 function of the trial court in granting its
consent to  the withdrawal  have been properly performed and
not vitiated by reason of any illegality. [143E-158A]
63
     Per Tulzapurkar  J (Concurring  with Baharul  Islam and
Misra JJ.)
     1:1 Sri  Lalan Prasad  Sinha was  the competent officer
entitled to  apply for	the withdrawal from the prosecution.
[84 E. 85 F]
     2:2 It  is true  that the	appointment  of	 the  former
prosecutor, in	the  instant  case,  made  by  the  previous
government to  conduct the  case in  question had  not	been
cancelled, though  in fitness  of things it should have been
cancelled but  that did	 not prevent  the new  government to
make a	fresh appointment  of a Public Prosecutor and to put
him  in	  charge  of   the  case.   Appointments  of  Public
Prosecutors generally  fall under <a href="/doc/940317/" id="a_17">Section 24</a> (3)<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_18"> of the Code</a>
of  Criminal   Procedure,  but	when  the  State  Government
appoints public	 prosecutors for  the purpose of any case or
class  of   cases,  the	 appointees  became  Special  Public
Prosecutors under <a href="/doc/940317/" id="a_19">Section 24</a> (8)<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_20"> of the Code</a>. [85 B-D]
     1:2 Further  it cannot  be	 disputed  that	 the  former
prosecutor not	having appeared	 before the Special Judge at
any stage  of the hearing was never incharge of the case not
in the	actual conduct of the case; on the other hand, after
the allotment  of this	case to him, the latter was incharge
of the	case and  was actually conducting the case he having
admittedly appeared  in the  case at least on four occasions
before the Special Judge. [85 <a href="/doc/1112391/" id="a_21">D-F]
     State of  Punjab v.  Surjeet Singh	 and Anr</a>.,  [1967] 2
S.C.R. 347;  <a href="/doc/1519960/" id="a_22">M.N.S. Nair v. P.V. Balakrishnan and Ors</a> [1972]
2 S.C.R. 599, followed.
     1:3 It  is true  that, in	the instant  case, the State
Government had	taken its  own decision to withdraw from the
prosecution in	the case  against the accused persons and it
is also	 true that the said decision was communicated to the
Public Prosecutor,  but if  the	 letters  communicating	 the
decision are  carefully scrutinised,  it will  be clear that
the State  Government merely  suggested him  (which  it	 was
entitled to  do) to withdraw from the prosecution but at the
same time  asked him  to consider  the matter on his own and
after  satisfying   himself  about  it	make  the  necessary
application which  he did, and there is no material to doubt
the recital  that is  found in	the application	 that he had
himself considered  relevant materials	connected  with	 the
case and had come to his own conclusions in that behalf. [86
D-F]
     2. From  the Supreme  Court's enunciation	of the legal
position  governing   the  proper   exercise  of  the  power
contained in  <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_23">Section 321</a>, three or four things became clear
:
     (i) Though	 withdrawal from prosecution is an executive
function  of  the  Public  Prosecutor  for  which  statutory
discretion is  vested in  him,	the  discretion	 is  neither
absolute nor  unreviewable but	it is subject to the court's
supervisory function. In fact being an executive function it
would be  subject to  a judicial  review on  certain limited
grounds like  any other executive action; the authority with
whom the discretion is vested 'must genuinely address itself
to the	matter before it, must not act under the dictates of
another body,  must not do what it has been forbidden to do,
must act  in good  faith, must	have regard  to all relevant
considerations	and   must  not	  be  swayed  by  irrelevant
considerations, must  not seek	to promote purposes alien to
the letter  or the  spirit of  the legislation that gives it
power to act arbitrarily or capriciously." [81 E-H, 82A]
64
     (ii) Since	 the trial  court's supervisory	 function of
either granting	 or refusing  to grant	the permission	is a
judicial function  the same  is liable	to correction by the
High Court  under its  revisional powers  both under the old
and present  Code of  Criminal Procedure,  and naturally the
Supreme Court  would have  at least coextensive jurisdiction
with the  High Court in an appeal preferred to it by special
leave or upon a certificate by the High Court. [82 B-D]
     (iii) No  dichotomy as  such between political offences
or the	like on	 the one  hand and  common law crimes on the
other could  be said  to have been made by the Supreme Court
for purposes  of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_24">Section  321</a>, for,  even in what are called
political  offences  or	 the  like,  committing	 common	 law
crimes, is implicit, for the withdrawal from the prosecution
of which  the power under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_25">Section 321</a> has to be resorted to.
But the	 decisions do  lay down	 that when common law crimes
are motivated  by political  ambitions or  considerations or
they  are   committed  during	or  are	  followed  by	mass
agitations, communal frenzies, regional disputes, industrial
conflicts,  student  unrest  or	 like  situations  involving
emotive issues	giving rise to an atmosphere surcharged with
violence, the  broader cause of public justice, public order
and peace  may outweigh the public interest of administering
criminal justice  in a	particular litigation and withdrawal
from  the   prosecution	 of  that  litigation  would  become
necessary, a  certainty of  conviction notwithstanding,	 and
persistence in	the prosecution	 in the	 name of vindicating
the law	 may prove  counter-productive. In  other words,  in
case of	 such conflict	between	 the  two  types  of  public
interests, the	narrower public interest should yield to the
broader public	interest, and, therefore, an onerous duty is
cast upon  the	court  to  weigh  and  decide  which  public
interest should	 prevail in  each  case	 while	granting  or
refusing to  grant its	consent to  the withdrawal  from the
prosecution. For,  it is  not invariably that whenever crime
is politically	motivated or  is committed in or is followed
by any	explosive situation involving emotive issue that the
prosecution must  be withdrawn. In other words, in each case
of  such   conflict  the  court	 has  to  weigh	 and  decide
judiciously. But  it is	 obvious that  unless the  crimes in
question are  per se political offences like sedition or are
motivated  by  political  considerations  or  are  committed
during	or   are  followed   by	 mass  agitations,  communal
frenzies, regional  disputes, industrial  conflicts, student
unrest or  the	like  situations  involving  emotive  issues
giving rise  to an  atmosphere surcharged  with violence, no
question of  serving any  broader cause	 of public  justice,
public order or peace would arise and in the absence thereof
the public  interest of	 administering criminal justice in a
given  case   cannot  be   permitted   to   be	 sacrificed,
particularly  when  a  highly  placed  person  is  allegedly
involved in  the crime,	 as otherwise the common man's faith
in the rule of law and democratic values would be sheltered.
[82 D-H, 83 A-D]
     (iv) When	paucity of  evidence or	 lack of prospect of
successful prosecution	is the	ground	for  withdrawal	 the
court has  not merely  the power  but a	 duty to examine the
material on  record without which the validity and propriety
of such ground cannot be determined. [83 <a href="/doc/997644/" id="a_26">D-E]
     State of  Bihar v.	 Ram Naresh  Pandey</a>, [1957] SCR 279;
<a href="/doc/539250/" id="a_27">State of  Orissa v.  Chandrika Mohopatra  and Ors</a>., [1977] 1
SCR 335;  <a href="/doc/1615362/" id="a_28">Balwant Singh and Ors. v. State of Bihar</a>, [1978] 1
SCR 604;  R.K. Jain  v. State, [1980] 3 SCR 982; <a href="/doc/1519960/" id="a_29">M.N.S. Nair
v. P.V.	 Balakrishnan and  Ors</a>, [1972]	2 S.CR 599, referred
to.
65
     3:1 In  the light	of the legal principles, it would be
clear, that  this Vigilance  P.S. case	9 (2)  (78) being an
ordinary criminal  case involving  the commission  of common
law  crimes  of	 bribery  and  forgery	in  ordinary  normal
circumstances with self-aggrandisement or favouritism as the
motivating forces,  grounds (b),  (c) and  (d) stated in the
application for withdrawal were irrelevant and extraneous to
the issue  of withdrawal and since admittedly these were the
considerations which  unquestionably influenced the decision
of the	Public Prosecutor  in seeking the withdrawal as well
as the	decision of the trial court to grant the permission,
the impugned withdrawal of Vigilance P.S. case 9 (2) 78 from
the prosecution would stand vitiated in law. [87 H, 88 A, G-
H, 89 A-B]
     3:2  Admittedly,  the  offences  of  bribery  (criminal
misconduct)  and   forgery  which  are	said  to  have	been
committed by  Respondent No.  2 in conspiracy with the other
accused	 are   ordinary	 common	 law  crimes  and  were	 not
committed  during   nor	 were  they  followed  by  any	mass
agitation  or	communal  frenzy   or  regional	 dispute  or
industrial conflict  or student unrest or the like explosive
situation involving  any emotive  issue giving	rise to	 any
surcharged atmosphere  of violence;  further  it  cannot  be
disputed that  these are  not per  se political offences nor
were  they   committed	out   of  any  political  motivation
whatsoever; in	fact the  motivating force  behind them	 was
merely to  give protection  to and  shield Sri Nawal Kishore
Sinha, a  close friend,	 from  criminal	 as  well  as  civil
liability-a favouritism	 amounting  to	criminal  misconduct
allegedly indulged  in by  Respondent No.  2 by	 abusing his
position as  a Minister	 or  Chief  Minister  of  Bihar.  If
therefore, the	offences did  not partake  of any  political
character  nor	 were  committed  in  nor  followed  by	 any
explosive situation  involving emotive	issue giving rise to
any surcharged	atmosphere of  violence, no question serving
any broader  cause of  public justice, public order or peace
could arise  and in  absence thereof  the public interest of
administering criminal justice in this particular case could
not be permitted to be sacrificed. [88 C-F]
     3:3. No  results of  any election,	 howsoever sweeping,
can be	construed as  the people's  mandate  to	 condone  or
compound the  common law crimes allegedly committed by those
who have been returned to power; in fact such interpretation
of the	mandate would  be contrary to all democratic canons.
Success at  hustings is	 no licence  to sweep all dirt under
the carpet and enjoy the fruits nonchalantly. Therefore, the
plea of	 change	 in  the  situation  brought  about  by	 the
elections  putting  Respondent	No.  2	in  power  as  Chief
Minister and  prosecution against  the head  of State  would
have had adverse effects on public interest including public
order and  peace is  misplaced. At  the worst,	all that can
happen is  that Respondent  No. 2 will have to step down and
nothing more.  Any fear of destabilisation of the Government
is entirely  misplaced. On  the other  hand, withdrawal from
the prosecution	 of such  offences would  interfere with the
normal course  of administration  of  criminal	justice	 and
since Respondent  No. 2	 is placed  in a  high position, the
same is	 bound to  affect the common man's faith in the rule
of law	and administration  of justice. Further if the proof
of the	offences said  to have	been committed by Respondent
No. 2,	in  conspiracy	with  the  other  accused  based  on
undisputed and	genuine documentary evidence, no question of
political and  personal vendetta  or unfair  and overzealous
investigation would arise. [89 D-H, 90 A]
66
     3:4 The  documentary  evidence,  comprising  the  Audit
Reports, the  relevant notings in the concerned file and the
two orders of the Respondent No. 2, the genuineness of which
cannot be  doubted, clearly  makes out	a prima	 facie	case
against Respondent  No. 2 sufficient to put him on trial for
the offence  of criminal  misconduct under <a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_30">Section 5</a> (1) (d)
read with <a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_31">Section 5</a> (2) of the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_32">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>,
1947. Similar  is the  incidental offence  of forgery  under
<a href="/doc/1053937/" id="a_33">Section 466</a>  I.P.C. for	 antedating the	 second	 order.	 The
question of  "paucity  of  evidence",  therefore,  does	 not
arise. The  trial court	 failed, therefore,  in its  duty to
examine	 this	before	permitting   the   withdrawal	from
prosecution. [101 C-E, H, 102 A]
     3:5  Yet  another	legal  infirmity  attaching  to	 the
executive function  of the  Public Prosecutor as well as the
supervisory judicial function of the trial court which would
vitiate the  final order  is that  while the charge-sheet is
under sub-clauses  (a), (b)  and (d)  of <a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_34">Section  5</a> (1) read
with <a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_35">Section 5</a> (2) of the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_36">Prevention of Corruption Act</a> along
with other offences under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_37"> the Penal Code</a>, in the application
for withdrawal	and during  the submission  made before	 the
Court as  well as in the order of the trial Court permitting
the withdrawal the reference is to <a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_38">Section 5</a> (1) (c) and not
5 (1) (d). Obviously the permission granted must be regarded
as having  been given  in respect  of an  offence with which
Respondent No.	2 had  not been charged, completely ignoring
the offence  under <a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_39">Section  5</a> (1) (d) with which he had been
mainly charged. This state of affairs brings out a clear and
glaring non-application	 of mind  both on  the part  of	 the
Public Prosecutor  and also  the learned  special Judge with
the issue  of withdrawal; in the High Court also there is no
improvement in the situation. [103 B, D, E, F, H, 104 A-C]
     Per Baharul Islam, J.
     1:1 In view of the definition of "Public Prosecutor" in
<a href="/doc/760919/" id="a_40">Section 2</a>  of the  Code	 of  Criminal  Procedure  read	with
<a href="/doc/940317/" id="a_41">Section 24</a>  (8)<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_42"> of the Code</a> and in the light of the decision
of the	Supreme Court  in <a href="/doc/1112391/" id="a_43">State	 of Punjab  v. Surjeet Singh</a>
[1967] 2.  SCR 347, there cannot be any doubt, that Sri L.P.
Sinha was  a Public Prosecutor validity appointed under sub-
section (8) of <a href="/doc/898393/" id="a_44">Section 24</a> of the Code. [115 <a href="/doc/1112391/" id="a_45">D-E]
     State of  Punjab v.  Surjeet Singh</a>,  [1967] 2 SCR, 347,
followed.
     1:2 The  appointment  of  Shri  L.P.  Sinha  cannot  be
collaterally challenged particularly in an application under
<a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_46">Article 136</a>  of	 the  Constitution.  Shri  A.K.	 Dutta,	 the
earlier appointee  had at  no point  of time came forward to
make any  grievance at	any stage of the case, either at the
appointment of	Sri L.P.  Sinha as Special Public Prosecutor
or in  the latter's  conduct of the case; nor Sri L.P. Sinha
whose appointment  and right  to make  an application  under
<a href="/doc/1542359/" id="a_47">Section 321</a>  of the  Code have been challenged is before the
Supreme Court. [115 E-G]
     1:3 The  appointment of  the latter  prosecutor without
the termination	 of the appointment of the earlier one might
at best	 be irregular  or improper,  but cannot	 said to  be
legally invalid. The doctrine of de facto jurisdiction which
has been recognised in India will operate in this case. [115

425 quoted with approval.
     1:4 Shri  L.P. Sinha  was both  de jure  and  de  facto
Public Prosecutor  in the  case. If  he	 fulfilled  the	 two
conditions as  required by  <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_49">Section 321</a>, namely, (i) that he
was the	 Public Prosecutor;  and (ii)  was incharge  of	 the
case, he was competent to supply for withdrawal of the case,
even if he were appointed for that purpose only. [118 H, 119
A-C]
     2:1  <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_50">Section  321</a>	enables	 the  Public  Prosecutor  or
Assistant Public  Prosecutor incharge  of a case to withdraw
from the  prosecution with  the consent of the court. Before
an  application	 is  made  under  <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_51">Section  321</a>,	 the  Public
Prosecutor has	to apply  his mind  to the facts of the case
independently  without	 being	subject	  to  any  out	side
influence. But	it cannot be said that a Public Prosecutor's
action will  be illegal	 if he receives any communication or
instruction from  the  Government.  Unlike  the	 Judge,	 the
Public Prosecutor  is not an absolutely independent officer.
He is  an appointee  of the  Government, Central  or  State.
appointed conducting in Court any prosecution or proceedings
on behalf  of the Government. A public prosecutor cannot act
without instructions  of the Government; a public prosecutor
cannot conduct	a case absolutely on his own, or contrary to
the instructions  of his  client,  namely,  the	 Government.
<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_52">Section 321</a> does not lay any bar on the public prosecutor to
receive any  instruction from the Government before he files
an application	under that Section. If the public prosecutor
receives such  instructions, he	 cannot be said to act under
extraneous influence. On the contrary, the public prosecutor
cannot file  an application  for withdrawal of a case on his
own without  instruction from  the Government. [119 D-H, 120
B-C]
     2:2 A  mere perusal  of the  application  made  by	 the
public prosecutor  abundantly shows  that he  did apply	 his
mind to the facts of the case; he perused the case Diary and
the relevant  materials connected  with the case", before he
made the  application. He  did not  blindly quote  from	 the
Government letter  which contained  only one ground, namely,
"inexpediency of prosecution for reasons of state and public
policy". A  comparison of  the contents	 of this letter with
the contents of the application under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_53">Section 321</a> completely
negatives the  contention that	he did not himself apply his
mind independently  to the  fact of  the case  and  that  he
blindly acted on extraneous considerations. [112 F-H]
     3:1 The  object of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_54">Section 321</a> appears to be to reserve
power to  the Executive	 Government to withdraw any criminal
case  on   larger  grounds   of	 public	  policy,  such	 as,
inexpediency of	 prosecutions for  reasons of State; broader
public	interest   like	 maintenance   of  law	 and  order;
maintenance of	public peace  and harmony,  social, economic
and  political;	 changed  social  and  political  situation;
avoidance of  destabilisation of  a State Government and the
like. And  such powers	have been  rightly reserved  for the
Government; for,  who but  the Government  is in the know of
such conditions	 and situations	 prevailing in a State or in
the country.  The Court	 is not	 in a  position to know such
situations.
						   [126 D-F]
68
     3:2 The withdrawal from the prosecution is an executive
function of  the public prosecutor and the ultimate decision
to withdraw  from the prosecution is his; the Government may
only suggest to the Public Prosecutor that a particular case
may not	 be proceeded  with, but nobody can compel him to do
so; not	 merely inadequacy  of evidence,  but other relevant
grounds such as to further the broad ends of public justice,
economic and  political; public	 order and  peace are  valid
grounds for  withdrawal. The exercise of the power to accord
or withdraw  consent  by  the  court  is  discretionary.  Of
course, it  has to  exercise the  discretion judicially. The
exercise of the power of the Court is judicial to the extent
that the  Court in according or refusing consent has to see:
(i) whether  the grounds  of withdrawal	 are valid; and (ii)
whether the  application is  bonafide and  not collusive. It
may be	remembered that	 an order  passed by the Court under
<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_55">Section 321</a> is not appealable. [128 D-G]
     3:3 A mere perusal of the impugned order of the Special
Judge granting	permission to  withdraw from the prosecution
of accused  persons, in	 the case  in question shows that he
has applied his mind to the relevant law. What the court has
to do  under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_56">section  321</a> is  to see whether the application
discloses valid	 grounds of  withdrawal-valid as  judicially
laid down by the Supreme Court.
						   [128 G-H]
     3:4 A  criminal proceeding	 with a prima facie case may
also be	 with drawn.  Besides, the  normal practice  of	 the
Supreme Court  in a  criminal appeal  by Special Leave under
<a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_57">Art. 136</a>  of the  Constitution directed	 against an order of
conviction or  acquittal is  that it  does  not	 peruse	 the
evidence  on  record  and  appreciate  it  to  find  whether
findings of  facts recorded  by the courts below are correct
or erroneous,  far less	 does it  peruse the police diary to
see  whether   adequate	 materials  were  collected  by	 the
investigating agency.  It accepts the findings of the Courts
below unless  it is  shown that the findings are the results
of a wrong application of the principles of law and that the
impugned order has resulted in grave miscarriage of justice.
[129 A-C]
     R.K. Jain v. The State, [1980] 3 S.C.R. 982, followed.
     3:5 An  order under  <a href="/doc/1542359/" id="a_58">Section 321</a>  of the  Code does not
have the  same status as an order of conviction or acquittal
recorded by  a Trial  Court or appellate court in a criminal
prosecution, in	 as much  as the  former has  not been	made
appealable. An	order under  <a href="/doc/1542359/" id="a_59">Section 321</a>  of the  Code has a
narrower scope. As an order under <a href="/doc/1542359/" id="a_60">Section 321</a> of the Code is
judicial, what	the trial court is expected to do is to give
reasons	 for  according	 or  refusing  its  consent  to	 the
withdrawal. The duty of the Court is to see that the grounds
of withdrawal  are legally valid and the application made by
the public  prosecutor is  bonafide and	 not  collusive.  In
revision of an order under <a href="/doc/1542359/" id="a_61">Section 321</a> of the Code, the duty
of the	High Court  is to  see that the consideration by the
trial court  of the  application under	<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_62">Section 321</a>  was not
misdirected and	 that the  grounds of withdrawal are legally
valid. In  this case  the trial court elaborately considered
the grounds  of withdrawal  and found  them to	be valid and
accordingly accorded its consent for withdrawal. In revision
the High  Court affirmed the findings of the trial court. In
this  appeal  by  special  leave,  therefore,  there  is  no
justification to  disturb the  findings of  the courts below
and peruse  the statements  of witnesses  recorded or  other
materials collected by the investigating officers during the
course of investigation. [129 C-H]
69
     3:6 A  question of fact that needs investigation cannot
be allowed  to be  raised for the first time in an appeal by
special leave  under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_63">Article 136</a> of the Constitution. In his
application before  the special	 Judge the appellant did not
find fault  with any  of the  grounds of  withdrawal in	 the
application filed  by the  Public Prosecutor  under  <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_64">Section
321</a>. There was no mention of any forgery by antedating or by
pasting of  any earlier order and thereby making any attempt
at shielding  of any  culprit. He thus prevented the special
Judge and  the High Court from giving any finding an alleged
forgery and  thereby depriving	the Supreme  Court also from
the benefits of such findings of the courts below.
						   [131 C-E]
     3:7 There is no prima facie case of forgery or criminal
misconduct made out on the materials on record. If the Chief
Minister found	that his first order was unwarranted by law,
it was but right that he cancelled that order. Pasting order
by a  piece of	paper containing  another order	 prima facie
appears suspicious,  but pasting  is the  common practice in
the Chief  Minister's Secretariat. Antedating simpliciter is
no offence. [132 C,E,F]
     3:8 If two interpretations are possible, one indicating
criminal intention  and the  other innocent, needless to say
that the  interpretation beneficial  to the  accused must be
accepted. [132 G]
     3:9 Remand for trial if made will be a mere exercise in
futility and it will be nothing but an abuse of the Court to
remand the  case to the trial court in view of the following
circumstances, namely,	(1) the	 occurrence  took  place  as
early as  1970; it  is already	more than twelve years; (ii)
Respondent No.	2 is  the  Chief  Minister  in	his  office.
Knowing human  nature, as  it is,  it can hardly be expected
that the  witnesses, most  of whom  are officials, will come
forward and  depose against a Chief Minister; and (iii) Even
after the  assumption of  office by  Respondent No. 2 as the
Chief Minister	is  in	the  court  of	Special	 Judge,	 the
prosecution was pending on several dates but the Prosecutor,
Sri A.K.  Dutta, did  not take	any interest  in the case at
all.  It   cannot  be  accepted	 that  a  Public  Prosecutor
appointed by the Government in power, will now take interest
and conduct  the case  so as to secure conviction of his own
Chief Minister. [136 F-H, 137 A-B]
     Per R.B. Misra J.
     1:1 A  bare perusal  of <a href="/doc/1037589/" id="a_65">Section  321</a>  of  the  Criminal
Procedure Code	shows that  it does  not put  any embargo or
fetter on  the power  of the  Public Prosecutor	 to withdraw
from prosecuting  a particular	criminal case pending in any
court. All  that he  requires is that he can only do so with
the consent  of the  court where  the case is pending in any
court. [140 C-D]
     1:2 In  this country,  the scheme	of criminal  justice
places	the  prime  responsibility  of	prosecuting  serious
offences on  the  executive  authority.	 The  investigation,
collection of requisite evidence and the prosecution for the
offences with  reference to  such evidence are the functions
of the	executive. The function of the court in this respect
is a limited one and intended only to prevent the abuse. The
function of the court in according its consent to withdrawal
is, however,  a judicial  function. It,	 therefore,  becomes
necessary for the court before
70
whom the  application for  withdrawal is filed by the public
prosecutor to apply its mind so that the appellate court may
examine and be satisfied that the court has not accorded its
consent as  a matter  of course	 but has applied its mind to
the grounds  taken in  the  application	 for  withdrawal  by
Public Prosecutor. [140 <a href="/doc/726197/" id="a_66">E-G]

     2:1 <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_70">Section  321</a> is  in very  wide terms and in view of
the decisions  of the Supreme Court, it will not be possible
to confine  the grounds of withdrawal of criminal proceeding
only to	 offences which	 may be termed as political offences
or offences  involving	emotive	 issues.  The  only  guiding
factor which  should  weigh  with  Public  Prosecutor  while
making	the   application  for	 withdrawal  and  the  court
according its  permission for  withdrawal is  to see whether
the  interest	of  public   justice  is  advanced  and	 the
application for	 withdrawal is not moved with oblique motive
unconnected with  the vindication  of the  cause  of  public
justice. [145 E-G]
     2:2<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_71"> The  Indian Penal  Code</a> or<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_72">  the  Code</a>	of  Criminal
Procedure  does	  not  make  any  such	distinction  between
political offences  and offences  other than political ones.
Even if	 it is	accepted that political offences are unknown
to jurisprudence  and other  Acts do  contemplate  political
offences, the  fact remains that <a href="/doc/1037589/" id="a_73">Section 321</a> Cr. P.C. is not
confined only  to political  offences, but it applies to all
kinds of  offences and the application for withdrawal can be
made by	 the Public  Prosecutor on  various grounds. [145 H,
146 A-B]
     2:3 To  say that  unless the  crime allegedly committed
are per	 se political offences or are motivated by political
ambition or  consideration  or	are  committed	during	mass
agitation, communal frenzies, regional disputes, no question
of serving  a broader  cause of public justice, public order
or peace  can arise  is to put limitation on the broad terms
of <a href="/doc/1542359/" id="a_74">Section 321</a> of the Code. [148 F-G]
     3:1  The	Public	Prosecutor  may	 withdraw  from	 the
prosecution not	 only on  the ground  of paucity of evidence
but on	the other  relevant grounds  as	 well  in  order  to
further broad aims of justice, public order and peace. Broad
aim of	public justice	will certainly	include	 appropriate
social, economic and political purposes. [143 G-H]
     3:2 An  application for withdrawal from the prosecution
can be	made on	 various grounds  and it  is not confined to
political offences.  Therefore, it  cannot be  said that the
grounds mentioned in the application for withdrawal, namely:
     (i)  implication of  the accused persons as a result of
	  political and personal vendetta,
     (ii) inexpediency of the prosecution for the reasons of
	  State and Public policy, and
71
     (iii)adverse  effects   that  the	continuance  of	 the
	  prosecution will  bring on  public interest in the
	  light of the changed situation, are irrelevant.
are not liable grounds for withdrawal. [145 G-H]
     3:3 Further,  the decision	 of the public prosecutor to
withdraw from  the case	 on the	 grounds given by him in his
application for	 withdrawal cannot be said to be actuated by
improper oblique  motive. He  bonafide thought	that in	 the
changed circumstances  it would	 be inexpedient	 to  proceed
with the case and would be a sheer waste of public money and
time to	 drag on with the case if the chances for conviction
are few	 and far  between. In  the circumstances, instead of
serving the  public cause  of justice,	it will	 be  to	 the
detriment of public interest. [149 B-D]
     3:4 The  letter sent  by the  Government to  the public
prosecutor did	not indicate  that the	Government wants him
not to	proceed with  the case,	 but the  letter  gave	full
discretion to  the Public  Prosecutor, to apply his own mind
and to	come to	 his own  conclusion. Consultation  with the
Government or  high officer  is not improper. But the Public
Prosecutor has	to apply  his own  mind	 to  the  facts	 and
circumstances of the case before coming to the conclusion to
withdraw from  the prosecution.	 From the  materials on	 the
record, it  is clear  that the Public Prosecutor has applied
his own mind and came to his own conclusions. [155 D-F]
     3:5   The	 statutory   responsibility   for   deciding
withdrawal squarely  rests upon the public prosecutor. It is
non-negotiable and cannot be bartered away. The court's duty
in dealing  with the application under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_75">Section 321</a> is not to
reappraise the	materials which led the public prosecutor to
request withdrawal  from the  prosecution  but	to  consider
whether public	prosecutor applied  his mind as a free agent
uninfluenced  by   irrelevant  and   extraneous	 or  oblique
considerations, as  the court  has a  special duty  in	this
regard in  as much  as it  is  the  ultimate  repository  of
legislative  confidence	  in  granting	or  withdrawing	 its
consent to withdrawal from prosecution. [149 D-E]
     3:6 If  the view of the Public Prosecutor is one, which
could in  the circumstances  be taken by any reasonable man,
the court  cannot substitute its own opinion for that of the
Public Prosecutor.  If the Public Prosecutor has applied his
mind on	 the relevant  materials  and  his  opinion  is	 not
perverse and which a reasonable man could have arrived at, a
roving enquiry into the evidence and materials on the record
for the	 purpose of finding out whether his conclusions were
right or wrong would be incompetent. [154 H, 155 A]
     In the  view taken	 that no  prima facie  case has been
made out  under <a href="/doc/1053937/" id="a_76">Section	 466</a> of	 the Indian  Penal Code	 and
<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_77">Section 5</a>  (1) (d)  of the  <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_78">Prevention of Corruption Act</a> and
the fact  that the  High Court	in revision  agreed with the
view of	 the Special  Judge giving consent to the withdrawal
from the  prosecution  on  the	application  of	 the  Public
Prosecutor under <a href="/doc/1542359/" id="a_79">Section 321</a> I.P.C. this Court cannot make a
fresh  appraisal   of  evidence	 and  come  to	a  different
conclusion.
72
All that this Court has to see is that the Public Prosecutor
was not	 actuated by  extraneous or  improper considerations
while  moving	the  application  for  withdrawal  from	 the
prosecution. Even  if it  is possible  to have	another view
different from	the one taken by the Public Prosecutor while
moving the  application for  withdrawal from prosecution the
Supreme Court  should be  reluctant to	interfere  with	 the
order unless  it comes	to the	conclusion that	 the  Public
Prosecutor has	not  applied  his  mind	 to  the  facts	 and
circumstances of  the case,  and has  simply  acted  at	 the
behest of  the Government or has been actuated by extraneous
and improper  considerations. On the facts and circumstances
of the	case, it  is clear  that the  Public Prosecutor	 was
actuated by oblique or improver motive. [157 B-F]

on  21st  November,  1979  by  the  learned  Chief  Judicial
Magistrate-cum-Special Judge  (Vigilance), Patna, who issued
process against	 the accused  but before the trial commenced
the State  Government, at  the instance	 of Respondent No.2,
who in	the mean  time had  come to power and had become the
Chief Minister, took a decision in February 1981 to withdraw
from the prosecution for reasons of State and Public Policy.
Though initially  Shri Awadhesh Kumar Dutt, Senior Advocate,
Patna High  Court, had	been appointed	as a  Special public
prosecutor by  the previous  Government for  conducting	 the
said case,  the State  Government (now	headed by Respondent
No.  (2)  without  cancelling  Shri  Dutt's  appointment  as
Special	 Public	  prosecutor,	on   24th   February,	1981
constituted a  fresh panel  of lawyers	for conducting cases
pertaining to  Vigilance Department  and Shri  Lalan  Prasad
Sinha, one  of the Advocates so appointed on the fresh panel
was  allotted	the  said  case	 and  was  informed  of	 the
Government's said  decision and	 on 26th  March 1981  he was
further requested  to take  steps for  the withdrawal of the
case after  he	had  considered	 the  matter  and  satisfied
himself about it. On 17th June, 1981 Shri Lalan Prasad Sinha
made an application under<a href="/doc/1037589/" id="a_90"> s. 321</a> Cr.P.C. 1973 to the Special
Judge seeking permission to withdraw from the prosecution of
Respondent Nos.	 2, 3  and 4  in the  case on  four grounds,
namely, (a)  Lack of  prospect of  successful prosecution in
the light of the evidence, (b) Implication of the persons as
a  result   of	political   and	  personal   vendetta,	 (c)
Inexpediency of the prosecution for the reasons of the State
and public policy
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">74</span>
and  (d)   Adverse  effects  that  the	continuance  of	 the
prosecution will  bring on  public interest  in the light of
the changed  situation; and the learned Special Judge by his
order dated  20th  June,  1981	granted	 the  permission.  A
Criminal Revision  (No. 874/1981) preferred by the appellant
against the  said order	 was dismissed in limine by the High
Court on  14th September,  1981. It  is this withdrawal from
the prosecution	 permitted by  the learned Special Judge and
its confirmation by the High Court that are being challenged
in this appeal.
</p><p id="p_9">     Counsel  for   the	 appellant   raised  three  or	four
contentions in	support of the appeal. In the first place he
contended  that	  the  impugned	  withdrawal   was   utterly
unjustified on merits and also illegal being contrary to the
principles enunciated  by this	Court governing the exercise
of the	power under <a href="/doc/1037589/" id="a_91"> s. 321</a>  Cr. P.C.  According to  him the
decisions of  this Court  bearing on the nature and scope of
the  power  under  the	section	 clearly  suggest  that	 for
purposes  of   that  section   a  dichotomy  exists  between
political offences  and common	law offences  and  that	 the
considerations of public policy, public interest, reasons of
State or political and personal vendetta may become relevant
in the	case the  former cateorgy  but are  irrelevant while
withdrawing from  the prosecution of common law offences and
since in  the instant  case  the  offences  with  which	 the
accused and  particularly Respondent  No. 2 had been charged
were  common   law  offences,	namely,	 bribery   (criminal
misconduct) and	 forgery and  not with any political offence
the grounds at (b), (c) and (d) mentioned in the application
seeking	 permission   for  withdrawal  were  irrelevant	 and
extraneous and	non-germane  considerations  influenced	 the
Public Prosecutor  as  also  the  Court	 the  withdrawal  is
vitiated and  is bad  in law  and  as  regards	ground	(a),
namely, insufficiency  of evidence  or lack  of prospect  of
successful prosecution	the same was clearly untenable being
in teeth  of undisputed	 and  genuine  documentary  evidence
including the  orders admittedly  passed by respondent No. 2
in his	own hand that was available to prove the charges; he
also urged  that in  a case  where the proof of the offences
was primarily based on documentary evidence, the genuineness
of which  was not  in dispute  no question  of political and
personal  vendetta   or	  unfair   and	 over	enthusiastic
investigation	could	arise;	 therefore,   the   impugned
withdrawal  deserved   to  be	quashed.  Secondly,  counsel
contended that Shri Lalan Prasad Sinha was not the competent
officer to  apply for withdrawal from the prosecution of the
case under  s. 321 Cr P.C. inasmuch as that Shri A.K. Dutt's
appointment as Special
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">75</span>
public Prosecutor  made under <a href="/doc/709330/" id="a_92"> s. 24(8)</a>	 Cr. P.C. to conduct
this case had not been cancelled and as such the application
for permission to withdraw as well as the permission granted
thereon were unauthorised, incompetent and illegal. Thirdly,
it was urged that on the facts and circumstances of the case
Shri Lalan  Prasad Sinha did not function independently as a
free agent  but was  influenced	 and  guided  by  the  State
Government's  decision	 in  the  matter  and  as  such	 the
withdrawal at  the behest  of the  Government was  vitiated.
Counsel also  urged that  Shri Lalan Prasad Sinha's decision
(if at	all it was his own) to withdraw from the prosecution
as well	 as the Special Judge's decision to grant permission
were vitiated by non-application of mind.
</p><p id="p_10">     On the  other hand, Counsel for the Respondents refuted
all the contentions urged on behalf of the appellant. It was
denied that  the withdrawal  in question  was unjustified on
merits or  illegal or  contrary to  the principles governing
the exercise  of the  power<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_93"> s.	321</a>; on the Contrary counsel
for the	 Respondents urged  that the decisions of this Court
had clarified  the position that under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_94"> the Code</a> a withdrawal
from the prosecution was an executive function of the Public
Prosecutor or  that the	 discretion  to	 withdraw  from	 the
prosecution was	 that of the Public Prosecutor and none else
and that  he could  withdraw from the prosecution not merely
on the	ground of  paucity of evidence but on other relevant
grounds as well in order to further the broad ends of public
justice, public order and peace and the broad ends of public
justice	 would	include	 appropriate  social,  economic	 and
political purposes,  and  what	was  more  in  granting	 its
consent to  the withdrawal  the	 Court	merely	performed  a
supervisory function  and in  discharging such	function the
Court was  not to  reappreciate the  grounds which  led	 the
public prosecutor to request withdrawal from the prosecution
but to	consider whether  the Public  prosecutor had applied
his mind  as a	free agent,  uninfluenced by  irrelevant  or
extraneous consideration.  It was  disputed that the grounds
</p><p id="p_11">(b), (c)  and  (d)  mentioned  in  the	application  seeking
permission to withdraw were irrelevant or extraneous or that
ground (a)  was	 untenable.  According	to  Counsel  in	 the
instant case  Shri Lalan  Prasad Sinha,	 being in  charge as
well as in the conduct of the case was competent to make the
application  for   withdrawal  and  he	had  done  so  after
considering  all  the  relevant	 factors  and  circumstances
bearing on the issue and satisfying himself about it and not
at  the	 behest	 of  the  Government  as  contended  by	 the
appellant and  the learned  Special Judge also performed his
supervisory function in granting the requisite
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">76</span>
permission on  relevant considerations. Counsel emphatically
denied that  either  the  public  prosecutor's	decision  to
withdraw  from	 the  prosecution  or  the  special  Judge's
supervisory function  was  vitiated  by	 non-application  of
mind. Lastly  it was  contended that  this Court  should not
interfere with	the impugned  orders of	 the trial  Court as
well as	 the High Court in exercise of its powers under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_95">Art.
136</a> of the Constitution and the appeal be dismissed.
</p><p id="p_12">     Having regard  to the  aforesaid rival contentions that
were urged  before us  by the  learned Attorney	 General and
Council on  either side	 it is	clear that principally three
questions  arise  for  our  determination  in  this  appeal,
namely, (1)  what is  the true scope and nature of the power
under<a href="/doc/1037589/" id="a_96"> s.  321</a> of  Cr. P.C,  1973 ?  (2) whether	 Shri  Lalan
Prasad Sinha  was competent  officer entitled  to apply	 for
withdrawal  from  the  prosecution  and	 if  so	 whether  he
discharged his	executive function  independently as  a free
agent? And  (3) whether	 the withdrawal from the prosecution
of respondents	2, 3 and 4 in Vigilance P. S. Case No. 9 (2)
78 was unwarranted and unjustified on facts as also in law ?
In other words, whether the executive function of the Public
Prosecutor and	or the supervisory function performed by the
Court was  vitiated on	account of extraneous considerations
or non	application of	mind etc  deserving interference  by
this Court ?
</p><p id="p_13">     On	 the  first  question <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_97"> s.  321</a>	in  terms  gives  no
guidance; it  merely says  that "the  Public  Prosecutor  in
charge of  a case may, with the consent of the Court, at any
time before  the judgment  is pronounced,  withdraw from the
prosecution of	any person either generally or in respect of
any one	 or more  of the offences for which he is tried" and
goes on	 to indicate  the  results  that  entail  upon	such
withdrawal, namely, either a discharge of the accused if the
withdrawal is  made  before  the  charge  is  framed  or  an
acquittal of  the accused if it is made after the charge has
been framed;  in other	words, it  gives  no  indication  or
guideline as to in what circumstances or on what grounds the
public	Prosecutor   may  apply	  for  withdrawal  from	 the
prosecution nor	 the considerations on which the Court is to
grant its consent and hence the necessity to go to decisions
of this	 Court for ascertaining the true scope and nature of
the power  contained in	 it. In	 this  behalf  quite  a	 few
decisions of  this Court  both	in  regard  to	the  earlier
provision contained  in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_98"> s. 494</a> Cr. P.C. 1898 and the present
provision contained  in<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_99"> s.  321</a> (both being substantially in
pari materia) were referred to by Counsel for the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">77</span>
parties but it is not necessary to deal with all of them and
a reference to four decisions, namely, <a href="/doc/726197/" id="a_100">State of Bihar v. Ram
Naresh Pandey</a>,(1) <a href="/doc/539250/" id="a_101">State of Orissa v. Chandrika Mohapatra</a> and
Ors.,(2) <a href="/doc/1615362/" id="a_102">Balwant  Singh and ors. v. State of Bihar</a>(3) and R.
K. Jain	 v. The	 State(4) having  a bearing  on the  aspects
under consideration  will suffice.  These  decisions,  apart
from enunciating  the  principles  which  would	 govern	 the
exercise of  the power	under  the  section,  emphasise	 the
functional dichotomy  of the Public Prosecutor (who performs
an executive  function) and  the  Court	 (which	 performs  a
supervisory judicial function) thereunder.
</p><p id="p_14">     In Ram  Naresh Pandey's  case (supra)  the Court  while
dealing with<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_103"> s. 494</a> of the old Code observed thus.
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	  "The section	is an  enabling one and vests in the
     Public Prosecutor	the discretion to apply to the Court
     for its consent to withdraw from the prosecution of any
     person. The  consent, if granted, has to be followed up
     by his discharge or acquittal, as the case may be .....
     There can	be no  doubt, however,	that  the  resultant
     order on the granting of the consent, being an order of
     'discharge'   or	'acquittal',   would   attract	 the
     applicability of correction by the High Court under<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_104"> ss.
     435</a>, <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_105">436</a>  and <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_106">439</a>	or  417<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_107">	 of  the  Code</a>	of  Criminal
     Procedure. The  function of  the Court,  therefore,  in
     granting its consent may well be taken to be a judicial
     function. It  follows that	 in granting the consent the
     Court must	 exercise a judicial discretion ........ The
     initiative is  that of  the Public	 Prosecutor and what
     the Court has to do is only to give its consent and not
     to determine  any matter  judicially  ..  The  judicial
     function,	therefore,   implicit  in  the	exercise  of
     judicial discretion  for  granting	 the  consent  would
     normally mean that the Court has to satisfy itself that
     the executive function of the Public Prosecutor has not
     been improperly exercised, or that it is not an attempt
     to interfere  with the  normal course  of	justice	 for
     illegitimate reasons  or purposes	.. ....	 It (s. 494)
     cannot  be	  taken	 to   place   on   the	 Court	 the
     responsibility for	 a prima  facie determination  of  a
     triable
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">78</span>
     issue.  For   instance  the   discharge  that   results
     therefrom need  not always	 conform to  the standard of
     'no prima	facie case' under<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_108"> ss. 209</a> (1) and 253 (1) or
     of 'ground lessens' under<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_109"> ss. 209</a> (2) and 253 (2). This
     is not  to say that a consent is to be lightly given on
     the application  of the  Public Prosecutor,  without  a
     careful and proper scrutiny of the grounds on which the
     application for consent is made." (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>
<p id="p_15">     In Chandrika Mohapatra's case (supra) while setting out
the principles	that should  be kept in mind by the Court at
the  time   of	giving	 consent  to   withdrawal  from	 the
prosecution under<a href="/doc/138097064/" id="a_110"> s. 494</a> the Court observed thus;
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	  "It  will  therefore,	 be  seen  that	 it  is	 not
     sufficient for the Public Prosecutor merely to say that
     it is not expedient to proceed with the prosecution. He
     has to  make out  some ground which would show that the
     prosecution is  sought to	be withdrawn  because  inter
     alia  the	prosecution  may  not  be  able	 to  produce
     sufficient evidence  to sustain  the charge or that the
     prosecution does  not appear to be well founded or that
     there are	other circumstances  which clearly show that
     the object	 of administration  of justice	would not be
     advanced or furthered by going on with the prosecution.
     The ultimate  guiding consideration  must always be the
     interest of  administration of  justice and that is the
     touchstone on  which the  question must  be  determined
     whether  the   prosecution	 should	 be  allowed  to  be
     withdrawn."
</blockquote><p id="p_16">It may	be stated  that Criminal  Appeal No. 310 of 1975 was
one of	the appeals  decided by	 the Court  in that case. In
that  appeal  the  incident,  during  the  course  of  which
offences under	ss. 147,  148 149,  307 and  324 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_111">I.P.C</a>. were
said to	 have been  committed, had  arisen  out	 of  rivalry
between two  trade unions and since the date of the incident
calm and  peaceful atmosphere  prevailed in  the  industrial
undertaking and	 in those  circumstances the State felt that
it would not be conducive to interest of justice to continue
the  prosecution   against   the   respondents	 since	 the
prosecution  with  the	possibility  of	 conviction  of	 the
respondents  would   rouse  feelings   of   bitterness	 and
antagonism and	disturb the  calm  and	peaceful  atmosphere
prevailing  in	 the  industrial   undertaking	 and   hence
permission to withdraw
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">79</span>
was sought  and granted.  Upholding the permission the Court
observed thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	  "We cannot  forget that  ultimately every  offence
     has a  social or  economic cause  behind it  and if the
     state feels  that elimination  or	eradication  of	 the
     social or	economic cause	of the crime would be better
     served by not proceeding with the prosecution the State
     should clearly  be at  liberty  to	 withdraw  from	 the
     prosecution."</blockquote>
<p id="p_17">     In Balwant Singh's case (supra) the independent role of
the  Public   Prosecutor  in   making  an   application	 for
withdrawal from the prosecution was emphasised and the Court
pointed out  that the  sole consideration which should guide
the Public Prosecutor before he decides to withdraw from the
prosecution was	 the larger  factor of the administration of
justice and  not political  favours nor	 party pressures nor
the like  considerations; nor  should he allow himself to be
dictated by  his administrative	 superiors to  withdraw from
prosecution, but  that the  consideration which should weigh
with him must be whether the broader cause of public justice
will  be   advanced  or	  retarded  by	 the  withdrawal  or
continuance of	the prosecution.  The Court  also  indicated
some instances	where withdrawal  from prosecution  might be
resorted to  independently of  the merits  of the case where
the broader cause of public justice would be served:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">	  "Of course,  the interests of public justice being
     the paramount  consideration  they	 may  transcend	 and
     overflow  the   legal   justice   of   the	  particular
     litigation. For instance, communal feuds which may have
     been amicably settled should not re-erupt on account of
     one or two prosecutions pending. Labour disputes which,
     might have	 given rise to criminal cases, when settled,
     might probably  be another instance where the interests
     of	 public	 justice  in  the  broader  connotation	 may
     perhaps warrant  withdrawal from the prosecution. Other
     instances may also be given where public justice may be
     served by	withdrawal even apart from the merits of the
     case."</blockquote>
<p id="p_18">     In R.K.  Jain's case (supra) after reviewing the entire
case  law   on	the  subject  this  Court  enunciated  eight
propositions as emerging
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">80</span>
from the  decided cases	 (page 996  of the  Report), out  of
which the  following six  would be material for the purposes
of the instant case:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">     "1.  The  withdrawal   from  the	prosecution  is	  an
	  executive function of the Public Prosecutor.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">     2.	  The discretion to withdraw from the prosecution is
	  that of  the Public  Prosecutor and none else, and
	  so, he cannot surrender that discretion to someone
	  else.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">     3.	  The  Government   may	 suggest   to	the   Public
	  Prosecutor  that   he	 may   withdraw	  from	 the
	  prosecution but none can compel him to do so.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">     4.	  The  Public	Prosecutor  may	 withdraw  from	 the
	  prosecution not merely on the ground of paucity of
	  evidence but	no other relevant grounds as well in
	  order to further the broad ends of public justice,
	  public order	and peace.  The broad ends of public
	  justice will certainly include appropriate social,
	  economic and,	 we  add,  political  purposes	Sans
	  Tammany Hall Enterprises.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">     5.	  The Court performs a supervisory function granting
	  its consent to the withdrawal.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">     6.	  The  Court's	duty  is  not  to  reappreciate	 the
	  grounds which led the Public Prosecutor to request
	  withdrawal from  the prosecution  but to  consider
	  whether the  Public Prosecutor applied his mind as
	  a  free  agent,  uninfluenced	 by  irrelevant	 and
	  extraneous considerations. The Court has a special
	  duty	in   this  regard  as  it  is  the  ultimate
	  repository of	 legislative confidence	 in granting
	  or withholding  its consent to withdrawal from the
	  prosecution."
</blockquote><p id="p_19">By way of elaborating proposition No. 4 above, the Court has
gone on to observe thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">	  "We have  referred to the precedents of this Court
     where it  has been said that paucity of evidence is not
     the only  ground on  which the  Public  Prosecutor	 may
     withdraw from  the prosecution.  In the  past  we	have
     often known  how expedient	 and necessary	it is in the
     public interest for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">81</span>
     the Public	 Prosecutor to	withdraw  from	prosecutions
     arising  out   of	mass   agitations,  communal  riots,
     regional  disputes,   industrial	conflicts,   student
     unrest, etc.  Whenever issues  involve the emotions and
     there is  a surcharge  of violence in the atmosphere it
     has  often	  been	found  necessary  to  withdraw	from
     prosecutions in  order to	restore peace,	to free	 the
     atmosphere from  the surcharge  of violence,  to  bring
     about a  peaceful settlement  of issues and to preserve
     the calm  which may  follow the  storm. To persist with
     prosecutions where	 emotive issues	 are involved in the
     name of vindicating the law may even be utterly counter
     productive."
</blockquote><p id="p_20">Similarly, by way of elaborating proposition No. 6 above the
Court has gone on to observe thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">     "We may  add  it  shall  be  the  duty  of	 the  Public
     Prosecutor to inform the Court and it shall be the duty
     of the  Court to  apprise itself  of the  reasons which
     prompt the	 Public	 Prosecutor  to	 withdraw  from	 the
     prosecution. The Court has a responsibility and a stake
     in the  administration of	criminal justice  and so has
     the Public	 Prosecutor, its 'Minister of Justice'. Both
     have a  duty to  protect the administration of criminal
     justice  against	possible  abuse	 or  misuse  by	 the
     Executive	by  resort  to	the  provisions	 of <a href="/doc/1037589/" id="a_112"> s.	 321</a>
     Criminal  Procedure   Code.  The  independence  of	 the
     judiciary requires	 that once the case has travelled to
     the Court,	 the Court  and its officers alone must have
     control over  the case and decide what is to be done in
     each case."</blockquote>
<p id="p_21">     From the  aforesaid enunciation  of the  legal position
governing the  proper exercise	of the power contained in<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_113"> s.
321</a>, three  or four  things become amply clear. In the first
place though  it is  an executive  function  of	 the  Public
Prosecutor for	which statutory discretion is vested in him,
the discretion	is neither  absolute nor unreviewable but it
is subject  to the  Court's supervisory	 function.  In	fact
being an  executive  function  it  would  be  subject  to  a
judicial review	 on certain  limited grounds  like any other
executive action,  the authority with whom the discretion is
vested "must  genuinely address	 itself to the matter before
it, must not act under the dictates of another body must not
do what it has been forbidden to do, must act in good faith,
must have regard to all relevant considerations and must not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">82</span>
be swayed  by irrelevant  considerations, must	not seek  to
promote purposes alien to the letter or to the spirit of the
legislation that  gives it  power to  act and  not must	 act
arbitrarily or	capriciously These  several  principles	 can
conveniently be	 grouped in  two main  categories failure to
exercise a  discretion, and excess or abuse of discretionary
power.	The   two  classes   are  not,	 however,   mutually
exclusive."   (vide    de   Smith's   judicial	 Review	  of
Administrative Action 4th Edition pp. 285-86)
     Secondly, since  the trial Court's supervisory function
of either  granting or refusing to grant the permission is a
judicial function  the same  is liable	to correction by the
High Court under its revisional powers both under the old as
well  as   the	present	 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_114">Code  of</a>  Criminal  Procedure,	 and
naturally  this	 Court	would  have  at	 least	co-extensive
jurisdiction with  the High  Court in an appeal preferred to
it by special leave or upon a certificate by the High Court.
</p><p id="p_22">     Thirdly,  no   dichotomy  as   such  between  political
offences or  the like  on the one hand and common law crimes
on the	other could  be said to have been made by this Court
for purposes  of<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_115"> s. 321</a> as con-tended for by Counsel for the
appellant, for,	 even in  what are called political offences
or the	like, committing  common law  crimes is implicit for
the withdrawal from the prosecution of which the power under
s. 321	has to	be resorted  to. But  the decisions  of this
Court do  lay down that when common law crimes are motivated
by  political	ambitions  or  considerations  or  they	 are
committed  during   or	are  followed  by  mass	 agitations,
communal frenzies,  regional disputes, industrial conflicts,
student unrest	or like	 situations involving emotive issues
giving rise  to an  atmosphere surcharged  with violence the
broader cause  of public justice, public order and peace may
out weigh  the public  interest	 of  administering  criminal
justice in  a particular  litigation and withdrawal from the
prosecution of	that litigation	 would become  necessary,  a
certainty of  conviction notwithstanding  persistence in the
prosecution in	the name  of vindicating  the law  may prove
counter-productive. In other words, in case of such conflict
between the  two types	of public  interests,  the  narrower
public interest should yield to the broader public interest,
and therefore,	an onerous  duty is  cast upon	the Court to
weigh and  decide which	 public interest  should prevail  in
each case while granting or refusing to grant its consent to
the  withdrawal	  from	the  prosecution.  For,	 it  is	 not
invariably that	 whenever crime	 is politically motivated or
is committed  in or  is followed  by any explosive situation
involving emotive
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">83</span>
issue that the prosecution must be withdrawn. An instance in
point would  be the  case of Mahatma Gandhi's assassination,
which was  in a sense politically motivated (due to transfer
of Rs.	55 crores to Pakistan) and was followed by explosive
situation involving  emotive issue  resulting in  widespread
violence, arson	 and incendiarism against members of a class
in the	country	 particularly  in  Maharashtra	but  no	 one
suggested any withdrawal and the prosecution of the persons,
who also  included  a  political  personality,	was  rightly
carried to  its logical	 end resulting	in conviction of the
guilty and  acquittal of the political personality. In other
words, in  each case of such conflict the Court has to weigh
and decide  judiciously. But  it is  obvious that unless the
crime  in  question  are  per  se  political  offences	like
sedition or are motivated by political considerations or are
committed  during   or	are  followed  by  mass	 agitations,
communal frenzies,  regional disputes, industrial conflicts,
student unrest	or the	like  situations  involving  emotive
issues	giving	 rise  to   an	atmosphere  surcharged	with
violence, no question of serving any broader cause of public
justice public order or peace would arise and in the absence
thereof	 the   public  interest	 of  administering  criminal
justice	 in   a	 given	 case  cannot  be  permitted  to  be
sacrificed, particularly  when a  highly  placed  person  is
allegedly involved  in the  crime, as  otherwise the  common
man's faith  in the  rule of law and democratic values would
be shattered.
</p><p id="p_23">     Fourthly, the  decision in	 R.K.  Jain's  case  (supra)
clearly shows  that when  paucity of  evidence	or  lack  of
prospect  of   successful  prosecution	is  the	 ground	 for
withdrawal the	Court has not merely the power but a duty to
examine the  material on  record without  which the validity
and propriety  of such	ground cannot be determined. In that
case this  Court disposed  of two sets of appeals, one where
the withdrawal from the prosecution against George Fernandes
and others  was on  the ground	that the  offences  were  of
political character  and the  other pertained  to withdrawal
from the  prosecution in  four cases  against Choudhry Bansi
Lal on the ground that the evidence available was meagre and
in one	out of	the four cases the complainant (Shri Manohar
Lal) had been suitably and profitable compensated. The Court
upheld the  grant of  permission for  withdrawal in both the
sets of	 appeals-in the	 first set  on the  ground that	 the
offences alleged  to have been committed by George Fernandes
and  others  were  of  a  political  character,	 the  motive
attributed to  the accused  being that they wanted to change
the Government led by Shrimati Gandhi and therefore with the
change in the Government
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">84</span>
the broad  ends of  public justice justified the withdrawal,
while in  the  other  set  the	Court  examined	 the  entire
material available on record and came to the conclusion that
the ground  put forward	 had been made out and justified the
withdrawal. It	may be	stated that  in <a href="/doc/1519960/" id="a_116">M.N.S,	Nair v. P.V.
Balakrishnan and  Ors</a> (1)  the Sessions Court as well as the
High Court  had permitted withdrawal from the prosecution of
a case	involving offences of forgery, cheating, etc. On the
ground that  the dispute  was of  a civil nature, that there
had been  enormous delay in proceeding with a trial and that
securing of  evidence would  involve heavy  expenses for the
state as  witnesses were  in  far  off	places.	 This  Court
allowed the appeal, set aside the permission granted for the
withdrawal and	directed the  trial to proceed in accordance
with the  law after holding that none of the grounds alleged
or even their cumulative effect would justify the withdrawal
from the  prosecution  in  particular  after  examining	 the
material on  record this  Court came  to the conclusion that
the finding  of the  lower courts  that the dispute was of a
civil nature  was incorrect.  It is  thus  clear  that	when
paucity of  evidence  or  lack	of  prospect  of  successful
prosecution is	the ground for withdrawal this Court must of
necessity examine  the material	 in order  to determine	 the
validity or  propriety of  the ground. It is in the light of
the aforesaid legal principles that two questions arising in
this appeal will have to be decided.
</p><p id="p_24">     The next  question raised	by Counsel for the appellant
was whether  Shri  Lalan  Prasad  Sinha	 was  the  competent
officer entitled  to  apply  for  the  withdrawal  from	 the
prosecution and	 if so	whether he  discharged his  function
independently as a free agent ? In this behalf Counsel urged
that the  initial appointment  of  Shri	 A.K.  Dutt  as	 the
Special Public Prosecutor made by the State Government under
s. 24  (8) Cr.	P.C. On	 26th February, 1979 to conduct this
case had  not been  cancelled, that  Shri Lalan Prasad Sinha
could  merely	be  regarded  as  one  of  the	four  Public
Prosecutors appointed  on the  fresh panel constituted under
Law (Justice)  Department's letter  No.C/Mis-8-43/78 J dated
24th February, 1981 and that though this particular case had
been allotted  to him  by the  letter dated  25th  February,
1981, he  had no authority over the head of Shri A.K.Dutt to
apply for  withdrawal from  the prosecution  and as such the
application made  by him  would be  unauthorised and illegal
and consequently  the Court's  order dated  20th June,	1981
would be  vitiated. Counsel further contended that the State
Government had already taken a decision to withdraw from the
prosecution in this
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">85</span>
case on	 grounds of  inexpediency of prosecution for reasons
of State  and public  policy, that  the	 said  decision	 was
communicated to Shri Lalan Prasad Sinha, who was directed to
take steps  in that  behalf and that it was pursuant to such
direction that he made the application and not independently
on his	own as	a free	agent and,  therefore, the executive
function on  the part  of the Public Prosecutor (assuming he
had the	 authority to  make the	 application) was improperly
performed. It  is not  possible to  accept either  of  these
contentions for the reasons we shall presently indicate.
</p><p id="p_25">     It is  true that the appointment of Shri A.K. Dutt made
by the	previous Government as the Special Public Prosecutor
to conduct  this case  had not	been  cancelled,  though  in
fitness of things the new Government should have done so but
that did  not prevent  the new	Government to  make a  fresh
appointment of	a Public Prosecutor and to put him in charge
of the	case. Appointments  of Public  Prosecutors generally
fall under <a href="/doc/940317/" id="a_117"> s. 24(3)</a>  but when the State Government appoints
Public Prosecutors  for the purposes of any case or class of
cases the appointees become Special Public Prosecutors under
s. 24(8)  and in  the instant  case under  the Law (Justice)
Department's letter  dated 24th February, 1981 a fresh panel
of lawyers  consisting of  4 Advocates	including Shri Lalan
Prasad	Sinha	was  constituted   "for	  conducting   cases
pertaining to  Vigilance Department  both at Headquarters at
Patna as  also outside	Patna" and,  therefore,	 Shri  Lalan
prasad Sinha  will  have  to  be  regarded  as	having	been
appointed as  Special Public  Prosecutor under<a href="/doc/940317/" id="a_118"> s. 24(8)</a>. But
apart from this aspect of the matter, on the facts obtaining
in the	case, it  cannot be disputed that Shri A.K. Dutt not
having appeared before the Special Judge at any stage of the
hearing was  never defacto  incharge of	 the case nor in the
actual conduct	of the	case; on  the other  hand, after the
allotment of  this case	 to him	 Shri Lalan Prasad Sinha was
incharge of the case and was actually conducting the case he
having admittedly  appeared  in	 the  case  at	least  on  4
occasions (on  6th, April,  21st April,	 27th April and 26th
May, 1981)  before the Special Judge, and, therefore, in our
view, he  was the proper person who could make the necessary
application in	the matter of withdrawal. In this context it
will be	 useful to  point out  that<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_119"> s.	494</a> of	the old Code
seemed to authorise "any Public Prosecuter" to withdraw from
the prosecution with the consent of the Court but this Court
in <a href="/doc/265262/" id="a_120">State of Punjab v. Surijit Singh &amp; Anr</a>. (1) had held that
"the reasonable interpretation
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">86</span>
to be placed upon<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_121"> s. 494</a>, in our opinion, is that it is only
the Public  Prosecutor, who is incharge of a particular case
and is actually conducting the prosecution, that can file an
application  under   that  section,  seeking  permission  to
withdraw from the prosecution." The same view was reiterated
by this Court in the <a href="/doc/1519960/" id="a_122">Case of M.N.S. Nair v. P.V. Balkrishnan</a>
(supra). The  present  <a href="/doc/1037589/" id="a_123">section	321</a>  Cr.  P.  C.  has  given
legislative recognition	 to the aforesaid view of this Court
inasmuch as it expressly provides that the Public Prosecutor
"incharge of  a case" may withdraw from the prosecution with
the consent  of the  Court. We	are satisfied that though he
was appointed  as the  Special Public  Prosecutor to conduct
this case  in February	1979  Shri  A.K.  Dutt	was  neither
incharge of the case nor was actually conducting the same at
the material  time and since Shri Lalan Prasad Sinha was not
merely incharge	 of the case but was actually conducting the
case was the proper officer to apply for the withdrawal from
the prosecution.
</p><p id="p_26">     Similarly, there is no substance in the contention that
Shri Lalan  Prasad Sinha  had sought the withdrawal from the
prosecution at	the behest  of the  State Government.  It is
true that the Government State had taken its own decision to
withdraw from  the  prosecution	 in  the  case	against	 the
respondents Nos.  2, 3	and 4  and it  is also true that the
said decision  was communicated	 to Shri  Lalan Prasad Sinha
but if	the two	 letters, one  dated 25th February 1981 from
the Law	 Secretary to  the District Magistrate and the other
dated 26th  March 1981	from the  Addl. Collector,  Incharge
Legal Section  to the  Special Public  Prosecutor,  Incharge
Vigilance cases,  are carefully scrutinized it will be clear
that the  State Government  merely suggested  to Shri  Lalan
Prasad Sinha (which it was entitled to do) withdraw from the
prosecution but	 at the	 same time asked him to consider the
matter on his own and after satisfying himself about it make
the necessary  application which  he did  on 17th June, 1981
and there  is no material to doubt the recital that is found
in the	application that  he had himself considered relevant
materials connected  with the  case and	 had come to his own
conclusion in  that behalf.  We are  not  impressed  by	 the
argument that the appointment of Shri Lalan Prasad Sinha was
made only for applying for withdrawal and not for conducting
the case.  The appellants  contention, therefore,  has to be
rejected.
</p><p id="p_27">     The   next	  important   question	 that	arises	 for
consideration is whether the withdrawal from the prosecution
of Respondents Nos.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">87</span>
<p id="p_28">2, 3  and 4  in	 Vigilance  P.S.  Case	No.  9	(2)  78	 was
unwarranted, unjustified or illegal on facts as also in law.
In other  words, the  real question is whether the executive
function of  the public	 prosecutor and	 or the	 supervisory
function of  the Trial	Court in granting its consent to the
withdrawal have been improperly performed or are vitiated by
reason	of  any	 illegality  ?	This  will  necessitate	 the
consideration of  the four  grounds on	which the withdrawal
was sought by the Public Prosecutor and granted by the trial
Court under <a href="/doc/1037589/" id="a_124"> s. 321</a>  Cr. P.C. As stated earlier, pursuant to
the suggestion of the State Government and after considering
the matter  for himself	 Shri  Lalan  Prasad  Sinha  in	 his
application dated  17th June,  1981 specifically set out for
grounds for  withdrawal from  the prosecution  in the namely
</p><p id="p_29">(a) lack  of prospect of successful prosecution in the light
of evidence,  (b) the implication of the persons as a result
of political  and personal vendetta, (c) the inexpediency of
the prosecution	 for the  reasons of  the State	 and  Public
policy and  (d) the adverse effects that the continuation of
the prosecution	 will bring on public interests in the light
of the	changed situation.  Significantly enough the learned
Special Judge  after summarising  the  submissions  of	Shri
Lalan Prasad  Sinha, which  were in  terms of  the averments
made and  the grounds  set out	in the application, passed a
short reasoned order on 20th June, 1981 as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">	  Having considered  the legal position explained by
     the Supreme Court (in R.K. Jain's case) and submissions
     made by the learned Special P.P. in charge of this case
     and having	 perused the  relevant records of the case I
     am satisfied  that it  is a fit case in which prayer of
     the learned  Special P.P. to withdraw should be allowed
     and it is, therefore, allowed. Consequently the special
     P.P. Shri	Lalan Prasad  Sinha is permitted to withdraw
     from the prosecution and in view of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_125">section 321</a> (a) Cr.
     P. C. the accused persons are discharged."
</blockquote><p id="p_30">In other  words, the  learned Special Judge accepted all the
grounds on  which withdrawal  was  sought  and	granted	 the
permission  to	 withdraw  from	 the  prosecution  on  those
grounds. The  question is  whether Vigilance P.S. Case No. 9
(2) 78 was such as would attract the grounds and even if the
grounds were  attracted was  withdrawal from the prosecution
justified ?
</p><p id="p_31">     Out of  the four  grounds set  out above,	I shall deal
with grounds (b), (c) and (d) first and ground (a) later. In
the light of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">88</span>
the legal  principles discussed	 above it cannot be disputed
that grounds  like the	inexpediency of	 the prosecution for
the reasons  of State  or public  policy, implication of the
accused persons	 out of	 political and	or personal vendetta
and adverse  effects which  the continuance  of	 prosecution
will have  on public  interests	 in  the  light	 of  changed
situation are  appropriate and have a bearing on the broader
cause of public justice, public order and peace, which might
in a  given case  outweigh or  transcend the narrower public
interest of  administering criminal  justice in a particular
litigation necessitating  the withdrawal of the latter, but,
as observe  dearlier, no  question of  serving	and  broader
cause of  public justice,  public order	 or peace  can arise
unless the  crimes allegedly  committed are per se political
offences  or   are  motivated	by  political  ambitions  or
considerations or  are committed  during or  are followed by
mass  agitations,   communal  frenzies,	 regional  disputes,
conflicts, student  unrest or  like situations which involve
emotive issues	giving rise  to a  surcharged atmosphere  of
violence. Admittedly, the offences of bribery (criminal mis-
conduct) and  forgery which  are said to have been committed
by Respondent No. 2 in conspiracy with the other accused are
ordinary common law crimes and were not committed during nor
were they  followed by any mass agitation or communal frenzy
or regional dispute or industrial conflict or student unrest
or the	like explosive situation involving any emotive issue
giving	rise  to  any  surcharged  atmosphere  of  violence;
further it  cannot be  disputed that  these are	 not per  se
political offences  nor	 were  they  committed	out  of	 any
political motivation  whatsoever;  in  fact  the  motivating
force behind  them was	merely to  give	 protection  to	 and
shield Shri  Nawal  Kishore  Sinha,  a	close  friend,	from
criminal as  well as civil liability-a favouritism amounting
to criminal  misconduct allegedly  indulged in by Respondent
No. 2  by abusing  his position	 as a  Minister or the Chief
Minister of Bihar. If therefore the offences did not partake
of  any	 political  character  nor  were  committed  in	 nor
followed by  any explosive situation involving emotive issue
giving rise  to any  surcharged atmosphere  of	violence  no
question serving any broader cause of public justice, public
order or  peace could  arise and  in absence  there  of	 the
public interest	 of administering  criminal justice  in this
particular case	 could not  be permitted to be sacrified. In
other words,  this being an ordinary criminal case involving
the commission	of common  law crimes of bribery and forgery
in ordinary normal circumstances with self-aggrandisement or
favouritism as	the motivating	force, grounds	(b), (c) and
</p><p id="p_32">(d)  were   irrelevant	and   extraneous  to  the  issue  of
withdrawal and since admittedly these were
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">89</span>
the  considerations   which  unquestionably  influenced	 the
decision of  the public prosecutor in seeking the withdrawal
as well	 as the	 decision of  the trial	 Court to  grant the
permission, the	 impugned withdrawal  from  the	 prosecution
would stand vitiated in law.
</p><p id="p_33">     Counsel for  the respondents  urged that as a result of
the elections  there was  a change  in the  situation,	that
Respondent No.	2's party  had received the peoples' mandate
and voted  to power,  that Respondent  No. 2  had become the
Chief Minister of the State and that the prosecution against
the head  of the  State would  have had	 adverse effects  on
public	interest  including  public  order  and	 peace	and,
therefore, its	continuation was regarded as inexpedient for
reasons of State and public policy. I fail to appreciate the
contention: for,  what	has  the  change  in  the  situation
brought about  by the  elections putting  one or  the  other
party  in   power  got	 to  do	 with  the  continuation  of
prosecution  for  ordinary  common  law	 crimes	 of  bribery
(criminal-mis-conduct)	and   forgery  especially  when	 the
offences were  not  actuated  by  any  political  motivation
whatsoever nor had they been committed in or followed by any
explosive situation  involving	emotive	 issue?	 No  emotive
issue was  or is involved whatsoever. Surely, in the absence
of  the	 aforesaid,  aspects  no  result  of  any  election,
howsoever sweeping, can be construed as the peoples' mandate
to condone  or compound	 the  common  law  crimes  allegedly
committed by  those who have been returned to power; in fact
such interpretation  of the mandate would be contrary to all
democratic canons,  Success at	hustings is  no	 licence  to
sweep  all   dirt  under   the	carpet	 and  enjoy   fruits
nonchalantly.  Moreover,   the	apprehension   that   public
interest including public order and peace would be adversely
affected by  the continuation  of the  prosecution of common
law crimes  (which do not partake of any political character
or are	not  committed	in  or	followed  by  any  explosive
situation involving  emotive issue)  against the head of the
State is  ill-founded, for,  all that  can  happen  is	that
Respondent No.	2 will	have to	 step down and nothing more.
Any fear  of destabilisation  of the  Government is entirely
misplaced.  On	 the  other   hand,  withdrawal	  from	 the
prosecution of such offences would interfere with the normal
course of  administration  of  criminal	 justice  and  since
Respondent No.	2 is  placed in	 a high position the same is
bound to  affect the  common man's  faith in the rule of law
and administration of justice. Besides, as I shall point out
later, if  the proof  of the  offences	said  to  have	been
committed by  Respondent No.  2 in conspiracy with the other
accused was  based on  documentary evidence, the genuineness
of which is not in dispute, no
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">90</span>
question of  political and  personal vendetta  or unfair and
overzealous investigation  would arise.	 In my	view, in all
the facts  and circumstances,  grounds (b), (c) and (d) were
not attracted  to the  instant case  and were irrelevant and
extraneous to  the  issue  of  withdrawal  and	since  these
grounds had  influenced the executive function of the Public
Prosecutor as  well as	the supervisory judicial function of
the trial  Court  the  performance  of	these  functions  is
vitiated. The  High Court  has simply  put its	seal on	 the
trial Court's  order accepting	these grounds.	The impugned
withdrawal as  permitted by the trial Court and confirmed by
the High  Court in  so far  as it  is based on these grounds
would be bad in law.
</p><p id="p_34">     I shall  now proceed  to deal  with the ground (a) that
was put	 forward for  withdrawal from  the  prosecution.  In
substance the  ground was  that there  were  no	 chances  of
successful prosecution	in view	 of paucity  of evidence  to
prove the charges. As stated earlier when such is the ground
it is  the duty	 of the	 Court to  examine the	material  to
ascertain whether  the ground  was valid  one or whether the
available material  was sufficient to make out a prima facie
case against  the accused  to put him on trial ? And I shall
approach the problem strictly from this angle.
</p><p id="p_35">     The facts giving rise to the launching of the aforesaid
prosecution against  respondent Nos.  2, 3  and 4  and three
others may  be stated: The Patna Urban Co-operative Bank was
registered in  May 1970	 and commenced	its banking business
with Nawal  Kishore Sinha as its Chairman, K.P. Gupta as its
Honorary Secretary,  M.A. Haidari  as its  Manager and	A.K.
Singh as a Loan Clerk (who also worked as the care-taker and
Personal Assistant  to N.K.  Sinha).  A	 Loan  Sub-Committee
consisting of  N.K.  Sinha  the	 Chairman,  K.P.  Gupta	 the
Secretary and  one Shri Purnendu Narain, an Advocate used to
look after  the sanctioning and granting of loans. Under its
bye-laws the  Chairman was  the ultimate authority in regard
to all	the functions of the Bank and the Honorary Secretary
along with  the Chairman had to exercise supervisory control
over all  the activities  of the  Bank while the Manager was
concerned with	its day	 to  day  working.  Dr.	 Jagan	Nath
Mishra,	 then  an  M.L.C.  and	who  subsequently  became  a
Minister and  the Chief Minister in the Bihar Cabinet helped
the Bank  and its  Chairman  (N.K.  Sinha  being  his  close
associate  and	 confidant)  in	  several   ways   including
mobilisation of resources for the Bank. Separate audits into
the working of the Bank were conducted by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">91</span>
the Reserve  Bank of  India as	well as	 by the Co-operative
Department of the Bihar Government for the years 1972-73 and
1973-74 during	the  course  of	 which	a  large  number  of
irregularities (such  as non-maintenance  of cash books in a
proper manner,	grant of over-draft facility without current
account etc  ), illegal	 practices, acts of defalcations and
malversation  of  funds	 of  the  Bank	came  to  light;  in
particular the	Audit Reports  disclosed that  huge  amounts
running into lakhs of rupees had been squandered away by (a)
giving loans  to non-members,  (b) giving loans even without
application, agreement	or pronote, (c) giving loans without
hypothecations, (d)  giving  short  term  loans	 instead  of
realising cash on sale proceeds even for hypothecated goods,
</p><p id="p_36">(e) giving  loans to the same persons in different names and
</p><p id="p_37">(f) giving  loans to  fictitious  persons  and	non-existing
firms or  industries etc.  and the audit team of the Reserve
Bank in	 its report came to the conclusion that the Chairman
Shri Nawal  Kishore Sinha  and others  were responsible	 and
accountable for	 'bad loans' to the tune of Rs. 12 lakhs and
'mis-appropriation and	embezzlement' to  the tune of Rs. 25
lakhs. On  the basis  of these audit reports at the instance
of the	Reserve Bank  the management of the Bank through its
Board of  Directors was	 superseded on	10th of	 July,	1974
under the  orders of  the Registrar, Co-operative Societies,
and Nawal  Kishore Sinha the Chairman and other Directors on
the Board  were removed	 and an	 officer of the Co-operative
Department,  Government	 of  Bihar,  was  appointed  as	 the
Special Officer to look after the affairs of the Bank.
</p><p id="p_38">     On the  strength of  the aforesaid	 Audit	Reports	 the
Registrar, Co-operative	 Societies, agreeing  with the Joint
Registrar, put	up a  note dated 4.11.1974 to the Secretary,
Co-operative   saying	 that	prima	facie	charges	  of
defalcations, conspiracy,  etc. were  made out	against	 the
officials of the Bank and legal action be taken against them
after taking  the opinion  of  the  Public  Prosecutor;	 the
Secretary by  his note dated 7.11.1974 sought the opinion of
the Law Department on 18.11.1974 the Law Department recorded
its opinion  in the  relevant file (being File No. IX/Legal-
9/75 of	 the Department	 of Co-operation)  that	 a  case  of
conspiracy and	criminal breach	 of trust  against the loans
and office  bearers of the Bank was prima facie made out. On
16.12.1974 a  draft complaint  was prepared by the Assistant
Public Prosecutor,  Patna for  being filed  before the Chief
Judicial Magistrate,  Patna; on the same day (16.12.1974) an
office noting  was made by Shri Bimal on the file suggesting
that the  Law Department's  advice on the draft complaint be
obtained,  which  course  of  action  was  approved  by	 the
Secretary, Co-operation on 16.12.1974, by the Minister for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">92</span>
Co-operative (Shri  Umesh Prasad  Verma) on  1.1.1975 and by
the  then  Chief  Minister  (Shri  A.  Gaffoor)	 on  2.1.75.
Accordingly, the  file was  sent to the Law Department which
reiterated its	earlier advice for launching the prosecution
and on	the file  being	 received  back	 on  18.1.1975,	 the
Secretary Co-operation	endorsed the  file on  21.1.1975  to
A.P.P. Shri  Grish Narain Sinha for necessary action i.e. to
file the  prosecution (vide the several notings made in File
No.IX/Legal-9/75-relied upon  by the  respondents). In other
words by  21.1.1975  the  stage	 was  set  for	launching  a
criminal prosecution  against the loanees and the members of
the Board  of Directors of the Bank with Nawal Kishore Sinha
as the	principal accused  and a  complaint petition in that
behalf duly  approved by  the Law  Department and  signed by
Shri Jagdish  Narain Verma,  District Co-operative  Officer,
Patna on  25.1.1975 was also ready with the A.P.P. for being
filed in  the Court.  But before  the A.P.P.  could file the
complaint, Respondent  No.2 (Jagan  Nath Mishra, Agriculture
and Irrigation	Minister)  wrote  a  buff-sheet	 note  dated
24.1.1975 asking  the Secretary,  Co-operation to  send	 the
concerned file	along with  Audit Reports  to him before the
institution  of	  the  Criminal	  case.	 Accordingly,  after
obtaining the approval of the then Co-operative Minister and
the then  Chief Minister  for sending the file to respondent
No. 2, the Secretary recalled the file and other papers from
the A.P.P. on 28.1.1975 and on 24.2.1975 he sent the file to
the Law Minister en route the then Chief Minister. It may be
stated that  under the	Notification dated  30th April, 1974
issued under <a href="/doc/1431979/" id="a_126">Art. 166 (3)</a> of the Constitution read with Rule
5 of  the Rules of Executive Business of the State of Bihar,
the then  Chief Minister  Shri Abdul  Gaffoor was inter alia
holding the  portfolio of  Law also  but  according  to	 the
affidavit of  Shri Neelanand  Singh dated 19th October, 1982
filed on behalf of Respondent No.1 before us Shri A. Gaffoor
as per	his note  dated 29-8-1974  addressed  to  the  Chief
Secretary and  circulated to various departments had, with a
view to	 lessen his heavy burden, requested Respondent No. 2
(Jagan Nath  Mishra) to	 look after  the  work	of  the	 Law
Department and	as such	 endorsing the file on 24.2.1975 'to
the Law	 Minister en-route  the Chief  Minister' would	mean
that the  file must  have gone	to respondent No. 2 as there
was no	other person holding the Law portfolio excepting the
Chief Minister	himself under  the Notification	 dated	30th
April, 1974.  It is claimed by the appellant that Respondent
No. 2  sat tight  over the file for over two and half months
till he became the Chief Minister whereas it is suggested on
behalf of  the Respondents  that though	 the file was called
for by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">93</span>
Respondent No.	2 on 24-1-1975 it did not actually reach him
till middle  of May,  1975. However,  ignoring the aforesaid
controversy,  the  fact	 remains  that	the  filing  of	 the
complaint got  postponed from  24-1-1975 (the  date of Buff-
sheet order  of Respondent  No. 2)  till middle of May, 1975
and in	the meantime  on 11.4.1975 Respondent No. 2 replaced
Shri A.	 Gaffoor as  the Chief Minister and in the middle of
May 1975  as the  Chief Minister Respondent No. 2 passed two
orders which are very eloquent.
</p><p id="p_39">     On 16-5-1975  in the  File No. IX/Legal-9/75 respondent
No. 2 wrote out an order in his own hand in Hindi concerning
the action  to be  taken against  Nawal	 Kishore  Sinha	 and
others, the  English rendering	of which,  according to	 the
respondents, runs thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">	  "Much time  has passed.  On perusal of the File it
     appears that  there is  no	 allegation  of	 defalcation
     against the  Chairman and	the Members  of the Board of
     the Bank.	Stern action should be taken for realisation
     of loans from the loanees and if there are difficulties
     in realisation  from the  loanees surcharge proceedings
     should be initiated against the Board of Directors. The
     normal condition  be restored in the Bank after calling
     the Annual General Meeting and holding the election.</blockquote>
<p id="p_40">				      (Sd) Jagan Nath Mishra
16-5-1975
     In	 the  margin  opposite	the  above  order  the	seal
containing the despatch entry originally showed 16-5-1975 as
the date  on which  the file  was despatched  from the Chief
Minister's Secretariat	to the Co-operative Department after
Respondent No.	2 had made the above order. It is clear that
the first  part of  the above  order regarding	the criminal
involvement is	in teeth of the Audit Reports of the Reserve
Bank and  the Co-operative  Department and  contrary to	 the
opinion of  the Law  Department	 it  thwarted  the  criminal
prosecution against  Shri Nawal	 Kishore Sinha	and  others,
while under  the latter	 part it still exposed them to civil
liability by  way of  surcharge proceedings  to	 be  adopted
against them in default of realisations from the loanees but
as even	 the loans  had been  advanced mostly  in fictitious
names and  were	 actually  utilised  by	 the  office-bearers
themselves the	prospect of  civil  liability  loomed  large
before	them.  Realising  this	position  Respondent  No.  2
irregularly-there being	 no endorsement nor any seal showing
inward receipt of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">94</span>
the File  by Chief  Minister's Secretariat-got	hold of	 the
File again  and passed	another order in his hand on a piece
of paper in Hindi under his signature but bearing an earlier
date 14.5.1975	and had	 it pasted  over the  earlier  order
dated 16.5.1975	 in the	 File  so  as  to  efface  the	same
completely, and the date of despatch 16.5.75 in the despatch
seal appearing	in the	margin was  altered to	14 5.1975 by
over writing;  an English  rendering of	 this second  order,
addressed to the Minister for Co-operation, runs thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">	  "Please  issue  order	 for  restoring	 the  normal
     condition in  the Bank  after  holding  Annual  General
     Meeting.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">				      (Sd) Jagan Nath Mishra
					    14-5-1975"
</blockquote><p id="p_41">It  is	undisputed  that  Respondent  No.  2  did  pass	 the
aforesaid two  orders in his own hand in Hindi, the first on
16-5-1975 and  the second  subsequently in point of time but
ante-dated it  to 14-5-1975 and had it pasted over the first
order completely  effacing that	 order. Such  conduct on his
part has  been explained only on the basis that as the Chief
Minister he  had the authority and power to revise or review
his  earlier  order  and  that	it  is	the  usual  practice
prevailing in  the Patna Secretariat that whenever any order
passed earlier	is sought  to be  revised or reviewed by the
same officer  or Minister it is done by pasting it over by a
piece of  paper containing the revised orders (Para 8 of the
counter affidavit of Shri Bidhu Shekhar Banerjee dated 17-3-
1982 filed  on behalf  of respondent  No. 1). Even with this
explanation the	 admitted position  that emerges is that the
aforesaid two  orders were  passed by respondent No. 2, that
the second  order was  ante-dated to  14-5-1975 and that the
same was  pasted on  the file so as to efface completely the
earlier order.	In other  words in substance and reality the
entire order  passed by	 Respondent No.	 2 in  the concerned
file on	 16-5-1975 which  contained 4  directions; (a) there
being no allegation of defalcation against the Chairman, the
Members of  the Board no criminality was involved, (b) stern
action for  realisation of  the loans  from the	 loanees  be
taken, (c)  failing which  surcharge proceedings against the
Board of  Directors be	initiated  and	(d)  restoration  of
normal condition  in the  Bank be  brought about  by calling
Annual General	Meeting and  holding the election, was wiped
out and	 completely substituted	 by the	 second order  which
merely retained	 the last  direction (item (d) above) of the
first order.  In effect	 under the  second  order  both	 the
criminal as  well as  civil liability of Nawal Kishore Sinha
and others
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">95</span>
were given  a go-bye,  notwithstanding the  Audit Reports of
the  Reserve   Bank  and  the  Co-operative  Department	 and
Respondent No.	2 merely  directed that the normal condition
in the Bank be restored and this result was brought about by
the second  order which	 was  ante-dated  with	the  obvious
fraudulent intent  of nullifying  or rendering	nugatory any
action that  could have	 been or might have been taken (even
if not actually taken) pursuant to the first order after the
file had left the Chief Minister's Secretariat on 16.5.1975,
that being the most natural consequence flowing from the act
of ante-dating	the second  order. It  is not necessary that
the fraudulent	intent should  materialise; it	is enough if
act of	ante-dating is done with the fraudulent intent. This
being a	 case of  inter-departmental orders, the first order
dated 16th  May, 1975  passed by  Respondent  No.  2  became
operative as  soon as  the concerned  file  left  the  Chief
Minister's Secretariat and as such the same could be revised
or reviewed  by Respondent No. 2 by officially and regularly
calling	 back	the  file  and	by  passing  a	fresh  order
subsequent in  point of	 time modifying	 or  cancelling	 the
earlier order  but surely not by the crude method of pasting
the subsequent order over the first so as to efface the same
completely and	in no  event by	 ante-dating it.  It is true
that mere  ante-dating a  document or  an  order  would	 not
amount to  an offence  of forgery but if the document or the
order is  antedated with oblique motive or fraudulent intent
indicated above (without the same actually materialising) it
will be forgery.
</p><p id="p_42">     The   aforesaid	undisputed   documentary    evidence
comprising the	Audit Reports,	the relevant  notings in the
concerned file	and the	 two  orders  of  Respondent  No.  2
clearly makes  out a  prima facie  case of the commission of
two common  Law offences of criminal mis-conduct<a href="/doc/1229833/" id="a_127"> s. 5(1)</a> (d)
of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_128">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>) and forgery (s. 466 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_129">I.P.C</a>.)
by Respondent  No. 2 without needing any further material to
establish the  same. The  ingredients of  the former  can be
said to	 be prima facie satisfied in that by passing the two
orders Respondent  No. 2  by corrupt  or illegal means or by
otherwise  abusing   his  position  as	the  Chief  Minister
subverted the criminal prosecution and surcharge proceedings
against Nawal  Kishore Sinha  and others  and had thereby at
any rate  obtained  for	 them  pecuniary  advantage  to	 the
deteriment  of	 the  Bank,   its  members,  depositors	 and
creditors. This is apart from the aspect as to whether while
doing so he obtained pecuniary advantage for himself or not,
for which  further material by way of confessional statement
of the	approvers would	 be required  to  be  considered  or
appreciated but ignoring such further material
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">96</span>
the ingredients of<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_130"> s. 5</a> (1) (d) get satisfied prima facie as
indicated above. As regards the latter though Respondent No.
2 had  the authority  and power	 to pass the second order in
substitution of	 the first,  by ante-dating the second order
with fraudulent	 intent the  ingredients  of  forgery  again
prima  facie   satisfied.  In  other  words,  the  aforesaid
material is  clearly sufficient	 to put	 Respondent No	2 on
trial  for,  if	 the  said  material  remains  unrebutted  a
conviction would clearly ensue.
</p><p id="p_43">     It	  was	strenuously   contended	  by   Counsel	 for
respondents, particularly  by counsel  for Respondent  No. 2
that if	 the aforesaid two orders passed by Respondent No. 2
are properly understood it cannot be said that the effect of
either of these two orders was to thwart or to scuttle or to
subvert the  criminal prosecution  and surcharge proceedings
against Nawal  Kishore Sinha  and others and that the effect
of the	second order  was certainly  not to  countermand the
directions contained  in the  first order in regard to items
</p><p id="p_44">(b) and	 (c) above  but in fact the effect was to facilitate
recourse to surcharge proceedings against the office-bearers
without the hurdle of being required to make the recovery of
loans from  the loanees	 first, which  was the import of the
first order  dated 16-3-1978.  It was further contended that
instead of  stifling the  criminal prosecution against Nawal
Kishore Sinha and other office bearers Respondent No. 2 at a
subsequent stage  had directed prosecution of office bearers
including Nawal	 Kishore Sinha and actually the Co-operative
Department had	taken steps  to adopt  surcharge proceedings
even against  Nawal Kishore  Sinha  by	issuing	 show  cause
notice	to  him	 and  therefore,  the  charges	of  criminal
misconduct and	forgery against	 the  Respondent  No.  2  in
conspiracy  with   others  were	 clearly  unsustainable	 and
withdrawal  from   the	prosecution  sought  by	 the  public
prosecutor was proper and justified. In my view, however, as
I shall	 presently indicate, the further materials on record
do not	bear out or support these submissions of counsel for
the respondents.
</p><p id="p_45">     On the  question as  to whether the effect of either of
the aforesaid  two orders  was to thwart; scuttle or subvert
criminal prosecution  and surcharge  proceedings or  not and
what was  intended by  Respondent No. 2 when he passed those
orders would  be clear	from his further conduct evidence by
subsequent notings and orders passed by him till he went out
of power in 1977 and in this behalf it would be desirable to
delineate the  course which  the subsequent  events took  in
regard to criminal prosecution as well as surcharge
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">97</span>
proceedings separately.	 As regards criminal prosecution, it
appears that  the Co-operative Department wanted to go ahead
with it	 and in	 that behalf  by his next noting dated 28-6-
1975 the  then Minister	 for Co-operation  sought directions
from the Chief Minister as to what should be the next course
of  action  in	the  matter  of	 filing	 the  complaint	 and
Respondent No.	2 as the Chief Minister passed the following
order on  the file  on 30-6-1975: "Discussion has been held.
There is no need to file the prosecution." This clearly show
what Respondent	 No. 2	intended by his aforesaid two orders
in the	matter of  criminal prosecution	 and  the  direction
clearly runs  counter to  the suggestion  that	he  did	 not
thwart, scuttle	 or subvert the criminal prosecution against
Nawal Kishore  Sinha and  others. It further appears that in
July, 1975  there were	questions and call attention motions
in the Bihar Legislative Assembly during the course of which
the propriety  of non-prosecution  of the culprits concerned
in the	Bank fraud,  despite Law  Department's	advice,	 was
discussed, that	 the Speaker  referred	the  matter  to	 the
Estimates Committee  of the  House, that  in June,  1976 the
Estimates  Committee   submitted  its	Report	recommending
prosecution of Nawal Kishore Sinha and others, that in July,
1976  a	  debate  took	 place	in   the  Assembly   on	 the
recommendations	 contained   in	 the  said  Report  and	 the
Government  was	 forced	 to  agree  to	launch	prosecutions
against the culprits. In the wake of these events Respondent
No. 2  as the Chief Minister passed an order on 4-8-1976 for
launching criminal  prosecutions but  even there he directed
that prosecutions  be launched	against some  of the office-
bearers and  loanees of the Bank including Shri K. P. Gupta,
the Hony, Secretary, Shri M.A. Haidary, the Manager and Shri
K.P. Gupta,  the Loan  Clerk but  not against  Nawal Kishore
Sinha who  was excluded	 from being  arraigned as an accused
and accordingly	 23 criminal  cases were  filed against	 the
aforesaid office-bearers  and loanees. This order is another
indication that	 even with  all the  furore which  the Banks
affairs had  created Respondent	 No. 2	wanted	to  and	 did
protect and  save Shri	Nawal Kishore  Sinha  from  criminal
prosecution by	excluding him  from  the  array	 of  accused
persons. As  regards the 23 criminal cases filed against the
other office bearers and the loanees of the Bank there is on
record in  the Co-operative  Department File  No.  12/Legal-
31/77 a Buff-Sheet order dated 2-2-1977 passed by Respondent
No. 2  to the  following effect:  "In order  to recover	 the
money from  some of  the loanees  of  the  Patna  Urban	 Co-
operative Bank, criminal cases were instituted against them.
Action should be taken immediately for the withdrawal of the
cases against  those loanees  who have	cleared the  loan in
full, and proper instalments for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">98</span>
payment of  loans should  be fixed against those who want to
repay the  loan but due to financial handicaps are unable to
make payment  at a  time, and  thereafter necessary  further
action should  be taken."  It appears  that pursuant to this
order after verifying that loans from three parties (Plastic
Fabricators, Climaz  Plastic Udyog and K.K. Boolan) had been
cleared the  criminal cases against them were directed to be
withdrawn immediately. However, the protection given to Shri
Nawal Kishore  Sinha against  criminal prosecution continued
to benefit him.
</p><p id="p_46">     In the  meanwhile in April, 1976 the Banking Licence of
the Patna  Urban Co-operative  Bank  was  cancelled  by	 the
Reserve Bank  of India	and further  at the  instance of the
Registrar, Co-operative	 Societies, the	 Bank was ordered to
be liquidated.	It appears  that Shri T. Nand Kumar, I.A.S.,
Liquidator of  the Bank	 addressed a  communication  to	 the
Registrar, Co-operative	 Societies suggesting  that  besides
the other  office-bearers Sri  Nawal Kishore  Sinha, the ex-
Chairman of  the Bank  also deserve  to	 be  prosecuted	 for
offences of  embezzlement, forfery,  cheating, etc.  but the
matter was  kept pending for report of the Superintendent of
Police (Co-operative Vigilance Cell); the S.P. (Co-operative
Vigilance Cell)	 after collecting  facts and evidence got it
examined by  Deputy Secretary  (Law) in C.I.D., obtained the
opinion that a criminal case was fully made out against Shri
Nawal Kishore  Sinha and proposed that a fresh criminal case
as per	draft F.I.R.  be filed	and that  Shri Nawal Kishore
Sinha should  also be  made co-accused	in a number of cases
already	 under	 investigation,	  the	S.P.   (Co-operative
Vigilance Cell)	 obtained the  approval of D.I.G., C.I.D. on
his said  proposal and	submitted the same to the Secretary,
Co-operation, for  obtaining Chief Minister's permission. In
view of	 the Chief  Minister's earlier order restricting the
filing of  criminal cases against some of the office-bearers
and loanees  only the S.P's noting categorically stated that
the draft  F.I.R. (against  N.K. Sinha)	 had been  vetted by
D.I.G. C.I.D. as well as by I.G.. of Police. After examining
the entire  material carefully	and obtaining clarifications
on certain  points Shri	 Vinod Kumar  Secretary Co-operation
put up	a lengthy  note dated  15-1-1977 to the Minister for
Co-operation in which he specifically placed the proposal of
S.P.  (Co-operative   Vigilance	 Cell)	for  lodging  F.I.R.
against Shri  Nawal Kishore  Sinha for his approval and also
suggested that	the Hon'ble  Minister may  also	 obtain	 the
approval  of  the  Chief  Minister.  The  Minister  for	 Co-
operation in  his turn endorsed the file on 20-1-1977 to the
Chief Minister	for the	 latter's  approval.  The  file	 was
received by  the Chief	Minister's Secretariat	on 30-3-1977
and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">99</span>
Respondent No.	2 as  the Chief Minister on 9-4-1977 instead
of indicating  his mind either way merely marked the file to
"I.G. of  Police." which was meaningless as the prior noting
had clearly indicated that a draft F.I.R. had been vetted by
both,  D.I.G.,	C.I.D.	and  I.G.  of  Police.	Counsel	 for
Respondent No.	2 submitted that the endorsement made by the
Chief Minister	meant that  he had  approved the  action  as
proposed. It is impossible to accept the submission. Had the
Chief Minister	merely put his signature or initials without
saying anything	 it might have been possible to suggest that
he had	approved the proposal, but to mark the file to "I.G.
of Police" without saying 'as proposed' or something to that
effect cannot  mean that  the Respondent  No. 2 had approved
the proposal.  In fact,	 with the knowledge that the I.G. of
Police had approved and vetted the draft F.I.R. against N.K.
Sinha, merely  marking the file to "I.G. of Police" amounted
to putting  off the  matter  Meanwhile	Respondent  No.	 2's
Government went	 out of power and under the President's Rule
the matter  was dealt  with by	the Governor Shri Jagan Nath
Kaushal (the  present Union  Law Minister)  who granted	 the
approval on  16-5-1977 as  a result  whereof a criminal case
(being F.I.R.  Case No.	 97 (5)	 77) ultimately	 came to  be
filed at  Kadam Kuan  Police Station  on  30-5-1977  against
Nawal Kishore  Sinha, for which Respondent No. 2 cannot take
any credit  whatsoever. On  the other  hand, the  subsequent
events show  that  so  long  at	 it  lay  within  his  power
Respondents No.	 2 made	 every effort  to protect  and	save
Nawal Kishore Sinha from criminal prosecution by abusing his
official position-a  criminal  prosecution  which  had	been
proposed by  independent bodies	 like the  Reserve  Bank  of
India and  the Co-operative Department, agreed to by the Law
Department,  recommended  by  the  Estimates  Committee	 and
ultimately approved by the Governor Shri Jagan Nath Kaushal.
</p><p id="p_47">     As regards	 the surcharge	proceedings the	 position is
very  simple.  As  discussed  earlier,	the  two  directions
contained in  the first	 order dated  16-5-1975	 for  taking
stern action  to realise  loans	 from  the  loanees  and  in
default to  initiate surcharge proceedings against the Board
of Directors  were wiped  out by  the subsequent  ante-dated
order 14-5-1977,  and  thereby	Respondent  No.	 2  thwarted
surcharge proceedings  and attempted to give a go bye to the
civil liability	 of Nawal  Kishore Sinha  and other  office-
bearers of  the Bank. This conduct on the part of Respondent
No 2  has been	explained in  the counter  affidavit of Shri
Vinod Kumar  Sinha dated  8-10-1982  filed  before  us,	 and
counsel for Respondent No. 2 pressed it into service
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">100</span>
during his  arguments and the explanation is that a separate
file titled "Surcharge Proceedings" being File No. 3 of 1975
maintained in  the office  of Deputy Registrar, Co-operative
Societies, Patna Division shows (a) that by his letter dated
30-4-1975 the  Deputy Registrar informed the joint Registrar
that discussions  had already  been held  with the Registrar
and that surcharge proceedings would be initiated as soon as
possible (b)  that on  10-6-1975 the  necessary proposal for
surcharge was drafted and filed by the District Co-operative
Officer before	the Registrar under sec. 40 of the Bihar and
<a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_131">Orissa	Co-operative   Society	Act</a>   and  (c)	on  1-7-1975
Surcharged Case No. 3 of 1975 had been started against Nawal
Kishore Sinha  and others  by directing	 issuance  of  show-
cause-notice to	 them  and  that  in  view  of	these  facts
Respondent No.	2 could	 not be	 said to have counter-manded
the Surcharge  proceedings, it	is further  urged  that	 the
order dated  16-5-1975 directing  surcharge proceedings was,
therefore,  unnecessary	  and  irrelevant   as	the   proper
authority, namely,  the Registrar  had	already	 decided  to
start surcharge	 proceedings which  were started by issuance
of show-cause notice to Nawal Kishore Sinha and others on 1-
7-1975 and, in fact, if the struck-out order dated 16-5-1975
had remained without being replaced by the order dated 14-5-
1975 the  surcharged proceedings  which were  filed on 10-6-
1975 would have been delayed and the effect of recalling the
first order  dated 16-5-1975  (incidentally recalling of the
first  order  by  the  second  order  is  admitted)  was  to
facilitate  the	 surcharge  proceedings	 (which	 were  being
processed at  that time	 in the	 office of Deputy Registrar)
without being  required to  adopt recovery  proceedings from
the loanees  first. Counsel for Respondent No. 2 strenuously
urged that  instead of	thwarting or  stalling the surcharge
proceedings the subsequent order dated 14-5-1975 removed a -
hurdle. The explanation to say the least is disingenuous for
two  or	  three	 reasons  and  cannot  be  accepted.  First,
admittedly and	this was  fairly  conceded  by	counsel	 for
Respondent No.	2, that	 there is  no material	on record to
show that  File No. 3/75 pertaining to surcharge proceedings
was sent  to the  Chief Minister  (Respondent No.  2) or was
seen by	 him prior to 16-5-1975,indeed, it was never sent to
him at	all with  the result  that Respondent  No. 2  had no
knowledge of either the notings and orders contained therein
or  what  was  being  done  in	the  office  of	 the  Deputy
Registrar, Co-operative	 Societies, when he passed either of
the two orders dated 16-5-1975 and 14-5-1975 and the
explanation, therefore,	 that Respondent  No. 2	 facilitated
the filing of the surcharge proceedings by the office of the
Deputy Registrar, without the necessity of proceeding
against the loanees first, is not candid. Secondly, the
proposal for surcharge proceeding itself was submitted and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">101</span>
filed by  the District	Co-operative Officer  against  Nawal
Kishore Sinha  and others  on 10-6-1975	 and  the  surcharge
proceedings actually could be said to have been initiated on
1-7-1975, when	show cause  notice was directed to be issued
and served  on	Nawal  Kishore	Sinha  on  15-7-1975,  while
thwarting of the surcharge proceedings against Nawal Kishore
Sinha  and   others  was   already  complete,	having	been
accomplished by Respondent No. 2 by his ante-dated order 14-
5-1975. Thirdly	 it is	obvious that Respondent No. 2 cannot
take credit  for the  action that was taken in the matter of
surcharge proceedings against Nawal Kishore Sinha and others
by   the   Office   of	 Registrar,   Co-operative   Society
independently of  and in  spite of Respondent No. 2's action
of subverting the surcharge proceedings.
</p><p id="p_48">     It will appear clear from the above discussion that the
documentary evidence  mentioned above,	the  genuineness  of
which cannot  be doubted,  clearly makes  out a	 prima facie
case against Respondent No. 2 sufficient to put him on trial
for the	 offence of  criminal misconduct  under<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_132"> s. 5</a> (1) (d)
read with <a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_133"> s. 5</a>	 (2) of	 the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_134">Prevention	 of Corruption	Act</a>,
1947. Similar  is the position with regard to the incidental
offence of  forgery under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_135"> s. 466</a>,  <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_136">I.P.C</a>. said to have been
committed by  him, for,	 ante-dating of	 the second order by
him is	not disputed;  and it is on record that in regard to
such ante-dating  no explanation  was offered  by him during
the investigation  when he  was questioned  about it  in the
presence of his lawyers and there has been no explanation of
any kind  in any  of the counter-affidavits filed before us.
But during  the course	of arguments his counsel offered the
explanation that  could only  be ascribed  as  a  bona	fide
mistake or slip (vide written arguments filed on 14.10.1982)
but such  explanation does  not bear scrutiny, having regard
to the	admitted fact  that after  the ante-dated  order was
pasted over  the first	order the despatch date appearing in
the margin  was required  to be	 and  has  been	 altered  to
14.5.1975 by over-writing and if over-writing is required to
be done	 there cannot  any bona	 fide mistake  or slip.	 The
ante-dating in	the  circumstances  would  be  with  oblique
intent to  nullify any	possible action	 that could  have or
might have  been taken pursuant to the first order as stated
earlier, that  being the  most natural	consequence  flowing
from it	 which in  must in law be presumed to have intended.
It would, of course, be open to him to rebut the same at the
trial but  at the  moment there	 is no material on record-by
way of	rebuttal. In  the circumstances	 it is impossible to
accept the  paucity of	evidence  or  lack  of	prospect  of
successful
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">102</span>
prosecution as	a  valid  ground  for  withdrawal  from	 the
prosecution.  On   the	aforesaid   undisputed	 documentary
evidence no  two views	are possible  in the  absence of any
rebuttal material,  which, of  course, the  respondent No. 2
will have  the opportunity  to place before the Court at the
trial. What  is more  the so-called  unfair or	over-zealous
investigators were  miles away	when the  aforesaid evidence
came into existence.
</p><p id="p_49">     As far  as Respondent  No. 3  (Nawal Kishore Sinha) and
Respondent No.	4 (Jiwanand  Jha) are concerned it cannot be
forgotten that they have been arraigned alongwith Respondent
No. 2  on a  charge  of	 criminal  conspiracy  in  pursuance
whereof the several offences are said to have been committed
by all	of them.  Further it  is obvious  that the principal
beneficiary of	the offence  of criminal  misconduct said to
have been  committed by	 Respondent No. 2 under<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_137"> s. 5</a> (1) (d)
read with<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_138"> s. 5</a> (2) of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_139">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, 1947 has
been Respondent	 No. 3	and so	far as	Respondent No.	4 is
concerned it  cannot be	 said that  there is  no material on
record suggesting  his complicity.  Admittedly, he  has been
very close  to	Respondent  No.	 2  for	 several  years	 and
attending to  his affairs-private  and party affairs and the
allegation  against  him  in  the  F.I.R.  is  that  he	 was
concerned with	the deposit of two amounts of Rs. 10,000 and
Rs. 3,000  on 27.12.1973  and 1.4.1974	in the	Savings Bank
Account of  Respondent No  2 with the Central Bank of India,
Patna Dak Bungalow Branch, which sums, says the prosecution,
represented some  of the  bribe amounts	 said to  have	been
received by  respondent No.  2 and  the tangible documentary
evidence in  proof of  the two	deposits having been made in
`Respondent No.	 2's account consists of two pay-in slips of
the concerned  branch of  Central Bank of India. Whether the
two amounts  came from	the funds  of the  Patna  Urban	 Co-
operative Bank	or not	and whether they were really paid as
bribe amounts  or not  would be aspects that will have to be
considered at the trial. However, as pointed out earlier the
offence under <a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_140"> s. 5</a> (1) (d) would even otherwise be complete
if pecuniary  advantage	 (by  way  of  scuttling  the  civil
liability of surcharge) was conferred on Nawal Kishore Sinha
and others. If Respondent No.2 has to face the trial then in
a case	where conspiracy  has been charged no withdrawal can
be permitted  against Respondent No. 3 and Respondent No. 4.
In arriving  at the  conclusion that  paucity of evidence is
not a  valid ground  for withdrawal  from the prosecution in
regard to  Respondents Nos.  2, 3 and 4. I have deliberately
excluded from  consideration  the  debatable  evidence	like
confessional statements of the approvers
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">103</span>
etc. (credibility  and effect whereof would be for the trial
court  to  decide)  said  to  have  been  collected  by	 the
allegedly   over-zealous    investigating   officers   after
Respondent No. 2 went out of power in 1977.
</p><p id="p_50">     There is  yet another  legal infirmity attaching to the
executive function  of the  Public Prosecutor as well as the
supervisory judicial function of the trial court which would
vitiate the  final order.  As  per  the	 charge-sheet  filed
against them  respondents Nos.	2, 3 and 4 were said to have
committed offences  under<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_141"> ss.  420</a>/<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_142">466</a>/<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_143">417</a>/<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_144">109</a>/<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_145">120-B</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_146">I.P.C</a>.

(2) of	the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_149">Corruption	of Prevention Act</a>, 1947 and gravaman
of the	charge against	the respondent	No 2 was that in his
capacity either as a Minister or the Chief Minister of Bihar
by corrupt  of illegal	means or  by otherwise	abusing	 his
position as  a public  servant he,  in conspiracy  with	 the
other accused and with a view to protect Nawal Kishore Sinha
in particular,	sought to  subvert criminal  prosecution and
surcharge proceedings against Nawal Kishore Sinha and others
and  either  obtained  for  himself  or	 conferred  on	them
pecuniary advantage  to the  detriment of Patna Co-operative
Bank, its Members, depositors and creditors; in other words,
the principal charge against Respondent No. 2 was in respect
of the	offence of  criminal misconduct	 under<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_150"> s.  5</a> (1) (d)
read with<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_151"> s. 5</a> (2) of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_152">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, 1947 and
the offence  under<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_153"> s.  5</a> (1)  (c) was  nowhere mentioned  or
referred to.  The difference  between<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_154"> s.  5</a> (1) (d) (bribery
amounting to  criminal mis-conduct) and<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_155"> s. 5</a> (1) (c) (breach
of trust  amounting to criminal mis-conduct) is substantial,
each having different ingredients but in the application for
withdrawal filed  by Shri  Lalan Prasad	 Sinha on 17th June,
1981 he	 stated that  withdrawal  from	the  prosecution  in
Vigilance Case No. 9 (2) 78 was sought in respect of several
offences including the offence of criminal mis-conduct under
s. 5  (1) (c)  read with <a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_156"> s. 5</a>	(2)  of	 the  <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_157">Prevention  of
Corruption Act</a>	and through out the application there was no
reference to  the offence of criminal mis-conduct under<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_158"> s. 5</a>
(1) (d)	 read with<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_159"> s. 5</a> (2) of the said Act. In other words,
an offence  under<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_160"> s. 5</a> (1) (c) read with<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_161"> s. 5</a> (2) with which
Respondent No.	2 had  never been  charged was mentioned and
the offence under<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_162"> s. 5</a> (1) (d) read with<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_163"> s. 5</a> (2) with which
he was principally charged was completely omitted. Obviously
submissions contained  in the  application as  well as those
that were  made at  the hearing	 before the  Court  were  in
relation to  the offence  of<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_164"> s.	 5</a> (1)	(c) and not<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_165"> s. 5</a> (1)
</p><p id="p_51">(d). Similarly the learned Special Judge while granting the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">104</span>
requisite permission  has also referred to the offence under
s. 5  (1) (c)  and not	s. 5  (1) (d)  of the  <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_166">Prevention of
Corruption Act</a>	in his	order and  obviously the  permission
granted must  be regarded as having been given in respect of
an offence with which Respondent No. 2 had not been charged,
completely ignoring  the offence  under<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_167"> s.  5</a> (1)  (d)	with
which he  had mainly  been charged.  This state	 of  affairs
brings out  a clear and glaring non-application of mind both
on the	part of	 the Public  Prosecutor as  also the learned
Special Judge while dealing with the issue of withdrawal; in
the  High   Court  also	 there	is  no	improvement  in	 the
situation. This	 must lead  to the  quashing of the impugned
withdrawal from the prosecution.
</p><p id="p_52">     Having regard  to the  aforesaid discussion it is clear
that the  impugned withdrawal  was not	justified either  on
merits or  in law  and being  illegal has  to be  quashed. I
would, therefore,  allow the appeal set aside the withdrawal
order and  direct that	Vigilance P. S. Case No. 9 (2) 78 be
proceeded with the disposed of in accordance with law.
</p><p id="p_53">     BAHARUL ISLAM, J. This is an appeal by special leave by
Shri Sheonandan	 Paswan, who  intervened in  an	 application
under <a href="/doc/1037589/" id="a_168">Section  321</a> of  the Code	 of Criminal Procedure, 1973
(hereinafter `the  Code') pending  before the Chief Judicial
Magistrate-cum-Special Judge, Patna. The material background
facts may be narrated thus:
</p><p id="p_54">     2. The  appellant is  a member of the Bihar Legislative
Assembly and belongs to the Lok Dal Party. Respondent No. 2,
Dr. Jagannath  Mishra, is  currently the  Chief Minister  of
Bihar ;	 and Respondent	 No. 4,	 Shri Jiwanand	Jha  at	 the
relevant time  was a  close associate  of Respondent  No. 2.
Respondent No.	3, Shri Naval Kishore Sinha, who started the
Patna Urban  Cooperative Bank  (hereinafter `the  Bank') and
became its  Chairman, had been a colleague of Respondent No.
2 in  the Legislative  Council of Bihar. In 1972, respondent
No. 2  became Minister	for Cooperation	 and Agriculture. On
June  18,   1974,  the	Sub  Divisional	 Co-operative  Audit
Officer, Patna,	 submitted his	audit report  of the Bank in
respect	 of   the  year	  1972-73  alleging   a	 number	  of
irregularities in  the affairs	of the	Bank. The report was
submitted to the Co-operative Department whereupon the Joint
Registrar, Cooperative	Audit Department,  recommended legal
action	against	  the  Directors  of  the  Bank.  The  legal
assistant of the Department submitted a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">105</span>
draft prosecution  report prepared  by the Public Prosecutor
with a	suggestion that	 the Registrar	of  the	 Cooperative
Department should  obtain the  opinion of the Law Department
on the	draft prosecution  report. The	Registrar agreed  to
send the  draft prosecution report to the law Department but
expressed  desire   that  the  Minister	 in  charge  of	 the
Cooperative Department	should see  the report.	 Accordingly
the file  was endorsed	to the	Minister in  charge  of	 the
Cooperative Department.	 The then Chief Minister, Shri Abdul
Gafoor, signed	it by way of agreement with the Registrar to
obtain the  advice of  the Law	Department and	approved the
First  Information   Report  (FIR).  The  Secretary  of	 the
Cooperative Department	then requested the Public Prosecutor
to amend  the draft FIR which was sent to the Law Department
for opinion.  The Law  Department returned  the file  to the
Cooperative Department stating that it had already given its
opinion and  that it was not its duty to file complaint. The
file was  then endorsed	 to the Additional Public Prosecutor
for necessary  action. Respondent No. 2 who was the Minister
in charge  of Irrigation  and Agriculture also wanted to see
the file  along with  the audit	 report before the complaint
was actually  filed. The  Cooperation Minister	endorsed the
file to	 the Chief  Minister, Shri Gafoor, with his comments
that the  file might be sent to the Irrigation Minister. The
Secretary,  Cooperative,  requested  the  Additional  Public
Prosecutor  to	release	 the  file,  with  the	endorsement,
"filing of  complaint may  await further  instructions". The
Additional Public Prosecutor sent the file to the Secretary,
Co-operative, through  a special messenger with a request to
return the  file after	perusal by  the Chief Minister (Shri
Gafoor). The  Secretary, Cooperative  Department,  sent	 the
file to	 the Minister of Cooperation with his remarks, inter
alia, "para 4:-Law Deptt. have tendered their advice at page
13/N that  criminal case  made out against the Secretary and
other Directors of the bank should be filed."
</p><p id="p_55">     "Para 5: Chief Minister and Minister (Law) have desired
to see the file before complaints are actually lodged". As a
result the  file was  recalled from  the  Additional  Public
Prosecutor.
</p><p id="p_56">     The above	movement of  the file  was between  January,
1975 to February 24, 1975.
</p><p id="p_57">     3. On  April 11,  1975,  there  was  a  change  in	 the
Ministry  of   Bihar.  Chief  Minister,	 Abdul	Gafoor,	 was
replaced by Respondent
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">106</span>
No. 2  as Chief	 Minister and one Dr. Jawahar Hussain became
the Minister  of Cooperation. On May 16, 1975, the aforesaid
file was  put up  before the Chief Minister, who ordered for
taking strict  steps for  realisation of  the loans, failing
that for  starting surcharge  proceedings,  and	 to  restore
normal conditions in the Bank after convening annual general
meeting and holding election.
</p><p id="p_58">     Subsequently, the	said order  was covered by pasting a
piece of  paper containing  a fresh  order to which we shall
refer later.  On June  28, 1975	 the Minister of Cooperation
wrote  to   the	 Chief	 Minister  that	 the  buff-sheet  of
correspondence showed  that the	 former Chief Minister (Shri
Gafoor) postponed  the filing of the complaint and wanted to
see the	 file; and  as the  former Chief Minister had passed
the said  orders, it  was for  the  new	 Chief	Minister  to
indicate the  next course  of action in the case. Respondent
No. 2  wrote on	 the file that discussions had been held and
that there  was no need to file any case. On August 4, 1976,
the Chief Minister ordered for the prosecution of the office
bearers and  loanees of	 the  bank  including  its  honorary
Secretary, Shri	 K.P.  Gupta,  Manager,	 Shri  M.A.  Haidari
(hereinafter `Haidari') and the loan clerk.
</p><p id="p_59">     4. There was a mid-term poll to the Lok Sabha in March,
1977. In  that poll,  the Congress  (I)	 Government  at	 the
Centre was  voted out of power and the Janata Government was
installed with	Shri Morarji Desai as the Prime Minister and
Chaudhury Charan  Singh	 as  the  Home	Minister.  In  April
following, the	Patna  Secretariat  Non-gazetted  Employees'
Association submitted  a  25  point  representation  against
Respondent No. 2 to the Prime Minister and the Home Minister
of the Union Government apprising them of the irregularities
of the	Bank. In June following, the Congress (I) Government
of Bihar  headed by  Respondent No. 2 was replaced by Janata
Government  headed   by	 Shri	Karpoori  Thakur.  The	said
Employees' Association	on July	 9, 1977 submitted a copy of
the representation  to the new Chief Minister, Shri Karpoori
Thakur, with  a request	 for  making  an  enquiry  into	 the
allegations by an Enquiry Commission. The representation was
endorsed by  the State	Government to  the Inspector General
(Vigilance)  for   a  preliminary   probe.  Eventually	 the
preliminary  inquiry   was  entrusted	to  the	 then  Joint
Secretary, Shri D.N. Sahay.
</p><p id="p_60">     5. The  Union Home	 Minister, Chaudhury  Charan  Singh,
wrote a	 D.O. letter  to the  Chief Minister  of Bihar, Shri
Karpoori
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">107</span>
Thakur, saying	that as per Code of Conduct, 1964, the Prime
Minister had  to look  into  a	complaint  against  a  Chief
Minister or  an ex-Chief Minister and obtain comments of the
Chief Minister	in the	first instance	and then  decide the
course of  action. On  25.7.1977, Joint Secretary, Shri D.N.
Sahay, submitted his preliminary report and recommended that
the Home  Ministry of  the Government  of  India  should  be
informed of the proposed course of action and suggested that
before ordering	 detailed inquiry,  it was essential to take
concurrence of	the Union Home Minister. The Chief Minister,
however, on  23.8.1977, discussed  the matter with the Chief
Secretary `at  20.08 p.m.'  and ordered full enquiry without
the consent of, or intimation to, the Union Home Ministry.
</p><p id="p_61">     On 1.9.1977, Joint Secretary, Shri D.N. Sahay, wrote to
the Special  Secretary	regarding  the	charge	No.  8	that
related to  the Bank  that as  a Commission  of Enquiry	 had
already been  instituted, he  doubted the  desirability of a
vigilance inquiry. The Chief Minister, Shri Karpoori Thakur,
opined	that   the  materials  collected  by  the  Vigilance
Department would  be used  by the  Commission. On 20.9.1977,
the Joint  Secretary, Shri D.N. Sahay, again referred to the
Conduct Rules  of 1964 for Ministers and Chief Ministers and
suggested that	necessary notes	 by Chief Minister should be
sent to	 the Union  Home Minister  for necessary  orders for
inquiry. Then  on 17.10.1977,  Chief Minister, Shri Karpoori
Thakur, who  had written a D.O. letter to the Home Minister,
Chaudhury  Charan  Singh,  regarding  the  allegations	with
regard	to   the  Bank	 again	suggested  that	 although  a
Commission of  Enquiry had  been  appointed,  the  Vigilance
inquiry	 might	continue,  as  the  materials  collected  by
vigilance might be used by the Commission.
</p><p id="p_62">     In October,  1977, Shri S.B. Sahay was posted as D.I.G.
(Vigilance) by	the Chief Minister, Shri Karpoori Thakur. On
7.11.1977, Shri S.B. Sahay ordered for inquiry on all points
without obtaining  consent of  the Union  Home Ministry	 and
without waiting for further orders.
</p><p id="p_63">     In November,  1977, one  Shri D.P.	 Ojha was  posted as
S.P., Vigilance,  by the Chief Minister, Shri Thakur and the
inquiry was endorsed to Shri Ojha.
</p><p id="p_64">     6. It  has been  alleged by  the  respondents  that  in
January, 1978,	some Inspectors	 of the	 CID  like  Raghubir
Singh, Sharda
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">108</span>
Prasad Singh,  Ram Dahin  Sharma and others were transferred
to Vigilance  Department and  they were	 responsible for the
investigation of the major portions of the case in question,
and that  all the  criminal cases  investigated	 by  D.S.Ps.
(CID), Bihar,  relating to  the	 Bank  were  transferred  to
Vigilance Department  and placed  under the  charge  of	 the
Inspector, Shri	 Raghubir Singh. Haidari, aforesaid, who had
been an accused of Kadam Kuan P.S. case and arrested and who
had made  a confessional  statement was	 rearrested  by	 the
investigating officer,	Shri Raghubir  Singh  on  22.1.1978.
Haidari made  a second confession implicating Respondent No.
2 for  the first time. On 26.1.1978, A.K. Sinha who was also
rearrested made	 a  confession.	 On  28.1.1978.	 D.P.  Ojha,
aforesaid,  submitted	his  inquiry   report	recommending
institution of	criminal cases	against Respondent No. 2 and
others. Similar	 recommendations were also made by Shri S.B.
Sahay, aforesaid,  and also  by the I.G. Vigilance. The file
was  then  referred  to	 the  Advocate	General,  Shri	K.D.
Chatterjee, appointed  by the Karpoori Thakur Government. On
31.1.1978, the Chief Minister, Shri Thakur, approved it with
the direction  to hand over the file to Shri S.B. Sahay, who
in turn, endorsed it to Shri D.P. Ojha for investigation and
institution of	the case.  On 1.2.1978,	 Shri Ojha  directed
Shri R.P.  Singh, Additional S.P. to institute a case. After
having obtained	 sanction of  the Governor,  a criminal case
was instituted	on 1.2.1978  by the  Vigilance Police and on
19.2.1979  a   charge-sheet  was   submitted   against	 the
respondents and others.
</p><p id="p_65">     7.	 On   26.2.1979,  one	Shri  Awadesh	Kumar  Datta
(hereinafter `A.K.  Datta'), a	Senior Advocate of the Patna
High Court  was appointed  Special Public  Prosecutor by the
Karpoori Thakur	 Government to	conduct	 the  two  vigilance
cases against Respondent No. 2.
</p><p id="p_66">     8. On  21.11.1979, the  Chief Judicial  Magistrate-cum-
Special Judge, Patna, took cognizance of the case.
</p><p id="p_67">     9. Shortly thereafter, there was a change of Government
in Bihar  and Respondent  No. 2	 became the  Chief  Minister
again. On  10.6.1980, the  State Government  took  a  policy
decision that  criminal cases  launched	 "out  of  political
vendetta"  in	1978-79	 and  cases  relating  to  political
agitation be withdrawn.
</p><p id="p_68">     10. On  24.2.1981, the  Government appointed  one	Shri

<p id="p_87">     It is  evident from  the last quoted letter that Shri L
P. Sinha was appointed a Public Prosecutor.
</p><p id="p_88">     16. The  State Government	may appoint a Special Public
Prosecutor under  sub-section (8)  of <a href="/doc/898393/" id="a_177">Section 24</a> of the Code
for the	 purpose of  any case  or classes  of cases.  Public
Prosecutor has been defined under clause (u) of <a href="/doc/915147/" id="a_178">Section 2</a> of
the Code as:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_55">     "2(u)-"Public Prosecutor"	means any  person  appointed
	  under <a href="/doc/940317/" id="a_179">Section	 24</a>, and  includes any person acting
	  under the directions of a Public Prosecutor,,
     In the  case of  <a href="/doc/1112391/" id="a_180">State of	Punjab v.  Surjit Singh	 and
another</a>,(1) a  Bench of five Judges of this Court considered
the provisions of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">115</span>
<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_181">Section 492</a>  to	 <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_182">495</a>  of  the  old  Code  dealing  with	 the
appointment of Public Prosecutor. The Court observed:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_56">     "Public  Prosecutors   are	 appointed   by	 the   State
	  Government under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_183">section 492(1)</a> or by the District
	  Magistrate or the Sub-Divisional Magistrate, under
	  sub-section (2)  of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_184">section  492</a>. The appointment,
	  under sub-section  (1) of  <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_185">section 492</a>  can  be  a
	  general appointment  or for  a particular case, or
	  for any  specified class  of cases,  in any  local
	  area. Under  this provision  more than one officer
	  can be  appointed as	Public	Prosecutors  by	 the
	  State	 Government.   Under  sub-section  (2),	 the
	  appointment of  the Public  Prosecutor is only for
	  the purpose of a single case. There is no question
	  of a general appointment of the Public Prosecutor,
	  under sub-section (2). Therefore, it will be seen,
	  that a  Public Prosecutor  or Public	Prosecutors,
	  appointed either  generally, or  for any  case, or
	  for any  specified classes  of cases,	 under	sub-
	  section (2),	are all Public Prosecutors under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_186"> the
	  Code</a>".
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_57">There cannot  be any  doubt, therefore, that Shri L.P. Sinha
was a  Public Prosecutor validly appointed under sub-section
(8) of <a href="/doc/898393/" id="a_187">section 24</a> of the Code.</blockquote>
<p id="p_89">     But what  was submitted  by the appellant was that Shri
L.P. Sinha  could  not	be  appointed  a  Public  Prosecutor
without the  appointment of  Shri  A.K.	 Datt,	having	been
terminated first. It was not the contention of the appellant
that the  appointment  of  Shri	 L.P.  Sinha  was  otherwise
invalid.
</p><p id="p_90">     17. The  answer to	 this contention  is this, Shri A.K.
Datta had  at no  point of  time come  forward to  make	 any
grievance  at	any  stage   of	 the  case,  either  at	 the
appointment of	Shri L P. Sinha as Special Public Prosecutor
or in  the latter's conduct of the case; nor Shri L.P. Sinha
whose appointment  and right  to make  an application  under
<a href="/doc/1542359/" id="a_188">section 321</a>  of the Code have been challenged, is before us.
His   appointment   cannot   be	  collaterally	 challenged,
particularly in	 an application	 under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_189">Article	136</a>  of	 the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_91">     The  appointment	of  Shri   L.P.	 Sinha	without	 the
termination of	the appointment of Shri A.K. Datta, might at
best be	 irregular or  improper, but  cannot be	 said to  be
legally invalid. The doctrine
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">116</span>
of de  facto jurisdiction which has been recognised in India
will operate in this case. In the case of Gokaraju Rangaraju
etc. v.	 State of  Andhra Pradesh  (1) to  which one  of  us
(Baharul Islam, J.) was a party, it has been held:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_58">	  "The doctrine	 is now	 well established  that 'the
     acts of  the Officers de facto performed by them within
     the scope	of their  assumed official authority, in the
     interest the  public or third persons and not for their
     own benefit,  are generally as valid and binding, as if
     the were the acts of officers de jure".</blockquote>
<p id="p_92">     The judgment  referred, with approval, to the following
observations-made in  the case	of New Zealand and Norton v.
Shelby Country decided by the United States Supreme Court-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_59">	  "Where an  office exists under the law, it matters
     not how  the appointment  of the  incumbent is made, so
     far as  the validity  of his  acts are concerned. It is
     enough that  he is	 clothed with  the insignia  of	 the
     office, and  exercises its	 powers and  function..	 The
     official acts  of such  persons are recognised as valid
     on grounds	 of public policy, and for the protection of
     these having official business to transact".</blockquote>
<p id="p_93">     This Court	 in Gokaraju's case (supra) also quoted with
approval the following passage from Colley's 'Constitutional
Limitation':
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_60">	  "An intruder	is one	who attempts  to perform the
     duties of	an office  without  authority  of  law,	 and
     without the support of public acquiscence-
	  No one is under obligation to recognise or respect
     the acts  of an  intruder, and  for all  legal purposes
     they are absolutely void. But for the sake of order and
     regularity, and  to prevent confusion in the conduct of
     public business  and in  security of private right, the
     acts of  officers de  facto  are  not  suffered  to  be
     questioned because	 of  the  want	of  legal  authority
     except by	some direct  proceeding instituted  for	 the
     purpose by the State or by some one claiming the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">117</span>
     office de	jure, or  except  when	the  person  himself
     attempts  to   build  up  some  right,  or	 claim	some
     privilege or  emolument, by reason of being the officer
     which he  claims to  be. In all other cases the acts of
     an Officer	 de facto  are as valid and effectual, while
     he is  suffered to retain the office, as though he were
     an officer	 by right,  and the  same legal consequences
     will flow	from them  for the  protection of the public
     and of  third parties. There is an important principle,
     which finds  concise expression in the legal maxim that
     the acts  of officers  de facto  cannot  be  questioned
     collaterally".</blockquote>
<p id="p_94">     18. The next question is whether Shri L.P. Sinha was in
charge of  the case  as required by <a href="/doc/1542359/" id="a_190">section 321</a> of the Code.
Shri L.P. Sinha was entrusted with and put in charge of, the

			   (emphasis added).
</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_72">     Shri L.P. Sinha had been appointed a Government counsel
on 24.2.1981 to conduct vigilance cases as stated above. The
application for withdrawal was made by him on 17.6.1981-more
than four  months later.  After having been appointed Public
Prosecutor, and	 having been  put in charge of the Vigilance
P.S. Case  No. 9(2)78,	he appeared  in the  case  on  seven
dates, namely,	6.4.1981, 21.4.1981,  27.4.1981,  26.5.1981,
3.6.1981, 19.6.1981 and 20.6.1981. It has been stated in the
affidavit filed	 by the	 Secretary, Law	 Department  of	 the
State of  Bihar that  the order	 disclosed that "no one else
appeared for  the prosecution" except Shri L.P. Sinha. There
is nothing on record to show whether in fact Shri A.K. Datta
did at	all accept  the appointment  as a Public Prosecutor.
</blockquote><p id="p_95">The record  does not  show that	 he took any steps at all in
the case.  Shri L.P.  Sinha could not have appeared on seven
different dates	 during the course of 3 1/2 months and taken
steps in  it had he (A.K. Datta) been in charge of the case.
The learned  Special Judge  also has  found as a fact in his
judgment that  the application under <a href="/doc/1542359/" id="a_191">section 321</a> of the Code
was made  "by  Shri  Lallan  Prasad  Sinha,  Special  Public
Prosecutor, in	charge of this case" (emphasis added). There
is, therefore, absolutely no doubt that at the relevant time
Shri L.P.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">119</span>
<p id="p_96">Sinha was in charge of the case, and not Shri A.K. Datta, as
submitted by the appellant. Shri L.P. Sinha was both de jure
and de facto Public Prosecutor in the case.
</p><p id="p_97">     It	 was  factually	 wrong	that  Shri  L.P.  Sinha	 was
appointed  only	 to  withdraw  the  case,  as  submitted  by
appellant's counsel.  Even if  he were,	 there	was  nothing
illegal in  it (also  see 1931 Cal. 607). If Shri L.P. Sinha
fulfilled the  two conditions  as required by <a href="/doc/1542359/" id="a_192">section 321</a> of
the Code,  namely, that	 (i) he	 was a Public Prosecutor and
</p><p id="p_98">(ii) was  in charge  of the  case, he was competent to apply
for withdrawal	of the	case, even  if he were appointed for
that purpose only.
</p><p id="p_99">     19. The next question for decision is whether Shri L.P.
Sinha functioned  independently. The  appellant's submission
is that	 Shri L.P. Sinha acted as directed by the Government
to make	 the application  for withdrawal and himself did not
apply his mind.
</p><p id="p_100">     <a href="/doc/1542359/" id="a_193">Section 321</a>  of the  Code enables the Public Prosecutor
or Assistant  Public Prosecutor	 in  charge  of	 a  case  to
withdraw from the prosecution with the consent of the Court.
The appellant submits, in our opinion correctly, that before
an application	is made	 under <a href="/doc/1542359/" id="a_194">section	321</a> of the Code, the
Public Prosecutor  has to apply his mind to the facts of the
case independently  without being  subject  to	any  outside
influence; and	secondly, that	the Court  before which	 the
case is	 pending cannot give its consent to withdraw without
itself applying	 its mind  to the  facts of the case. But it
cannot be  said that  a Public	Prosecutor's action  will be
illegal if he receives any communication or instruction from
the Government.
</p><p id="p_101">     Let us  consider the  point from the practical point of
view. Unlike  the Judge,  the Public  Prosecutor is  not  an
absolutely independent	officer. He  is an  appointee of the
Government, Central  or State (see ss. 24 and 25 Crl. P.C.),
appointed for  conducting in  Court any prosecution or other
proceedings on	behalf of the Government concerned. So there
is the relationship of counsel and client between the Public
Prosecutor and	the Government.	 A Public  Prosecutor cannot
act  without   instructions  of	  the  Government  a  Public
Prosecutor cannot  conduct a  case absolutely on his own, or
contrary to  the instruction  of  his  client,	namely,	 the
Government. Take  an extreme  hypothetical  case,  in  which
Government is  the prosecutor, and in which there is a prima
facie case
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">120</span>
against an  accused, but  the Government feels on the ground
of public  policy, or  on the ground of law and order, or on
the  ground   of  social   harmony,  or	 on  the  ground  of
inexpediency of	 prosecution for  reasons of State, the case
should	not  be	 proceeded  with;  the	Government  will  be
justified  to  express	its  desire  to	 withdraw  from	 the
prosecution and	 instruct  the	Public	Prosecutor  to	take
necessary legal	 steps to  withdraw  from  the	prosecution.
<a href="/doc/1542359/" id="a_195">Section 321</a>  of the  Code does not lay any bar on the Public
Prosecutor to  receive any  instruction from  the Government
before he  files an  application under	that section. If the
Public Prosecutor  receives such  instructions, he cannot be
said to act under extraneous influence. On the contrary, the
Public Prosecutor  cannot file an application for withdrawal
of  a	case  on   his	own  without  instruction  from	 the
Government.
</p><p id="p_102">     Now in  the above	hypothetical case, if the Government
gives instructions  to a  Public Prosecutor to withdraw from
the prosecution	 of a  case, the  latter has  the  following
courses open to him:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_73">     (i)  He can  blindly file the petition without applying
	  his mind  to the  facts of  the case.	 This is not
	  contemplated by <a href="/doc/1542359/" id="a_196">Section 321</a> of the Code;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_74">     (ii) He may,  himself, apply  his mind  to the facts of
	  the case,  and may  agree with the instructions of
	  the Government  and file  the petition stating the
	  grounds   of	 withdrawal.   This   is   what	  is
	  contemplated by  the section	and has been done in
	  this case; or
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_75">     (iii)He may tell the Government, "It is a good case for
	  the prosecution;  conviction is almost sure; and I
	  do not  agree with  you that	the case  should  be
	  withdrawn, I	am not	going to file a petition for
	  withdrawal." In  that event, the Public Prosecutor
	  will have  to return	the  brief  and	 perhaps  to
	  resign. For,	it is the Government, not the Public
	  Prosecutor, who  is in the know of larger interest
	  of the State.</blockquote>
<p id="p_103">     20. Let  us now see if Shri L.P. Sinha applied his mind
to the	facts of the case before he made the application. He
made the following application before the Court:

	       prosecution in the light of evidence, (b) the
	       implication of  the persons  as a  result  of
	       political  and  personal	 vendetta,  (c)	 the
	       inexpediency  of	  the  prosecution  for	 the
	       reasons of  the State  and public policy, (d)
	       the adverse  effects that the continuation of
	       the  prosecution	  will	 bring	 on   public
	       interests  in   the  light   of	the  changed
	       situation,   and	   after   giving    anxious
	       considerations and  full deliberations, I beg
	       to file this application to withdraw from the
	       prosecution of  all the	persons involved  in
	       the aforesaid case:

	       time of	institution  of	 the  case  and	 the
	       investigation thereof,  it appears  that	 the

	       party in the country. The prosecution was not
	       launched in  order to advance the interest of
	       public  justice.	  I  crave  leave  to  place

	       advancement of  the cause  of public  justice
	       should not  proceed further.  More so, as the

<p id="p_104">     A mere  perusal of	 the  above  application  abundantly
shows that  Shri L.P.  Sinha did apply his mind to the facts
of the	case ;	he perused  "the Case Diary and the relevant
materials connected  with  the	case"  before  he  made	 the
application. He	 did not  blindly quote	 from the Government
letter No.  M/26-81 J.	dated 25th  February,  1981  (quoted
above) which contained only one ground namely, "inexpediency
of prosecution	for reasons  of State  and public policy". A
comparison of  the contents of this letter with the contents
of the	application under <a href="/doc/1542359/" id="a_206">section 321</a> of the Code completely
negatives the  appellant's contention  that Shri  L.P. Sinha
did not himself apply his mind independently to the facts of
the  case   and	 that	he  blindly   acted  on	  extraneous
considerations.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">123</span>
<p id="p_105">     As a proof of non-application of the mind of the Public

has considered all the earlier decisions, and summarised the
observations as under :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_84">     "Thus from the precedents of this Court; we gather,
	  (1)  Under the  Scheme of  the Code prosecution of
	       an  offender   for  a   serious	offence	  is
	       primarily   the	  responsibility   of	 the
	       Executive.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_85">	  (2)  The withdrawal  from the	 prosecution  is  an
	       executive function of the Public Prosecutor.
	  (3)  The   discretion	  to   withdraw	  from	 the
	       prosecution is  that of the Public Prosecutor
	       and none else, and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">124</span>
	       so, he  cannot surrender	 that discretion  to
	       someone else.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_86">	  (4)  The Government  may  suggest  to	 the  Public
	       Prosecutor that	he  may	 withdraw  from	 the
	       prosecution but none can compel him to do so.
	  (5)  The Public  Prosecutor may  withdraw from the
	       prosecution  not	 merely	 on  the  ground  of
	       paucity of  evidence but	 on  other  relevant
	       grounds as well in order to further the broad
	       ends of	public	justice,  public  order	 and
	       peace. The  broad ends of public justice will
	       certainly   include    appropriate    social,
	       economic and  we add, political purposes Sans
	       Tammany Hall enterprise.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_87">	  (6)  The Public  Prosecutor is  an officer  of the
	       Court and responsible to the Court.
	  (7)  The Court  performs a supervisory function in
	       granting its consent to the withdrawal.
	  (8)  The Court's  duty is  not to reappreciate the
	       grounds which  led the  Public Prosecutor  to
	       request withdrawal  from the  prosecution but
	       to consider  whether  the  Public  Prosecutor
	       applied	 his   mind   as   a   free   agent,
	       uninfluenced  by	 irrelevant  and  extraneous
	       considerations. The  Court has a special duty
	       in  this	  regard  as   it  is  the  ultimate
	       repository  of	legislative  confidence	  in
	       granting	 or   withholding  its	 consent  to
	       withdraw	 from  the  prosecution".  (emphasis
	       added).
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_88">     The Court in the above decision has also observed :
	  "Wherever issues involve the emotions and there is
     a surcharge  of violence in the atmosphere it has often
     been found	 necessary to  withdraw from prosecutions in
     order to  restore peace to free the atmosphere from the
     surcharge	of  violence,  to  bring  about	 a  peaceful
     settlement of issues and to preserve the calm which may
     follow the	 storm. To  persist with  prosecutions where
     emotive issues  are involved in the name of vindicating
     the law  may  even	 be  utterly  counterproductive.  An
     elected Government, sensitive and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">125</span>
     responsive to  the feelings and emotions of the people,
     will be  amply justified if for the purpose of creating
     an atmosphere  of goodwill	 or for	 the purpose  of not
     disturbing a calm which has descended it decides not to
     prosecute the  offenders involved	or  not	 to  proceed
     further with  prosecutions already	 launched.  In	such
     matters who  but the  Government, can and should decide
     in the  first instance, whether it should be baneful or
     beneficial to  launch or  continue prosecutions. If the
     Government decides	 that it  would	 be  in	 the  public
     interest to  withdraw  from  prosecutions	how  is	 the
     Government to go about this task".
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_89">     The Court further observed :
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_90">	  "But where  such large  and  sensitive  issues  of
     public policy  are	 involved,  he	(Public	 Prosecutor)
     must, if  he is  right minded, seek advice and guidance
     from the  policymakers. His  sources of information and
     resources are  of a very limited nature unlike those of
     the policy-makers. If the policy-makers themselves move
     in the  matter in	the first  instance, as indeed it is
     proper that  they should  where  matters  of  momentous
     public policy  are involved,  and if  they	 advise	 the
     Public Prosecutor	to withdraw from the prosecution, it
     is not  for the  Court to	say that the initiative came
     from the Government and therefore the Public Prosecutor
     cannot be	said to	 have exercised a free mind. Nor can
     there be any quibbling over words". (emphasis added).</blockquote>
<p id="p_109">     This decision  is a  complete answer  to the contention
raised by  learned counsel  of the  appellant that a triable
case cannot be withdrawn. Paucity of evidence is only one of
the grounds of withdrawal.
</p><p id="p_110">     22. Faced	with this decision learned counsel submitted
that the  case in  hand was  a	case  involving	 common	 law
offences while	George Fernandes  case (supra)	was  dealing
with political	offences, which	 offences only, according to
counsel, can  be permitted to be withdrawn from prosecution.
We are unable to accept the submission. (<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_216">Section 321</a> has not
dichotomised  into   common  law   offences  and   political
offences. The  Court held  in George Fernandes case (supra),
with respect  rightly, "to  say that  an  offence  is  of  a
political character is not to absolve the offenders of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">126</span>
the offence.  But the  question is, is it a valid ground for
the Government	to advise  the Public Prosecutor to withdraw
from the  prosecution". (emphasis  added). The reason of the
absence of  any dichotomy in <a href="/doc/1542359/" id="a_217">section 321</a> of the Code appears
to us  to be  the very	object of  the section.	 What is the
necessity of this section. An offence is an offence. A trial
will end  in conviction	 or acquittal of the accused. If the
offence is  compoundable, it  may be  compounded. But if the
offence	 is  not  compoundable,	 why  should  the  trial  be
withdrawn ?  How are offences under <a href="/doc/1949191/" id="a_218">sections 121-A</a>, <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_219">120-B</a> of
the Penal  Code, and  <a href="/doc/895566/" id="a_220">sections 4</a>,  <a href="/doc/1335368/" id="a_221">5</a> and  <a href="/doc/1539301/" id="a_222">6</a> of the Explosive
Substances Act,	 1908 and  <a href="/doc/733048/" id="a_223">sections 5(3)</a>  (b) and  12 of the
<a href="/doc/176528/" id="a_224">Indian Explosives  Act</a>, 1884  (as in George Fernande's case)
less	heinous	    than     offences	  under	    <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_225">sections
420</a>/<a href="/doc/1053937/" id="a_226">466</a>/<a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_227">471</a>/<a href="/doc/513074/" id="a_228">109</a>/<a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_229">120B</a> of	 the Penal  Code and  5(1) (a), 5(1)
</p><p id="p_111">(b) and	 5(1) (d) of the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_230">Prevention of Corruption Act</a> (as in
this case) ? Are offences relating to security of State less
serious than  corruption ?  In our  view, the answers are in
the negative. The reverse appears to be truer.
</p><p id="p_112">     In our  opinion, the  object of  <a href="/doc/1037589/" id="a_231">section 321</a>  Cr.	P.C.
appears to  be to  reserve power to the Executive Government
to withdraw  any criminal  case on  larger grounds of public
policy such  as inexpediency  of prosecutions for reasons of
State; broader	public interest	 like maintenance of law and
order; maintenance  of public  peace  and  harmony,  social,
economic  and	political;  changed   social  and  political
situation;  avoidance	of  destabilization   of  a   stable
Government and	the like.  And such powers have been, in our
opinion, rightly  reserved for	the Government; for, who but
the Government	is  in	the  know  of  such  conditions	 and
situations prevailing  in a  State or  in the  country ? The
Court is not in a position to know such situations.
</p><p id="p_113">     23. In  George Fernandes, case (supra), the allegations
against	 Shri  George  Fernandes,  who	later  on  became  a
Minister of  the Union	Government during the Janata regime,
where that  after the  proclamation of Emergency on June 25,
1975, Shri George Fernandes, Chairman of the Socialist Party
of India,  and Chairman	 Railwaymen's Federation,  sought to
arouse	resistence   against  the   said  Emergency  and  to
overthrow the  Government and that he committed various acts
in  pursuance  of  that	 object.  The  investigating  agency
submitted a  charge sheet against Shri Fernandes and twenty-
four others  for offences  under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_232">section 121-A</a>, <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_233">120-B</a>,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_234"> Penal

Indian Explosives
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">127</span>
Act, 1884.  Two of  the accused	 persons had  been  tendered
pardon. They  had, therefore, to be examined as witnesses in
the  Court  of	the  Magistrate	 taking	 cognizance  of	 the
offences  notwithstanding   the	 fact	that  the  case	 was
exclusively triable  by the  Court of Sessions. The evidence
of the	approver was recorded on March 22, 1977 and the case
was adjourned  to March 26, 1977 for further proceedings. At
that stage,  on March  26, 1977,  Shri N.S.  Mathur, Special
Public Prosecutor  filed an application under <a href="/doc/1542359/" id="a_239">section 321</a> of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">128</span>
<p id="p_115">     It is  seen that  the only	 ground for  withdrawal	 was
"public interest  and changed circumstances" as mentioned in
para 4 of the petition.
</p><p id="p_116">     The Chief	Metropolitan Magistrate	 granted his consent
for withdrawal	from the  prosecution on  the ground that it
was 'expedient	to  accord  consent  to	 withdraw  from	 the
prosecution", (emphasis	 added). In revision, the High Court
affirmed the Magistrate's order. The appeal by Special Leave
was dismissed  by this Court. In other words, an application
stating Government's  desire to withdraw from prosecution on
the grounds of 'public interest' and 'changed circumstances'
was held to be valid under <a href="/doc/1037589/" id="a_247">section 321</a> Cr. P.C.
</p><p id="p_117">     24. The  next question  for examination  is whether the
permission was	given by  the Special  Judge in violation of
law as	laid down  by this  Court in  this regard.  We	have
already referred  to the  decisions cited  by the appellant.
The law	 laid down  by this Court in the series of decisions
referred to  above, inter  alia, is  (1) that the withdrawal
from the  prosecution is an executive function of the Public
Prosecutor and	that the  ultimate decision to withdraw from
the prosecution	 is his; (2) that the Government may suggest
to the	public prosecutor  that a particular case may not be
proceeded with,	 but nobody  can compel	 him to	 do so ; (3)
that not  merely inadequacy  of evidence, but other relevant
grounds such as to further the broad ends of public justice,
economic and  political; public	 order and  peace are  valid
grounds for  withdrawal. The exercise of the power to accord
or withdraw  consent  by  the  Court  is  discretionary.  Of
course, it  has to  exercise the  discretion judicially. The
exercise of the power of the Court is judicial to the extent
that the Court, in according or refusing consent, has to see
</p><p id="p_118">(i) whether  the grounds  of withdrawal	 are valid; and (ii)
whether the application is bona fide or is collusive. It may
be remembered  that the	 order passed  by  the	Court  under
<a href="/doc/1542359/" id="a_248">section 321</a>  of the  Code, either  according or	 refusing to
accord consent,	 is not	 appealable. A	mere perusal  of the
impugned order	of the	Special	 Judge	shows  that  he	 has
applied his  mind to  the facts of the case and also applied
his mind  to the  law laid  down by  this  Court  in  Geroge
Fernandes case	that has  summarised the  entire law  on the
point, and correctly applied them to the facts of this case.
It is  therefore not correct to say that the decision of the
Special Judge  was contrary  to the  law laid  down by	this
Court.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">129</span>
<p id="p_119">     25. The  only other submission of the appellant is that
there is  a prima  facie case for trial by the Special Judge
and that this Court should send it back to him for trial. We
have held  above that  a criminal  proceeding with  a  prima
facie case  may	 also  be  withdrawn.  Besides,	 the  normal
practice of this Court in a criminal appeal by Special Leave
under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_249">Article  136</a> of  the Constitution	 directed against an
order of conviction or acquittal is that this Court does not
peruse the  evidence on	 record and re-appreciate it to find
whether findings  of facts  recorded by the Courts below are
correct or  erroneous, far  less does  it peruse  the Police
Diary to  see whether  adequate materials  were collected by
the investigating  agency. It  accepts the  findings of	 the
Courts below  unless it	 is shown  that the findings are the
results of  a wrong application of the principles of the law
and  that   the	 impugned   order  has	 resulted  in  grave
miscarriage of justice.
</p><p id="p_120">     26. An  order under  <a href="/doc/1542359/" id="a_250">section 321</a>  of the  Code, in	 our
opinion, does  not have	 the same  status  as  an  order  of
conviction or  acquittal recorded  by a	 trial or  appellate
Court in  a criminal prosecution, inasmuch as the former has
not been  made appealable. An order under <a href="/doc/1542359/" id="a_251">section 321</a> of the
Code has  a narrower scope. As an order under <a href="/doc/1542359/" id="a_252">section 321</a> of
the Code  recorded by  the trial  Court is judicial what the
trial Court  is expected  to  do  is  to  give	reasons	 for
according or  refusing its  consent to	the  withdrawal.  As
stated above,  the duty	 of the	 Court is  to see  that	 the
grounds of  withdrawal are legally valid and the application
made by	 the Public  Prosecutor is  bona  fide	and  is	 not
collusive. In  revision of an order under <a href="/doc/1542359/" id="a_253">section 321</a> of the
Code, the  duty of  the	 High  Court  is  to  see  that	 the
consideration by  the trial  Court of  the application under
<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_254">section 321</a>  was not  misdirected and  that the	 grounds  of
withdrawal are	legally valid. In this case, the trial Court
elaborately considered	the grounds  of withdrawal and found
them to	 be valid  and accordingly  accorded its consent for
withdrawal. In revision the High Court affirmed the findings
of the trial Court.
</p><p id="p_121">     We find  no justification	in this	 appeal	 by  Special
Leave to disturb the findings of the Courts below and peruse
the statements	of witnesses  recorded	or  other  materials
collected by the investigating officers during the course of
investigation.
</p><p id="p_122">     27. Although  it does not arise out of the three points
formulated by  Mr. Venugopal  at the  start of his argument,
nor does it arise
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">130</span>
out of the appellant's petition opposing withdrawal, learned
counsel submitted  that there  was a  prima facie  case	 for
trial by  the Special  Judge and the case should be remanded
to him	for trial. Let us examine that aspect also as it has
been argued at length.
</p><p id="p_123">     Learned counsel  fairly concedes  that he does not take
much reliance  on oral evidence but takes strong reliance on
two pieces of documentary evidence, namely, alleged creation
of forged  documents by	 Dr.  Mishra  and  the	confessional
statement of Haidari implicating Dr. Mishra.
</p><p id="p_124">     Elaborate arguments were advanced by learned counsel of
the parties  on the  piece of  documentary  evidence  which,
according to the appellant's counsel would form the basis of
conviction of  Respondent No.  2. That	documentary evidence
was that  Respondent No. 2 as Chief Minister passed an order
on 16-5-1975  in Hindi.	 English translation  of this  order
reads as follows :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_98">	  "Much time  has passed. On perusal of the file, it
     appears that  there is  no	 allegation  of	 defalcation
     against the  Chairman and	the Members  of the Board of
     the Bank.	Stern action should be taken for realisation
     of loans from the loanees and if there are difficulties
     in realisation  from the loanees, surcharge proceedings
     should be initiated against the Board of Directors. The
     normal condition  be restored in the Bank after calling
     the Annual General Meeting and holding the elections."</blockquote>
<p id="p_125">     According to  the appellant, Respondent No. 2 wrote the
following fresh order -
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_99">	  "Please issue	 orders	 for  restoring	 the  normal
     condition in  the Bank  after  holding  Annual  General
     Meeting.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_100">					Sd/- Jaganath Mishra
					       14-5-75"
</blockquote><p id="p_126">and pasted it over the earlier order.
</p><p id="p_127">     According	to   the  appellant,  Respondent  No.  2  by
overwriting '4'	 (in (Hindi) on the original Hindi digit '6'
changed the  date 16-5-1975  to 14-5-1975.  These facts have
not been denied by Respondent No. 2 before us.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">131</span>
<p id="p_128">     The appellant's submission was that by the above act of
antedating  by	over-writing.  Respondent  No.	2  committed
forgery, and  by pasting over the earlier order committed an
offence under  <a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_255">section	5</a>  (1)	(d)  of	 the  <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_256">Prevention  of
Corruption Act</a>	as by  that latter act he obtained pecuniary
advantage  to  Shri  Nawal  Kishore  Respondent	 No.  3,  by
stopping the surcharge proceedings.
</p><p id="p_129">     28. Before	 proceeding  further,  it  is  pertinent  to
mention that  in his  application before  the Special Judge,
the appellant  did not find fault with any of the grounds of
withdrawal in the application filed by the Public Prosecutor
under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_257">section  321</a>. His	 only contention was that an attempt
was being  made by the Public Prosecutor to scuttle the case
and that  the Court should apply its independent mind before
according consent  to the  withdrawal and  that he should be
heard in  the matter.  He made	no mention of any forgery by
antedating or  by pasting  of any  earlier order and thereby
making any  attempt at	shielding of  any culprit.  He thus,
prevented the  Special Judge  and the High Court from giving
any finding on alleged forgery on the allegations of pasting
and antedating	and  thereby  depriving	 us  also  from	 the
benefits of such findings of the Courts below. This question
of fact	 has now  been sought to be brought to the notice of
this Court  during the course of argument by learned counsel
of the	appellant in  this appeal.  A question	of fact that
needs investigation  cannot be	allowed to be raised for the
first time  in an  appeal by Special Leave under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_258">Article 136</a>
of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_130">     29. Be  that as  it may, let us examine the contention.
But this  will not  be treated	as a  precedent. The  pasted
order containing the following:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_101">     (i)   The Chief  Minister's finding  that there  was no
	  allegation of defalcation against the Chairman and
	  Members of the Board;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_102">     (ii) Direction  to take stern action for realisation of
	  the loans from the loanees;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_103">     (iii)Directions to	 initiate surcharge  proceedings  in
	  case of difficulties in realisation;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_104">     (iv) Direction  to call  the annual  General Meeting of
	  the Bank and hold election in order to restore the
	  normal condition of the Bank.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">132</span>
<p id="p_131">Only the  portions against  (i), (ii)  and (iii)  above have
been covered  by pasting  the fresh  order which is but (iv)
above. The  appellant's submission  is that  by covering the
first three directions, Respondent No. 2 shielded Respondent
No. 3  and others  from realizing  the due from the culprits
including Respondent  No. 3  or	 from  initiating  surcharge
proceedings against  them. The	answer to  the contention is
three-fold:
</p><p id="p_132">     (i) The  order of	surcharge by  the Chief	 Minister is
unwarranted by	law. <a href="/doc/73844564/" id="a_259">Section  40</a> of  the  Bihar	 Cooperative
Societies Act,	1935 gives  power only	to the	Registrar to
initiate surcharge  proceedings. An  appeal  lies  from	 his
order to  the State  Government	 under	sub-section  (3)  of
<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_260">section	 40</a>.   In  fact,   admittedly  Deputy  Registrar  of
Cooperative Societies  issued notices  of surcharge  against
Respondent No. 3 on 31-12-1975 when Respondent No. 2 himself
was the	 Chief Minister).  If the  Chief Minister found that
his first  order was  unwarranted by  Law, it  was but right
that he cancelled his first order
</p><p id="p_133">     (ii) On  a second	thought any  authority may bona fide
change his  mind and  decide that  restoration of the normal
condition of  the Bank by calling the annual General Meeting
and election  should be attended to first and realization of
the loans and surcharge proceedings later. Bona fide scoring
out the	 order retaining  the last part, would constitute no
offence by  Respondent No. 2. Pasting an order by a piece of
paper  containing   another  order   prima   facie   appears
suspicious, but	 pasting is the common practice in the Chief
Minister's Secretariate	 as revealed  by the  file  produced
before us.
</p><p id="p_134">     (iii)  Antedating	 simpliciter  is   no  offence.	 Mr.
Venugopal advanced  an argument	 on the	 possible motive  of
antedating and	submitted that	the motive was to obliterate
any possible  action on	 the first  order, The submission is
highly speculative and cannot be accepted.
</p><p id="p_135">     In any  view, if  two interpretations are possible, one
indicating  criminal   intention  and  the  other  innocent,
needless to  say that  the interpretation  beneficial to the
accused must be accepted.
</p><p id="p_136">     30. Confessional Statement of Haidari
     As stated above, there was another vigilance case known
as Kadam  Quan P.S.  Case No.  97 (5)  J7  relating  to	 the
officers of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">133</span>
Bank. It  was being  investigated by  the  Officers  of	 the
Cooperative   Department but  abruptly it was transferred to
the Vigilance Department on 16-1-1978. In this case Haidari,
aforesaid, was	one of	the accused.  He was also one of the
accused in  the case  in hand,	but later  on, on  grant  of
pardon, he  turned an  approver	 and  became  a	 prosecution
witness. He was also being prosecuted in several other cases
on the	basis of  orders passed	 by Respondent No. 2 on 4-8-
1976. In  the Kadam  Kuan case,	 Haidari made a confessional
statement on  4-11-1976 but did not implicate Respondent No.
</p><p id="p_137">2. He  was re-arrested	on 22-1-1978  whereafter he  made  a
second	confessional   statement  on  24-1-1978,  this	time
implicating Respondent	No. 2  for the	first time  for	 the
alleged offence	 said to  have been  committed in  the years
1973 75.  As the Kadam Kuan case also related to the affairs
of the	Bank and  Haidari had  already made  a	confessional
statement, there  was no  need for  him	 to  make  a  second
confessional statement	on 24-1-1978.  It may  be remembered
that on	 that date,  Vigilance Case No. 9 (2) 78 had not yet
been registered	 and Haidari was not an accused in this case
and therefore  it  cannot  be  said  that  the	confessional
statement on  which great  reliance has	 been placed  by the
appellant was  a confessional  statement made by an accused.
This case  was registered at the Vigilance Police Station in
the morning  on	 1-2-1978  and,	 therefore,  to	 give  legal
validity to the confessional statement it was shown recorded
in  Kadam  Kuan	 case  No.  97	(5)  77.  This	confessional
statement is said to be the second confessional statement of
Haidari in  the same  Kadam Kuan  case. Haidari's  so-called
confessional  statement	  therefore  is	  not  only   not  a
confessional statement	of a  co-accused but  it inspires no
confidence. On	the top	 of it,	 it was	 the statement of an
accomplice turned approver, and is worthless.
</p><p id="p_138">     31. The submission of the respondents that the criminal
case against  Respondent No.  1 is  the result	of political
vendetta has also to be considered.
</p><p id="p_139">     (i)  The	first  circumstance   pointed  out   by	 the
respondents in this regard is the unusual hurry in which the
file was moved. It has been stated in the affidavit filed on
behalf of the State of Bihar by Shri Bidhu Shekhar Banerjee,
Deputy	 Superintendent	  of   Police,	 Cabinet   Vigilance
Department, that within the period of four days
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">134</span>
the inquiries  were completed,	advice obtained	 and  orders
passed for instituting the case as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_105">	  "(i) The  Kadamkuan P.S.  Case No.  97 (5)  77 was
     transferred to  Vigilance Department  by an order dated

<p id="p_140">     (ii)  The	 second	 circumstance  pointed	out  is	 the
political bitterness  between  Respondent  No.	2  and	Shri
Karpoori Thakur.  From the  facts narrated at the beginning,
it is  seen that  there was  animosity between the appellant
and Shri  Karpoori Thakur,  the former Chief Minister of the
Janata Government on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">135</span>
the one	 hand and  Respondent No. 2. Dr. Mishra, the present
Congress (I) Chief Minister of Bihar, on the other.
</p><p id="p_141">     It has  been stated that Respondent No. 2 is one of the
prominent leaders of the Congress Party that was politically
opposed to  the	 Janata	 Party	Government  headed  by	Shri
Karpoori Thakur	 at the time of the institution of the case.
In  1977   when	 Respondent   No.  2   headed  the  Congress
Government, a  warrant of  arrest was  issued  against	Shri
Karpoori Thakur	 for  his  arrest  and	detention,  for	 his
alleged anti-Government	 activities and that Karpoori Thakur
was absconding	for long.  It has  been suggested  that Shri
Karpoori Thakur was nursing grudge against Respondent No. 2.
The suggestion appears to have substance. Shri D.P. Ojha was
a Superintendent  of Police  in Bihar. It has been stated in
the counter-affidavit  filed by	 Respondent No.	 4  that  he
(Ojha) has  been indicted  by Justice  Mathew in  his report
submitted on  9.5.1975 relating	 to the	 murder of Shri L.N.
Mishra, brother	 of Respondent	No. 5. Justice method in his
report held:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_116">	  "The direct  responsibility  for  making  security
     arrangements  under  the  security	 instructions  dated
     13-9-1971 issued  by the  Central Government devolve on
     the head of the Police (Shri D.P. Ojha). The Commission
     finds that	 the S.P. Samastipur failed to discharge the
     duty  enjoined   upon  him	 by  the  instruction  dated
     13.9.1971 issued  by the  Central Government.  The S.P.
     Samastipur was  guilty of	derelication of duty in this
     respect. The officer who failed to discharge their duty
     or were  negligent of  the performance of same could be
     directly responsible  to the  State Government  and the
     State  Government	 to  be	  the  agency	for   taking
     appropriate action against them."</blockquote>
<p id="p_142">     It	 has  been  stated  in	affidavit  that	 the  Janata
Government at  the Centre  had accepted the said findings of
the Mathew Commission. But the Government of Bihar headed by
Shri Karpoori  Thakur, not  only exonerated  Shri D.P. Ojha,
but transferred	 him to the Vigilance Department and all the
cases relating	to the	Patna Co-operative Bank (the bank in
question) were	transferred to	the Vigilance  Department in
charge of  Ojha. The  Respondent's allegations	are that not
only  Chief  Minister  Shri  Karpoori  Thakur  had  his	 own
political animosity  against Dr. Mishra but Shri Ojha had to
work under  the influence of the Chief Minister. It has been
suggested that he has been instrumental in directing the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">136</span>
investigation in such a way that a case was made out against
Dr. Mishra  and others	by collecting  false  evidence.	 The
suggestion cannot be ruled out as frivolous or unreasonable.
Shri Karpoori  Thakur, the  then Chief	Minister ignored the
wholesome  suggestion  of  the	then  Union  Home  Minister,
Chaudhury Charan  Singh, that a former Chief Minister, could
be proceeded  against only  after obtaining clearance of the
Prime Minister	according to<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_261"> the Code</a> of Conduct of 1964. He
also ignored  the suggestion  in this  regard of  Shri	D.N.
Sahay that  before proceeding  against an  ex-Chief Minister
clearance from	the Prime Minister and the Home Minister was
necessary. He also ignored the suggestion of Shri D.N. Sahay
that no Vigilance Enquiry was necessary as there was already
a Commission  of Enquiry  into the Bank matter, and directed
the  investigation.  This  shows  active  interest  of	Shri
Karpoori Thakur in the prosecution of Respondent No. 2.
</p><p id="p_143">     (iii)  The	 third	circumstance  pointed  out  is	that
although Respondent  No. 4  has been  made  an	accused,  no
allegation against him has been pointed out.
</p><p id="p_144">     32. It is common place that the prosecution is to prove
the guilt  of the  accused beyond  reasonable doubt and that
the accused  need not  prove  beyond  reasonable  doubt	 his
defence, if  any. If the defence is probable and reasonable,
and its considerations creates doubt in the creditability of
the prosecution	 case, the  accused will get the benefit and
shall have  to be acquitted. In the instant case, as we have
observed, the  entire investigation has been vitiated and no
person can be convicted on the basis of evidence procured by
such investigation.
</p><p id="p_145">     33. The  following circumstances  also need to be taken
into account  in considering whether the case merits sending
back to	 the Special  Judge for	 trial as  proposed  by	 the
appellant, assuming  and only  assuming, there	is  a  prime
facie case for trial:
</p><p id="p_146">     (i) The  occurrence took  place as early as 1970; it is
already more than twelve years.
</p><p id="p_147">     (ii) Respondent  No. 2  is the  Chief Minister  in	 his
office. Knowing	 human nature,	as it  is, it  can hardly be
expected that  the witnesses,  most of	whom are  officials,
will come forward and depose against a Chief Minister.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">137</span>
<p id="p_148">     (iii) Even after the assumption of office by Respondent
No. 2 the Chief Minister, in the Court of the Special Judge,
the prosecution	 was pending on several dates but the Public
Prosecutor, Shri  A.K. Datta,  did not	take any interest in
the case  at all.  It  cannot  be  expected  that  a  Public
Prosecutor appointed  by the  Government in  power, will now
take  interest	 and  conduct  the  case  so  as  to  secure
conviction of  his own	Chief Minister. Remand for trial, if
made, will  be a  mere exercise	 in futility; and it will be
nothing but  an abuse  of the process of the Court to remand
the case to the trial Court.
</p><p id="p_149">     34. As  a result  of  the	foregoing  discussions,	 the
appeal is dismissed.
</p><p id="p_150">     MISRA,  J.	  I  have  the	privilege  of  perusing	 the
differing judgments  of	 brothers  Tulzapurkar	and  Baharul
Islam JJ.  While I  respectfully  agree	 with  some  of	 the
findings  reached   by	brother	 Tulzapurkar,  I  regret  my
inability to concur with some of the findings. I, therefore,
propose to give my own reasons for the same.
</p><p id="p_151">     The present  appeal by  special leave is a sequel to an

</p><p id="p_152">     In order  to appreciate  the contention  raised by	 the
counsel for  the parties it is essential to read the grounds
taken in the application. Para 2 of the application reads:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_117">	  "That since  the prosecution	of the case involves
     the  question   of	 momentous   public  policy  of	 the
     Government, which	may have  its consequences  of	wide
     magnitude affecting  the large issue of public interest
     also, the desirability
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">138</span>
     of the  continuance  of  the  prosecution	was  broadly
     examined both  by the  State Government and also by me.
     Keeping in	 view (a)  lack of  prospect  of  successful
     prosecution  in   the  light   of	evidence,   (b)	 the
     implication of the persons as a result of political and
     personal  vendetta,   (c)	the   inexpediency  of	 the
     prosecution for  the reasons  of the  State and  public
     policy, (d)  the adverse  effects that the continuation
     of the prosecution will bring on public interest in the
     light of  the changed  situation, and  after giving  my
     anxious considerations and full deliberations, I beg to
     file this	application to withdraw from the prosecution
     of all the persons involved in the aforesaid case."
</blockquote><p id="p_153">Para 3 of the application states:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_118">	  "That I have therefore gone through the case diary
     and the  relevant materials connected with the case and
     have come	to the	conclusion that in the circumstances
     prevailing at  the time  of institution of the case and
     the investigation thereof, it appears that the case was
     instituted on the ground of political vendetta and only
     to defame	the fair  image of  Dr. J.N. Mishra, who was
     then the  leader of  the  opposition  and	one  of	 the
     acknowledged leaders  of  the  Congress  Party  in	 the
     country. The  prosecution was  not launched in order to

<p id="p_155">     The application  was opposed on a variety of grounds by
the appellant,	which I shall deal with in the later part of
the judgment in detail.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">139</span>
<p id="p_156">     The application  was, however,  allowed  by  the  Chief
Judicial  Magistrate-cum-Special   Judge  Vigilance  and  he
accorded his  consent by his speaking order dated 20th June,
1981.
</p><p id="p_157">     The appellant  took up  the matter	 in revision  to the
High Court  which also	confirmed the  order  of  the  trial
court. The  appellant has  now come to this Court by special
leave. The grounds taken on behalf of the appellant are four
fold:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_120">     1.	  (a) For  the purposes	 of<a href="/doc/1542359/" id="a_269"> s. 321</a> of the Code there
	  exists a  dichotomy between political offences and
	  offences under common law. While the former can be
	  withdrawn on	grounds	 of  public  policy,  public
	  interest or  reasons of state even though there is
	  certainty of	obtaining a  conviction, no question
	  of public  policy, public  interest or  reasons of
	  State could  every arise  in a  prosecution for  a
	  Common Law  offence or a common case of bribery or
	  forgery.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_121">	  (b)  Similarly,   no	question   of  political  or
	  personal vendetta  would arise in a case where the
	  proof	 of   the  offence  is	based  primarily  on
	  documents, the  genuineness of  which	 is  not  in

<p id="p_158">     Before dealing  with the points raised on behalf of the
appellant it is appropriate at this stage to know the nature
and scope of<a href="/doc/1542359/" id="a_276"> s. 321</a> of the Code.
</p><p id="p_159">     A bare  perusal of	 the section  shows that it does not
prescribe any  ground nor  does it put any embargo or fetter
on the	power of  the Public  Prosecutor  to  withdraw	from
prosecuting a particular criminal case pending in any court.
All that  it requires  is that	he can	do so  only with the
consent of  the court  where the case is pending. This Court
has, however,  laid down  certain guiding principles for the
exercise of  the power	of withdrawal  under this section by
the Public  Prosecutor or by the court according its consent
to such	 withdrawal. It	 is in the light of those guidelines
that the  propriety or	the legality  of the  withdrawal  of
criminal proceeding has to be judged.
</p><p id="p_160">     In this  country the  scheme of criminal justice places
the prime  responsibility of prosecuting serious offences on
the executive  authority. The  investigations, collection of
requisite evidence and the prosecution for the offences with
reference  to	such  evidence	are  the  functions  of	 the
executive. The	function of  the court	in this respect is a
limited one  and intended  only to  prevent the	 abuse.	 The
function of the court in according its consent to withdrawal
is, however,  a judicial  function. It,	 therefore,  becomes
necessary for  the court  before whom  the  application	 for
withdrawal is  filed by	 the Public  Prosecutor to apply its
mind  so  that	the  appellate	court  may  examine  and  be
satisfied that	the court  has not accorded its consent as a
matter of  course but  has applied  its mind  to the grounds
taken  in   the	 application   for  withdrawal	 by   Public
Prosecutor.
</p><p id="p_161">     The  guiding   principles	laid  down  by	the  various
decisions of  this Court may now be referred to. <a href="/doc/726197/" id="a_277">In State of
Bihar v.  Ram Naresh Pande</a>(1) this Court had the occasion to

     clear that,  what the  Court has  to determine, for the
     exercise of  its discretion  in granting or withholding

<p id="p_162">     Again in  <a href="/doc/1519960/" id="a_284">M.N.S. Nair v. P.V. Balkrishnan</a>(1) this Court
after reviewing	 various cases	from different	High  Courts
laid down the following guidelines:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_126">	  "Though the  section is  in general terms and does
     not circumscribe the powers of the Public Prosecutor to
     seek permission  to withdraw  from the  prosecution the
     essential consideration  which is implicit in the grant
     of the  power is  that it	should be in the interest of
     administration of	justice which  may be either that it
     will not  be able	to produce  sufficient	evidence  to
     sustain  the  charge  or  that  subsequent	 information
     before prosecuting agency would falsify the prosecution
     evidence or any other similar circumstances which it is
     difficult to  predicate as	 they are dependent entirely
     on	 the   facts  and   circumstances  of	each   case.
     Nonetheless it is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_70">142</span>
     the duty  of the  Court also  to see  in furtherance of
     justice that  the permission  is not  sought on grounds
     extraneous to  the interest of justice or that offences
     which are	offences against  the  State  go  unpunished
     merely because  the Government  as a  matter of general
     policy of	expediency  unconnected	 with  its  duty  to
     prosecute offenders  under the  law, directs the Public
     Prosecutor to  withdraw from  the prosecution  and	 the
     Public Prosecutor merely does so at its behest."
     "It appears  to us	 that the  wide and  general  powers
     which are	conferred  under  Sec.	494  on	 the  Public
     Prosecutor to withdraw from the prosecution though they
     are subject  to the  permission of the Court have to be
     exercised	by   him  in   relation	 to  the  facts	 and
     circumstances of  that case  in furtherance  of, rather
     than as  a hindrance  to the  object  of  the  law	 and
     justified	on   the  material   in	  the	case   which
     substantiate the  grounds alleged, not necessarily from
     those gathered  by the  judicial method  but  on  other
     materials	which  may  not	 be  strictly  on  legal  or
     admissible evidence.  The Court  also while considering
     the request  to grant permission under the said Section
     should not	 do so as a necessary formality-the grant of
     it for  the mere  asking. It  may do  so only  if it is
     satisfied on  the materials  placed before	 it that the
     grant of it subserves the administration of justice and
     that permission  was not  being sought covertly with an
     ulterior purpose  unconnected with	 the vindication  of
     the law which the executive organs are in duty bound to
     further and maintain."

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_128">     "The ultimate  guiding consideration must always be the

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_132">     "1.  Under the  scheme<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_288"> of	the Code</a>  prosecution of  an
	  offender for	a serious  offence is  primarily the

	  extraneous considerations. The Court has a special
	  duty	in   this  regard  as  it  is  the  ultimate
	  repository of	 legislative confidence	 in granting
	  or withholding  its consent to withdrawal from the
	  prosecution."</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_140">     In view  of the  principles laid  down in the aforesaid
cases, I  have to  examine whether  the grounds taken by the
appellant are tenable.</blockquote>
<p id="p_163">     I take  up the  first ground  raised on  behalf of	 the
appellant that	for the	 purpose of <a href="/doc/1037589/" id="a_289"> s. 321</a>  Cr. P.C.  there
exists dichotomy between the political offences and offences
at Common  Law and while political offences can be withdrawn
on grounds of public policy, public interest, or for reasons
of the	State, even though there is certainty of obtaining a
conviction, no	such consideration  could ever	arise  in  a
prosecution for	 a Common  Law offence	or a  common case of
bribery or forgery.
</p><p id="p_164">     This argument  proceeds on	 the assumption	 that in the
cases cited  above, permission	was granted  only  in  cases
relating to  political	offences  and  not  with  regard  to
offences at Common Law. I am afraid, this will not be a fair
reading	 of  the  decisions  mentioned	above.	One  of	 the
principles laid	 down in  the aforesaid	 cases is  that	 the
Public Prosecutor may withdraw from the prosecution not only
on the	ground of  paucity of evidence but on other relevant
grounds as  well in  order to further broad aims of justice,
public order  and peace.  Broad aims  of public justice will
certainly include appropriate social, economic and political
purposes. In
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_73">145</span>
M.N.S. Nair's  case (supra)  this  Court  after	 enumerating
certain grounds further observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_141">	  ".any other  similar	circumstances  which  it  is
     difficult to  predicate as	 they are dependent entirely
     on the facts and circumstances of each case."
</blockquote><p id="p_165">Likewise in  C. Mohapatra's  case (supra)  this Court  again
observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_142">	  "No hard  and fast  rule can	be laid down nor can
     any categories  of cases  be defined  in which  consent
     should be granted or refused."
</blockquote><p id="p_166">In face of these observations it will be difficult to accept
the contention	that  withdrawal  from	prosecution  can  be
permitted only	in political  offences and not in Common Law
offences. In  the past	there have  been cases	where crimes
motivated  by	political  ambitions  or  considerations  or
committed  during   mass  agitations,	communal   frenzies,
regional disputes,  industrial conflicts,  student unrest or
the like  situations involving emotive issues giving rise to
an atmosphere  surcharged with violence, have been permitted
to be  withdrawn in  the interest of public order and peace.
But on	that account  it will  not be  correct to  say	that
permission to withdraw can be granted by the Court only when
offences as enumerated above are involved. <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_290">Section 321</a> is in
very wide  terms and in view of the decisions cited above it
will not  be possible  to con  fine grounds only to offences
which may  be  termed  as  political  offences	or  offences
involving emotive  issues. To  interpret the  section in the
way as	desired by the counsel for the appellant will amount
to re-writing  <a href="/doc/1542359/" id="a_291">section 321</a>  of the  Code. The  only  guiding
factor which  should weigh  with the public prosecutor while
moving	the   application  for	 withdrawal  and  the  court
according its  permission for  withdrawal is  to see whether
the  interest	of  public   justice  is  advanced  and	 the
application for	 withdrawal is not moved with oblique motive
unconnected with the vindication of cause of public justice.
</p><p id="p_167">     If	 once  it  is  accepted	 that  the  application	 for
withdrawal from	 the prosecution  can  be  made	 on  various
grounds and  it is  not confined  to political offences, the
contention raised  on behalf  of the  appellant that grounds
Nos.  (b),   (c),  (d)	mentioned  in  the  application	 for
withdrawal are	irrelevant in  the instant  case will not be
tenable. The<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_292">  Indian Penal  Code</a> or<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_293">  the  Code</a>	of  Criminal
Procedure  does	  not  make  any  such	distinction  between
political
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_74">146</span>
offences and  offences other than political ones. Even if it
is accepted  that political  offences  are  not	 unknown  to
jurisprudence  and   other  Acts  do  contemplate  political
offences, the  fact remains  that<a href="/doc/1037589/" id="a_294"> s.  321</a> Cr.  P.C.  is	 not
confined only  to political offences or social offences, but
it applies  to all kinds of offences and the application for
withdrawal can	be made	 by the Public Prosecutor on various
grounds. The  only safeguard  that should be kept in mind by
the Public  Prosecutor is  that it  should  not	 be  for  an
improper or  oblique  or  ulterior  consideration,  and	 the
guiding consideration  should  be  that	 of  vindication  of
public justice.
</p><p id="p_168">     In the  application for withdrawal from prosecution the
public Prosecutor  has given four reasons and he has applied
his own	 mind to the facts and circumstances of the case. In
para 3	of his application he has clearly stated that he has
gone through  the case	diary  and  the	 relevant  materials
connected with	the case and has come to the conclusion that
in the	circumstances prevailing  at the time of institution
of the	case and  the investigation  thereof it appears that
the case was instituted on the grounds of political vendetta
and only to defame the fair image of Dr. J.N. Mishra who was
then  the   leader  of	 the  opposition   and	one  of	 the
acknowledged leaders of the Congress Party in the country.
</p><p id="p_169">     The Court while according the consent to the withdrawal
has only  to  see  that	 the  Public  Prosecutor  has  acted
properly and  has not been actuated by oblique or extraneous
considerations. It  is not the function of the Court to make
a fresh	 appraisal of  the evidence  and  come	to  its	 own
conclusion on  the question whether there is a triable issue
to be investigated by the Court.
</p><p id="p_170">     First I  take up  ground No.  (b)	in  para  2  of	 the
application for	 withdrawal, that  is,	the  implication  of
respondent No.	2, as  a result	 of personal  and  political
vendetta. In  the opinion  of  the  Public  Prosecutor,	 the
prosecution  was   motivated  by   personal  and   political
vendetta. The  aforesaid criminal case was instituted during
the period of Janata Party Government by an order dated 31st
of January  1978 passed	 by Shri  Karpoori Thakur,  the then
Chief Minister,	 who was  the party  leader of the appellant
Sheonandan Paswan,  who was  also the  State Minister of the
Janata Party Government.
</p><p id="p_171">     From the  materials placed	 on the record it is evident
that respondent No. 2 is one of the prominent leaders of the
party
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">147</span>
politically opposed  to the Janata Party which was the party
in power led by Shri Karpoori Thakur at the relevant time of
the institution	 of the	 prosecution. Respondent  No. 2	 had
been a	bitter critic of the principles and policies of Shri
Karpoori Thakur.  In 1977  when respondent No. 2 was heading
the government	a warrant  of arrest was issued against Shri
Karpoori Thakur for his arrest and detention. The appellant,
formerly  a  Deputy  Magistrate,  was  posted  as  Assistant
Secretary in  the Chief Minister's Secretariat of respondent
No. 2.	He was	removed from  the Secretariat  to some other
department by respondent No. 2. The appellant joined the Lok
Dal and	 fought election  on Lok  Dal ticket after resigning
his job.  When he became a State Minister in the Ministry of
Shri Karpoori  Thakur, he  came to  occupy  a  big  official
bungalow at  Bailly Road,  Patna. In  1980 when the party to
which respondent No. 2 belongs came to power, respondent No.
2 became  the Chief  Minister. The  appellant ceased to be a
State Minister	and was asked to hand over possession of the
official residence.  Since the	appellant refused to vacate,
the State  Government ultimately   resorted to extreme legal
step for  dispossessing him.  This made	 the appellant	feel
aggrieved. He vindicated his right by filing a writ petition
in the	High Court  which  was	eventually  decided  in	 his
favour. The  fact, however,  remains that  there was no love
lost between the appellant and respondent No. 2.
</p><p id="p_172">     When Shri	Karpoori Thakur became the Chief Minister in
the Janata  Party regime, the quickness with which the files
moved when  a decision was taken to prosecute respondent No.
2 is  very significant.	 From the  affidavit of	 Shri  Bidhu
Sekhar Banerjee,  Deputy Superintendent	 of Police,  Cabinet
Vigilance Department,  it is apparent that within the course
of a few days the inquiries were  completed, advice obtained
and orders  passed for	instituting  the  case.	 On  9th  of
January 1978  all the  criminal cases  investigated  by	 Dy.
S.Ps. CI,  Bihar, relating to Patna Urban Co-operative Bank,
including  P.S.	  Case	No.   97(5)77  were  transferred  to
Vigilance Department  by order	of Shri Karpoori Thakur, the
then Chief  Minister and  placed under	the Inspector,	Shri
Reghubir Singh.	 On 22nd January, 1978 M.A. Haidari and A.K.
Sinha, accused	of Kadam Kuan P.S. Case No. 97(5)77 were re-
arrested by  Shri Raghubir  Singh, Inspector  and the second
confession of  Shri M.A.Haidari was secured in which for the
first time  he brought	allegations against  Dr. Mishra. The
confession of  Shri A.K.  Sinha was  secured .	on  26th  of
January, 1978. On 28th January 1978 Shri D.P. Ojha.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">148</span>
<p id="p_173">S.P. Vigilance	submitted his  inquiry	report	recommending
institution of criminal cases against Dr. Mishra and others.
On 29th	 of January  1978 Shri S.B. Sahay DIG Vigilance also
recommended the	 institution of	 a criminal case. On 30th of
January	  1978,	   I.G.Vigilance   also	   recommended	 the
prosecution. On	 the same  day	the  file  was	referred  to
Advocate General  Shri K.D. Chattarjee appointed as Advocate
General by  Shri Karpoori  Thakur. On  31st of January, 1978
the Chief  Secretary sent  the file to the Chief Minister of
Bihar. On the same day the Chief Minister, Bihar approved it
and handed  over the file direct to Shri S.B. Sahay, DIG. On
1st  of	 February,  1978  the  file  was  endorsed  by	S.P.
Vigilance, Shri	 D.P.Ojha to  Addl.  S.P.,  R.P.  Singh	 for
instituting the	 case. On  1st of February, 1978 a Vigilance
Criminal case  was instituted in Police Station at 0600 hrs.
At 8.50	 hrs. the  Case was  discussed by  I.G.with DIG Shri
S.B. Sahay  and Shri  D.P. Ojha	 and decision  was taken  to
search houses  of Dr.  Mishra at Patna, Balua Bazar, and his
relations. On  the same day request to issue search warrants
was made  and search  warrants were  issued. On the same day
Inspectors M/s.	 Sharda	 Nanda	Singh,	Raghubir  Singh	 and
Ramdehia Sharma were got transferred from CID to Vigilance.
</p><p id="p_174">     The speed	with which  the file  of the  criminal	case
moved from  one place  to another and orders obtained itself
indicates that	it was	not to vindicate the cause of public
justice but  it was  only to  feed their  grudge that such a
keen interest  was exhibited  by the  Chief Minister and the
appellant  also	 actuated  by  his  personal  and  political
vendetta sought to oppose the application for withdrawal. In
these circumstances it is doubtful whether the appellant was
truly representing the public interest.
</p><p id="p_175">     To say  that unless  the crime  allegedly committed are
per se	political offences  or are  motivated  by  political
ambition or  consideration or  are committed mass agitation,
communal frenzies, regional disputes, no question of serving
a broader cause of public justice. public order or peace can
arise is to put limitation on the broad terms of <a href="/doc/1542359/" id="a_295">section 321</a>
of the Code.
</p><p id="p_176">     The Public	 Prosecutor was of the view that as a result
of election  there was	a change in the situation in as much
as Respondent  No 2's party received the peoples mandate and
voted to  power and  Respondent No.  2 had  become the Chief
Minister of  the State	and that the prosecution against the
head of	 the State  would have	had adverse effect on public
interest, including public order and peace
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">149</span>
and, therefore,	 he thought  it inexpedient  for reasons  of
State and  public policy to proceed with the case. It is the
Public Prosecutor  who has been given the exclusive power to
apply for withdrawal and if he in his discretion thinks that
it would  be inexpedient  to proceed with the case the Court
cannot reconsider  the matter  afresh and  come to  its	 own
conclusion different  from  the	 one  taken  by	 the  public
prosecutor unless  the Court  comes to a conclusion that the
public prosecutor  has done  so with  an improper or oblique
motive.
</p><p id="p_177">     In my  opinion the decision of the public prosecutor to
withdraw from  the case	 on the	 grounds given by him in his
application for	 withdrawal cannot be said to be actuated by
improper or oblique motive. He bona fide thought that in the
changed circumstances of the case it would be inexpedient to
proceed with  the case	and it	would be  sheer	 wastage  of
public money  and time	to drag	 on with  the  case  if	 the
chances for  conviction are  few and  far  between.  In	 the
circumstances instead of serving the public cause of justice
it will be to the detriment of public interest.
</p><p id="p_178">     The statutory  responsibility for	deciding  withdrawal
squarely rests	upon  the  public  prosecutor.	It  is	non-
negotiable and	cannot be bartered away. The Court's duty in
dealing	 with  the  application	 under	s.  321	 is  not  to
reappreciate the  grounds which led the public prosecutor to
request withdrawal  from the  prosecution  but	to  consider
whether the  public prosecutor	applied his  mind as  a free
agent uninfluenced  by irrelevant  and extraneous or oblique
considerations as  the Court  has a  special  duty  in	this
regard	inasmuch   as  it  is  the  ultimate  repository  of
legislative  confidence	  in  granting	or  withholding	 its
consent to  withdrawal from prosecution. The Court's duty is
to see	in furtherance of justice that the permission is not
sought on grounds extraneous to the interest of justice.
</p><p id="p_179">     The Public	 Prosecutor applied  his mind and on perusal
of case	 diary and  other materials  he was satisfied in the
interest of public justice to withdraw from the case.
</p><p id="p_180">     The Court	also passed a speaking order while according
its consent  to the  withdrawal. The relevant portion of its
order is in the following terms:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_143">	  "Having considered the legal position explained by
     the Supreme  Court and  the  submissions  made  by	 the
     learned
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_78">150</span>
     Special Public  Prosecutor in-charge  of this case, and
     having perused  the relevant  records of  the case I am
     satisfied that  it is a fit case in which the prayer of
     the learned.  Special  Public  Prosecutor	to  withdraw
     should be allowed and it is therefore allowed."
</blockquote><p id="p_181">Normally the  observation made	by the	Court  that  it	 has
perused the  relevant records of the case should be presumed
to be  correct unless  a very  strong case  is made  out for
holding that it did not do so and the vaunted remark made by
the Court  that it  has done  so is  incorrect. In a similar
situation  this	  Court	 in   C.  Mohapatra's  case  (supra)
observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_144">	  "..according	to  the	 prosecution,  the  evidence
     collected during  investigation was  not sufficient  to
     sustain the  charge  against  the	respondent  and	 the
     learned Magistrate was satisfied in regard to the truth
     of this averment made by the Court Sub-Inspector. It is
     difficult for us to understand how the High Court could
     possibly observe  in its  order that the Magistrate had
     not perused  the case  diary when	in terms the learned
     Magistrate has stated in his order that he had read the
     case diary	 and it	 was after reading it that he was of
     the opinion  that the  averment of the prosecution that
     the evidence was not sufficient was not ill-founded
     An attempt	 has been made on behalf of the appellant to
show that  the case diary was not with the Court and that it
was lying  elsewhere  and,  therefore,	he  could  not	have
perused the  case diary	 and his  observation is  not  quite
correct. This  contention cannot  be accepted  at  its	face
value in view of the observations made by the court.</blockquote>
<p id="p_182">     Now I  take up  ground No.	 (a) of	 the application for
withdrawal from	 the case.  This ground	 relates to  lack of
prospect  of  a	 successful  prosecution  in  the  light  of
evidence. The  counsel for  the appellant has contended that
in the	instant case  on the  documentary  evidence  itself,
which is  not in  dispute, an  offence under <a href="/doc/1053937/" id="a_296"> s. 466</a>  of the
Indian Penal  Code and	s. 5  (1) (d)  of the  <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_297">Prevention of
Corruption Act</a>	is prima  facie	 made  out  and	 the  Public
Prosecutor was	not justified  in moving the application for
withdrawal on  this ground. He referred to the antedating of
an order. Dr. J.N.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_79">151</span>
<p id="p_183">Mishra, Respondent  No. 2, after becoming the Chief Minister
passed an  order in  his handwriting  on 16th  May, 1975  in
Hindi, the English rendering whereof is given below:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_145">	  "Much time  has passed.  On perusal of the file it
     appears that  there is  no	 allegation  of	 defalcation
     against the  Chairman and	the Members  of the Board of
     the Bank.	Stern action should be taken for realisation
     of	 the  loans  from  the	loanees	 and  if  there	 are
     difficulties in  realisation from the loanees surcharge
     proceedings should	 be initiated  against the  Board of
     Directors. Normal	conditions be  restored in  the Bank
     after calling  the Annual	General Meeting	 and holding
     elections.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_146">				      Sd/- Jagan Nath Mishra
	       16.5.1975."
</blockquote><p id="p_184">It appears  that this order was replaced by another order in
Hindi, the English rendering of which is:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_147">	  "Please issue	 orders	 for  restoring	 the  normal
     condition's in  the Bank  after holding  Annual General
     Meeting.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_148">				       Sd/-Jagan Nath Mishra
			      16.5.1975."
</blockquote><p id="p_185">by pasting  this order	over the  order dated 16th May, 1975
and by	antedating the latter order as 14th of May, 1975 and
this clearly  in the  opinion of  the learned counsel brings
out an	offence of  criminal misconduct under s.5 (1) (d) of
the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_298">Prevention of Corruption Act</a> and of forgery under<a href="/doc/1053937/" id="a_299"> s. 466</a>
IPC. A	lot of	argument was advanced that the pasting of an
order over  the order dated 16th May, 1975 by a letter order
itself creates	a suspicion.  This  was	 rather	 an  unusual
method adopted	by Dr.	J.N. Mishra  to erase  the  previous
order and to replace it by another order of the same date by
antedating it  as 14th	may 1975  by  pasting  it  over	 the
earlier order.	The method of replacing one order by another
by pasting  over the  earlier one  appears  to	be  a  well-
recognised practice  in the  Secretariat of Bihar Government
and Solicitor  General	Shri  K.  Parasaran  showed  various
similar orders	which had  been replaced by another order by
pasting over  the earlier one. So, that part of the argument
loses all its force on examination of various similar orders
by adopting the same method. The question, however, is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_80">152</span>
whether this antedating of the latter order as 14th May 1975
by pasting  it	over  the  earlier  order  would  amount  to
criminal misconduct  within the	 meaning of <a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_300"> s. 5</a> (1) (d) of
the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_301">Prevention	of Corruption  Act</a> and	forgery	 within	 the
meaning of<a href="/doc/1053937/" id="a_302"> s. 466</a> of the Indian Penal Code. Insofar as it is
material for  the purpose  of this case,<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_303"> s. 5</a> (1) (d) of the
<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_304">Prevention of Corruption Act</a> reads:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_149">	  "5. (1)  A Public  servant is	 said to  commit the
     offence of criminal misconduct-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_150">     (a) ...........................
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_151">     (b) ...........................
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_152">     (c) ...........................
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_153">     (d)  if he, by corrupt or illegal means or by otherwise
	  abusing his  position as  public servant,  obtains
	  for himself  or for  any other person any valuable
	  thing or pecuniary advantage."</blockquote>
<p id="p_186">     The contention  on behalf	of the	appellant is that by
changing the  order dated  16th May,  1975, respondent No. 2
obtained for  Nawal  Kishore  Sinha,  respondent  No.  3,  a
pecuniary advantage  inasmuch as  by antedating	 the  second
order respondent  No. 2 had absolved Nawal Kishor Sinha from
the surcharge proceedings. The factum of change has not been
disputed by  respondent No.  2 and therefore, prima facie an
offence under <a href="/doc/1229833/" id="a_305"> s. 5(1)</a> (d) is made out and no other evidence
be looked  into. In  the circumstances the Public Prosecutor
was not justified in coming to the conclusion that there was
no prospect of conviction of respondent No. 2.
</p><p id="p_187">     I am  afraid this	contention cannot  be  accepted	 for
obvious reasons.  The earlier  order dated 16th May, 1975 no
doubt contemplated four things:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_154">     (1)  that there is no allegation of defalcation against
	  the Chairman and Members of the Board of the Bank;
     (2)  stern action	should be  taken for  realisation of
	  the loans from the loanees;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_155">     (3)  if there  are difficulties in the realisation from
	  the  loanees	 surcharge  proceedings	  should  be
	  initiated against the Board of Directors, and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_81">153</span>
     (4)  normal conditions  be restored  in the  Bank after
	  calling the  annual general  meeting	and  holding
	  elections.
</blockquote><p id="p_188">By the	second order,  which is said to have been antedated,
only the fourth part of the order has been maintained. There
seems to  be no	 earthly reason	 for antedating	 the  latter
order by  putting the  date as	14th of	 May, 1975.  It	 was
always open  to the  Minister to  have changed his order and
pass another  order. The same purpose could have been served
by  Respondent	No.  2,	 if  he	 really	 wanted	 to  absolve
Respondent No.	3 from the liability by passing the order on
the 16th  of May, 1975 by replacing the earlier order by the
subsequent order.  Rather that	purpose of Respondent No. 2,
if at all, could have been served better by keeping the date
of the	second order  as 16th  May, or	any subsequent date.
Secondly, the  second antedated	 order dated  14th May, 1975
could  not   stand  in	 the  way  of  initiating  surcharge
proceedings against  Respondent No.  3 and  other members of
the Board of the Bank. Date 14th May, 1975, for all we know,
may have  been on  account of some accidental slip The other
reason	as  suggested  by  the	Solicitor  General  is	that
surcharge proceedings  could be	 initiated only	 by the	 Co-
operative Department under<a href="/doc/1938446/" id="a_306"> s. 40</a> of the Bihar and Orissa Co-
operative <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_307">Societies Act</a>, 1935. It reads:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_156">	  "40, Where  as a result of an audit under<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_308"> s. 33</a> or
     an enquiry	 under<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_309"> s. 35</a>, or an inspection under<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_310"> ss. 34</a>,
     <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_311">36</a> or  37, or the winding up of a Society it appears to
     the Registrar that any person who has taken part in the
     organisation or  management of  the society or any past
     or present	 officer of  the society  has been guilty of
     the fact or omission mentioned in clauses (a), (b), (c)
     or (d)  the Registrar  may enquire	 into the conduct of
     such persons  or officers and after giving such officer
     or person	an opportunity of being heard, make an order
     for surcharge."
</blockquote><p id="p_189">Therefore, in  view of	the aforesaid provisions of<a href="/doc/73844564/" id="a_312"> s. 40</a> of
the Cooperative	 Societies Act, taking steps for a surcharge
is not	within the jurisdiction of the State Executive. This
may have  been another	reason for  dropping the proceedings
for surcharge,	if at all, against the officers of the bank.
There is yet another reason. The second antedated order does
not say	 a word	 about dropping	 the  surcharge	 proceedings
ordered by  Respondent No.  2  in  the	earlier	 order	and,
therefore, it  is difficult to say that Respondent No. 2 had
actually   dropped   the   surcharge   proceedings   against
Respondent No. 3 and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_82">154</span>
other offers  of the  Co-operative Bank.  Indeed,  surcharge
proceedings had	 been initiated.  Surcharge files  regarding
surcharge  case	  No.  3   of  1975  proves  that  surcharge
proceedings were  proposed initially by the Deputy Registrar
on 30th	 of April  1975 and  were in fact taken on 1st June,
1975 and  the show  cause notice was issued on 1st July 1975
and surcharge  order was  made against	Shri  Nawal  Kishore
Sinha and  others on 31st December, 1975. This shows clearly
that no	 benefit or  advantage was  given to  Nawal  Kishore
Sinha or  others by  the order	of 14th	 May, 1975. From the
affidavit of  Jiwanand Jha, Respondent No. 4 it appears that
an amount  of Rs.  33,96,024.90 was  given as  loans to	 180
persons. Out  of the  total amount  given by way of loans an
amount of  Rs. 25,64,682.23  has already  been realised from
106 persons.  The unrealised  amount is only Rs. 8,31,337.67
for which decrees have been passed against 64 persons and as
against the remaining 10 persons proceedings for realisation
are going on.
</p><p id="p_190">     About the offence of forgery under<a href="/doc/1053937/" id="a_313"> s. 466</a> of the Indian
Penal Code  also I  have my  grave doubts.  Forgery has been
defined under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_314"> s. 463</a> as "making any false document". Making
of false  document is  defined in <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_315"> s. 464</a>.  According to the
counsel for  the appellant the present case falls within the
scope of  "who dishonestly  or fraudulently makes a document
or part of a document ...at a time at which he knows that it
was  not   made,  signed,   sealed  or	executed"  The	word
"dishonestly" has  been defined in<a href="/doc/898393/" id="a_316"> s. 24</a> of the Indian Penal
Code as "whoever does anything with the intention of causing
wrongful gain  to one  person or  wrongful loss	 to  another
person	 is   said   to	  do   that   thing   "dishonestly."
"Fraudulently" has  been defined  in<a href="/doc/1148711/" id="a_317"> s.	 25</a> as	"a person is
said to	 do a  thing fraudulently if he does that thing with
intent to defraud but not otherwise." The precise contention
raised on  behalf of  the appellant is that Respondent No. 2
changed the  order which  has been  earlier passed  with the
intention of  causing wrongful loss to the Bank by reason of
the fact  that by  the order passed surcharge proceeding was
countermanded.
</p><p id="p_191">     On the  materials on  record I  am not satisfied that a
prima facie  case under	<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_318"> s. 5</a>  (1) (d)	of the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_319">Prevention of
Corruption Act</a> and of forgery under<a href="/doc/1053937/" id="a_320"> s. 466</a> Indian Penal Code
are made out.
</p><p id="p_192">     The facts	have many  faces. If  the view of the Public
Prosecutor is one, which could in the circumstances be taken
by any	reasonable man,	 the Court cannot substitute its own
opinion for  that of  the Public  Prosecutor. If  the Public
Prosecutor has applied his mind
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_83">155</span>
on the	relevant materials  and his opinion is not perverse,
and which  a reasonable	 man could have arrived at, a roving
inquiry into  the evidence  and materials  on the record for
the purpose  of finding	 out whether  his  conclusions	were
right or  wrong would  be incompetent.	That would virtually
convert this  Court  into  an  Appellate  Court	 setting  on
judgment.
</p><p id="p_193">     The contention raised by the counsel for appellant that
the Public  Prosecutor Shri  Lallan  Prasad  Sinha  was	 not
competent to  apply for	 withdrawal has not been accepted by
my  brothers   Tulzapurkar  and	 Baharul  Islam	 JJ.  and  I
respectfully agree with them.
</p><p id="p_194">     If the  Public Prosecutor	thought that the continuance
of the prosecution in the circumstances would only end in an
exercise in  futility, he  was fully justified in moving the
application for	 withdrawal. The only question is whether he
has applied  his  mind	and  he	 was  not  actuated  by	 any
extraneous consideration  or improper  motive. It was sought
to be  argued on  behalf of  the appellant  that the  Public
Prosecutor has	acted at the behest of the Government and he
did not apply his own mind. Reference was made to the letter
sent by	 the Government to the Public Prosecutor. The letter
did not	 indicate that	the  Government	 wants	him  not  to
proceed with  the case	but the	 letter gave full freedom to
the Public  Prosecutor to  apply his own mind and to come to
his own	 conclusion. In	 view of  the various authorities of
this Court, consultation with the Government or high officer
is not	improper. But the Public Prosecutor has to apply his
own mind  to the  facts and circumstances of the case before
coming to  the conclusion  to withdraw from the prosecution.
From the  materials on	the record  I am  satisfied that the
Public Prosecutor  has applied	his own mind and came to his
own conclusions.
</p><p id="p_195">     The last  but not the least in importance was the point
raised on  behalf of  the appellant  that the  sanction	 for
prosecution  had  already  been	 given	by  the	 then  Chief
Minister, Abdul	 Gafoor and  the complaint  was going  to be
filed but  it was  postponed on	 account of Respondent No. 2
who by	that time  overtook as	the Chief Minister of Bihar.
The argument is that firstly he tried to delay the filing of
the complaint; and secondly that he ordered for not pro
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_84">156</span>
secuting the  officers of  the bank including Respondent No.
2, Shri Jagan Nath Mishra.
</p><p id="p_196">     It appears	 from the  notes on dates given on behalf of
the Respondent	that the  file went  to the  Chief Minister,
Respondent No.	2 because  of an earlier noting dated Ist of
January 1975  by Shri  Omesh Prasad  Verma  that  the  Chief
Minister may  also like	 to see. A further noting dated 31st
of January  1975 by Shri R.K. Shrivastava in the Ministry of
Co-operation was to the following effects:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_157">	  "Chief Minister  and Minister	 of Law have desired
     to see  the file before complaints are actually lodged.
     As per  their directions,	the file  has been  recalled
     from  the	 Additional  Public   Prosecutor.   In	 the
     circumstances narrated  above Minister of Law and Chief
     Minister would  like to  accord their  approval to	 the
     filing of the complaint."
</blockquote><p id="p_197">A subsequent  note of  Shri R.	K. Shrivastava dated 27th of
January 1975 is in the following terms:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_158">	  "The Chief  Minister has  desired that if the said
     complaint has  not been  filed should  await till he is
     able to  see the  file. Another  buff  sheet  has	been
     received from  the Minister  of Agriculture  also.	 The
     file may  kindly be  recalled and	filing of complaints
     may await till further clearance of the C.M."
</blockquote><p id="p_198">It appears  that the previous Chief Minister was replaced by
that time Dr. J.N. Mishra. It is in these circumstances that
the file  was sent  to Respondent  No. 2  in his capacity as
Chief Minister	in pursuance  of the  earlier desire  of the
then Chief  Minister, Shri  Abdul  Gafoor,  and	 passed	 the
following orders:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_159">	  "In order  to recover	 the money  from some of the
     loanees of	 the Patna  Urban Co-operative Bank criminal
     cases were	 instituted against  them. Action  should be
     taken immediately	for  the  withdrawal  of  the  cases
     against those loanees who have cleared the loan in full
     and proper	 instalments for  payment of loans should be
     fixed against  those who want to repay the loan but due
     to financial incapacity
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_85">157</span>
     are unable	 to make  payment at  a time  and thereafter
     necessary further action should be taken."
</blockquote><p id="p_199">In this	 state of  affairs it cannot be said that Respondent
No. 2 was out to obstruct the criminal proceedings.
</p><p id="p_200">     The facts	that the prosecution, if ordered, will start
after a gap of about eight years cannot be lost sight of. In
the view  taken by  me in  the earlier	part of the judgment
that no	 prima facie  case in  my opinion  has been made out
under<a href="/doc/1053937/" id="a_321"> s.  466</a> of  the Indian  Penal Code and<a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_322"> s. 5</a> (1) (d) of
the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_323">Prevention	of Corruption Act</a> and the fact that the High

giving consent to the withdrawal from the prosecution on the
application of	the Public  Prosecutor under<a href="/doc/1037589/" id="a_324"> s. 321</a> Cr. P.C.
this Court  cannot make	 a fresh  appraisal of	evidence and
come to	 a different  conclusion. All that this Court has to
see is	that the  Public  Prosecutor  was  not	actuated  by
extraneous  or	improper  considerations  while	 moving	 the
application for	 withdrawal from the prosecution. Even if it
is possible  to have  another view  different from  the	 one
taken by  the Public Prosecutor while moving the application
for  withdrawal	  from	prosecution  this  Court  should  be
reluctant to interfere with the order unless it comes to the
conclusion that	 the Public  Prosecutor has  not applied his
mind to	 the facts  and circumstances  of the  case, and has
simply acted  at the  behest of	 the Government	 or has been
actuated by  extraneous and  improper considerations. On the
facts and  circumstances of  the case it is not possible for
me to  hold that  the  Public  Prosecutor  was	actuated  by
oblique or improper motive.
</p><p id="p_201">     In view  of my  finding that  the criminal case against
Respondent No.	2 and  others was  instituted on  account of
personal or  political vendetta	 at  the  instance  of	some
disgrunted political  leaders, that  no prima  facie case of
forgery or  misconduct is  made out  on the materials on the
record, that  the Court's  jurisdiction in  dealing with the
application under <a href="/doc/185764/" id="a_325"> s. 311</a> of the Code is only to see whether
the Public  Prosecutor had  applied for	 withdrawal  in	 the
interest of  Public Justice,  or he  has done so actuated by
improper or  oblique motive,  that a  substantial amount  of
loan has  already been realised, that the continuance of the
criminal case in the circumstances of this case will be only
an exercise  in futility  at the  cost of  public money	 and
time, that the trial court as well as the High Court
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_86">158</span>
