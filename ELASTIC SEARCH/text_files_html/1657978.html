<p id="p_1">1.         By this order, I shall dispose of I.A. No. 4251/2009 filed by

the plaintiffs under Order 39 Rules 1 &amp; 2 read with Section 151 of the

Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.         The present suit has been filed for perpetual injunction

restraining passing off and infringement of trade mark, rendition of

accounts, damages etc. Plaintiff no. 1 is a permanent resident of Delhi

and is the sole proprietor of the trade mark „Anantam‟ registered under



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">CS (OS) No. 602/2009                                            Page 1 of 15</span>
 No. 1248372 dated 7th November, 2003 in Class 24 and No. 1254084

dated 9th December, 2003 in Class 25 with regard to all kinds of

readymade garments like handkerchiefs, dhotis, tissues(piece goods, bed

and table covers), lungis etc. The business of these goods is being

carried out from the trade mark „Anantam‟ from the residence of

plaintiff no. 1 which is C-2/29, Model Town, Delhi- 110009.

</p><p id="p_3">3.          The plaintiff no. 1 has been using the said trade mark since

September, 2003. From 1st April, 2004 a partnership firm was

constituted by plaintiff no. 1 along with plaintiffs no. 2 and 3 who are

her son and daughter respectively and together, the plaintiffs opened up

a showroom of readymade garments and apparel in shop no. 8-9, First

Floor, Metropolitan Mall, MG Road, Gurgaon, Haryana. A partnership

firm by the name of M/s. Anantam was thus created, and the same is

plaintiff no. 4 herein.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.          The plaintiffs have submitted that the name Anantam slowly

became synonymous for quality, durability and the latest designs so

much so that people from all over India and abroad became its customers

and with time, plaintiff no. 1 has come to be referred to as Anantam.

Further, the plaintiffs‟ products have been advertised on television too.

The news channels AAJ TAK and NDTV have taken video shots of the

plaintiffs‟ outlet and have aired the same. The increase in sales of the

plaintiff no. 4 firm has been from Rs. 1,53,74,331.25 in 2004-05 to Rs.

3,48,50,644/- in 2007-08 i.e. more than double in four years. The

plaintiffs have acquired a vast amount of goodwill by the name of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CS (OS) No. 602/2009                                           Page 2 of 15</span>
 Anantam.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.         Some time in April, 2007 when an employee of the plaintiffs

went to purchase raw material from the market, the same was refused by

shopkeepers who stated that the plaintiffs‟ branch at Jaipur had defaulted

in making certain payments and hence, the plaintiffs could not purchase

any material. The plaintiffs then sent a legal notice dated 5th May, 2007

to the defendant and the defendant replied vide letter dated 6 th August,

2007 stating that it had been using the trade mark Anantam since 2005

with respect to readymade garments, jewellery, purses etc. Due to the

continuing wrong of the defendant, the plaintiffs sent another legal

notice dated 19th December, 2008 to the former stating that if it did not

cease its infringing activities and replied within a week, the plaintiffs

would initiate legal proceedings against it. Since no reply was sent by

the defendant and the infringing activities continued, the present suit was

filed.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.         In the present application, the plaintiffs have submitted that

the use of the registered trade mark „Anantam‟ by the defendant in

relation to readymade garments, perfumes, watches, hosiery etc.

infringes valuable rights of the plaintiffs as sub-standard goods are being

sold which are of the same classification, nature and description as the

plaintiffs products and in fact, are being sold under an identical mark as

the plaintiffs. The use of the mark „Anantam‟ is only to cause confusion

and deception in the mind of purchasers and therefore the same is mala

fide.
</p>
<p id="p_7">

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CS (OS) No. 602/2009                                             Page 3 of 15</span>
</p><p id="p_8"> 7.          Further, the defendant‟s reply dated 6th August, 2007 to the

plaintiffs‟ legal notice dated 5th May, 2007 states that registration of the

former‟s trade mark is pending in Classes 35 and 42. The plaintiffs

submit that they will take necessary action and file an opposition to the

defendant‟s application.
</p>
<p id="p_9">8.          It is the plaintiffs‟ contention that use of an identical mark in

respect of goods which are similar in classification and description

would surely deceive and confuse the ultimate purchasers. There is no

doubt that a person, while buying the goods of the defendant, might

think that he/she is in fact buying the plaintiffs‟ goods.

</p><p id="p_10">9.          It is on account of the defendant‟s deliberate and mala fide

use of the plaintiffs‟ registered trade mark that the plaintiffs have filed

the present application for an ad-interim injunction restraining the

defendant from infringing the plaintiffs‟ trade mark and from passing off

its inferior quality goods as those of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs have

also prayed for damages. The plaintiffs submit that balance of

convenience is in their favour as they are the prior users of the registered

trade mark and prima facie case has also been established. Further, they

would suffer irreparable loss and injury if the defendant did not cease

production, marketing and sale of its goods under the name „Anantam‟.

</p><p id="p_11">10.         In its reply, the defendant has stated that the plaintiffs‟ suit

ought to be dismissed on account of various reasons mentioned in detail

in the written statement. Firstly, the suit as filed by plaintiffs no. 2 to 4 is

not maintainable as the plaint has been neither signed nor verified by



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CS (OS) No. 602/2009                                                 Page 4 of 15</span>
 them, nor has any counsel been appointed to represent them. Secondly,

plaintiff no. 1 has not authorized the other plaintiffs to use the trade

mark registered exclusively in her favour. Thirdly, the present suit has

been filed against a non-juristic person as M/s. Anantam is a proprietary

concern and neither a legal entity not a juristic person, hence the suit

ought to be dismissed. Further, the plaintiffs have concealed material

facts from the court as the defendant had informed them about its

pending registration applications in its reply dated 6 th August, 2007 and

instead of filing an opposition, the plaintiffs kept tracking the progress of

the defendant‟s applications and when a certificate of Registration of

Trade Mark was issued under No. 1506086 by the Registrar of Trade

Marks on 21st November, 2006 (only with regard to class 35) the

plaintiffs decided to harass the defendant with the knowledge that the

defendant‟s trade mark was under a different class which had no

connection to the plaintiffs‟ registered trade mark, which was in totally

separate classes. Lastly, the plaintiffs have not complied with the

provision contained in Order 39 Rule 3 (b) of the CPC.

</p><p id="p_12">11.        On merits, the defendant has argued that a perusal of the

plaintiffs‟ registered trademarks would show that the name „Anantam‟

has been granted in its simple form without any logo. The trade of the

defendant is covered under Classes 35 and 42 and that of the plaintiffs

under Classes 24 and 25, which itself reveals the difference between the

two. The defendant has contended that the partnership Anantam has been

carrying on its work without any legal consent from the concerned



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CS (OS) No. 602/2009                                               Page 5 of 15</span>
 authority and hence, the same is illegal. Further, the goods being traded

under the name „Anantam‟ are the goods of other manufacturers and

therefore, their receptivity with the clients does not establish the

plaintiffs‟ reputation at all.
</p>
<p id="p_13">12.         As per the defendant, its use of the word „Anantam‟ is

completely different from the plaintiffs. Further, the defendant has

pointed out the long gap between the plaintiffs‟ second legal notice and

the defendant‟s reply to its earlier notice i.e. from 6 th August, 2007 to

19th December, 2008. While highlighting this gap, the defendant has

contended that the plaintiffs‟ disinclination to proceed with the matter

show that the marks used by the parties were not similar and were not

causing any deception.
</p>
<p id="p_14">13.         The defendant has referred to Section 28 (3) and Section 30

(2) (e) of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_1">Trade Marks Act</a>, 1999 and submitted that the defendant is

entitled to use the registered trade mark of the plaintiff even if the same

is similar to the plaintiffs‟ trade mark. Further, the plaintiffs‟ place of

work is in Gurgaon, Haryana and the defendant‟s place of work is in

Jaipur, Rajasthan therefore the situation of confusion would not arise and

consumers would not wrongly presume the defendant‟s products to be

those of the plaintiffs‟ and due to this reason, this court also has no

jurisdiction to entertain the present suit.
</p>
<p id="p_15">14.         I have perused the contentions of both parties. Before

proceeding to look into the arguments on merit, I shall look into the

question of jurisdiction of this court. As per the plaintiffs, this court has



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">CS (OS) No. 602/2009                                               Page 6 of 15</span>
 jurisdiction to entertain the present suit under <a href="/doc/969470/" id="a_2">Section 134</a> of the Trade

Marks Act, 1999 while the defendant‟s contention is that since it has no

place of work in Delhi nor does it reside in Delhi, this court cannot try

this suit for want of jurisdiction. <a href="/doc/969470/" id="a_3">Section 134</a> provides as under :

<p id="p_16">15.        The defendant‟s argument that its trade mark is also

registered under Trade Mark No. 1506086 in Class 35 and therefore, as

per Section(s) 28(3) and 30 of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_4">Trade Marks Act</a>, 1999 since both

parties are registered users of the name and mark in question, both will

be treated as equal and no case of infringement will lie in the present

case.

<p id="p_17"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">CS (OS) No. 602/2009                                              Page 7 of 15</span>
</p><p id="p_18"> 16.        In my considered opinion, the present issue requires an

examination of the Trade Marks Rules, 2002 (hereinafter referred to as

„the Rules‟). As per the defendant‟s contention, its trade mark is

registered under Class 35 of Schedule IV of the Rules. Schedule IV

provides the classes wherein classification of goods and services has

been classified. A bare perusal of this Schedule reveals that Class 35

relates to services i.e. to advertising, business management, business

administration, office functions. The defendant got the mark „Anantam‟

registered in class 35 in respect of complete family store dealing in

readymade garments, hosiery, sarees, suits, cosmetics, perfumes, ladies

purses, watches, jewellery and all type of accessories and merchandise

goods as well as part of its trading name. Admittedly, the defendant is

using the name/ mark and logo of „Anantam‟ on packages, invoices and

other printed material etc., as fact which has been admitted by the

counsel for defendant during the course of hearing of the interim

injunction. After examination of classification of goods it is clear that

the goods in which the defendant‟s mark/ name is registered fall in

classes 14, 18, 24 and 25 and not in class 35. I do not agree with the

learned counsel for the defendant that the defendant has only one shop

from where these goods are being sold because of the reason that while

selling the merchandise items, the defendant is admittedly using packing

material, advertisement products, plastic bags, invoices, sign board and

gift packs where the name „Anantam‟ is mentioned, whether as a mark

or a name and this has to be considered as a user if the mark/name



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">CS (OS) No. 602/2009                                           Page 8 of 15</span>
 „Anantam‟.
</p>
<p id="p_19">17.        It is well settled law that the use of a mark can be by various

means and one of them is by way of advertisement or intention to use the

mark in question. It is relevant to refer <a href="/doc/1405250/" id="a_5">Section 2(2)(c)(i)</a> of the Trade

Marks Act, 1999 which provides as follows :

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">             "<a href="/doc/117176/" id="a_6">Section 2</a> (ii) : In this Act, unless the context otherwise

Thistle and Anr</a>., 1994 (14) PTC 83 (Cal) (DB) further illuminates this

aspect of the present matter. The relevant portion of the same is

reproduced hereinbelow :

<blockquote id="blockquote_13">             "20. Incidentally, it is to be noted that use of the mark does
             not postulate actual sale of the goods bearing such a mark.
             'Use' to my mind can be in any form or way and does not
             necessarily mean and imply actual physical sale and it is
             now well settled that even mere advertisement without
             having even the existence of the goods can be said to be a
             use of the mark..."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">19.        Since the defendant is admittedly using the name „Anantam‟

as its mark as well as trade name, therefore, the user of the mark is

apparent on the face of it, as already stated as the goods in which

registration is granted fall in Classes 14, 18, 24 and 25. Prima facie, I am

of the considered view that registration in clause 35 is not correctly

granted in accordance with the Trade Mark Rules, 2002, hence, the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">CS (OS) No. 602/2009                                              Page 9 of 15</span>
 defendant cannot take the benefit of Section(s) 28 (3) and 30 of the

<a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_8">Trade Marks Act</a>, 1999 thus, there is no bar to the suit for infringement

against the defendant. The plaintiffs are entitled to take the benefit of

<a href="/doc/969470/" id="a_9">Section 134</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 due to the reasons (a) that

plaintiffs no. 1 to 3 are actually and voluntarily residing within the local

limits of this court‟s territorial jurisdiction, (b) the application for

registration of trademark was filed by the plaintiffs in the Delhi Trade

Marks office and (c) the plaintiffs are advertising their products on

national television channels and are also purchasing material from

various manufacturers in Delhi. Hence, at this stage, this court cannot

come to the conclusion that it has no territorial jurisdiction.

Laboratories LLC &amp; Anr. v. Gufic Ltd. &amp; Anr</a>., 2009 (41) PTC 41

(Del) wherein the defendant had a similar/identical trade mark registered

in the same class, a learned single judge of this court observed the

following :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">               "Registration has been made only prima-facie evidence of
               the registration otherwise being in accordance with the Act

               plaintiff but I find that even <a href="/doc/667743/" id="a_12">Section 28(1)</a> while being
               subject to other provisions of Act, further provides that
               "registration of the trademark, if valid, give to the registered
               proprietor" exclusive right to use the trademark. Thus the
               validity of registration can be gone into, wherever
               permissible under the Act. <a href="/doc/944811/" id="a_13">Section 124(1)(b)</a> also indicates
               that it was within the contemplation of the legislature that
               there could be a suit for infringement of trademark where
               the defendant takes a plea under <a href="/doc/1215460/" id="a_14">Section 30(2)(e)</a> i.e. that
               use by him is not infringement because of his mark being
               also registered. The legislature while further providing for
               stay of suit in such cases, in Sub-section (5) expressly

              making any interlocutory order. <a href="/doc/519703/" id="a_15">Section 31</a> r/w the scheme
             of 124 leads to an un-escapable conclusion that (A) there
             can be a suit for infringement against the registered
             proprietor (B) that upon the defendant taking the plea of his
             registration and of there being thus no infringement, such
             suit has to be stayed awaiting the rectification proceedings
             and (C) the court is empowered in such case to pass any
             interlocutory order. The court while passing interlocutory
             order will necessarily have to prima facie adjudicate the
             validity of the two competing registrations. Upon inquiry, it
             was informed that the Registrar while trying the
             rectification application has no power to grant interim relief.
             The legislature under <a href="/doc/479452/" id="a_16">Section 124(5)</a> has thus empowered
             the court under <a href="/doc/479452/" id="a_17">Section 124(5)</a> to grant injunction against

<blockquote id="blockquote_16">             11. Once having reached a conclusion that registration is

             record and in the facts of the case, the court is empowered
             to injunct use of registered trademark also ..."

             including of injunction restraining the use of the registered
             trademark by the defendant can be made by the court, if the

<p id="p_22">22.        In view of the finding given in the earlier paras above and the

case law referred, I hereby hold that a suit for infringement is

maintainable in the present case and that this court has got jurisdiction as

fide registered trade mark for their products. The contention of the

 defendant that it is also a bona fide registered trade mark holder is

without any substance as the said trade mark has been registered under

the wrong class in Schedule IV. I am of the considered view that even

otherwise, in an action of passing off, the well settled law in <a href="/doc/1181080/" id="a_18">Century

Traders v. Roshan Lal Duggar Co</a>., AIR 1978 (Del) 250 will be

applicable. In this case it was held that for the purpose of claiming

proprietorship of a mark, it is not necessary that the mark should have

been used for considerable length of time. A single actual use with intent

to continue such use eo instanti confers a right to such mark as a trade

mark. Further, in order to succeed in an application for temporary

injunction the applicant has to establish user of the aforesaid mark prior

in point of time than the impugned user by the non-applicant. Further

still, actual damage or fraud is unnecessary in a passing off action

whether the relief asked for is injunction alone or injunction, accounts

and damages. If there is a likelihood of the offending trade mark

invading the proprietary right, a case for injunction is made out.

</p><p id="p_24">24.        The plaintiffs have been using the duly registered trade mark

„Anantam‟ since September 2003. By the defendant‟s own admission, it

started using the said mark in 2005. The requisite factum that the

plaintiffs have been using the mark prior in time than the defendant has

been successfully established. In my opinion, nothing further needs to be

said. The plaintiffs have established a prima facie case. Further, balance

of convenience is in their favour as they are prior users of the said mark

and irreparable injury would be caused to them if the defendant is

 allowed to carry on its infringing activity. Delay, if any, is not fatal in

case of infringement of trade mark. In the present case, it is an

undisputed fact that the trade mark and name used by the defendant is

identical to the plaintiffs‟ and in relation to the same goods, therefore,

the question of delay in filing the suit, if any, does not arise. In this

reference, in Tata Oil Mills Co. Ltd. Vs. Wipro Ltd., AIR 1986 Delhi

345 this court observed that mere delay in filing of a suit for

infringement is not fatal and referred to Sh. Swaran Singh Trading Vs.

M/s. Usha Industries (India), 1986 (6) PTC 287 (Del) (DB), the

relevant portion whereof is reproduced hereinbelow :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_18">            "7. There is then the question of delay. Learned counsel for
            the respondents had urged that the delay is fatel to the grant
            of an injunction. We are not so satisfied. A delay in the
            matter of seeking an injunction may be a ground for
            refusing an injunction in certain circumstances. In the
            present case, we are dealing with a statutory right based on
            the provisions of the Trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_19">Merchandise Marks Act</a>,
            1958. An exclusive right is granted by the registration to the
            holder of a registered trade mark. We do not think that
            statutory rights can be lost by delay. The effect of a
            registered mark is so clearly defined in the Statute as to be
            not capable of being mis-understood. Even if there is some
            delay, the exclusive right cannot be lost. The registered
            mark cannot be reduced to a nullity. The principles
            governing other types of injunctions are not be readily
            applied to a case like the present. Of course, if it was a case
            of a similar mark as opposed to the same mark, the
            concurrent user coupled with delay might be a ground for
            refusing an injunction. However, when the same mark is
            being used, in a sense, the public is deceived into
            purchasing the defendant‟s good on the belief that they are
            the plaintiff‟s goods, so a registered trade mark is a
            casualty, it is the duty of the Court to protect the registered
            mark. That is the whole concept of registration. So, we
            cannot refuse an injunction even if there is some delay
            especially when the mark is the same. To refuse the
            injunction would tantamount to permit a fraud being
            practised on unwary customers. This is a matter of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">CS (OS) No. 602/2009                                            Page 13 of 15</span>
             principles on which the Court cannot refuse the injunction."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_25">25.        Further,    in   Durga    Dutt    Sharma      Vs.   Navaratna

Pharmaceuticals Laboratories, AIR 1965 SC 980 the test of

infringement and passing off is given which reads as under :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_19">            "28. ... The action for infringement is a statutory remedy
            conferred on the registered proprietor of a registered trade
            mark for the vindication of the exclusive right to the use of
            the trade mark in relation to those goods" (Vide <a href="/doc/1056401/" id="a_20">Section 21</a>
            of the Act). The use by the defendant of the trade mark of
            the plaintiff is not essential in an action for passing off, but
            is the sine qua non in the case of an action for infringement.
            No doubt, where the evidence in respect of passing off
            consists merely of the colourable use of a registered trade
            mark, the essential features of both the actions might
            coincide in the sense that what would be a colourable
            imitation of a trade mark in a passing off action would also
            be such in an action for infringement of the same trade
            mark. But there the correspondence between the two ceases.
            In an action for infringement, the plaintiff must, no doubt,
            make out that the use of the defendant‟s mark is likely to
            deceive, but where the similarity between the plaintiff‟s and
            the defendant‟s mark is so close either visually, phonetically
            or otherwise and the court reaches the conclusion that there
            is an imitation, no further evidence is required to establish
            that the plaintiff‟s rights are violated."

Bhatia</a>,(2004) 3 SCC 90, the following has been observed :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_20">            "5. The law on the subject is well settled. In cases of
            infringement either of trade mark or of copyright, normally
            an injunction must follow. Mere delay in bringing action is
            not sufficient to defeat grant of injunction in such cases. The
            grant of injunction also becomes necessary if it prima facie
            appears that the adoption of the mark was itself dishonest."
