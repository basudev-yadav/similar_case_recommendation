HEADNOTE:



JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">			   ORDER
</p><p id="p_2">1. This is a review petition filed by Respondents 1 and 2 in
SLP (C) No. 18175 of 1993.  By our order dated November	 26,
1993, we granted special leave and, having heard the appeal,
we allowed it and directed Respondents 1 and 2 to refund the
monies recovered by them from the State Bank of Patiala upon
certain bank guarantees.
</p><p id="p_3">2.   The  appellants  had filed an earlier  appeal  in	this
Court	against	  a   decision	of   CEGAT   regarding	 the
classification	of  toilet soap for the purposes  of  excise
duty.  Interim orders were passed in the appeal whereby stay
of recovery of excise duty pursuant to the impugned order of
CEGAT was granted on condition that 50% thereof was paid  by
the appellants to the excise authorities within 3 months and
for   the   balance  50%  the  appellants   furnished	bank
guarantees.   The  appeal was,	ultimately,  allowed.	This
Court  then stated that it "did not propose to go  into	 the
question of the refund as it is a matter to be dealt with by
the  authorities  concerned  in accordance  with  law.	 The
appellants   shall  have  to  apply  for  refund   and	 the
authorities shall be required to deal with it in  accordance
with  the  law.	 It is for the	authorities,  therefore,  to
decide the question as per law."
</p><p id="p_4">3.   Accordingly,  on May 14, 1993 the appellants  wrote  to
the first respondent and requested him "to refund the amount
and  the bank guarantees deposited from time to	 time  under
Supreme Court of India's interim orders during the  pendency
of  the above-referred appeals".  Since, in their view,	 the
refund application was not being dealt with, the  appellants
filed  a  writ petition on August 27, 1993 before  the	High
Court	of  Punjab  and	 Haryana  seeking  its	 expeditious
disposal.   On	October	 18, 1993 the High  Court  issued  a
direction to the excise authorities to dispose of the  claim
of  the appellants for "refund/release of  bank	 guarantees"
within one month.  The High Court directed the appellants to
have the bank guarantees extended till the final disposal of
the claim for refund.  Against this order of the High  Court
the  special  leave petition aforementioned  was  filed,  on
which leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was allowed
by the order of which review is now sought.
</p><p id="p_5">4.   The excise authorities passed an order on November	 15,
1993 holding that the amount deposited by the appellants  in
court  and  withdrawn  by the  excise  authorities  and	 the
amounts	 covered  by the bank guarantees  furnished  by	 the
appellants pursuant to the interim orders of this Court were
not  refundable	 to  the appellants  having  regard  to	 the
provisions  of <a href="/doc/128890889/" id="a_1">Section 11-B</a> of the Central Excises and	<a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_2">Salt
Act</a>, 1944.  The bank guarantees not having been renewed, the
first  respondent  then	 issued	 upon  the  bank  a  demand,
pursuant  to  which  the bank guarantees  were	encashed  on
November  17,  1993.   By our order of	November  26,  1993,
allowing  the civil appeal as aforestated, we held that	 the
direction  issued  by  the  High  Court	 in  regard  to	 the
extension  of the bank guarantees was bad because  the	bank
guarantees
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">549</span>
were  not the subject-matter of the application	 for  refund
pending before the excise authorities.	Once this Court	 had
decided	 the earlier appeal against  the  excise-authorities
they  did  not	have the power to get  the  bank  guarantees
encashed.   Accordingly, we directed the excise	 authorities
to  repay the amounts collected upon the bank guarantees  to
the bank.
</p><p id="p_6">5.   <a href="/doc/15859491/" id="a_3">Section 11</a> -B of the Act provides that person  claiming
refund	of  any duty of excise may make an  application	 for
refund	of such duty to the Assistant Collector	 of  Central
Excise	before	the expiry of six months from  the  relevant
date  and  in  such  form  as  may  be	prescribed  and	 the
application  shall  be accompanied by  such  documentary  or
other  evidence	 as the applicant may furnish  to  establish
that the amount of duty of excise in relation to which	such
refund is claimed was collected from or paid by him and	 the
incidence of such duty had not been passed on by him to	 any
other person.
</p><p id="p_7">6.   Mr A.K. Ganguli, learned counsel for Respondents 1	 and
2  submitted  that  the provisions of  <a href="/doc/15859491/" id="a_4">Section	11</a>  -B	were
attracted to the bank guarantees in question; that the	bank
guarantees, fumished under the interim orders of this  Court
as  a condition of stay of recovery of excise duty from	 the
appellants,  should  be deemed to be  equivalent  to  monies
deposited  in  Court;  that,  therefore,  it  was  for	 the
appellants  to establish before the excise authorities	that
they  had  not	passed on the  incidence  thereof  to  their
customers;  and	 that, since the appellants  had  failed  to
establish  this,  the excise authorities  were	entitled  to
encash the bank guarantees and retain the amounts thereof.
</p><p id="p_8">7.   Mr	 Ganguli relied upon the judgment of this  Court  in
<a href="/doc/823425/" id="a_5">Union of India v.   Jain Spinners Ltd</a>.	1 This was a case in
which  the High Court had, on a writ petition filed  by	 the
assessee, granted interim stay of collection of a demand  of
excise	duty  on condition that the  assessee  deposited  in
court  stated  sums  and for further  clearances  gave	bank
guarantees  for	 the  amounts of the disputed  duty.   By  a
subsequent  order the excise authorities were  permitted  to
withdraw  the  amounts deposited by the assessee  in  court.
The  writ petition filed by the assessee succeeded,  and  it
applied	 to the High Court for refund of the  amounts  which
had been deposited by it and which had been withdrawn by the
excise authorities.  The High Court allowed the application.
The excise authorities filed an appeal in this Court against
the  High  Court's order.  This Court held  that  under	 the
provisions  of	the Act a duty was cast upon  the  Assistant
Collector of Excise to consider the question.  It could	 not
be  disputed  that  the amount which was  deposited  by	 the
assessee  in the High Court and was withdrawn by the  excise
authorities was towards the excise duty which was  assessed.
The  provisions	 of  Section II -B were	 attracted  and	 the
assessee was not entitled to take advantage of the order  by
which  the  deposit  had been made unless  it  succeeded  in
showing to the statutory authorities that it had not  passed
on the whole or any part of the duty in question to  others.
This Court said that if the contentions advanced by  counsel
for the assessee were accepted it would
1    (1992) 4 SCC 389: (1992) 61 ELT 321
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">550</span>
defeat the amended provisions of the Act.  It would then  be
open  to assessees to obtain orders from the courts, as	 had
happened  in the case before it, and, instead of paying	 the
assessed  amount of duty to the authorities, deposit  it  in
court and raise the plea that what it had deposited in court
was not duty and the assessee was entitled to get a  refund,
either directly from the court or, if it had been withdrawn,
from the authorities, notwithstanding that it had passed  on
the duty to others.
</p><p id="p_9">8.   The judgment in the case of Jain Spinners' applies to a
case where excise duty has been deposited in court  pursuant
to  an	interim order and has been withdrawn by	 the  excise
authorities.   In such a case, clearly, the assessee has  to
make  an  application  for  refund  and	 to  such  a   case,
therefore, the provisions of <a href="/doc/128890889/" id="a_6">Section 11-B</a> squarely apply.
</p><p id="p_10">9.   <a href="/doc/15859491/" id="a_7">Section 11</a> -B applies when an assessee claims refund of
excise	duty.  A claim for refund is a claim for  repayment.
It  presupposes that the amount of the excise duty has	been
paid  over to the excise authorities.  It is then  that	 the
excise authorities would be required to repay or refund	 the
excise duty.
</p><p id="p_11">10.  The question, therefore, is whether it can be said that
the  furnishing of a bank guarantee for all or part  of	 the
disputed  excise duty pursuant to an order of the  court  is
equivalent to payment of the amount of the excise duty.	  In
our  view, the answer is in the negative.  For the  purposes
of  securing  the  revenue  in	the  event  of	the  revenue
succeeding  in proceedings before a court, the court,  as  a
condition  of  staying the demand for the  disputed  tax  or
duty, imposes a condition that the assessee shall provide  a
bank  guarantee for the full amount of such tax or  duty  or
part  thereof.	The bank guarantee is required to  be  given
either in favour of the principal administrative officer  of
the  court or in favour of the revenue authority  concerned.
In  the	 event	that the revenue fails	in  the	 proceedings
before the court the question of payment of the tax or duty,
the  amount of which is covered by the bank guarantee,	does
not  arise and, ordinarily, the court, at the conclusion  of
its  order,  directs  that the bank  guarantee	shall  stand
discharged.   Where the revenue succeeds the amount  of	 the
tax  or duty becomes payable by the assessee to the  revenue
and  it is open to the revenue to invoke the bank  guarantee
and demand payment thereon.  The bank guarantee is  security
for the revenue, that in the event the revenue succeeds	 its
dues will be recoverable, being backed by the guarantee of a
bank.  In the event, however unlikely, of the bank refusing,
to  honour  its	 guarantee it would  be	 necessary  for	 the
revenue	 or,  where the bank guarantee is in favour  of	 the
principal administrative officer of the court, that  officer
to file a suit against the bank for the amount due upon	 the
bank guarantee.	 The amount of the disputed tax or duty that
is secured by a bank guarantee cannot, therefore, be held to
be paid to the revenue.	 There is no question of its  refund
and <a href="/doc/128890889/" id="a_8">Section 11-B</a> is not attracted.
</p><p id="p_12">11.  We	 find, therefore, no merit in the  review  petition.
We  reiterate out finding that the bank guarantees given  by
the  appellants were not properly the subject-matter of	 the
writ  petition before the High Court and the High Court	 was
in error in directing the appellants to renew the same.	  We
reiterate
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">551</span>
our direction to the first and second respondents  forthwith
to  repay  to the State Bank of	 Patiala,  Overseas  Branch,
Millar	Gang,  Ludhiana,  the  amount  of  Rs  1,  18,00,000
collected upon the bank guarantees within two weeks.
</p><p id="p_13">12.  The review petition is dismissed.	The first and second
respondents shall pay to the appellants costs quantified  in
the sum of Rs 5000.
</p><p id="p_14">13.  This  order  will	also dispose of I.A. No.  3  in	 the
appeal.
