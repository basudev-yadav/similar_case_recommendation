      JUSTICE PRATHIBA M. SINGH
                      JUDGMENT
</pre><p id="p_1">Prathiba M. Singh, J.
</p><p id="p_2">1.     The present suit has been filed by the Plaintiff, who claims to be a
manufacturer of luxury shoes. The name of the Plaintiff Company -
Christian Louboutin (hereinafter, 'Plaintiff') is based on the name of its
founder, namely Mr. Christian Louboutin, a famous designer of high end
luxury products. The Plaintiff claims that the name, likeness and
photographs of Mr. Louboutin enjoy goodwill and protection under the
Trademarks Act, 1999 (hereinafter, 'TM Act'). The products of the Plaintiff
are worn and preferred by a large number of celebrities. The Plaintiff claims
that it enjoys enormous repute and goodwill in the fashion industry and was
rated amongst top 5 prestigious women's luxury shoe brand. The name

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">CS (COMM) 344/2018                                               Page 1 of 59</span>
 "Christian Louboutin", in word form and logo form, as also the red sole
mark, are registered trademarks in India, and there are various other
applications which are also pending registration. The Plaintiff further claims
that its products are sold only through an authorized network of exclusive
distributors. In India, there are two stores in Mumbai and one in Delhi which
are authorized by the Plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_3">2.     According to the Plaintiff, the Defendants operate a website by the
name www.darveys.com (hereinafter, 'Darveys.com'). It is the Plaintiff's
allegation that the Defendants, offer for sale and sell various products on
their website, bearing the luxury brands/names of the Plaintiff.              The
Defendants' website contains the complete "Christian Louboutin" product
catalogue. The website further claims that the products are 100% authentic.
</p><p id="p_4">3.     As per the plaint, the goods of the Defendants are impaired or are
counterfeits. Apart from offering for sale and selling the Plaintiff's products,
on the website of the Defendants, the image of the founder of the Plaintiff is
also used, and the names "Christian" and "Louboutin" are also used as
meta-tags. By using these meta-tags, the defendants attract traffic to their
website. According to the Plaintiff, the Defendants' website gives an
impression that it is in some manner sponsored, affiliated and approved for
sale of a variety of luxury products bearing the mark of the Plaintiff's
genuine products. This results in infringement of the trademark rights of the
Plaintiff, violation of personality rights of Mr. Christian Louboutin and
dissolution of the luxury status enjoyed by their products and brands.
</p><p id="p_5">4.     This Court had on 26th September, 2014 granted interim relief in the
following terms.
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">           "11. Learned counsel for the plaintiff has referred to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CS (COMM) 344/2018                                                  Page 2 of 59</span>
            various paras of the plaint as well as documents placed
           on record. It appears to the Court that the plaintiff has
           been able to make out a strong prima facie case for
           grant of ex-parte ad-interim order. In case injunction
           is not granted, the plaintiff will suffer irreparable loss
           and injury. The balance of convenience lies in favour
           of the plaintiff and against the defendants. Thus, the
           plaintiff is entitled for ex-parte ad-interim injunction.
           Till the next date of hearing, the defendants, their
           partners, officers, servants, agents, distributors,
           stockists and representatives are restrained from
           selling, offering for sale, advertising, or directly or
           indirectly dealing in footwear and leather goods
           including shoes, handbags, purses, footwear or any
           other goods bearing the registered trademarks of the
           plaintiff or any similar trademark amounting to an
           infringement of registered trademarks of the plaintiff,
           in particular trademark registration No.1644051 for
           word mark CHRISTIAN LOUBOUTIN through their e-
           commerce website www.darveys.com and/or any of
           their outlets and/or during any events or exhibitions or
           in any manner whatsoever or any similar trademark
           amounting to an infringement of plaintiffs' registered
           trademarks, dilution as also passing off.
           Compliance of Order XXXIX Rule 3 CPC be made
           within four days. Dasti."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_6">5.     The Defendants have, thereafter, filed their written statement. The
plea taken in the written statement is that the customer who comes to the
Defendant's website is given a choice of booking products from any of the
287 boutiques/sellers from across the globe. It is categorically averred that
the goods offered are completely genuine and are sold directly by the sellers.
It is claimed that the Defendants are not selling the goods but they merely
enable booking of orders through their online platform. It is further claimed
that no after sales warranty or service is given from the manufacturer and the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CS (COMM) 344/2018                                                  Page 3 of 59</span>
 terms and conditions do not involve the Plaintiff, who are the manufacturers
of the products. The written statement contains some interesting pleadings
on behalf of the Defendants which are as under:
</p><p id="p_7">   a) That the praise for Mr. Christian Louboutin is not within the
       knowledge of the Defendants.
</p><p id="p_8">   b) That the Defendants are not aware about the various types of goods
       marketed by the Plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_9">   c) The Defendants have not had any direct dealings with the Plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_10">   d) The Defendants offer for sale luxury items of different concerns on
       the website, by booking orders only.
</p><p id="p_11">   e) The advertisements for promoting sale are made by the Defendants at
       their own expense without involving the Plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_12">   f) The goods of the Plaintiff were offered for sale on the website of the
       Defendants but the responsibility was taken over by the sellers, on
       whose behalf the goods were offered for sale.
</p><p id="p_13">   g) That     the   website    Darveys.com       offers    products      of     287
       boutiques/sellers from across the globe.
</p><p id="p_14">   h) The goods are imported and are based on the understanding that the
       products are genuine and that the manufacturers are not liable in any
       manner; the name, address of brand owners are displayed.
</p><p id="p_15">   i) There is a disclaimer that the manufacturer does not have any
       responsibility and involvement in the sale process. There is no
       imitation because actual name itself is used.
</p><p id="p_16">   j) The Defendants do not purchase any articles for sale, only book the
        orders on behalf of the sellers whose products they display on their


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CS (COMM) 344/2018                                                     Page 4 of 59</span>
          platform. The names of the sellers are correctly displayed on the
         website.
</p><p id="p_17">     k) It is denied that the products are fake or counterfeits. The Defendant's
        website claims that only products of the original manufacturers are
        being sold.
</p><p id="p_18">     l) The Defendants do not change the physical condition of the product
        and hence there is no impairment.
</p><p id="p_19">     m) That the orders are booked and sent to the foreign sellers to supply the
        goods.
</p><p id="p_20">     n) That the Plaintiffs should issue a warning that its goods are not for
        sale and in that case the Defendant will state that the goods of the
        Plaintiff will not be offered for sale.
</p><p id="p_21">     o) The advertisement of the product is at the risk, responsibility and
        expense of the Defendants and that no commercial connection with
        the Plaintiff is represented.
</p><p id="p_22">     p) That the Defendants offer goods belonging to various other
        manufacturers also. The Defendants claim that the Plaintiffs should
        feel happy about the sale of their products in a legalized manner.
</p><p id="p_23">6.      The Plaintiff, in replication, claims that the Defendants' manner of
use, in fact, alludes to a connection with the Plaintiff due to the following
features on the website.
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">            "i. Use of write-ups of Christian Louboutin on the
            Defendants' website in which the fame of red lacquered
            sole and the charm of the Plaintiffs products are
            acknowledged;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">            ii. The use of the trademark Christian Louboutin in
            enlarged overly conspicuous font size as opposed to a
            normal font size, on their website;
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CS (COMM) 344/2018                                                  Page 5 of 59</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">            iii. Use of meta-keyword-tags with a view to increasing
           the hits which the Defendants' websites obtain from
           search engines like Google;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">           iv. Use of photographs of Mr. Christian Louboutin on
           their website;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">           v. Use of photographs of the Plaintiffs products
           namely, Sweet Charity, Mina Spikes, Body Strass, Miss
           Loubi, etc, on the website of the Defendants;
           vi. Use of characteristic model names of the Plaintiffs
           products namely: Sweet Charity, Mina Spikes, Body
           Strass, Miss Loubi, etc. in respect of their products,
           which model names are distinctive of the Plaintiffs
           products and thus have trademark value;
           vii. Use of the registered trademarks of the Plaintiff, in
           particular the CHRISTIAN LOUBOUTIN word mark
           for tool-tip features on their website, i.e. which appear
           when the cursor or pointer is placed at specific
           locations on the website;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">           viii. Displaying pictures of shoes with red soles (which
           is a registered trademark of the Plaintiff) either with
           the words "Christian Louboutin" or even without the
           words "Christian Louboutin".
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">           ix. A tie-up or arrangement with boutiques belonging
           to the exclusive distribution network of the Plaintiff is
           alluded to in the "About Us" section of the Defendants'
           website www.darveys.com."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_24">7.     A perusal of the pleadings shows that no factual issues arise for
determination in this case. The Plaintiff asserts proprietary rights in the
image of Christian Louboutin, in the name Christian Louboutin, in the red
sole design, in the logo of Christian Louboutin and the write up thereof.
None of these are denied by the Defendants. Since the Defendants' only
case is based on their role as intermediaries who book orders, for which
supplies are effected through various sellers, the only defence put forward
by the Defendant is under <a href="/doc/844026/" id="a_1">Section 79</a> of the Information Technology Act,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">CS (COMM) 344/2018                                                  Page 6 of 59</span>
 2009 (hereinafter, '<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2">IT Act</a>'). The issue of liability under <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_3">Section 79</a> of the IT
Act is to be decided on the basis of pleadings and documents on record,
none of which are disputed by the parties. The website of the Defendants is
admitted. The ownerships of the Plaintiff's marks are not disputed. Hence
this Court, after hearing the parties, is proceeding to decide the suit. Neither
party has any objection to the said course of action. Ld. Counsel for the
Defendant in fact submitted during oral arguments, that the Defendants are
willing to stop sale of any of the Plaintiff's products.
</p><p id="p_25">8.     The following issues arise for decision in the present case.
</p><p id="p_26">       a) Whether the Defendants' use of the Plaintiff's mark, logos and
          image is protected under <a href="/doc/844026/" id="a_4">Section 79</a> of the Information
          Technology Act, 2000?
</p><p id="p_27">       b) Whether the Plaintiff is entitled to relief, and if so, in what terms?
A.     E-commerce platforms and their liability as intermediaries
</p><p id="p_28">9.     Electronic commerce or e-commerce, as it is known in short, is
commerce which takes place online i.e. the purchase-sale of goods/services
and not from physical brick and mortar shops, malls or kirana stores. The
goods are sold through online platforms where the products are displayed
and offered for sale. A customer, who wishes to purchase the product, can
visit the website, browse the hundreds of choices that exist, identify the
products, book an order, and upon delivery of the product, make payment.
In some platforms, however, customers can maintain running accounts and
their credit card or debit card would be automatically charged for the
purchase so made.       So far, the process is quite simple, however, the
conundrum does not end here. Owing to a large variety of products that are
offered by websites, companies running these platforms have arrangements
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">CS (COMM) 344/2018                                                    Page 7 of 59</span>
 with various sellers for supply of products. Some websites display the
names of the sellers transparently and also offer the same products through
different sellers and even assist the customers by providing reviews of all
the various sellers of that product.
</p><p id="p_29">10.    In some instances, once a customer books an order, the same is
transmitted to the seller and the seller supplies the product to the customer.
The payment is, however, made through the online platform. However, in
several online platforms, companies running the website maintain godowns
and warehouses across the country and the world. The order is booked by
the customer on the website. The invoice generated is that of the website
company. The packaging of the product is by the said company.               The
delivery is also by the online platform. The e-commerce Company merely
sources the products from the sellers and stores them in its godowns and
warehouses.     Inventory is maintained by the e-commerce platform. Thus,
the e-commerce platform plays a much more active role.
B.     When can an e-commerce platform be termed as intermediary?
</p><p id="p_30">11.    Does    every   company     which   runs   an   e-commerce      website
automatically come under the definition of intermediary? As per the
<a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_5">Information Technology Act</a>, 2000 (hereinafter, '<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_6">IT Act</a>') an `intermediary'
is defined as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">           "Section 2(w) "intermediary", with respect to any
           particular electronic records, means any person who
           on behalf of another person receives, stores or
           transmits that record or provides any service with
           respect to that record and includes telecom service
           providers, network service providers, internet service
           providers, web-hosting service providers, search
           engines, online payment sites, online-auction sites,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">CS (COMM) 344/2018                                                Page 8 of 59</span>
             online-market places and cyber cafes."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_31">12.     A perusal of the website, Darveys.com, shows that immediately upon
entering the website, a window is opened that it is "members only" website.
It is also claimed that the website only offers luxury brands for members and
the products are obtained from shops in USA and Europe at discounts as
high as 60% are offered. In order to shop on this website, the customer has
to pay Rs.2,000/- and obtain a membership. It proudly proclaims:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">            "Darveys is a members only club. Our members gets an
                   opportunity to browse and shop from our
           exclusive collection at the same time as they are available
                          at the international stores".
</blockquote>
<p id="p_32">13.     The membership fee of Rs.2,000/- is not refundable. It claims that it
provides luxury fashion essentials from over 70 opulent fashion labels, out
of which 30 are available exclusively with Darveys.com. It also clearly
states -
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">             "we offer these exclusive products to our members and
                        provide direct shipment from the
                  international boutiques to their doorstep".
</blockquote>
<p id="p_33">14.     The website also provides what is called an authenticity guarantee,
which states that -
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">                 "We have a tie up with only A-listed authorised
                    luxury local boutiques form across globe,
                 who have been operational for over five years.
      Our authenticity guarantee extends up to return of twice of the money
         to our members in case of lapse in our judgment of a fair deal.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">                So you can ease your stress and rejoice shopping
                         with our transparent dealing."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_34">15.     The term used in this authenticity guarantee, in effect, means that

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">CS (COMM) 344/2018                                                 Page 9 of 59</span>
 genuinity of the product is being guaranteed by the website. The terms
"lapse in our judgment of a fair deal" also means that if the products turn
out to be fake or of not the expected quality, Darveys.com will return twice
the money.
</p><p id="p_35">16.    On shipping information, it is claimed that the shipping is done from
boutiques to the doorstep of the customers; however, an image of a truck
with the name Darveys appears on the website which clearly shows that the
website is, in fact, arranging the transportation of the product. The image of
the truck is set out below.
</p>



<p id="p_36">Upon the customer becoming a registered member, the website, which is run
by Defendant No.3 allots a password and account designation.
</p><p id="p_37">17.    In its terms and conditions, it claims that it facilitates the purchase of
original products such as clothing, footwear, wearable accessories from a
myriad of high-end fashion brands. The website, Darveys.com contains a
disclaimer that there is no connection, affiliation, or economic link with the
brand owner. The disclaimer reads as under:

           connection or control over the brand owner."

<p id="p_38">18.    In the user warranty page, the website claims that warranty and
exchange terms are provided by the respective boutiques/sellers which are
located abroad and the products sold through the website are not subject to
warranty or exchange policy of the respective manufacturers.             In the
warranty section, the website claims that the responsibility is only to check
if the matter given on the website is correct, but no warranty is provided in
respect of quality, tone, truth, unity of any data, matter, product or service.
It also claims that goods offered by Darveys.com are imported and genuine,
which are sold through boutiques/sellers directly to the customers and the
goods do not include any after sale service or warranty as they are not under
the control of Darveys.com. It also claims that sales are made directly by
the boutiques and invoices raised are by the suppliers to the customers. The
relevant warranty conditions are set out below:

            purposes of making the transmission more efficient.

            passive - meaning thereby that the intermediary does not have any
            knowledge or control over the information which is transmitted or
            stored.

<blockquote id="blockquote_26">        d. If any service provider deliberately collaborates with the recipient
          of a service, the exemption no longer applies.
       e. In order for the service provider to continue to enjoy the
          exemption, upon obtaining knowledge of any illegal activity, the
          service provider has to remove or disable access to the
          information.

 automated process for selection of key words. Louis Vuitton objected to the
sponsored links on Google's search engine to websites which were offering
imitation versions of Louis Vuitton products. Similarly, two more
companies, one running a travel arrangement service and another running a
matrimonial agency had raised issues in respect of the Adwords/ sponsored
links provided by Google. Various disputes were referred to the European
Court of Justice, and the Court came to the conclusion that a trademark
owner is entitled to prohibit an advertiser on the Google Adword programme
if the link is originating from a third party. However, if the service provider,
who merely provides the internet reference through a keyword or a sign
identical to the trademark, does not violate <a href="/doc/854952/" id="a_8">Article 51</a> of Director 89/104, or

</blockquote><p id="p_47">26.    One of the leading judgments on the issue of violation of trademark
rights on online platforms is L'Oreal SA &amp; Ors. v. eBay International AG
&amp; Ors. [Case C-324/09 decision dated 12th July, 2011] decided by Court of
Justice of European Union (hereinafter, 'CJEU') on a reference from the
High Court of Justice (England and Wales), Chancery Division (United
Kingdom). The case involved was of sale of L'Oreal perfumes, cosmetics,
hair cutting products on the eBay platform by sellers. The sellers entered
into an agreement with eBay called "Online - Market User Agreement".
The said agreement prohibited the sale of counterfeit items or sale in
volition of trademark rights. The various allegations of L'Oreal were-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_34">       i) That its products were being sold in violation of territorial
          limitations i.e. products which were made for US and other
          territories were being sold in Europe,
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_35">       ii) That some of the products sold on the platform were counterfeit
          products,
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_36">       iii) That eBay was advertising L'Oreal products through the Google
          'Adwords' referencing service.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_48">27.    The CJEU held that the advertising through key-words/Adwords
could constitute "use", however, since the said use was in respect of
products of L'Oreal itself, it would not be in violation of Directive 89/104
and Regulation 14/94. However, in respect of liability of the operator of an
online market place, in order for the internet service provider to be exempted

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">CS (COMM) 344/2018                                                  Page 17 of 59</span>
 from liability under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_13">article 14</a> of the Directive 2000/31 i.e. the E-commerce
Directive, such an operator ought to be intermediary. Following the tests in
Google France (supra) the Court held that eBay processes the data entered
by its sellers. EBay also provides assistance to optimize the sales of the
sellers. The Court distinguishes between the operator of an online market
place who stores the offers for sale on its servers, sets terms of service,
provides general information and is remunerated for the same and an
operator, who optimizes presentations of the offers for sale, promotes offers,
provides them assistance etc. In the former case, the operator would be
entitled to exemption from liability whereas in the latter, it would not be
entitled to exemption.
</p><p id="p_49">28.    The question whether the operator of an online market place is
entitled to the exemption, is based on the role played by the operator i.e.
active or inactive. If the operator provides assistance "which entails, in
particular, optimizing the presentation of the offers for sale in question or
promoting them", even if the operator has not played active role and he
provides the above service, the operator can claim protection as an
intermediary. However, the said intermediary, if upon becoming aware of
the facts which lead to an inference that the offers made on the website were
unlawful, failed to act expeditiously, then the exemption ceases.
</p><p id="p_50">29.    The next question considered by the Court was whether the injunction
ought to be granted. The Court held that the operators of online market
place have a duty not only to bring an end to the infringement but also to
prevent further infringement. Relevant observations are as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_37">                "144. In view of the foregoing, the answer
                to the tenth question is that the third

                 sentence of <a href="/doc/1678224/" id="a_14">Article 11</a> of Directive 2004/48
                must be interpreted as requiring the
                Member States to ensure that the national
                courts with jurisdiction in relation to the
                protection of intellectual property rights
                are able to order the operator of an online
                marketplace to take measures which
                contribute, not only to bringing to an end
                infringements of those rights by users of
                that marketplace, but also to preventing
                further infringements of that kind. Those
                injunctions      must       be      effective,
                proportionate, dissuasive and must not
                create barriers to legitimate trade."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_51">30.    However, the injunctions should not include an active monitoring of
data, the general monitoring obligation would violate <a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_15">Article 3</a> of Directive
2004/48. The Court ought to also ensure that no barriers are created of
legitimate trade. There could not be general and permanent prohibition of
selling on that market place of goods bearing the trademark.
</p><p id="p_52">31.    In contrast in S.A. Louis Vuitton Malletier v. eBay Inc. &amp; Anr.
[General docket no. 2006077799 decision dated 4th December, 2008]
decided by the Commercial Court at Paris and thereafter, affirmed by the
Appellate Court and the Supreme Court of France, in somewhat similar
circumstances, the French Courts have held that eBay had not set up
sufficient measures to combat infringements. For example by not imposing
obligations on the sellers of seeking certificate of authenticity of products,
by not commencing a guilty seller by terminating his accounts and by
withdrawing the illicit advertisements when notified by the trademark
owner. Thus, the Court further held that eBay was wrong in asking
trademark owners for financial contribution to combat counterfeiting. Thus,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">CS (COMM) 344/2018                                                Page 19 of 59</span>
 eBay was guilty of abstention and negligence, which both are tortuous act
for which it owed compensation.
</p><p id="p_53">32.    Thus, in the EU, the national courts have to determine whether the
service provider has played an active role or not, and whether it has
knowledge or control all over the data which is stored by it. If the service
provider has no knowledge, then upon obtaining knowledge of the unlawful
data, if it failed to expeditiously remove the data or disable access, then the
service provider could be liable. The test of whether the service provider is
liable is to determine - Whether the role of the service provider is neutral or
not? Thus, according to the judgements in the EU, in case of online market
places, the injunctions which ought to be passed must be measured and
calculated rather than blanket injunctions.
</p>
<p id="p_54">US Position:
</p><p id="p_55">33.    In Tiffany vs. eBay 600 F.3d 93 (hereinafter, 'Tiffany v. eBay'), the
allegation was that eBay's conduct in facilitating and advertising the sale of
Tiffany's products, which turned out to be counterfeit, constitutes direct and
contributory trademark infringement. The Circuit Judge held that eBay had
taken sufficient steps to reduce the sale of counterfeit items on its websites
and it had also acted in good faith. Whenever informed of counterfeit
products being sold on its website, eBay took them down. eBay had also
permitted Tiffany to disseminate more information about counterfeit
products by providing for Tiffany to create an "About Me" page, on eBay's
platform, which is maintained by Tiffany and not eBay. Due to all these
reasons, the Circuit Judge decided in favour of eBay.
</p><p id="p_56">34.    Before the Court of Appeals, Tiffany alleged that eBay was guilty of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">CS (COMM) 344/2018                                                 Page 20 of 59</span>
 infringement i.e. direct trademark infringement and contributory trademark
infringement. On the former i.e. direct trademark infringement, the Appeals
Court held that eBay was using the mark Tiffany on its platform to describe
accurately genuine Tiffany products offered for sale on its website, and
hence there was no direct infringement. According to the Court, if a mark is
used to signify the genuine product of the trademark owner, it does not
constitute infringing use of a mark.
</p><p id="p_57">35.       However, the more complex question was in respect of contributory
trademark infringement. On this issue, the Appeals Court analysed the
judgment of the USA Supreme Court in Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives
Laboratoes, Inc. 456 U.S. 844 wherein it was held -
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_38">               "if a manufacturer or distributor intentionally induces
               another to infringe a trademark, or if it continues to supply
               its product to one whom it knows or has reason to know is
               engaging in trademark infringement, the manufacturer or
               distributor is contributorially responsible for any harm
               done as a result of the deceit"
</blockquote><p id="p_58">This test for contributory infringement in this judgment is popularly known
as the `Inwood Test'.
</p><p id="p_59">36.       After considering the `Inwood Test', the Appeals Court in Tiffany v.
eBay (supra) had to consider the question as to whether the Inwood test of
contributory infringement could be extended to service providers on the
internet. Various Circuit Courts of the United States had considered the
Inwood test and had come to varying the conclusions: -

                            conduct, it would be liable.2

</blockquote><p id="p_60">37.        The Court of Appeals in Tiffany v. eBay (supra) was considering the
question as to whether contributory infringement applies to an online market
place like eBay. The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court that in
order for eBay to be made liable for contributory trademark infringement,
eBay ought to have had more than a general knowledge that its service was
being used for selling counterfeit goods. The Court of Appeals further
discussed the manner in which the judgment in Sony Corp. of America v.
Universal City Studios, Inc. 464 U.S. 417 (hereinafter, 'Sony') reconsidered
the Inwood test. However, applying the Inwood test read with the decision in
Sony (supra), it held that
                "Thus Tiffany failed to demonstrate that eBay was
                supplying its service to individuals who it knew or had
                reason to know were selling counterfeit Tiffany goods.
</p>
<p id="p_61">38.        On the basis of lack of knowledge, therefore, the Court held that eBay
was not liable. The Court further observed as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_41">                 "Moreover, we agree with the district court that if

                offending listings or the identity of the sellers behind
                them, eBay might very well have been charged with
                knowledge of those sales sufficient to satisfy Inwood's

advertisement, the Court held that since eBay did not sell the counterfeit
Tiffany goods, however, to the extent that eBay advertised the impugned
merchandise, they should be held liable.        Thus, on the issue of false
advertisement, the Court remanded the matter to the District Court. The
relevant observations are as under: -

            inauthentic Tiffany goods. Again, this consideration is
           relevant to Tiffany's direct infringement claim, but less
           relevant, if relevant at all, here. It is true that eBay did
           not itself sell counterfeit Tiffany goods; only the
           fraudulent vendors did, and that is in part why we
           conclude that eBay did not infringe Tiffany's mark. But
           eBay did affirmatively advertise the goods sold through
           its site as Tiffany merchandise. The law requires us to
           hold eBay accountable for the words that it chose
           insofar as they misled or confused consumers. eBay
           and its amici warn of the deterrent effect that will grip
           online advertisers who are unable to confirm the
           authenticity of all of the goods they advertise for sale.
           See, e.g., Yahoo! Inc. Amicus Br. 15; Electronic
           Frontier Foundation et al. Amicus Br. 18-19. We
           rather doubt that the consequences will be so dire. An
           online advertiser such as eBay need not cease its
           advertisements for a kind of goods only because it
           knows that not all of those goods are authentic. A
           disclaimer might suffice. But the law prohibits an
           advertisement that implies that all of the goods offered
           on a defendant's website are genuine when in fact, as
           here, a sizeable proportion of them are not.
           Rather than vacate the judgment of the district court as
           to Tiffany's false advertising claim, we think it prudent
           to remand the cause so that the district court, with its
           greater familiarity with the evidence, can reconsider
           the claim in light of what we have said. The case is
           therefore remanded pursuant to United States v.
           Jacobson, 15 F.3d 19 (2d Cir. 1994), for further
           proceedings for the limited purpose of the district
           court's re-examination of the false advertising claim in
           accordance with this opinion."

incentive to permit listing as it charged a fee for listing and sales through its
platform. But the Court held that the liability of a service provider like eBay

 could be only when it is informed of the infringement but ignores to take
action.
</p><p id="p_64">41.    Thus, there is no uniformity in the manner in which intermediaries
have been treated in different jurisdictions. In fact, some intermediaries
such as eBay have faced varying kinds of decisions.            However, the
underlying principles appear to be the same, in order to determine whether
the intermediary is active or passive, negligent or compliant. All these
questions are to be determined on the basis of role of the operator or the
internet service provider but the trend is clearly that genuine intermediaries
are saddled with lesser responsibilities of compliance upon notice and those
intermediaries, which played active roles, have been held to be liable to pay
monetary compensation.

           complying with the 2009 Rules and the other by the
           Designated Officer when he has to follow an order
           passed by a competent court. The intermediary

           expeditiously remove or disable access to certain

for direct infringement under <a href="/doc/1718389/" id="a_44">Section 51(a)(ii)</a> of the Copyright Act. The

            of activities. These activities carried the immunity
           known as "safe harbor". Such safe harbor provisions
           apply as long as (i) the intermediary establishes,
           publicizes and implements a "Notice and Take Down"
           regime for removing content once a copyright owner
           sends a notice to the intermediary; (ii) there exists a
           system for identifying repeat offenders and removing
           them from the system and (iii) to make provisions for
           technical protection measures. Similarly in the
           European Union including United Kingdom, Internet
           Service Providers are given immunity under the
           European Copyright Directives (ECD). Here the range
           of enterprises covered under "ISP" is much larger and
           includes not just traditional service providers but also
           include hosting services, e-commerce merchants,
           social networking sites, cloud computing services,
           mobile hosts etc. Under the ECD, to maintain
           immunity, the ISP must not initiate the transmission,
           select the receiver of the transmission or modify the
           information contained in the transmission; similarly
           the intermediary is not liable for cached material as
           long as the above factors are complied with. Immunity
           is also subject to the ISP taking down cached content
           once it receives actual knowledge that the original
           source of the information has been removed or access
           to it disabled, or removal or blocking of access has
           been ordered by a competent court or authority. A
           hosting defence is also available to service providers
           which limits liability which may accrue on providing
           information storage services as long as the service
           provider does not have actual knowledge of unlawful
           activity or that upon receiving such knowledge fails to
           act expeditiously to remove or disable access to such

           intent of <a href="/doc/1687472/" id="a_52">Section 79</a> is to ensure that in terms of
           globally accepted standards of intermediary liabilities

           certain minimum standards to avoid liability; it
           provides for an affirmative defence and not a blanket

           Even under <a href="/doc/1038145/" id="a_56">Section 51</a>, the infringement contemplated

           legal norms, intermediaries can attract great liability,
           for no fault of theirs which in the long run would not
           only discourage investment, research and development
           in the Internet sector but also in turn harm the digital
           economy- an economy which is currently growing at a
           tremendous pace and without which life could
           potentially come to a standstill. Surely, such a

            consequence was not intended by Parliament, which
           mindful of techno- legal developments around the
           world created for safe harbor provisions. Another
           aspect is the manner how Internet is accessed. If a
           strict regime is implemented with respect to
           intermediary liability, such intermediaries could
           conveniently migrate to a location where data
           protection laws are not as rigorous and the content
           would still be accessible. Under such circumstances
           while the economic loss is one aspect, it would become
           near impossible to trace intermediaries to take down
           content.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_57">           50. <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_65">Section 79(3)</a> of the IT Act specifies that when a
           person has actual knowledge or upon notification by
           the appropriate government or its authority fails to
           expeditiously remove or disable access to an unlawful
           content then the immunity granted under <a href="/doc/1258314/" id="a_66">Section 79(1)</a>
           is revoked. The knowledge contemplated under this
           section is actual knowledge. In Shreya Singhal
           (supra), <a href="/doc/34465/" id="a_67">Section 79(3)</a> with Rule 3(4) of the Rules were
           read down to mean receipt of actual knowledge from a
           court order or on being notified by the appropriate
           government. However, this was in respect of
           restrictions under <a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_68">Article 19(2)</a> of the Constitution of
           India. The Supreme Court was conscious of the fact
           that if millions of requests for take down are made, it
           would become difficult for intermediaries (such as
           Google) to identify legitimate requests. In the case of
           copyright laws it is sufficient that MySpace receives
           specific knowledge of the infringing works in the
           format provided for in its website from the content
           owner without the necessity of a court order."

<p id="p_71">47.    Insofar as due diligence is concerned, the Court analysed the
Information     Technology    (Intermediaries   Guidelines)   Rules,     2011
(hereinafter, 'Intermediaries Guidelines') and held that the intermediary
should not knowingly host information which is contrary to the said rules.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">CS (COMM) 344/2018                                               Page 32 of 59</span>
<p id="p_72"> The Court concluded as under: -
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_58">            "56.     Furthermore,      under <a href="/doc/411599/" id="a_69">Section    79(2)(b)</a> an
           intermediary should not initiate the transmission,
           select the receiver of the transmission and select or
           modify the information. It is reasonably clear that
           MySpace complies with the first and second sub-
           clauses; it has a "free for all" platform, which by itself
           does not initiate the sharing feature. While it has
           created the "share" option that per se does not mean
           that it "initiates" an action. Content, which is shared
           can be both lawful and unlawful and in any case at a
           prima facie stage, this Court does not discern that
           MySpace initiates the transmission; the usage of that
           feature rests purely in the hands of third party users.
           Similarly it does not choose its audience/ receiver.
           Anyone with Internet access can open its website and
           be a receiver/viewer of the data being transmitted.
           Now, on the third sub-clause of whether MySpace
           selects or modifies information, this court at a prima
           facie stage finds that firstly the modification is to the
           format and not to the content and secondly even the
           process of modifying the format is an automatic
           process without either MySpace's tacit or expressed
           control or knowledge. In the circumstances this Court
           concludes that MySpace prima facie complies with the
           requirements of <a href="/doc/411599/" id="a_70">Section 79(2)(b)</a>.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_59">           57. The other aspect that needs to be complied with is
           the "due diligence" clause under <a href="/doc/411599/" id="a_71">Section 79(2)(c)</a>.
           Here once again, the Intermediary Rules are relevant-
           especially Rule 79(3). MySpace's website - for
           purposes of viewing does not require the user
           subscription to its terms and conditions. However, for
           the purpose of uploading, sharing, commenting etc.
           subscription with MySpace is needed and for this
           purpose an agreement is entered into between the
           parties. To comply with the due diligence procedure
           specified in the Rules, MySpace has to publish its rules,
           regulations, privacy policy and user agreement for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">CS (COMM) 344/2018                                                  Page 33 of 59</span>
            access of usage. These agreements and policies on the
           appellant's website must comply with Sub Rule 2 of the
           Rules. MySpace has annexed its user agreements and
           privacy policies which suggest due compliance with the
           said rules. It requires its users to comply with its
           privacy policy and user agreements before they can
           create their accounts with the appellant in order to
           modify, add, host, upload, and transmit etc. their data.
           This however, does not end the list of duties MySpace
           has to follow. There are several users who may agree
           to the terms and conditions and still upload infringing
           content. Under <a href="/doc/34465/" id="a_72">Section 79(3)</a> read with Rule 3(4) of the
           Rules posit an intermediary on receiving "actual
           knowledge" or upon obtaining knowledge from the
           affected person in writing or through email to act
           within 36 hours of receiving such information disable
           access to such information. If copyright owners, such
           as SCIL inform MySpace specifically about infringing
           works and despite such notice it does not take down the
           content, then alone is safe harbor denied. However, it
           is for SCIL to show that despite giving specific
           information the appellant did not comply with its
           notice."

SCIL. Para 68 of MySpace (supra) reads as under: -

PTC 551 (Del) (hereinafter, 'Kent RO Systems SJ'), a learned single Judge
of this Court had the occasion to consider the role of eBay in a case of
design infringement. The Court noticed that upon receipt of the order by the
Court, to block access to the URLs where the infringing products were
located, eBay implemented the same and removed the offending products
from website. However, the Plaintiff contended that eBay ought to not only
devise a mechanism of pulling down any products when it was notified that
the goods were counterfeit, but should also screen other content being
hosted on its portal for such infringement. In this context, the Court held as
under: -
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_64">           "30. To hold that an intermediary, before posting any
           information on its computer resources is required to
           satisfy itself that the same does not infringe the
           intellectual property rights of any person, would
           amount to converting the intermediary into a body to
           determine whether there is any infringement of
           intellectual property rights or not. All persons claiming

            any intellectual property rights will then, intimate the
           intermediaries of their claims and the intermediaries
           then, before hosting any material on their computer
           resources would be required to test the material vis-a-
           vis all such claims lodged with them, else would be
           liable for infringement.

           Rules, according to me do not oblige the intermediary
           to, of its own, screen all information being hosted on
           its portal for infringement of the rights of all those
           persons who have at any point of time complained to

</blockquote><p id="p_76">51.    In the context of whether eBay can be directed to devise a programme
for detecting infringement and piracy, unless the Plaintiff proves that there is
an abetment, aiding or conspiracy, an intermediary cannot be expected to
exercises any vigilance. The Court observed that: -
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_66">            "35. ...... Merely because intermediary has been
           obliged under the IT Rules to remove the infringing

           of immoveable property or of publisher of a newspaper
           or magazine in physical form and that whether an
           owner of immoveable property can be required to keep

situations including in the case of uploading of content by users, copyright
infringement and violation of design rights. However, the position that is

<p id="p_81"> Nature of E-commerce websites and the legal position:
</p><p id="p_82">55.    E-commerce websites are of different kinds. There are several
platforms which have transparent privacy policies, takedown policies and
IPR policies. They also have a dedicated unit dealing with complaints of IP
owners. They also reveal complete details of the sellers who are actually
placing their wares for sale on the platform. However, some e-commerce
platforms do not have all these features. The sellers' full names are
unknown, and the sellers, are on a large number of occasions located in
foreign countries. The website does not give the warranty and neither does
the seller. There are certain platforms which promote their own affiliate
sellers on their own market place. They are however not shown as affiliated
companies on their platforms. Some platforms also offer enormous logistic
support such as storage facilities, transportation, delivery, guarantees of
authenticity and warranties, exchange, after sales service, etc. Some
platforms raise invoices in the name of the service provider. Payments are
collected by the platforms. There are several online market places which
simply provide a platform for the user to upload his/her information for
further dissemination. For example, auction websites, where one user
uploads the photos of his products, and labels it with a price, and another
user simply accepts to purchase it on as is where is basis from the said seller.
Such a record of that product could be transmitted through the website and
would constitute receipt, storage or transmission. The question is whether in
these cases the operators of these platforms can continue to qualify as
intermediaries or not.

 active participation in the trade? These are the questions that arise in the
present case.
</p><p id="p_86">59.    Further it has to be also seen as to whether the platform is taking
adequate measures to ensure that no unlawful acts are committed by the
sellers. For this the following issues, inter alia, need to be factored:
  i.   The terms of the agreements entered into between the sellers and the
       platform;
</p><p id="p_87"> ii.   The manner in which the terms are being enforced;
</p><p id="p_88">iii.   The consequences of violation of the terms;

       trademarks are protected;
</p><p id="p_90"> v.    Whether the platforms have knowledge of the unlawful acts of the
       seller;
</p><p id="p_91">60.    Darveys.com does not disclose the details of the foreign sellers or
where they purchase the products from. The sellers are not subject to the
jurisdiction of this court. It is only a claim that the products are genuine. It
has a membership fee for its customers. The policy which is available on
Darveys.com shows that if the products turn out to be counterfeit,
Darveys.com will return twice the money. Is Darveys.com an intermediary
and is the Darveys.com platform entitled to exemption under <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_88">Section 79</a> of
the Act?
</p><p id="p_92">61.    The policies which are discussed above shows that Darveys.com
exercises complete control over the products. Darveys.com is in fact
identifying the sellers, enabling the sellers actively, promoting them and
selling the products in India. The role of Darveys.com is much more than
that of an intermediary.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">CS (COMM) 344/2018                                                   Page 42 of 59</span>
<p id="p_93"> 62.    While the so-called safe harbour provisions for intermediaries are
meant for promoting genuine businesses which are inactive intermediaries,
and not to harass intermediaries in any way, the obligation to observe due
diligence, coupled with the intermediary guidelines which provides
specifically that such due diligence also requires that the information which
is hosted does not violate IP rights, shows that e-commerce platforms which
actively conspire, abet or aide, or induce commission of unlawful acts on
their website cannot go scot free.
</p><p id="p_94">63.    The elements summarised above would be key to determining
whether an online marketplace or an e-commerce website is conspiring,
abetting, aiding or inducing and is thereby contributing to the sale of
counterfeit products on its platform. When an e-commerce website is
involved in or conducts its business in such a manner, which would see the
presence of a large number of elements enumerated above, it could be said
to cross the line from being an intermediary to an active participant. In such
a case, the platform or online marketplace could be liable for infringement in
view of its active participation. Needless to add, e-commerce websites and
online marketplaces ought to operate with caution if they wish to enjoy the
immunity provided to intermediaries. The question, however, would have to
be determined after reviewing the practices of various websites under the
facts and circumstances of a particular case.
</p><p id="p_95">64.    So long as they are mere conduits or passive transmitters of the
records or of the information, they continue to be intermediaries, but merely
calling themselves as intermediaries does not qualify all e-commerce
platforms or online market places as one.

<p id="p_99"> 68.    <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_94">Section 79(1)</a> is also qualified by sub-<a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_95">Section 79(3)</a>. The exemption

is contributing in the commission of the unlawful act. The words conspired,
abetted, aided or induced have to be tested on the basis of the manner in
which the business of the platform is conducted and not on a mere claim by
the platform. <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_97">Section 79(3)</a> has two dimensions i.e., <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_98">Section 79(3)(a)</a> and
<a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_99">Section 79(3)(b)</a>. The latter relates to having a policy to take down

 intermediary but the same is not conclusive. What is lawful or unlawful
depends on the specific statute being invoked and the Guidelines cannot be
considered as being exhaustive in their manner of application to all statutes.
</p><p id="p_103">72.    The factors enumerated above are in-line with the test which applies
for determining whether there is `use' of a mark under Section 2(2)(c) of the
Trademarks Act, 1999, or `falsification of a mark' or `false application of a
mark' under Sections 101 and 102 of the TM Act, 1999. The statute is very
broad in construing use, falsification and false application. While use for
goods is broad and would include any physical or in any other relation
whatsoever to goods, even use in respect of services is quite broad i.e. it
includes the provision, performance or making availability of services.
Would services provided in respect of sale of counterfeit goods constitute
use of a mark? The answer to this question depends on <a href="/doc/545792/" id="a_110">Section 2(w)</a> of the
IT Act. In the context of an intermediary, it could provide any service and
enjoy exemption only if the constituents of <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_111">Section 79</a> of the IT Act are
satisfied.
</p><p id="p_104">73.    In order to decide whether there is abetment, aid or inducing or
authorizing communication of an unlawful act, Sections 101 and 102 of the
TM Act would also be of relevance. These Sections reads as under:

overriding effect. The provision reads as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_141">           "<a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_114">Section 81</a> - Act to have overriding effect. - The

           1970."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_107">76.    The overriding nature of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_117">IT Act</a> has application only if the
provisions of the Trade Mark Act are inconsistent with the provisions of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">CS (COMM) 344/2018                                                  Page 54 of 59</span>
 <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_118">IT Act</a>. The Intermediary Guidelines 2011 themselves require compliance
with the TM Act by the persons to host, display or upload the products or
services. The provisions of <a href="/doc/176471/" id="a_119">Section 29</a>, <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_120">Section 101</a> and Section 102 of the
TM Act, are being looked at in order to interpret as to what constitutes
'conspiring, abetting, aiding or inducing' the commission of an unlawful
act, in the context of trade mark rights. The provisions of the TM Act are not
in any manner inconsistent with the provisions of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_121">IT Act</a>. Hence <a href="/doc/1039298/" id="a_122">Section
81</a> of the IT Act does not grant any immunity to intermediaries who may be
in violation of the provisions of the TM Act. While, use of a mark for any of
the purposes elaborated above, in respect of genuine goods of the owner
would not be infringement, the performance of any service as elaborated
above, in respect of counterfeit goods or goods which are not genuine, could
constitute infringement.
</p><p id="p_108">77.    Thus, for illustration purpose, any online market place or e-commerce
website, which allows storing of counterfeit goods, would be falsifying the
mark. Any service provider, who uses the mark in an invoice thereby giving
the impression that the counterfeit product is a genuine product, is also
falsifying the mark. Displaying advertisements of the mark on the website so
as to promote counterfeit products would constitute falsification. Enclosing
a counterfeit product with its own packaging and selling the same or
offering for sale would also amount to falsification. All these acts would aid
the infringement or falsification and would therefore bring the e-commerce
platform or online market place outside the exemption provided under
<a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_123">Section 79</a> of the IT Act.
</p><p id="p_109">78.    Thus, the various factors that are enumerated in the paragraphs above
and the absence/presence of the said factors would hold the key to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">CS (COMM) 344/2018                                                Page 55 of 59</span>
 determining whether an e-commerce website is actually an intermediary or
not. When an e-commerce company claims exemption under <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_124">Section 79</a> of
the IT Act, it ought to ensure that it does not have an active participation in
the selling process. The presence of any elements which shows active
participation could deprive intermediaries of the exemption.
</p><p id="p_110">79.    In the world of e-commerce, IP owners face challenging times. This is
because sellers of counterfeit or infringing products seek shelter behind the
platform's legitimacy, like in the case of Darveys.com. Darveys.com is
involved in the promotion and sale of luxury products. The seller is located
on a foreign shore. It is not even clear as to whether the seller is in fact
selling a genuine product. As stated above, Darveys.com promotes the
products to its members who sign up on Darveys.com. Without becoming a
member, one cannot effect a purchase on Darveys.com. In such cases giving
exemptions of <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_125">Section 79</a> would in fact amount to legalizing the infringing
activity. The seller is not known, the person from whom the seller purchases
the goods is not known. It is also not known if the product is genuine,
though Darveys.com represents to be same to be genuine. In view of these
factors, Darveys.com cannot be termed as an intermediary that is entitled to
protection under <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_126">Section 79</a> of the IT Act. The use of the mark, Christian
Louboutin, the name, the photograph of the founder, without the permission
of the Plaintiff, and without ensuring that the products which are sold are in
fact genuine, would constitute violation of Plaintiff's rights. The Defendant
has relied on a judgement of a Ld. Single Judge in Christian Louboutin v.
Abubacker 250 (2018) DLT 475 the court was considering protection for the
red sole trademark. In the said judgement the court held that the red sole
mark is not distinctive as there can be no monopoly on the colour red. The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">CS (COMM) 344/2018                                                 Page 56 of 59</span>
 present suit does not relate to the red sole mark in isolation but the use of the
plaintiffs marks, name of its name of its founder, use of the words
constituting the mark in various ways including on the website, images,
packaging material, invoice etc. by the Defendant which is an e-commerce
platform. Thus the said judgement does not help the Defendant in the
present case.
</p><p id="p_111">80.    Meta-tagging: The plaintiff has relied upon a judgement in respect of
meta-tags. A single judge of the Delhi High Court has held that use of meta-
tags is illegal as it enables the Defendant to ride on the reputation of the
Plaintiff. Meta tags are links which are provided using keywords. If a trade
name is used as a keyword and a link is provided, the website comes up
whenever a customer searches for the said trade mark. The trade mark used
in the code as a keyword is invisible to the end-user or customer. Such use,
though invisible to the customer, has been held to be illegal in the case of
Kapil Wadhwa Vs. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. 194 (2012) DLT 23.The
Plaintiff claims that when a web user enters the Plaintiff's mark in a search
engine such as Google, Darveys.com website is amongst the search results
and an analysis of the code shows that the marks of the Plaintiff are used as
meta-keyword-tags, with a view to increasing the hits which the Defendant's
website obtains from search engines like Google.
</p><p id="p_112">81.    The trademark owner loses its huge customer base especially in the
case of luxury products. If the products turn out to be counterfeit or not up to
the mark, then it is the trademark owner's brand equity which is diluted. The
seller himself does not suffer. Such immunity is beyond what is
contemplated to intermediaries under <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_127">Section 79</a> of the IT Act. While
<a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_128">Section 79</a> of the IT Act is to protect genuine intermediaries, it cannot be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">CS (COMM) 344/2018                                                  Page 57 of 59</span>
 abused by extending such protection to those persons who are not
intermediaries and are active participants in the unlawful act. Moreover, if
the sellers themselves are located on foreign shores and the trade mark
owner cannot exercise any remedy against the said seller who is selling
counterfeits on the e-commerce platform, then the trade mark owner cannot
be left remediless.
</p><p id="p_113">82.     The suit is thus decreed in the following terms:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_143">        i.   Darveys.com is directed with immediate effect, to disclose the
