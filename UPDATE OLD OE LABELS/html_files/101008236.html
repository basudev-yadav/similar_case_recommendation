learned Single Judge dismissing W.P.(C) No.8532/2011 preferred by the

appellant. The said writ petition was filed by the appellant assailing the

order dated 27.09.2011 of the Central Information Commission (CIC)

allowing the appeal of the respondent.

2005, sought from the appellant the actual marks secured by his daughter in

each subject for the reason "this information will help me to identify her

week areas in studies and take timely action, so that she can pursue her

career after XII.    I hereby certify that I will neither reveal the above

information to her nor put any pressure on her."
</p>
<p id="p_6">4.    The Information Officer of the appellant informed the respondent that

with the introduction of the grading system at secondary examination with

effect from the year 2010, the appellant had done away with intimating

marks and therefore the information sought could not be provided.

</p><p id="p_7">5.    The respondent preferred the statutory first appeal which was

dismissed observing that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      i)     the National Policy on Education 1986 and Programme of

             Action 1992 had provided for recasting of the examination

             system and suggested that grades be used in place of marks;

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">      ii)    that the National Curriculum Framework 2005 also envisaged

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">LPA No.1090/2011                                               Page 2 of 11</span>
               an evaluation system which would grade the students on their

              regular activities in the classroom and enable students to

              understand and focus on their learning gaps and learn through

              these as part of Formative Assessment;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">      iii).   that the introduction of grades in the examination had been

              debated by the appellant also and after holding countrywide

              consultations and deliberations with eminent educationists and

              experts, the nine point grading system had been introduced in

              the secondary school examination from the year 2010;

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">      iv).    The system of declaring subject wise marks had thus been

              replaced by subject wise grades and grade point;

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">      v).     the purpose of introducing the grading system was to take away

              the frightening judgmental quality of marks, to lead to a stress

              free and joyful learning environment and was intended to

              minimize mis-classification of students on the basis of marks,

              to eliminate unhealthy cut-throat competition and to reduce

              societal pressure etc.

      The order denying information as to marks was thus upheld.

</blockquote><p id="p_8">6.    The respondent pursued the matter before the CIC. It was the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">LPA No.1090/2011                                                 Page 3 of 11</span>
 contention of the appellant before the CIC also that, to provide specific

marks would be contrary to the policy of introducing the grading system

and would undo the grading system. However the appellant, on enquiry by

the CIC, confirmed that the marks awarded were available with the

appellant in their data. The CIC held that since, the marks were available

with the appellant and since none of the exemptions under the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_2">RTI Act</a> were

attracted to support the non disclosure thereof, the appellant was bound to

and directed to provide the information sought.
</p>
<p id="p_9">7.    It was the argument of the appellant before the learned Single Judge

also that disclosure of the marks would dilute and defeat the grading system.

The learned Single Judge however held that since the respondent was

seeking disclosure of marks, only of his daughter and further since his

daughter who has since attained majority had also consented to the same

and since the respondent was not seeking disclosure of marks obtained by

other students and further since the appellant was possessed of the

information sought, it was required to disclose the same. It was further

observed that a student is entitled to know the marks secured by him / her.

</p><p id="p_10">8.    Notice of this appeal was issued and the operation of the impugned

order stayed. The respondent appearing in person has been heard. Though

 opportunity was given to the appellant to file written arguments but no

written arguments were filed.
</p>
<p id="p_11">9.    The documents filed by the appellant show that the appellant, vide its

letter dated 29.09.2009 to the Heads of all the Institutions affiliated to it,

while introducing the system of Grading at Secondary School level,

explained the evaluation process as under:

              shall be provided to the schools on demand."

</blockquote><p id="p_13"> 10.   The appellant has also placed before us the judgment of Division

 Bench of this Court in Independent Schools' Federation of India (Regd.)

 Vs. Central Board of Secondary Education 183(2011) DLT 211 upholding

 the grading system introduced by the appellant and dismissing the challenge

 thereto. The challenge to the grading system, in the said proceeding also

 was inter alia on the ground that replacing marks by grades was only a

 cosmetic change and would mar the quality of education and the concept of

 grading was virtually an eye-wash. Needless to state that the said challenge

 was also found to be without any basis and rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_14">11. What we find to have prevailed with the CIC and the learned Single Judge

  is that, despite introduction of grading system, marks existed with the

  appellant; it was held that once the information sought was available, there

  could be no denial thereof. What also prevailed was that the respondent

  was seeking marks only of his ward and not of other students and thus there

  could be no objection to disclosure thereof. The CIC also observed that the

  information sought was not exempt.
</p>
<p id="p_15">

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> LPA No.1090/2011                                                 Page 6 of 11</span>
</p><p id="p_16"> 12.   We are unable to agree; we feel that the CIC as well as the learned

Single Judge, by directing disclosure of „marks‟, in the regime of „grades‟

have indeed undone what was sought to be done by replacing marks with

grades and defeated the very objective thereof. The objective, in replacing

the marks with grades, as can be gathered from the documents on record,

was to grade students in a bandwidth rather than numerically; it was felt that

difference, between a student having 81% and a student having 89%, could

be owing to subjectivity in marking and there was no reason to otherwise

consider a bearer of 81 percentile to be inferior to a bearer of 89 percentile

and there was no reason to treat them differently. It was thus decided to

place both in grade A2 with grade point 9 as aforesaid. Though ideally, the

examiner in such cases ought to give both of them grade A2 only, without

giving them 81% and 89% as aforesaid but it appears that since the teachers

and examiners also, owing to the long past practice were used to marking

instead grading students, for their guidance, the range was prescribed as

aforesaid. Thus it appears that though the marks are available but in law

and fact they ought not to have been available. The marks appear to be

available with the appellant only owing to the examiners and teachers being

not immediately accustomed to grading and for their convenience.



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">LPA No.1090/2011                                                 Page 7 of 11</span>
</p><p id="p_17"> 13.   The question which arises is, whether the information which ought

not to have been there as per the changed policy upheld by the Court can be

treated as information within the meaning of the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_3">RTI Act</a>. In our opinion

no. Information which is forbidden by law or information of a nature, if

disclosed, would defeat the provisions of any law or disclosure whereof is

opposed to public policy, cannot be regarded as „lawful‟ and is to be ignored

and no disclosure thereof can be made or directed to be made.

</p><p id="p_18">14.   No doubt, as the CIC also has observed, none of the clauses of

<a href="/doc/758550/" id="a_4">Section 8</a>, if literally interpreted, are attracted. However while interpreting a

statutory provision, we cannot shut our eyes to hard realities, to what was

sought to be achieved thereby and cannot in a pedantic manner allow the

literal interpretation to run amock and create a situation not intended by the

statute. Moreover, a reading of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_5">RTI Act</a> in the manner

done by the CIC and the learned Single Judge would bring it in conflict with

other laws and notwithstanding the overriding effect given thereto by

<a href="/doc/1971086/" id="a_6">Section 22</a> thereof, the first attempt has to be to harmonise its provisions

with other laws. Once a purposive interpretation is given to <a href="/doc/758550/" id="a_7">Section 8</a>, it will

be found that information forbidden to be published [<a href="/doc/26532/" id="a_8">Section 8(1)(b)</a>] and

information available in fiduciary relationship [<a href="/doc/1494553/" id="a_9">Section 8(1)(e)</a>] is exempt.



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">LPA No.1090/2011                                                   Page 8 of 11</span>
 In our opinion, even though there is no express order of any court of law

forbidding publication of marks [as is the want of <a href="/doc/26532/" id="a_10">Section 8(1)(b)</a>] but the

effect of bringing the regime of grades in place of marks and of dismissal of

challenge thereto, is to forbid publication/disclosure of marks. Similarly, in

the evaluation process prescribed by appellant, for guidance of its

examiners, marks are only to arrive at a grade, perhaps as aforesaid to

acquaint the examiners with the grading system and as a transitory stage in

the shift from marks to grades.
</p>
<p id="p_19">15.   The Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1596595/" id="a_11">Kailash Chand v. Dharam Das</a> (2005) 5 SCC

375 reiterated that a statute can never be exhaustive and legislature is

incapable of contemplating all possible situations which may arise in future

litigation and in myriad circumstances and it is for the Court to interpret the

law with pragmatism and consistently with demands of varying situations.

The legislative intent has to be found out and effectuated. Earlier also in

<a href="/doc/102494937/" id="a_12">Smt. Pushpa Devi v. Milkhi Ram</a> (1990) 2 SCC 134 the same sentiment

was expressed by holding that law as creative response should be so

interpreted to meet the different fact situations coming before the court, for

Acts of Parliament were not drafted with divine prescience and perfect

clarity and when conflicting interests arise, the court by consideration of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">LPA No.1090/2011                                                  Page 9 of 11</span>
 legislative intent must supplement the written word with force and life. Lord

Denning (in Seaford Estate Ltd. v. Asher (1949) 2 KB 481) observing that

the judge must consciously seek to mould the law so as to serve the needs of

time and must not be a mere mechanic, was quoted with approval.

</p><p id="p_20">16.   The Supreme Court recently in <a href="/doc/1548289/" id="a_13">The Institute of Chartered

Accountants of India v. Shaunak H. Satya</a> (2011) 8 SCC 781, in the

context of the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_14">RTI Act</a> itself held that in achieving the objective of

transparency and accountability of the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_15">RTI Act</a> other equally important

public interests including preservation of confidentiality of sensitive

information, are not to be ignored or sacrificed and that it has to be ensured

that the revelation of information in actual practice, does not harm or

adversely affect other public interests including of preservation of

confidentiality of sensitive information. We have already held above that

disclosure of marks, which though exists with the appellant would amount

to allowing play to the policy earlier prevalent of marking the examinees.

Merely because the appellant/its examiners for the purpose of grading, first

mark the students would not compel this court to put at naught or to allow

full play to the new policy of grades.
</p>
<p id="p_21">17.   No weightage can also be given to the submission of the respondent



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">LPA No.1090/2011                                                 Page 10 of 11</span>
 that the marks even if disclosed would not be used for any other purpose.

Such an offer cannot be enforced by the Court and the Court cannot on the

basis thereof allow disclosure of something which was not intended to exist

in the first place. The possibility of the respondent and his ward, in securing

admission and for other purposes using the said information to secure an

advantage over others cannot be ruled out.
</p>
<p id="p_22">18.   We are therefore unable to agree with the reasoning of the CIC and of

the learned Single Judge and allow this appeal. We hold the information,

disclosure of which was sought, to be no information and also exempt from

disclosure. We allow this appeal as well as the writ petition preferred by the

respondent and set aside the order dated 27.09.2011 of the CIC.

</p><p id="p_23">      No order as to costs.
