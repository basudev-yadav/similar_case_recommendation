HEADNOTE:
By  <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_4">article 2</a> of the New York Convention on the	 Recognition
and  Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, 1958, to  which
India  was  a  party,  each  contracting  State,  agreed  to
recognise  an agreement in writing under which	the  parties
thereto	 undertook to submit to arbitration dispute  between
them and the Court of a contracting State when seized of  an
action in a matter in respect of which parties have made  an
agreement "shall at the request of one of the parties  refer
the  parties to arbitration".  To implement this  Convention
Parliament  enacted  the  Foreign  Awards  (Recognition	 and
<a href="/doc/631834/" id="a_5">Enforcement) Act</a> XLV of 1961 <a href="/doc/1891982/" id="a_6">Section 3</a> of the Act  provides,
inter  alia,  that "if any party to a  submission  made,  in
pursuance  of an agreement" commences any legal	 proceedings
in  any Court any other party to the submission may  at	 any
time after appearance and before filing a written  statement
or  taking  any other step in the proceedings apply  to	 the
Court  to  stay	 the  proceedings  and	the  Court,   unless
satisfied  that the agreement is null and void,	 inoperative
or incapable of being performed. shall make an order staying
the proceedings.
In respect of a contract entered into by the respondent,  an
Indian	Firm,  with  the  appellant,  a	 Russian  firm,	 the
respondent  instituted	a  suit in  the	 Madras	 High  Court
alleging  breach of contract.  Thereafter the  Russian	firm
instituted  proceedings in terms of the arbitral  clause  in
the contract before the Foreign Trade Arbitration Commission
of  the	 U.S.S.R Chamber of Commerce, Moscow.	The  Russian
firm  also  entered appearance, under  protest,	 before	 the
Madras High Court and on the same date filed an	 application
under <a href="/doc/1891982/" id="a_7">section 3</a> of the Act for stay of the suit.  The Indian
firm   filed  an  application  for  an	interim	  injunction
restraining  the Russian firm from taking -any further	part
in  the arbitration proceedings at Moscow.  The	 High  Court
dismissed the application filed by the Russian firm for stay
of the suit and granted the interim injunction sought by the
Indian	firm.	In  appeal to this Court,  the	Indian	firm
contended  that	<a href="/doc/1891982/" id="a_8"> s. 3</a> of the: Act could be  invoked  by	 the
Russian	 firm  only if it had  implemented  the	 arbitration
agreement   by	 actually  submitting	the,   dispute	 for
arbitration  prior to the institution of the suit.   On	 the
questions  (i)	whether	 the words  "a	submission  made  in
pursuance of an agreement" ill <a href="/doc/1891982/" id="a_9">section 3</a> of the Act meant an
actual	 or   completed	 reference  made  pursuant   to	  an
arbitration agreement or they meant an arbitration agreement
that  has  come	 into existence as a  result  of  commercial
contract and (ii) whether the courts in India could grant an
injunction  restraining	 a party in Moscow  from  proceeding
with the conduct of arbitration before a tribunal there,
54
HELD : (Per Shah and Grover, JJ.)
The   word  "submission"  in  <a href="/doc/1891982/" id="a_10">section  3</a>  means	 an   actual
submission made in pursuance of an arbitration agreement  or
arbitral  clause  to which the Convention  setforth  in	 the
Schedule to the Act applies.  If submission means "agreement
to refer" or an arbitral clause in a commercial contract  it
makes the entire set of words unintelligible and  completely
ambiguous.  It is difficult to comprehend in that case,	 why
the legislature should have used the words which follow	 the
term   "submission",  namely  "made  in	 pursuance   of	  an
agreement".   If  by  "agreement"  is  meant  a	  commercial
contract  the words "made in pursuance of" convey no  sense.
The difficulties disappear if the word submission, is  given
the meaning of an actual submission of a particular  dispute
to  the	 authority of an arbitrator.  There is no  rule.  of
interpretation	 by  which  rank  ambiguity  can  be   first
introduced  by	giving	certain	 expressions  a	  particular
meaning	 and  then an attempt can be made to emerge  out  of
semantic  confusion  and obscurity by having resort  to	 the
presumed  intention  of the legislature to  give  effect  to
international obligations.  In this country, as is the	case
in England, a treaty or international protocol or convention
does  not become operative by its own force unless  domestic
legislation has been introduced to attain a specific result.
Once Parliament has legislated the court must first look  at
the  legislation and construe the language employed  in	 it.
If  statutory enactments are clear in meaning they  must  be
construed  according.to their meaning even though  they	 are
contrary  to the comity of nations or international law.   A
clear  deviation  from the rigid and strict  rule  that	 the
courts must stay a suit whenever an international commercial
arbitration,  as  contemplated	by  the	 protocol  and	 the
Conventions, was to take place, is to be found in <a href="/doc/1891982/" id="a_11">Section 3</a>.
It  is	of  a  nature which is	common,	 to  all  provisions
relating to stay in English and Indian arbitration laws, the
provision  being that the application to the Court for	stay
of the suit must be made by a party before tiling a  written
statement  or taking any other step in the proceedings.	  If
the  condition is not fulfilled no stay can be granted.	 [65

(Per  Ramaswami, J. dissenting.) The expression	 "submission
made  in pursuance of an agreement" in <a href="/doc/1891982/" id="a_12">section 3</a> has  to  be
construed in its historical setting.  The word	"submission"
must be interpreted to mean tile arbitral clause itself	 and
the  word  "agreement"	as the commercial  or  the  business
agreement which includes or embodies that clause.  In  other
words  the  word "submission" in the opening  words  of	 the
section	 means an agreement to refer to arbitration and	 the
words "the agreement to which the convention setforth in the
schedule  applies" means the business agreement or  contract
containing  the arbitral clause.  It follows therefore	that
if  there is an arbitral clause whether this is followed  by
actual	reference to arbitration or not, the very  existence
of this clause in the commercial agreement would render	 the
stay  of  the suit mandatory under <a href="/doc/1891982/" id="a_13">section 3</a>. This  view  is
considered  with  the rule of construction that	 as  far  as
practicable municipal law must be interpreted by the  courts
in  conformity with international obligations which the	 law
may  seek  to effectuate., It is well settled  that  if	 the
language  of  a section is ambiguous or is capable  of	more
than one meaning the protocol itself becomes relevant,	for,
there is a prima facie presumption that Parliament does	 not
intend to act in breach of international law including
			     55
specific  treaty obligations.  <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_14">Article, 2</a> of the  convention
imposes	 a  duty on the court of a  contracting	 state	when
seized	 of  such  an  action  to  refer  the	parties	  to
arbitration.  <a href="/doc/1891982/" id="a_15">Section 3</a> must therefore be read in consonance
with this international obligation.  The doctrine of literal
intepretation is not always the best method for ascertaining
the   intention	  of  Parliament.   The	  better   rule	  of
interpretation	is that a statute should be so construed  as
to prevent the mischief and advance the remedy according  to
the true intent of the makers of the statute. [79 C-G; 85 C]

(ii) (Per  Shah	 and  Grover,  JJ.)  The  point	 about	the.
Russian	 firm  having  no representative in  India  was	 not
agitated before the High Court and the position taken up  in
the  plaint  was  that	the-Russian  firm  was	carrying  on
business in the U.S.S.R. and at Madras.	 The principle;	 em-
bodied	in <a href="/doc/1912867/" id="a_20"> s.	35</a>  the	 Arbitration  Act,  1940  cannot  be
completely   ignored  while  considering  the  question	  of
injunction.  In the present case when the suit is not  being
stayed	under <a href="/doc/1891982/" id="a_21">section 3</a> of the Act it would be	contrary  to
the  principle underlying<a href="/doc/631834/" id="a_22"> s. 35</a> not to grant an,  injunction
restraining  the  Russian  firm	 from  proceeding  with	 the
Arbitration  at Moscow.	 The principle essentially  is	that
the arbitrator should not proceed with the arbitration	side
by  side in rivalry or in competition as if it were a  civil
court. [69 H, 70 H]
 (Per  Ramaswami J dissenting.) Even assuming that 3 of	 the
Act is not applicable this is not a proper case in which the
High Court should have issued an injunction restraining	 the
appellant  from proceeding with the arbitration.  As a	rule
the  Court  has	 to  exercise  its  discretion	with   great
circumspection	for  it	 is imperative	that  the  right  of
access; to the tribunals of a country should not be  lightly
interfered with,.  It is not sufficient merely to show	that
two  actions  have been started for it is  not	prima  facie
vexatious  to  commence two actions about the  same  subject
matter,	 one  here  and	 one  abroad.  The  reason  of	this
reluctance  to exercise the jurisdiction is that owing to  a
possible  difference between the laws of the two  countries,
the stay of one of the actions may deprive 'the plaintiff of
some  advantage which he is justified in pursuing.  Thus  he
may have a personal remedy in one country and a remedy	only
against	 the goods in another; or a remedy against  land  in
one  State  but	 no  such  remedy  in  another.,  The  rule,
therefore  is  that  a plea of lis alibi  pendens  will	 not
succeed	 and the court will not order a stay of	 proceedings
unless	the defendant proves vexation in point of fact.	  He
must show that the continued prosecution of both actions  is
oppressive  or embarrassing, an onus which he will :find  it
difficult to discharge if the
56
plaintiff  can	indicate  some material	 advantage  that  is
likely	to  result from each separate  action.	 Each  case,
therefore  depends  upon the setting of its  own  facts	 and
circumstances. [86 H]

The  Judgment  of  J. C. SHAH and A.  N.  GROVER,  JJ.,	 was
delivered  by  GROVER, J. RAMASWAMI, J., gave  a  dissenting
Opinion,.
</p><p id="p_6">Grover,	 J. These connected appeals which involve points  of
importance   and   interest  in	  international	  commercial
arbitration  arise out of a suit instituted on the  original
side  of  the  High Court of Judicature at  Madras  by	M/s.
Tarapore &amp; Co. against.	 M/s.  V. O. Tractoroexport, Moscow.
Initially   the	 claim	was  for  a   permanent	  injunction
restraining the Russian firm from realizing the proceeds  of
a  Letter of Credit opened on June 9, 1965 with the Bank  of
India  Ltd.,  Madras,  which had also been  impleaded  as  a
defendant.   Subsequently by an amendment of the plaint	 the
plaintiff has confined relief to recovery of damages.
The  facts chronologically are as follows : A  contract	 was
entered into on February 2, 1965, between the Indian and the
Russian firms for the supply of earth-moving machinery for a
value of Rs. 66,09,372.00. The machinery was required by the
Indian	firm  for  executing the work  of  excavation  of  a
feeder-	 canal as part of the Farakka Barrage  Project.	  On
June 9, 1965. the Indian firm opened a Letter of Credit with
the  Bank  of  India  Ltd., for	 the  entire  value  of	 the
machinery  in favour of the Russian firm.  The	consignments
started	 arriving at Calcutta in October 1965.	On  February
22,  1966, the Indian firm wrote to the Russian firm  saying
that there was something wrong with the design and work-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">			     57</span>
<p id="p_7">ing of motorised scrapers which had been supplied and  which
formed	one  of	 the  items  of	 machinery  covered  by	 the
contract.   One	 June 6, 1966 came the	devaluation  of	 the
Indian rupee by 57.48% as a result of -which the amount that
became payable by the Indian firm to the Russian firm  under
the  contract increased by Rs. 25 lakhs or so.	On June	 20,
1966, the Russian firm demanded an increase in the Letter of
Credit	owing  to the devaluation.  On August 1,  1966,	 the
Indian	firm served a notice on the Russian firm  containing
the  main allegations relating to breech of contract on	 the
part  of  the Russian firm.  The letter was called  upon  to
remedy the breaches and pay compensation.  It was made clear
that  until  this  was done the Russian firm  would  not  be
entitled  to  encash the Letter of Credit  for	the  balance
amount.	 On August 4, 1966, the Indian firm filed a suit  on
the  original side of the Madras High Court and obtained  an
ex parte order of injunction in respect of the operation  of
the  Letter  of	 Credit.  On August 14,	 1966,	the  parties
arrived at a settlement at Delhi after mutual discussion.
Pursuant  to  the agreement the suit was  withdrawn  by	 the
Indian	firm  but no amicable settlement,  as  contemplated,
took  place.  The Indian firm instituted a suit	 (No.	C.S.
118  of 1967) on the original side of the Madras High  Court
on  August  14, 1967.  It also filed an application  for  an
interim	 injunction  in the matter of the operation  of	 the
Letter of Credit.  On October 26, 1967, another	 application
was  filed for an interim injunction against the  encashment
of the devaluation drafts.  On November 4, 1967, the Russian
firm instituted proceedings in terms of the arbitral  clause
in  the	 contract  before  the	Foreign	 Trade	 Arbitration
Commission  of the U.S.S.R. Chamber of.	 Commerce,,  Moscow.
On  November 14, 1967, the Russian firm	 entered  appearance
under  protest	_ before the Madras High Court in  the	suit
filed  by  the Indian firm.  On the same date  the,  Russian
firm  filed an application under<a href="/doc/1891982/" id="a_23"> s. 3</a> of the-Foreign  Awards
(Recognition  and <a href="/doc/631834/" id="a_24">Enforcement) Act</a> XLV of 1961,	 hereinafter
</p><p id="p_8">-called	 the Act.  A prayer was made for stay of  the  suit.
On  January 15, 1968, the Indian firm filed  an	 application
for an interim injunction restraining the Russian  firm-from
taking any further part in the arbit proceedings at  Moscow.
We are not concerned with the branch of the litigation which
came  up  to this Court at a prior stage in respect  of	 the
interim injunctions granted by the single judge with  regard
to the operation of the Letter of Credit, and the subsequent
arrangement made for payment as a result of devaluation.  It
is  sufficient to mention that the appeals brought  to	this
Court  were allowed on November 26, 1968, and the  temporary
injunction  granted by the learned single judge relating  to
the operation of the Letter of Credit was vacated.
Sup.  CI/70-5
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">58</span>
The application which had been filed by the Russian firm for
stay  of  the suit under<a href="/doc/1891982/" id="a_25"> S. 3</a> of the Act  was  dismissed  by
Ramamurthi  J., on April 12, 1968.  The application  of	 the
Indian	firm  for  an  interim	injunction  restraining	 the
Russian firm from taking any further part in the arbitration
proceedings  at Moscow was, however, granted.	The  Russian
firm  preferred	 appeals against the orders of	the  learned
single judge before a division bench.  The bench  maintained
the  orders of Ramamurthi, J. The present appeals have	been
brought	 by the Russian firm by special leave  both  against
the order of the division bench and against the judgment  of
the learned single judge.  This was presumably done  because
there was some controversy about -the finality of the orders
which had been made by the single judge of the High Court.
The  questions which have to be determined in these  appeals
are  quite narrow.  The first question is whether the  words
"a  submission	made in pursuance of an agreement"  mean  an
actual	 or   completed	 reference  made  pursuant   to	  an
arbitration agreement or they mean an arbitration  agreement
that  has  come into existence as a result of  a  commercial
contract.  According to the appellant firm whenever there is
an  arbitration	 agreement  or	an  arbitral  clause  in   a
commercial   contract  of  the	nature	mentioned   in	 the
Convention the court is bound to stay the suit provided	 the
other  conditions laid down in<a href="/doc/1891982/" id="a_26"> s. 3</a> are satisfied.  On	this
approach  the  word "submission" is to be understood  as  an
arbitration   agreement	 or  arbitral  clause  relating	  to
existing  or  future differences and  the  word	 "agreement"
means an agreement of a commercial or business character  to
which the Convention applies.  The respondent firm maintains
that the critical words submission?' and "agreement" must be
given  their  natural and grammatical meaning and  the	word
"submission" made in pursuance of an agreement can only mean
an  actual  submission	of  the	 disputes  to  the  arbitral
tribunal.   The word "agreement" can have reference  to	 and
can  be	 construed  ,only in the  sense	 of  an	 arbitration
agreement  or an arbitral clause in a  commercial  contract.
It cannot mean a commercial contract because an	 arbitration
</p><p id="p_9">- agreement cannot be stated to have been made pursuant to a
commercial ,contract.  In other words, if submission has  to
be  taken in the sense of an arbitration agreement it  would
render the words "  submission	made  in  -pursuance  of  an
agreement" meaningless and unintellip.	The second  question
relates to the jurisdiction of the courts in this country to
grant an injunction restrationing a party which is in Moscow
from  proceeding  with the conduct of arbitration  before  a
tribunal  there.   Even if the courts have  jurisdiction  to
grant  an injunction, it is said, it would not be  a  proper
exercise of that jurisdiction in the circumstances of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> 59</span>
present	 case  to give an injunctory  relief.	The  learned
single judge has decided certain other controversial  issues
but  the  division  bench did not go into  them	 nor  do  we
propose	 to deal with them unless the decision on  the	true
and correct interpretation of<a href="/doc/1891982/" id="a_27"> S. 3</a> of the Act goes in favour
of the appellant firm.
</p><p id="p_10"><a href="/doc/631834/" id="a_28">The Act</a> has been enacted to enable effect to be given to the
Convention  on	the recognition and enforcement	 of  foreign
arbitral awards done at New York on June 10, 1558, to  which

it  has been pointed out that the procedure  for  settlement

the  history of the International Protocols and	 Conventions
as  a  result  of which legislation had	 to  be	 enacted  in

<a href="/doc/578192/" id="a_34">Section 1</a> (1) of that Act contained provisions similar to<a href="/doc/1891982/" id="a_35"> s.
3</a>  of the Act with certain differences.	 When the  aforesaid
Act  of	 1924  was enacted the meaning	of  "submission"  as
contained in s. 27 of the English Arbitration Act, 1889	 was
a written agreement to submit present or future	 differences
to  arbitration whether an arbitrator was named	 therein  or
not."
</p><p id="p_13">The  Arbitration (Foreign Awards) Act, 1930 was	 enacted  to
give  effect  "to a certain convention on the  execution  of
arbitral  awards  and  to amend sub-s. (1) of s.  1  of	 the
Arbitration Clauses (Protocol) Act, 1924 which provision was
described  in<a href="/doc/588423/" id="a_36"> s. 8</a> as one "for staying of legal	 proceedings
in  a  court  in  respect  of  matters	to  be	referred  to
arbitration under agreements to which the Protocol applies".
<a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_37">The Arbitration Act</a>, 1889 was amended by the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_38">Arbitration Act</a>
of  1934 which also provided for other matters	relating  to
arbitration  law  in England.  In sub-s. (2) of	<a href="/doc/157537/" id="a_39"> s.  21</a>	 the
expression  "arbitration agreement" was defined to  mean"  a
written agreement to submit present or future differences to
arbitration whether an arbitrator was named therein or not".
Although  the  definition of the  expression  "	 arbitration
agreement"  was	 introduced  by the amendment  made  by	 the
<a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_40">Arbitration   Act</a>  of  1934  the  definition  of  the	word
"submission"  contained in<a href="/doc/1308041/" id="a_41"> s. 27</a> of the Arbitration  Act  of
1889  remained	unaffected and unchanged.  To  complete	 the
history of legislation in England mention may be made of the
<a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_42">Arbitration Act</a>, 1950 which repealed the earlier enactments.
<a href="/doc/1242720/" id="a_43">Section	 4(2)</a>  of  this Act provided for,  stay	 when  legal
proceedings  were  commenced  in court by any  party  "to  a
submission to arbitration made in pursuance, of an agreement
to which the protocol set out in the First Schedule to	this
Act applies".  The Schedule to this Act contained the Geneva
Protocol on Arbitration Clauses of 1923 and the Geneva	Con-
vention on the execution of foreign arbitral awards of 1927.
In this Act the definition of "submission" contained in	 the
Act  of 1889 was omitted.  By<a href="/doc/874260/" id="a_44"> s. 32</a> "arbitration  agreement"

<p id="p_14">ences to arbitration, whether an arbitrator is named therein
or not".
</p><p id="p_15">In India the Arbitration (Protocol and Convention) Act, 1937
was  enacted  for  the	first time to  give  effect  to	 the
Protocol  and the Convention of 1923 and 1927  respectively.
This  was  done as the Government wanted to meet  he  widely
expressed  desire of the commercial world  that	 arbitration
agreements  should  be	ensured	 effective  recognition	 and
protection.   <a href="/doc/1529130/" id="a_45">Section  3</a> of the 1937 Act employed  the	same
language as is contained in<a href="/doc/1529130/" id="a_46"> s. 3</a> of the Act except with some
minor differences.  Both the Geneva Protocol of 1923 and the
Convention  of 1927 were appended as Schedules to this	Act.
So far as the ordinary arbitration law was concerned,  prior
to  the enactment of the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_47">Indian Arbitration Act</a>, 1940  there
were  two  sets	 of  laws applicable  to  what	were  called
Presidency  towns and areas which did not fall within  those
towns:	<a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_48">The  Indian Arbitration Act</a>, 1899 applied  to  cases
where  the subject matter submitted to arbitration was of  a
nature	that  if a suit were to be instituted  it  could  be
instituted in a Presidency town.  <a href="/doc/1242720/" id="a_49">Section 4(b)</a> contained the
definition  of the word " submission" which was	 similar  to
the  definition	 in the <a href="/doc/1003813/" id="a_50">English Act</a> of 1889.  In  the  Civil
Procedure Code of 1882 Part V dealt with arbitration.  These
provisions were applicable to such areas which were  outside
the  Presidency towns.	When the Civil Procedure Code,	1908
was  enacted  it  contained in	the  IInd  Schedule  similar
provisions   for  arbitration.	 There	was,   however,	  no
definition of "submission" or "arbitration agreement".	 <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_51">The
Arbitration Act</a>, 1940 was meant to consolidate and amend the
law relating to arbitration in India.' The word "submission"
was  not defined but the word "arbitration agreement" in <a href="/doc/1430346/" id="a_52"> s.
2(a)</a>  was  stated  to mean a  written  agreement  to  submit
present	 or  future differences to arbitration	whether	 the
arbitrator was named therein or not.
</p><p id="p_16">The  phraseology  which	 has been employed  in	the  English
statute	 and the Indian enactment for giving effect  to	 the
Protocol  and  the Conventions relating	 to  arbitration  is
practically the same.  <a href="/doc/1003813/" id="a_53">In the English Act</a> of 1924 the  words
used  were identical with the words to be found in<a href="/doc/1529130/" id="a_54"> S.  3</a>  of
the  Act,  namely,  "a submission made in  pursuance  of  an
agreement".  The only change which has been effected in	 the
English	 Arbitration  Act of 1950 in<a href="/doc/1242720/" id="a_55"> s. 4(2)</a>  is'  that	 the
words "to arbitration" have been inserted, within the  words
"submission" and "made".  Among the authoritative text	book
writers there has been a good deal of divergence of  opinion
on the meaning of the above phraseology.  In the 8th Edn. of
the Conflict of Laws by Dicey and Morris, Rule 182 has	been
formulated  which is based on S. 4(2) of the  English  Arbi-
tration	 Act 1950.  Referring to<a href="/doc/1242720/" id="a_56"> s. 4(2)</a> and the meaning  of
the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">63</span>
words  "a submission to arbitration made in pursuance of  an
agreement to which the protocol applies" the, authors are of
the  view  that this condition is satisfied if	the  parties
have  agreed  to  submit  present  or  future  disputes	  to
arbitration.  The Court is, according to them, under a	duty
to  stay  proceedings  although	 no  arbitrators  have	been
appointed.   The  word	"submission"  must  be	regarded  as
synonymous with the term "arbitration agreement" in the Pro-
tocol and the term "agreement to which the Protocol applies"
is  used  "to identify the commercial or  business  contract
between	 the  parties".	  This statement  is  based  on	 the
judgment  of  Scarman, J., in Owners of Cargo on  Board	 the
Merak	v.  The	 Merak	(Owners)  (1).	 Even	before	 the
pronouncement of this judgment preference for the view which
later  on  came	 to be expressed by  Scarman  J.,  had	been
indicated in the 7th Edn. of the same book. (See pages	1075
to  1076).  According to the well known work of	 Russell  on
Arbitration,  17th  Edn.,  the English	translation  of	 the
Protocol  is most obscure.  This is what has been stated  at
page 79
	      "The words of the section, however, would seem
	      to  limit	 its operation to cases	 where	some
	      sort  of "agreement to submit" is followed  by
	      an actual "submission" made "pursuant to"	 it.
	      (Presumably, the word " submission" here bears
	      its natural meaning, of "a submission  written
	      or  not)	of  an	-  actual  dispute  to	 the
	      authority	 of  an arbitral  tribunal,  "rather
	      than the statutory meaning which it bore
	      under  the 1889 Act and which is now borne  by
	      the phrase "arbitration agreement)".  Thus the
	      common  case, of an agreement -to refer  which
	      is never followed by a submission because	 the
	      claimant prefers to sue instead, is apparently
	      outside  the  section, although  the  Protocol
	      clearly meant it to be covered; see the French
	      text of <a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_57">Article 4".</a>
</p><p id="p_17">The  English translation of the French text in the 1950	 Act
has  been  stated  to  be a  mistranslating.   It  has	been
suggested that the Parliament may have enacted not the	true
text  of the Protocol but a very limited  interpretation  of
the false translation.	In Halsbury's Laws of England, Third

<p id="p_21">In  the	 Merak(1), Scarman J., react<a href="/doc/1242720/" id="a_58"> s. 4(2)</a> of the  Act  of
1950  with  the	 translation of the Protocol  in  the  First
Schedule  to  the Act.	According to him  the  Protocol	 was
concerned with two agreements--One, a contract commercial in
character or giving rise to a difference relating to matters
that  were  either  commercial	or  otherwise  'capable	  of
settlement  by	arbitration between parties subject  to	 the
jurisdiction  of different contracting States; the other  an
arbitration agreement whereby the parties to such a contract
agreed	to  submit their differences  to  arbitration.	(The
arbitration   agreement	  might	 itself	 included   in	 and
simultaneous  with  the commercial  or	business  contract).
<a href="/doc/1242720/" id="a_59">Section	 4(2)</a>  of  the Act was intended	 to  make  the	same
</p><p id="p_22">-distinction  between  the parties'  business  contract	 and
their arbitration agreement.  He proceeded to say:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">	      " It uses the term "submission to arbitration"
	      to identify the protocol's agreement to submit
	      their differences to arbitration and the	term
	      "agreement  to which the protocol applies"  to
	      identify	the commercial or business  contract
	      between  the  parties.  <a href="/doc/1242720/" id="a_60">Section  4(2)</a>,  in  my
	      opinion,	applies to agreements to  submit  to
	      arbitration made in pursuance of a contract to
	      which,  because  of  its	character  and	 the
	      character	  of  its  parties,   the   protocol
	      applies.	The words "in pursuance of",  merely
	      establish the link that there must be
	      between  the  agreement to submit	 present  or
	      future  differences  to  arbitration  and	 the
	      agreement	  of   a  commercial   or   business
	      character	 between parties of a certain  class
	      to  which the protocol applies.  They have  in
	      this context no temporal significance".
</blockquote><p id="p_23">One of the main reasons which prevailed in The Merak(1)	 was
that by construing "submission to arbitration" as an  actual
submission   of	  an  existing	dispute	 to   a	  particular
arbitrator, it would make "non-sense of the Protocol".
Now, as stated in Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol.  36,-page
414, there is a presumption that Parliament does not  assert
or   assume  jurisdiction  which  goes	beyond	the   limits
established  by the common consent of nations  and  statutes
are to be interpreted provided that their language  permits,
so as not to be inconsistent with the comity -of nations  or
with  the established principles of International Law.	 But
this principle applies only where there is an ambiguity	 and
must  give  way before a clearly  expressed  intention.	  If
statutory  enactments  are clear in meaning,  they  must  be
construed  according to their meaning even though  they	 are
contrary to the comity of nations or International Law.
(1)  (1965) 2 W.L.R. 250.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">65</span>
<p id="p_24">We  may look at another well recognised principle.  In	this
country,   as  is  the	case  in  England,  the	 treaty	  or
International	Protocol  or  convention  does	not   become
effective  or operative of its own force as in some  of	 the
continental  countries unless domestic legislation has	been
introduced   to	 attain	 a  specified  result.	 Once,	 the
Parliament has legislated, the, Court must first look at the
legislation  and construe the language employed in  it.	  If
the  terms of the legislative enactment do not	suffer	from
any  ambiguity or lack of clarity they must be given  effect
to  even if -they do not carry out the	treaty	obligations.
But  the  treaty or the Protocol or the	 convention  becomes
important  if  the meaning of the expressions  used  by	 the
Parliament  is riot clear and can be construed in more	than
one  way.  The reason is that if one of the  meanings  which
can  be properly ascribed is in consonance with	 the  treaty
obligations and the other meaning is not, so consonant,	 the
meaning	 which is consonant is to be preferred.	 Even  where
an  Act	 had been passed to give. effect to  the  convention
which was scheduled to it, the words employed in the Act had
to  be interpreted in the well established sense which	they
had in municipal law (See Barras v. Aberdeen Steam  Trawling
&amp; Fishing Co. Ltd.(1).
</p><p id="p_25">The  approach in "The Merak" appears to have been  dominated
by  the Protocol of 1923 and the question to be examined  is
whether	 the language of<a href="/doc/1559255/" id="a_61"> s. 4(2)</a> of the English Act of	1950
and <a href="/doc/1529130/" id="a_62"> s. 3</a> of the Act contains any such ambiguity or  suffers
from  any such lack of clarity as would justify the  use  of
the  Protocol to the extent made in the English	 case.	 The
term 'submission' as defined in the <a href="/doc/1003813/" id="a_63">English Act</a> of 1889	 and
the  <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_64">Indian  Act</a>  of  1899,  was  meant	 to  cover  both  an
arbitration  clause  by	 which the parties  agreed  that  if
disputes  arose	 they would be referred to  arbitration	 and
also  an  actual  submission  of  a  particular	 dispute  or
disputes  to the authority of a particular arbitrator.	 For
the sake of convenience, a distinction could be made calling
the  first  "an	 agreement  to refer"  and  the	 second,  "a
submission".  The term-"arbitration agreement" as defined by
the  <a href="/doc/1003813/" id="a_65">English  Act</a> of 1950 and the <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_66">Indian Act</a>  of  1940	also
covers	 both  "an  agreement  to  refer"  and	"an   actual
submission".   Turning to the words used in<a href="/doc/1529130/" id="a_67"> s. 3</a> of the	 Act
"submission  made in pursuance of an agreement to which	 the
convention  setforth  in the schedule  applies",  the  first
critical expression "submission" can have both the  meanings
in  view  of the historical background	of  the	 legislation
which  was  enacted to give effect to the Protocol  and	 the
Conventions.  If this term is to be given the larger meaning
of  including of "an agreement to refer" as also "an  actual
submission" of a particular dispute, it has to be determined
which meaning would be appro-
</p><p id="p_26">(1)  [1933] A.C. 402.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">66</span>
<p id="p_27">priate	in  the context in which the term  "submission"	 has
been  used  in	s.  3 of the  Act.   If	 "submission"  means
"agreement to refer" or an "arbitral clause" in a commercial
contract,  it makes the entire set of  words  unintelligible
and completely ambiguous.  It is difficult to comprehend  in
that  case  why the Legislature should have used  the  words
which  follow  the  term  "submission",	 namely,  "made	  in
pursuance  of  an agreement".  This brings us  to  the	true
import	of the expression "agreement".	If by	" agreement"
is  meant a commercial contract of the nature  mentioned  in
the,  "Merak",	the words "made in pursuance of"  convey  no
sense.	 Another anomaly which militates against the  estab-
lished	rule  of interpretation would arise if by  the	word
"agreement" is meant a commercial contract.  It cannot, even
by  stretching the language bear that meaning in the  second
part of<a href="/doc/1529130/" id="a_68"> s. 3</a> which reads
	      "..........  The court unless  satisfied	that
	      the agreement is null and void, inoperative or
	      incapable of being performed or that there  is
	      not  in fact any dispute between	the  parties
	      with  regard  to	the  matter  agreed  to	  be
	      referred	shall  make  an	 order	staying	 the
	      proceedings."
</p><p id="p_28">Here "agreement" can have reference to and mean not the com-
mercial	 contract  to which the convention setforth  in	 the
Schedule  applies  but only the agreement to  refer  or	 the
arbitral clause.  Unless the context so compels or requires,
the same meaning must ordinarily be ,attributed or given  to
the  same words used in the section. The above	difficulties
completely  disappear  if "submission"	isgiven	 the  second
meaning	 of an actual submission of a particular dispute  or
disputes  to the authority of a particular arbitrator.	 The
words which we are construing then have a clear,  consistent
and intelligible meaning,, namely, an actual submission made
in pursuance of an arbitration agreement or arbitral  clause
to  which the convention setforth in the  Schedule  applies.
The  words  "in pursuance of" are also thus  saved  and	 not
rendered otiose.  The courts have to be guided by the  words
of  the statute in which the legislature of the country	 has
expressed  its intention.  If<a href="/doc/1529130/" id="a_69"> s. 3</a> cannot be so read  as  to
permit	the meaning of the word "submission" to be taken  as
an  arbitral  clause or an agreement to	 refer,	 the  courts
would  not be justified in so straining the language of	 the
section as to ascribe the meaning which cannot be  warranted
by  the words employed by the legislature.  We are aware  of
no  rule  of interpretation by which rank ambiguity  can  be
first introduced by giving certain expressions a  particular
meaning	 and  then an attempt can be made to emerge  out  of
semantic confusion and obscurity by having resort to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11"> 67</span>
presumed  intention  of the legislature to  give  effect  to
international obligations.
</p><p id="p_29">It  is	true that by taking the above view the	purpose	 and
object	behind the Protocol and the conventions may  not  be
fully  carried out.  The intention underlying <a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_70">Art. 4</a> of	 the
Protocol  of  1923  and <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_71">Art. 2</a> of  the	Convention  of	1958
undoubtedly  appears  to be that whenever the  parties	have
agreed	-that their differences arising out of a  commercial
contract  be  referred to an arbitration,, the	court  of  a
contracting  State when seized of an action in	the  matter,
shall  refer the parties to an arbitration unless  it  finds
that  the  agreement is null and void or is  inoperative  or
incapable of being performed.  We apprehend it would  hardly
be conducive to international commercial arbitration not  to
have legislation giving full and complete effect to what  is
provided by the Protocol and the Conventions.  He also share
in  full  measure the anxiety and the effort  of  those	 who
desire	to respect the terms of international Protocols	 and
Conventions  in letter and spirit.  But we are bound by	 the
mandate	 of  the  legislature.	Once it	 has  expressed	 its
intention  in  words which have a  clear  signification	 and
meaning, the courts are precluded from speculating about the
reasons	 for  not effectuating the  purpose  underlying	 the
Protocol  and the conventions.	The consistent view  of	 the
Indian courts on the interpretation of the critical words in
s.  3  of  the Act of 1937 has not been in  favour  of	what
prevailed in the "Merak".  In the leading case in <a href="/doc/961181/" id="a_72">W. Wood  &amp;
Son  Ltd. v. Bengal Corporation</a>(1), Chakravarti	 C.J.  while
delivering  the judgment of the court, examined the  various
aspects of the question including the terms of the  Protocol
of 1923 and the Convention of 1927 and said :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">	      "If  the	agreement  to  which  the   Protocol
	      applies is an agreement for arbitration, there
	      cannot  possibly be an agreement in  pursuance
	      of that agreement.  <a href="/doc/1529130/" id="a_73">Section 3</a> must, therefore,
	      be construed as contemplating a case where not
	      only  is	there an  arbitration  agreement  in
	      force  between the parties but there has	also
	      been an actual reference to arbitration."
</blockquote><p id="p_30">The  learned  Single  Judge has given some  reasons  why  in
England as also in India the Statutes insist upon an  actual
submission  before  a stay of the suit can be  granted.	  It
has,  been pointed out that in different countries  the	 law
relating  to  arbitration is  naturally	 different.   Actual
submission has been made a condition precedent for  granting
stay  but  the	court has been left with  no  discretion  in
England	 and in India.	In some of the other  countries	 the
order for stay of a suit contrary to the arbitral
(1)  A.I.R. 1959 Cal. 8.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">68</span>
<p id="p_31">clause	is discretionary, there being no difference  between
the   municipal	 arbitration  and  arbitration	 under	 the
Protocol.   It	was  presumably for  this  reason  that	 the
Parliament insisted upon a real dispute between the  parties
and  an actual reference or submission to an arbitration  to
resolve	 the  particular  point or points in  dispute  as  a
condition  for	stay.  We do not consider that it  would  be
right  to speculate about the reasons which  prevailed	with
the  Parliament in enacting<a href="/doc/1529130/" id="a_74"> s. 3</a> of the Act in the  language
in which it has been done.  It is abundantly clear that	 the
Parliament  did not employ language which would indicate  an
unequivocal  intention that in the presence of an  agreement
to refer to an arbitral clause in a commercial contract, the
provisions  for	 granting  stay	 under	the  section   would
immediately  become  applicable irrespective  of  an  actual
submission  or a complete reference.  As it was open to	 the
legislature  to deviate from the terms -of the Protocol	 and
the  Convention	 it appears to have given  only	 -a  limited
effect	to the provisions of the 1958 Convention.   A  clear
deviation  from	 the rigid and strict rule that	 the  courts
must  stay  a  suit  whenever  an  international  commercial
arbitration   as  contemplated	by  the	 Protocol  and	 the
Conventions, was to take place, is to be found in s.3. It is
of  a nature which is common to all provisions	relating  to
stay in English and Indian arbitration laws, the  provisions
being that the application to the court for stay of the suit
must be made by a party before filing a written statement or
taking any other step in the, proceedings.  If the condition
is not fulfilled, no stay can be granted.  It cannot thus be
said that<a href="/doc/1529130/" id="a_75"> s. 3</a> of the Act or similar provisions in the prior
Act  of	 1937 or the English Statutes were enacted  to	give
effect	in its entirety to the strict rule contained in	 the
Protocol and the Conventions.
</p><p id="p_32">Another	 significant feature which cannot escape  notice  is
that the Parliament in England and India must be presumed to
have  been  aware when the <a href="/doc/1003813/" id="a_76">English Act</a> of 1950 and  the	 Act
were  enacted  that  the expression  'submission'  had	been
abandoned  in  the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_77">Arbitration Act</a>s and, instead,  the	term
'arbitration  agreement' had come to be defined	 as  meaning
what  submission meant :according to the definitions in	 the
<a href="/doc/1003813/" id="a_78">English	 Act</a>  of 1889 and <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_79">Indian Arbitration  Act</a>  of  1899.
Notwithstanding	  this,	 the  expression  'submission'	 was
employed in Sec. 4(2) of the <a href="/doc/1003813/" id="a_80">English Act</a> of 1950 and Sec.  3
of the Act.  If the intention was to have the wider  meaning
the  proper  and  correct  term	 to  use  was	"arbitration
agreement"  and	 logically  those  words  would	 have	been
employed.   It	is  more plausible that	 the  Parliament  by
retaining the expression 'submission' wanted to give it	 the
meaning	 of an actual submission, as by then there had	been
firm expression of opinion in the well-known work of Russell
on Arbitration and by jurists like Prof.  Arthur Nassbaum in
an article "Treaties on Commercial
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13"> 69</span>
Arbitration" in Vol. 56 of the Harvard Law Review,  pointing
to that meaning being given to 'submission'. -In India,	 the
High  Courts had uniformally and in unequivocal terms  taken
that view. (See W. Wood &amp; Son Ltd.Supra).
The  language in the relevant article of the  Convention  of
1958  had also undergone a change.  According to  Art.	 II,
the  term "agreement in writing' was to include an  arbitral
clause	in a contract or an arbitration agreement  and	that
term  was  stated  to mean something by	 which	the  parties
undertook  to submit to arbitration all or  any	 differences
which  had  arisen  or which might  arise  between  them  in
respect	  of   any  defined   legal   relationship   whether
contractual  or not concerning a subject matter	 capable  of
settlement  by	arbitration.  Thus, the term  "agreement  in
writing"  embraced  an	arbitral  clause  or  an   agreement
simpliciter  to	 refer	to arbitration	as  also  an  actual
submission  of	the  disputes to  the  arbitrator.   It	 was
equivalent to "Arbitration Agreement' as defined in the Act.
By  not	 using	that term and by  employing  the  expression
'submission'  in  Sec.	3 the  Parliament  appears  to	have
indicated  an  intention  to restrict the  meaning  of	that
expression to an actual submission or a complete reference.
Whatever way Sec. 3 of the Act is looked at, it is difficult
to reach the conclusion that 'submission' means an agreement
to  refer or an arbitral clause and does not mean an  actual
submission  or	completed  reference,  and  that  the  word'
"agreement" means a commercial contract and not an agreement
to refer or an arbitral clause.
</p><p id="p_33">The next question is whether the High Court was justified in
granting an interim injunction restraining the Russian	Firm
from proceeding with arbitration at Moscow.  The position of
the  Russian firm is that neither it nor the  Foreign  Trade
Arbitration  Commission of the U.S.S.R. Chamber of  Commerce
which  is seized of the arbitration proceedings is  amenable
to the jurisdiction of the courts in India.  The presence in
India  of  the party sought to be injuncted is	a  condition
pre-requisite for the grant of an injunction.  Altematively,
the  Indian Firm has been guilty of breach of the  agreement
to  refer the matter to arbitration at Moscow and  therefore
it  has	 disentitled itself to the exercise of	the  Court's
discretion  in	its  favour in the  matter  of	granting  an
injunction.
</p><p id="p_34">Now,  it is common ground that the point  about-the  Russian
Firm  having  no representative in India  was  not  agitated
before	the High Court.	 The position taken up in the  plant
was  that the Russian Firm was carrying on business  in	 the
U.S.S.R.  and  at Madras.  The controversy before  the	High
Court- appears to have
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">70</span>
been  confined	only  to what is stated in  Para  5  of	 the
counteraffidavit  of the Russian Firm, namely, that  in	 the
presence  of  the  Arbitration	agreement  in  the  contract
entered into between the parties, the only proper remedy for
the   Indian  Firm  was	 to  submit  the  disputes  to	 the
arbitration tribunal at Moscow.
</p><p id="p_35">The  rule as stated in Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol.	 21,
at page 407, is that with regard to foreign proceedings, the
court  will restrain a person within its  jurisdiction	from
instituting or prosecuting suits in a foreign court whenever
the  circumstances  of the case make such  an  interposition
necessary  or, proper.	This jurisdiction will be  exercised
whenever  there	 is  vexation or  oppression.	In  England,
Courts	have been very cautious and have  largely  refrained
from   granting	 stay  of  proceedings	in  foreign   Courts
(Cheshire's Private Industrial Law, 7th Ed. pages  108-110).
The injunction is, however, issued against a party and not a
foreign court.
</p><p id="p_36">Although it is a moot point whether Section 35 of the  Arbi-
tration	 Act, 1940, will be applicable to the present  case,
(<a href="/doc/804060/" id="a_81">Shiva	Jute Baling Limited v. Hindley &amp; Company  Limited</a>(1)
it  was	 assumed  that'	 <a href="/doc/1912867/" id="a_82">section  35</a>  applied  to   protocol
arbitration.) The principle embodied in that section  cannot
be  completely	ignored while considering  the	question  of
injunction.   According	 to that Section  no  reference	 nor
award  can  be	rendered  invalid  by  reason  only  of	 the
commencement  of legal proceedings upon the subject  of	 the
reference, but when legal proceedings upon the whole of	 the
subject matter of the reference have been commenced  between
all  the parties to the reference and a notice	thereof	 has
been  given  to	 the  arbitrators  or  umpire,	all  further
proceedings  in a pending reference shall, unless a stay  of
proceedings is granted under <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_83">section 34</a>, be invalid.
If  the	 venue of the arbitration proceedings  had  been  in
India and if the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_84">Arbitration Act</a> of  1940,
had.   been  applicable,  the  suit  and   the	 arbitration
proceedings   could   not  have	 been  allowed	to   go	  on
simultaneously	and either the suit would have	been  stayed
under <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_85">section 34</a> or it was, not stayed, and the	 arbitrators
were  notified	about the pendency of the suit,	 they  would
have  had to stay the arbitration proceedings because  under
<a href="/doc/1912867/" id="a_86">section	 35</a> such proceedings would become invalid  if  there
was identity between the subject-matter of the reference and
the  suit.  In the present case, when the suit is not  being
stayed	under <a href="/doc/1529130/" id="a_87">section 3</a> of the Act it would be	contrary  to
the principle underlying Set. 35 not to grant an  injunction
restraining  the  Russian  Finn	 from  proceeding  with	 the
arbitration  at Moscow.	 The principle essentially  is	that
the arbitrators should not proceed wit

the arbitration side by side in rivalry or in competition as
if it were a Civil Court.
</p><p id="p_38">Ordinarily,  a	party which has entered into a	contract  of
which  an arbitral clause forms an integral part should	 not
receive the assistance of the court when it seeks to  resile
from  it.  But in the present case a suit is being tried  in
the  courts of this country which, for the  reasons  already
stated,	 cannot be stayed under <a href="/doc/1529130/" id="a_88">section 3</a> of the Act in	 the
absence	 of  an	 actual submission of the  disputes  to	 the
arbitral tribunal at Moscow prior to the institution of	 the
suit.	The only proper course to follow is to restrain	 the
Russian	 Firm  which  has gone to the  Moscow  Tribunal	 for
adjudication of the disputes from getting the matter decided
by the tribunal so long as the suit here is pending and	 has
not been disposed of.
</p><p id="p_39">In this context, we cannot also ignore what has been  repre-
sented	during	the  arguments.	  The  current	restrictions
imposed by the Govt. of India on the availability of foreign
exchange  of which judicial notice can be taker,, will	make
it  virtually  impossible for the Indian Firm  to  take	 its
witnesses  to  Moscow for examination  before  the  Arbitral
tribunal  and to otherwise properly conduct the	 proceedings
there.	 Thus,	the  proceedings before	 that  tribunal	 are
likely	to  be	in effect ex parte.   The  High	 Court	was,
therefore,  right in exercising discretion in the matter  of
granting an interim injunction in favour of the Indian Firm.
The  appeals  fail  and are dismissed but  in  view  of	 the
peculiar  nature  of the points involved, there will  be  no
order as to costs.
</p><p id="p_40">Ramaswami,  J.	I  regret  I am unable	to  agree  with	 the
judgment pronounced by Grover, J.
</p><p id="p_41">The  first respondent had entered into a contract  with	 the
Government  of India for the excavation work in	 the  feeder
canal  of  the	Farakka Barrage	 project.   To	fulfil	this
contract with the Government of India and for the excavation
work  the  first respondent  required  certain	construction
machinery  such	 as  scrapers,	both  towed  and  motorised,
crawlers,  tractors  and bulldozers.  The respondent  No.  1
agreed	to purchase them from the appellant and	 the  latter
agreed to supply and deliver and the terms and conditions of
the  contract were embodied in a document dated February  2,
1965  signed  by  both the parties.   In  pursuance  of	 the
contract the first respondent opened a confirmed irrevocable
and  divisible letter of credit with the  second  respondent
for  the  entire  value	 of  the  equipment,  that  is,	 Rs.
66,09,372/-  in favour of the appellant	 negotiable  through
the  Bank of Foreign Trade of the U.S.S.R.,  Moscow.   Under
the said letter of credit the second respondent was required
to pay to the appellant on production of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">72</span>
documents particularised in the letter of credit along	with
the drafts. - One of the conditions of the letter of  credit
was  that  25  %  of  'the amount  should  be  paid  on	 the
presentation  of the specified documents and the balance  of
75% within one year from the date of the first payment.	  On
the strength of the contract the -appellant supplied all the
machinery  which it undertook to supply by about the end  of
December, 1965.	 After the machinery was used for some	time
the  first respondent complained that the machinery did	 not
conform	 to  the terms and conditions of  the  contract	 and
consequently   it  had	incurred  and  continued  to   incur
considerable loss.  Meanwhile the Indian rupee was  devalued
on  June  6,  1966  and in  consequence	 the  price  of	 the
machinery  went	 up by about 57.48 %. The  increase  in	 the
price  of  the	machinery was in accordance  with  the	gold
clause	of  the contract entered into between  the  parties.
Clause 13 of the Contract read as follows :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">	      "The  sellers  and the buyers shall  take	 all
	      measures	to settle amicably any disputes	 and
	      differences  which  may  arise out  of  or  in
	      connection with this contract.  In case of the
	      parties being unable to arrive at an  amicable
	      settlement,  all disputes are to be  submitted
	      without application to the ordinary courts for
	      the  settlement by Foreign  Trade	 Arbitration
	      Commission at the U.S.S.R. Chamber of Commerce
	      in  Moscow  in accordance with  the  Rules  of
	      Procedure	  of  the  said	  Commission.	 The
	      Arbitration  award will be final	and  binding
	      upon both parties."
</blockquote><p id="p_42">Ignoring this clause the first respondent instituted a	suit
C.S.  134 of 1966 in the Madras High Court  and obtained  an
ex  parte  injunction against the appellant and	 the  second
respondent  restraining them from negotiating the letter  of
credit.	 The 'appellant protested that the first  respondent
should	not  have  instituted a suit  in  violation  of	 the
arbitration  clause  in	 the  contract.	  By  a	  subsequent
agreement dated August, 14, 1966 the appellant and the first
respondent   agreed  to	 settle	 the  matter   amicably	  in
accordance  with the contract.	The appellant  consented  to
extend	the payment of letter of credit by one year and	 the
first respondent thereupon withdrew the suit in C.S. 134  of
1966.	The  respondent No. 1 is said to have  accepted	 the
devaluation drafts representing increase in the price of the
machinery consequent on the devaluation of the Indian  rupee
in  accordance	with  the clause in  the  contract.   Though
correspondence	 was  going  on	 between  the  parties,	  no
settlement could be arrived -at.  When the time came for the
payment	 of the balance of 75% of the letter of	 credit	 the
first  respondent instituted a suit C.S. 118 of 1967 in	 the
Madras	High Court in violation of the arbitral	 clause	 and
obtained  an ex parte injunction against the appellant	from
operating  the	letter of credit.  On November 5,  1967	 the
appellant instituted- arbitral proceedings
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">			     73</span>
before the Foreign Trade Arbitration Commission of  U.S.S.R.
Chamber of Commerce, Moscow in accordance with cl. 13 of the
contract for payment of the price of the machinery.   Notice
was issued to the first respondent to choose its nominee  to
represent  it in the Arbitration Commission and the date  of
hearing was also notified by the first respondent.  But	 the
first  respondent failed to appear before the Foreign  Trade
Arbitration  Commission.  Thereafter the  appellant  entered
appearance  in C.S. 118 of 1967 under protest and  filed  an
application No. 2604 of 1967 before the High Court under <a href="/doc/18760292/" id="a_89"> s.

respondent also filed an application No. 106 of 1968  before
the  High  Court  praying  that	 the  appellant	 should	  be
restrained  from taking part in the arbitration	 proceedings
at  Moscow.   After  hearing  the  parties  Ramamurthi	 J.,

The  learned  Judge  allowed the application  of  the  first

Moscow.	  The appellant preferred, appeals O.S.A. 25 and  26

	      inoperative or incapable of being performed."
</blockquote><p id="p_45">The argument of the first respondent is that<a href="/doc/1529130/" id="a_97"> s. 3</a> of the Act
can  be invoked by the appellant only if it had	 implemented
the  arbitration  agreement  by	 actually  submitting,	 the
dispute	 to  the  arbitrator or	 arbitrators  prior  to	 the
institution  of the suit.  In the present case if there	 was
any such reference to arbitration it was only on November 4,
1967,  that  is, about three weeks after the suit  bad	been
filed  in the High Court.  The contrary view point  was	 put
forward by Mr. Mohan Kumaramangalam on behalf of the  appel-
lant.	It  was	 said  that <a href="/doc/1529130/" id="a_98"> s. 3</a>  of,	the  Act  should  be
interpreted in the context of the articles of the Convention
set out in the schedule and it was not necessary that  there
should	be an actual submission to, arbitration	 before	 the
institution  of the suit.  If there was an  arbitral  clause
</p><p id="p_46">-whether  this was followed by reference to  arbitration  by
any of the parties or not the very existence of this  clause
in  the commercial agreement would render stay of  the	suit
mandatory under<a href="/doc/1529130/" id="a_99"> s. 3</a> of the Act.  The argument was that <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_100">art.
2</a> of the Convention makes it clear that under the Convention
the court of contracting State must, when seized of such  an
action	refer the parties to arbitration.  <a href="/doc/1529130/" id="a_101">Section 3</a> of	 the
Act  must be read in consonance with this  obligation.	 Any
interpretation	of  that section which	will  restrict	this
obligation  could  be  justified only  if  the	plain  words
necessitate  such a reading.  The argument of the  appellant
is  that  the words "if any party to a	submission  made  in
pursuance of an agreement to which the convention set  forth
in the schedule applies" really mean that the submission  is
the arbitral clause itself
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">			     75</span>
and  the agreement is a commercial agreement which  includes
or embodies that clause.
</p><p id="p_47">It  is	necessary  in  this  connection	 to  refer  to	 the
legislative history of the section.  The reason is that both
the  expressions submission" and "agreement of	arbitration"
have  got a special meaning because of the evolution of	 the
statute	 law.	The English Arbitration Act of	1889  (52-53
Vic.c.49)  is the first amending and  consolidating  statute
relating  to  arbitration.  <a href="/doc/1308041/" id="a_102">Section 27</a> of  the	Act  defined
submission as follows :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">	      "Submission  means  a  written  agreement	  to
	      submit   present	or  future   difference	  to
	      arbitration  whether  an arbitrator  is  named
	      therein or not."
</blockquote><p id="p_48">There  is  no  definition  of "agreement"  as  such  and  no
difference  is made between a mere arbitral clause, that  is

	      the New York Convention adopted at the  United

			    International and Commercial Arbitrati
ons.   It

	      requirements   of	 international	 trade	 and

</p><p id="p_53">	      The  question presented for  determination  is
	      what  is the true meaning -and effect  of	 the
	      words  "it any party to a submission  made  in
	      pusuance	of the agreement to which  the	said
	      protocol	applies"? in<a href="/doc/1529130/" id="a_128"> s. 3</a> of the Act.	Even
	      at  the  time  of the Act	 of  1889  the	word
	      "submission" had received a special meaning as
	      including a mere
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">				    79</span>
	      agreement	 to refer to arbitration as well  as
	      an   actual   reference	or   submission	  to
	      arbitration and this special meaning was given
	      statutory	 recognition in the Act of  1889  by
	      defining	submission' in this special  manner.
	      In  the  Arbitration Clauses  (Protocol)	Act,
	      1924 the phrase "submission made in  pursuance
	      of  the  agreement"  is  used  and  the	word
	      "submission"  is	employed  in  the  statutory
	      sense.  <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_129">In the Indian Arbitration Act</a>, 1889<a href="/doc/1242720/" id="a_130"> s.
	      4(b)</a>  defines submission in exactly  the	same
	      terms  as s. 27 of the English Act of  In	 the
	      English  Arbitration  Act	 of  1934  the	word
	      agreement'  is  defined  in <a href="/doc/157537/" id="a_131"> s.  21(2)</a>  as   a
	      "written agreement to submit present or future
	      differences   to	 arbitration   whether	 the
	      arbitrator  is named therein or not".   It  is
	      clear,   therefore,   that   the	  expression
	      "arbitration    agreement"   and	 the	word
	      "submission"  are synonymous and	connote	 the
	      same  idea.   In	my  opinion  the  expression
	      "submission made in pursuance of an agreement"
	      in <a href="/doc/1529130/" id="a_132"> s. 3</a> of the Act must be construed  in	 its
	      historical setting.  The word
	       "    submission"	   must,    therefore,	  be
	      interpreted to mean the arbitral clause itself
	      and the word "agreement" as the commercial  or
	      the  business  agreement	which  includes	  or
	      embodies that clause.  In other words the word
	      "submission"  in	the  opening  words  of	 the
	      section	means  an  agreement  to  refer	  to
	      arbitration  and the words "the  agreement  to
	      which the Convention set forth in the schedule
</p><p id="p_54">	      -applies"	 mean  the  business  'agreement  or
	      contract	containing the arbitral clause.	  It
	      follows,	therefore,  that  if  there  is	  an
	      arbitral	clause whether this is	followed  by
	      actual  reference to arbitration or  not,	 the
	      very   existence	 of  this  clause   in	 the
	      commercial agreement would render the stay  of
	      the. suit mandatory under<a href="/doc/1529130/" id="a_133"> s. 3</a> of the Act.
	      The  view	 that  I  have,	 expressed  is	also
	      consistent with the rule of construction	that
	      as  far as practicable the municipal law	must
	      be  interpreted  by the courts  in  conformity
	      with  international obligations which the	 law
	      may  seek	 to effectuate' It is  well  settled
	      that   if	 the  language	of  a  section,	  is
	      ambiguous	 or  is capable' of  more  than	 one
	      meaning  the protocol itself becomes  relevant
	      for  there is a prima facie  presumption	that

that  <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_134">art.  2</a> of the Convention which is  contained  in	 the

charter party or any bills of lading issued thereunder;	 and
that  the arbitration clause must in any event	be  rejected

	      <a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_140">Article  4</a> provides that the tribunals of	 the
	      contracting  states,  on	being  seised  of  a
	      dispute  regarding  a contract which  includes
	      an arbitration agreement whether referring  to
	      present  'or future differences,	shall  refer
	      the dispute to arbitration.  Thus the protocol
	      is  concerned  with  two	agreements--One,   a
	      contract	commercial  in character  or  giving
	      rise to a difference relating to matters	that
	      are either commercial or otherwise capable  of
	      settlement  by  arbitration,  between  parties
	      subject  to  the	jurisdiction  of   different
	      contracting states; the other, an	 arbitration
	      agreement	 whereby  the  parties	to  such   a
	      contract agree to submit their differences  to
	      arbitration.   It is clear from  the  protocol
	      that  the arbitration agreement may itself  be
	      included in and simultaneous with the  commer-</blockquote>
<p id="p_62">			    cial or business contract between the
 parties.
</p><p id="p_63">	      In  my  opinion <a href="/doc/1242720/" id="a_141">section 4(2)</a> -of	the  Act  is
	      intended to make the same distinction  between
	      the  parties'  business  contract	 and   their
	      arbitration    agreement,	  and	 no    other
	      distinction.  It uses the term "submission  to
	      arbitration   to	 identify   the	  protocol's
	      agreement	 to  submit,  their  differences  to
	      arbitration  and the term "agreement to  Which
	      the   protocol   applies'	 to   identify	 the
	      commercial  or business contract	between	 the
	      parties.	<a href="/doc/1242720/" id="a_142">Section 4(2)</a> in my opinion,  applies
	      to agreements to submit to arbitration made in
	      pursuance	 of a contract to which, because  of
	      its   character  and  the	 character  of	 its
	      parties, the protocol applies.  The words	 "in
	      pursuance	 of" merely establish the link	that
	      there must be between the agreement to  submit
	      present  or future differences to	 arbitration
	      and the agreement of a commercial or  business
	      character between parties of a certain  -class
	      to  which the protocol applies.  They have  in
	      this context no temporal significance.

<p id="p_64">	      see   no	 reason	 for  having   to   construe
	      'submission  to  arbitration'  as	 an   actual
	      submission   of  an  existing  dispute  to   a
	      particular  arbitrator.  <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_143">The Act</a> of 1950	does
	      not say that I must.  It makes nonsense of the
	      protocol	so  to do.  <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_144">The Act</a>  of	 1924  which
	      first  introduced the sub-section, was an	 Act
	      to give effect to the protocol ,arid there  is
	      respectable, though now antiquated,
	      authority, namely, the repealed <a href="/doc/1308041/" id="a_145">section 27</a>  of
	      the Act of 1889, for giving a wider meaning to
	      'submission' if the context so requires.	 The
	      term  'submission to arbitration' is  not	 now
	      defined by statute, and must, -in my  opinion,
	      be given a meaning appropriate to its context.
	      While, no doubt, it is often convenient to use
	      the term to distinguish an actual reference of
	      a	 particular dispute to arbitration  from  an
	      'arbitration  agreement' it would be wrong  so
	      to   do	in   construing	  this	  particular
	      subsection.   Accordingly, I find myself	able
	      to say that the subsection gives effect to the
	      intention	 of  the  protocol,  the   intention
	      clearly  being that when there is	 a  business
	      contract between parties subject to  different
	      contracting  states those parties 'are  to  be
	      referred	to  arbitration	 if  they  have	  so
	      agreed,  whether	their agreement	 relates  to
	      present or future differences."
</p><p id="p_65">	      The same view is expressed in Dicey &amp;  Morris,
	      The Conflict of Laws, 8th edn. p. 1075 :
</p><p id="p_66">	      <a href="/doc/1242720/" id="a_146">Section 4(2)</a> of the Act imposes upon the court
	      a	 duty  to stay the proceedings	if  a  party
	      relies on 'a submission to arbitration made in
	      pursuance	 of  'an  agreement  to	 which	 the
	      Protocol	 applies'.    This   condition	  is
	      satisfied if the parties have agreed to submit
	      present  or  future disputes  to	arbitration.
	      The term 'submission' includes an agreement to
	      refer.  The court is therefore under a duty to
	      stay  the proceedings although no	 arbitrators
	      have  been  appointed, Find the fact  that  an
	      arbitration   clause  is,	 included   in	 the
	      contract between the parties suffices for	 the
	      application of <a href="/doc/1242720/" id="a_147">section 4(2)</a>.  There is thus no
	      discrepancy between the section and <a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_148">Article  4</a>
	      of  the Protocol to which it purports to	give
	      effect.  According to <a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_149">Article 4</a> the court must
	      "refer  the  Parties to the  decision  of	 the
	      arbitrators"  if	the  contract  between	 the
	      parties  includes	 "an  arbitration  agreement
	      whether  referring  to present  or  to  future
	      differences."  The word "submission"  used  in
	      <a href="/doc/1242720/" id="a_150">section  4(2)</a> must be regarded  as  synonymous
	      with  the term 'arbitration agreement' in	 the
	      Protocol and the term 'agreement to which	 the
	      protocol	applies' is used in the section	 'to
	      identify the commercial
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">				    83</span>
	      or  business  contract between  the  parties'.
	      The controversy surrounding the interpretation
	      of <a href="/doc/1242720/" id="a_151">section 4(2)</a> (to which reference, was	made
	      in the previous edition of this book) was left
	      undecided in Radio Publicity Ltd. v. Compagnie
	      Luxembourgecise de Radiodifusion(1).  It	was,
	      however, settled by the decision of Scarman J.
	      in The Merak(2) and the point was not disputed
	      in 'the Court of Appeal."
</p><p id="p_67">If the opposite view for which respondent No. I contends  is
adopted	 and if it is held that the section only applies  if
the parties have submitted an actual dispute to	 arbitration
the  purpose of<a href="/doc/1529130/" id="a_152"> s. 3</a> of the Act and of the  ratification  of
the  New  York	Protocol of 1958 by India  would  have	been
largely	  frustrated.	Such  an  interpretation  would	  be
contrary to the avowed object and intention of the Act which
is "to give effect to the Convention -on the recognition and
enforcement of foreign arbitral awards" done at New York  on
June  10, 1958.	 When there is ambiguity in the language  of
the  section  it  is the duty of the  court  to	 adopt	that
construction which will effectuate the object of the Act and
not  nullify  the  intention  of  Parliament  and  make	 the
provision devoid of all meaning.
</p><p id="p_68">On behalf of the first respondent it was said that there was
a  presumption that the legislature in reenacting a  section
of  the	 law  must be presumed to have	been  aware  of	 the
intervening  judicial interpretation and to have  given	 its
approval  to it.  The classic statement of the rule is	that
James L.J. in Ex. p. Campbell(1)
	      "Where  once  certain  words  in	an  Act	  of
	      Parliament    have   received    a    judicial
	      construction  in one of the  Superior  Courts,
	      and the Legislature has repeated them  without
	      any  alteration  in a  subsequent	 statute,  I
	      conceive that the legislature must be taken to
	      have used them according to the meaning  which
	      a	 Court of competent jurisdiction  has  given
	      them."
</p><p id="p_69">But  the  rule is better and more moderately stated  by	 the
judicial  Committee in Webb v. Outrim(4) where the words  of
Griffith  C.J. in the Australian case D'Emdon  v.  Pedder(5)
are   adopted:	"When  a  particular  form  of	 legislative
enactment, which has received authoritative  interpretation,
whether by judicial decision or by a long course of practice
is adopted in the framing of a later statute, it is a  sound
rule of construction to hold that the words so adopted	were
intended  by the Legislature to bear the meaning  which	 has
been  so  put  upon them".  Even  in  this  qualified  form,
however.

<p id="p_75">the rule has not been acknowledged without protest (see	 the
speech	of  Lord  Blanesburgh in Barras	 v.  Aberdeen  Steam
Trawling Co.(1) The presumption	 is weak and is passed on an
optimistic fiction.  The rule has been criticised by Dr.  C.
K. Allen:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_27">	      "The second petrifying f`actor is the real  or

	      offshoot of the somewhat optimistic assumption
	      that the legislature must be presumed to	know
	      the actual state of the law.  Consequently, if

Sons Ltd. v.   Bengal  Corporation</a>(3) and K. E.	 Corporation
v.  S. De Traction  (4 ).  It was held in these	 cases	that
before	the  court stays proceedings under<a href="/doc/1529130/" id="a_155"> s. 3</a> of  the	 Act
there  must be an actual submission by both the	 parties  to
arbitrators  of	 the particular point in  dispute.   It	 was
argued that in enacting<a href="/doc/49537238/" id="a_156"> s. 3</a> Parliament was not content with
a mere readiness of the parties to go to arbitration but  it
insisted on something mote, that is, the actual	 implementa-
tion  of the arbitration agreement by the parties  concerned
by setting up the machinery of arbitration in motion.  I  am
unable	to  accept this line of reasoning.  It is  not	said
that  there  is	 a long course of practice or  a  series  of
decisions of various High Courts taking a particular view of
s.  3  of  the	Act.   The  decisions  referred	 to  by	 the

<p id="p_83">It is, however, maintained by the respondent that the  words
"  submission" and "agreement" must be given  their  natural
and  grammatical meaning and the word "submission"  made  in
pursuance   of	an  agreement"	can  only  mean	 an   actual
submission of the disputes to the arbitral tribunal.  So the
word "agreement" can have reference to and can be  construed
only  in the sense of an arbitration agreement	or  arbitral
clause	in  a  commercial  contract.   It  can-not  mean   a
commercial contract because an arbitration agreement  cannot
be  stated  to	have  been made	 pursuant  to  a  commercial
contract.   The contention is that if submission has  to  be
taken  in  the sense of an arbitration -agreement  it  would
render	the  words  "submisison	 made  in  pursuance  of  an
agreement"  meaningless and unintelligible.  In	 my  opinion
the argument proceeds on a fallacy.  A statute should not be
construed  as  a theorem of Euclid but the statute  must  be
construed  with some imagination of the purpose	 which	lies
behind the statute.  The doctrine of literal  interpretation
is not always the best method for ascertaining the intention
of Parliament.	The better rule of interpretation is that  a
statute	 should be so construed as to prevent  the  mischief
and -advance the remedy according to the true intent of	 the
makers	of  the	 statute.  The principle  was  for  example,
applied	 by  Lord Halsbury in Eastman  Photographic  Co.  v.
Comptroller of Patents(1) where the question was whether the
word  'solio'  used  as a trademark was	 an  invented  or  a
descriptive word.  In examining this question Lord  Halsbury
said:  "Among  the things which have passed into  canons  of
construction  recorded in Heydon's case we are to  see	what
was  the  law before the Act was passed, and  what  was	 the
mischief or defect for which the law had not provided,	what
remedy	Parliament appointed and the reason of the  remedy".
At p. 575 Lord Halsbury proceeded to state
	      Turner, L.J. in Hawkins v. Cathercole(2),	 and
	      adding  his own high authority to that of	 the
	      judges   in  Stredling  v.  Morgan(3)   -after
	      enforcing	 the proposition that the  intention
	      of the Legislature must be regarded, at length
	      the  judgment  in that case :  that  the	have
	      collected	 the intention 'sometimes by  consi-
	      dering  the cause and necessity of making	 the
	      Act....	sometimes   foreign   circumstances'
	      (thereby meaning extraneous circumstances), so
	      that they have ever been guided by the  intent
	      of  the  Legislature, which they	have  always
	      taken  according	to  the	 necessity  of	 the
	      matter,	and  according	to  that  which	  is
	      consonant to reason and good discretion'.	 And
	      he adds : "We have, therefore, to consider not
	      merely the words of this Act of Parlia-

<p id="p_87">	      meat  but the intent of the Legislature to  be
	      collected from the cause and necessity of	 the
	      Act  being  made,	 from a	 comparison  of	 its
	      several  parts,  and  from  foreign   (meaning
	      extraneous)  circumstances so far as they	 can
	      justly  be considered to throw light upon	 the
	      subject."
</p><p id="p_88">For  the  reasons  expressed I hold that  the  appellant  is
entitled under<a href="/doc/1529130/" id="a_158"> S. 3</a> of- the Act for an order of stay of	 the
proceedings  in C.S. 118 of 1967 pending in the Madras	High
Court  on  the ground that in terms of	the  Contract  dated
February  2,  1965  the parties expressly  agreed  that	 all
disputes  arising out of the contract should be	 settled  by
arbitration  by the Foreign Trade Arbitration Commission  of
the U.S.S.R. Chamber of Commerce at Moscow.
It is not, however, possible to decide these appeals finally
because the respondent has opposed the application for	stay
on  other  grounds  also.  Ramamurti,  J.,  found  that	 the
arbitral  clause  in the contract of February  2,  1965	 had
teased to be effective as between the parties as a result of
the  agreement dated August 14, 1966 Ex.  P-32 "and that  it
will  be wholly unrealistic. . . to hold that the moment  an
amicable settlement as provided in Ex.	P-32 proved  futile,
the  entire  contract,	Ex.  P-4 revived. . .  .  "  On	 the
further	 aspect	 that  admittedly<a href="/doc/1529130/" id="a_159"> s. 3</a>	itself	contains  an
exception  that	 the  mandatory obligation to  stay  is	 not
incumbent  on the court if the court is satisfied that	"the
agreement  is  null and void, inoperative  or  incapable  of
being  performed" Ramamurti, J. was apparently of  the	view
that  the  alleged nullity of the contract on the  basis  of
mutual	mistake was, a matter that the court has to  examine
further	 after recording evidence and that was a  ground  on
which proceedings cannot be stayed under<a href="/doc/1529130/" id="a_160"> s. 3</a>.
I  consider,  therefore,  that C.A. 1209 and  1834  of	1969
should be set down for further hearing on these points.
Civil  Appeals Nos. 1208 and 1833 of 1969 arise out  of	 the
application  No. 106 of 1968 filed by the  first  respondent
for  injunction to restrain the first respondent for  taking
further	 part  in  the arbitration  proceedings	 in  Moscow.
Ramamurti  J., took the view that since the application	 no.
2604 of 1967 for stay of the proceedings in the pending suit
C.S. II 8 of 1967 bad been dismissed the first	respondent's
injunction petition should be allowed on the ground that the
two  forums  were  mutually  exclusive.	  In  the  connected
appeals	 I have taken the view that the appellant  would  be
entitled to an order of stay of the proceedings in C.S.	 118
of 1967 under<a href="/doc/1529130/" id="a_161"> s. 3</a> of Act 45 of 1961.  Even assuming that<a href="/doc/1529130/" id="a_162"> S.
3</a> of the Act is not applicable this is not a proper case  in
which  the  High  Court should	have  issued  an  injunction
restraining   the   appellant  from  proceeding	  with	 the
arbitration.   As  a  rule the Court  has  to  exercise	 its
discretion  with great circumspection for it  is  imperative
that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">			     87</span>
right of access to the tribunals of a country should not  be
lightly	 interfered  with.  It is not sufficient  merely  to
show that two actions have been started for it is not  prima
facie  vexations  to  commence two actions  about  the	same
subject	 matter, one here and one abroad. (See	Mcttenry  v.
Lewis(1).   The	 reason of this reluctance to  exercise	 the
jurisdiction is that owing to a possible difference  between
the  laws  of  the two countries, the stay  of	one  of	 the
actions may deprive the plaintiff of some advantage which he
is  justified  in  pursuing.  Thus he may  have	 a  personal
remedy in one country and a remedy only against the goods in
another;  or a remedy against land in one State but no	such
remedy in another.  The rule ' therefore, is that a plea  of
lis  alibi pendens will not succeed and the court  will	 not
order  a  stay of proceedings unless  the  defendant  proves
vexation in point of fact.  He must show that the  continued
prosecution  of both actions is oppressive or  embarrassing,
an onus which he will find it difficult to discharge if	 the
plaintiff  can	indicate  some material	 advantage  that  is
likely	to  result from each separate  action.	 Each  case,
therefore,  depends  upon the setting of its own  facts	 and
circumstances.	 In  the facts of the present case I  am  of
opinion	 that no case for injunction has been made  out	 and
the  order of Ramamurti, J., dated April 12.  1968  allowing
the  application of respondent in no. 106 of 1968 should  be
set -aside.  I would accordingly allow the appeals nos. 1208
of 1969 and 1833 of 1969 with costs.
