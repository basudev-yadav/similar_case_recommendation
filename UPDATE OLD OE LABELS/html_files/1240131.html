      Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal, West Zonal

      Branch at Mumbai [hereinafter referred to as `Tribunal'] in Appeal

      No.C/138/03 Mum dated 23.06.2003. By the impugned order, the

      Tribunal has allowed the appeal filed by the respondent and has set

      aside the original order passed by the adjudicating authority, wherein

      it had directed the respondent to pay a sum of `2,20,50,125/- (Rupees

     1962 (hereinafter referred to as, "the Act") for release of the goods

     seized from the possession of the respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">2)   The factual matrix in brief is as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">           In a search and seizure in the office premises of the respondent-

     firm conducted by the officers of Customs Department, on the basis of

     specific information, a large quantity of rough diamonds was

     recovered. The partner of the respondent-firm, Shri Maganbhai Patel

     was neither able to offer any satisfactory explanation nor produce any

     documents in relation to the import of the said diamonds, and the

     diamonds were seized by the officers in the reasonable belief that they

     are liable for confiscation under the provisions of the Act. After

     investigation, a Show Cause Notice was issued to the respondent and

     others wherein confiscation of the seized diamonds was proposed.

     After adjudication, the adjudicating authority passed an order

     confiscating the seized diamonds under <a href="/doc/780637/" id="a_2">Section 111(d)</a> of the Act.</blockquote><p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">     However, an option was given to the respondent to redeem the seized

     goods on payment of redemption fine. The respondent was also asked



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                        2</span>
to pay the appropriate duty on the said confiscated diamonds which

were allowed to be released on payment of redemption fine.           In

addition, penalty was also imposed on the respondent under <a href="/doc/398879/" id="a_3">Section

112</a> of the Act.     Being aggrieved by the aforesaid order, the

respondent had preferred an appeal before the Tribunal. The Tribunal,

by its order dated 29.12.1995, disposed of the appeal and confirmed

the redemption fine of `60,00,000/- (Rupees Sixty Lakhs only) and

the penalty of `25,00,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Lakhs only) on the

respondent herein. The respondent thereafter filed a Writ Petition

before the Bombay High Court and the same was withdrawn to avail

the benefit under Kar Vivad Samadhan Scheme, 1998 (in short, "KVS

Scheme"). Pursuant to the order passed under the KVS Scheme by

the designated authority, the respondent was directed to pay an

amount of `42,50,000/- (Rupees Forty Two Lakhs and Fifty Thousand

only) towards redemption fine and penalty and the designated

authority also gave liberty to the respondent to redeem the goods on

payment of duty at the appropriate rate. The respondent thereafter

requested the appellants for release of diamonds by placing reliance

on the Notification No.247/76-Cus dated 02.08.1976. This request

was turned down by the department and the respondent was informed



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                 3</span>
that the seized diamonds would be released only after payment of duty

in the light of the order (original) dated 03.12.1992. Respondent

thereafter preferred a Writ Petition No.1976 of 2000 before the

Bombay High Court. The said Writ Petition was dismissed by the

High Court, wherein it was specifically observed "that the petitioner

imported diamonds of foreign origin without a valid licence." This

order was questioned before this Court in S.L.P.(C) No.1495 of 2000.

This Court, by its order dated 06.09.2002, while dismissing the

Special Leave Petition, directed the Additional Collector of Customs

(Preventive), Mumbai or other appropriate Assessing Officer to

decide the amount of duty payable under the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_4">Customs Act</a> in respect

of seized goods.    The Commissioner of Customs vide order in

Original No.CCP/KPM/ADJN/M&amp;P/27/2002, quantified the duty

payable by the respondent for an amount of `2,20,50,125/- (Rupees

Two Crores Twenty Lakhs Fifty Thousand One Hundred and Twenty

Five only) before redemption of the confiscated diamonds. Being

aggrieved by the same, the respondent herein filed appeal before the

Tribunal and the Tribunal, by its order dated 23.06.2003, allowed the

appeal and held that the exemption would be available to the goods

imported by the respondent in the light of the Notification No.247/76-

     this appeal filed by the Revenue under <a href="/doc/191615710/" id="a_5">Section 130E(b)</a> of the Act.


</p><p id="p_9">3)   Shri R.P. Bhatt, learned senior counsel appearing for the Revenue,

     submitted that the benefit of the exemption notification cannot be

     extended to a person who/which had illegally imported rough

     diamonds into the country. He further argued that the same could not

     be availed by those persons who did not have the licence to import

     diamonds, or who had smuggled rough diamonds into the country

     clandestinely without payment of duty. Per contra, Dr. Surat Singh,

     learned counsel for the respondent-firm, would contend that there is

     no infirmity in the order passed by Tribunal since the Tribunal, by

     placing reliance on the principles laid down by this Court, has granted

     relief to the respondent-firm.

</p><p id="p_13">5)   <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_6">The Customs Act</a>, 1962 is an Act to consolidate and amend the law

     relating to Customs. The object of the Act is to regulate the import

     and export of goods, into and from the shores of India, or otherwise,

     and determine the customs duty payable. It also attempts to fill the

     lacunae of the previous customs legislations, viz., the Sea Customs

     Act and the Land Customs Act. It also aims to counter the difficulties

     that have emerged over the years due to the changing economic and

     financial conditions; amongst them it proposes to tackle the increasing

     problems of smuggling both in and out of the country. <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_7">The Act</a> aims

     to sternly and expeditiously deal with smuggled goods, and curb the

     dents on the revenue thus caused. In order to deal with the menace of

     smuggling, the authorities are enabled to detect, conduct search and

     seizure, and if necessary, confiscate such smuggled goods, within the

     territory of India.

      exemptions is that exemptions should generally be strictly interpreted

      but beneficial exemptions having their purpose as encouragement or

      promotion of certain activities should be liberally interpreted. This

      composite rule is not stated in any particular judgment in so many

      words. In fact, majority of judgements emphasize that exemptions are

      to be strictly interpreted while some of them insist that exemptions in

      fiscal Statutes are to be liberally interpreted giving an apparent

      impression that they are contradictory to each other. But this is only

      apparent.    A close scrutiny will reveal that there is no real

      contradiction amongst the judgements at all. The synthesis of the

      views is quite clearly that the general rule is strict interpretation while

      special rule in the case of beneficial and promotional exemption is

      liberal interpretation. The two go very well with each other because

      they relate to two different sets of circumstances.

      is plain and unambiguous. Therefore, we are required to consider the

      same in their ordinary sense. A construction which permits one to

      take advantage of one's own wrong or to impair one's own objections

      under a Statute should be disregarded. The interpretation should as

      far as possible be beneficial in the sense that it should suppress the

      mischief and advance the remedy without doing violence to the

      language.

<p id="p_31">
</p><p id="p_32">12)   From the wording of the above exemption notification, it is clear that

      the benefit of the exemption envisaged is for those goods that are

      imported. According to <a href="/doc/1304587/" id="a_30">Section 2(25)</a> `imported goods' has been

      defined to mean "...any goods brought into India from a place

      outside India but does not include goods which have been cleared for

      home consumption." It is necessary that the above definition is read

      along with <a href="/doc/1797702/" id="a_31">Section 11</a>, <a href="/doc/1384041/" id="a_32">Section 111</a> and <a href="/doc/398879/" id="a_33">Section 112</a> of the Act, which

liable for confiscation. The goods which have been seized in this case

cannot be imported into India without a licence under the Import

Control Act and there is, therefore, a prohibition in law for the import

of goods except in compliance with the Import Control Act. It is not

the case of the respondent-firm that the goods were imported with a

valid licence and, therefore any import of goods of which importation

is prohibited by law, cannot be valid import under the Act. Goods so

imported cannot therefore, be treated to be lawfully "imported goods"

within the definition of that term in <a href="/doc/1304587/" id="a_35">Section 2(25)</a> of the Act.

Therefore, the respondent was not entitled to the benefit of the

notification.   The learned counsel for the respondent would contend

that by virtue of the Notification No.247-Cus dated 02.08.1976, rough

diamonds are exempted from payment of duty under the Act and,

therefore, adjudicating authority was not justified in directing the

respondent for payment of duty under the Act for release of the

confiscated goods. We find no merit in the contention. The goods

become exempted goods provided all the conditions of the notification

are fulfilled. If any condition of the notification is not fulfilled, goods

are not exempted goods. [See Union of India Vs. Ganesh Metal

</p><p id="p_33">13)   In short, question before us is whether goods that are smuggled into

      the country can be read within the meaning of the expression

      `imported goods' for the purpose of benefit of the exemption

      notification. We are of the view that `smuggled goods' will not come

      within the definition of `imported goods' for the purpose of the

      exemption notification, for the reason, the Act defines both the

      expressions looking at the different definitions given to the two

      classes of goods: imported and smuggled, and we are of the view that

      if the two were to be treated as the same, then there would be no need

      this Act is explained by a conjoint reading of <a href="/doc/1304587/" id="a_36">Section 2(25)</a>, <a href="/doc/1797702/" id="a_37">Section

      11</a>, <a href="/doc/1384041/" id="a_38">Section 111</a> and <a href="/doc/398879/" id="a_39">Section 112</a>. Reading these Sections together, it

      can be found that one of the primary purposes for prohibition of

      import referred to the latter is the prevention of smuggling [See

      <a href="/doc/1726246/" id="a_40">section 11(2)(c)</a>]. Further, in the light of the objects of the Act and the

      basic skeletal framework that has been enumerated above, it is clear

      that one of the principal functions of the Act is to curb the ills of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                                                            14</span>
      smuggling on the economy. In the light of these findings, it would be

      antithetic to consider that `smuggled goods' could be read within the

      definition of `imported goods' for the purpose of the Act. In the same

      light, it would be contrary to the purpose of exemption notifications to

      accord the benefit meant for imported goods on smuggled goods.


</p><p id="p_36">15)   The Tribunal has relied on the decision of this Court in the case of

      <a href="/doc/952963/" id="a_41">Associated Cement Companies v. Commissioner of Customs</a>, [2001

      (128) ELT 21 (SC)] to extend the benefit of the exemption

      notification on the respondent-firm, despite the fact that the goods that

      were in question were not smuggled goods. In the case of Associated

      Cement Companies Ltd. (supra), the question that fell for

      consideration was whether customs duty was leviable on technical

      material supplied in the form of drawings, manuals and computer disc.

      etc. The further question was that if customs duty was leviable, how

      it was to be valued.     While answering the issue, this Court has

      observed that <a href="/doc/1510048/" id="a_42">Section 12</a> of the Act provides that the duties of customs

      shall be levied at such rates as may be specified under the <a href="/doc/442204/" id="a_43">Customs

      Tariff Act</a>. <a href="/doc/442204/" id="a_44">When the Customs Tariff Act</a> itself provides that the

      import of drawings and designs under Heading No.49.06 is `free', it

      must follow that these drawings and designs, though goods were not

      chargeable to duty. In our considered view, this decision would not

      assist the respondent herein. In the present case, as we have already

      stated that the notification exempts certain articles when imported into

      India from payment of duty under the Act. The import must be valid

      and in accordance with the provisions of the Act. In the present case,

      it is the finding of the Bombay High Court that the respondent-firm

      had imported diamonds of foreign origin without a valid licence and

      that finding has become final. Therefore, we agree with the learned

      senior counsel Sri R.P. Bhatt on this aspect. The Tribunal, in our

      view, erred in holding that the situation was covered by the case of

      Associated Cements Company (supra.) decided by this Court.


</p><p id="p_37">16)   The other two issues which were argued by the respondent and the

      revenue before the Tribunal and same was not answered since the

      Tribunal allowed the assessee's appeal by extending the benefit of the

      exemption notification to the respondent-firm. We are of the view that

      these issues now require to be considered by the Tribunal.

      Accordingly, while setting aside the order passed by the Tribunal, we

      remand the matter to the Tribunal to consider those issues after

      affording personal hearing to both the parties. The appeal is disposed

      of accordingly. No order as to costs.
