HEADNOTE:



JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">B.P. JEEVAN REDDY, J.:
</p><p id="p_2">1.   Leave granted.  Heard counsel for both  the parties.
</p><p id="p_3">2.   The  appeal  arises from the judgment and	order  of  a
learned	 Single Judge of the Karnataka High  Court  quashing
the charge framed by the learned Magistrate.
</p><p id="p_4">3.   A	complaint  was filed by the  appellant	against	 the
three  respondents  herein under <a href="/doc/1408202/" id="a_1">Section 500</a> of	 the  Indian
Penal Code.  After receiving the evidence of the prosecution
as  contemplated  by  <a href="/doc/1842242/" id="a_2">Section 244</a>,  the	 learned  Magistrate
framed the charge against the respondent-, under <a href="/doc/1408202/" id="a_3">Section 500</a>
of  the	 Indian Penal Code.  While framing the	charge,	 the
learned	 Magistrate has recorded his reasons  therefor.	  In
this  order,  he referred to the objections  raised  by	 the
accused and his reasons for rejecting the same.	 The learned
Magistrate  observed:  "(O)n  going  through  the   evidence
adduced before court by the complainant at this stage, I  am
of the considered opinion that there exist grounds to  frame
charge against A. 1 to 3 for the offence punishable U/S. 500
<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">I.P.C</a>." The first respondent preferred a Revision  (Criminal
Revision   Petition  No.104  of	 1989)	before	 the   First
Additional  Sessions Judge, Hubli against the order  of	 the
learned	 Magistrate.  The learned Sessions  Judge  dismissed
the   Revision	observing  that	 inasmuch  as  the   learned
Magistrate  has framed the charge on a consideration of	 the
evidence  adduced by the complainant, oral and	documentary,
and  on	 being satisfied that there was a prima	 facie	case
made out against the accused, his order is not liable to  be
interfered  with in Revision. He observed that a  Revisional
Court  can interfere with the order of the trial  magistrate
framing	 charges only where it finds that the order  of	 the
trial magistrate is illegal, capricious or perverse.  There-
upon  the first respondent approached the High	Court  under
<a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_5">Section	 482</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code praying for	 the
quashing  of the charge.  The learned Single  Judge  allowed
the petition on the Following basis:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	      "From the discussion made above, it has to  be
	      said that the approach of the Courts below  in
	      ordering	 to   frame   charge   against	 the
	      petitioner  and the other two accused  for  an
	      offence  punishable under <a href="/doc/1408202/" id="a_6">Section 500</a>  IPC  is
	      the  resultant of non- application of mind  to
	      the  material  available on  record  and	also
	      resultant	   of	 incorrect    exercise	  of
	      jurisdiction  conferred.	 The  Courts   below
	      should have borne in mind that a person can be
	      charged  only  when  the	allegations  alleged
	      against  him are established prima  facie	 and
	      not  otherwise, because in criminal cases	 the
	      Courts  must  be	very  cautious	and  careful
	      before   proceeding   to	 frame	 charge	  as
	      unnecessary framing of charge on the one	hand
	      may  result in affecting the  persons  liberty
	      and on the other hand cause continuous and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">	      128</span>
	      unnecessary harassment, as it has happened  in
	      the instant case.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	      From the allegations made in the complaint and
	      the  intention  to prosecute  the	 accused  by
	      pursuing the complaint the material placed  on
	      record  and  the information gathered  at	 the
	      trial it is clear that it is a matter of	mere
	      prestige for both the parties who according to
	      their   own   version  belong   to   different
	      political faiths.	 It is not a genuine case of
	      one making any inputation against the other or
	      the other being defamed or his reputation low-
	      ered  in the estimation of the  public.	This
	      prolonged	  and  protracted   litigation	 and
	      harassment to both the parties would have been
	      ended  in the beginning itself if	 the  courts
	      below had taken into consideration the  effect
	      of  <a href="/doc/1568411/" id="a_7">Section 245</a> Cr.P.C. and its  applicability
	      to the necessary material on record keeping in
	      mind   the   basis  of  the   complaint,	 the
	      admissibility of the documents in evidence and
	      the  circumstances  and context in  which	 the
	      alleged	imputations   were   made   by	 the
	      petitioner."
</blockquote><p id="p_5">4.   The  learned  Judge quashed the charge  not  only	with
respect	 to the first respondent-accused, who alone was	 the
petitioner before him, but also with respect to	 Respondents
2  and	3 (Accused 2 and 3 respectively),  who	had  neither
filed  a Revision before the Sessions Judge nor had  applied
to the High Court for quashing the charge.
</p><p id="p_6">5.   The  complainant-appellant, Shri Ganesh Narayan  Hegde,
says  that  he belongs to a highly  reputed  and  well-known
family	of  North Kanara district whose main  occupation  is
agriculture and sericulture.  Some members of the family are
running	 a rice mill and one of the sons of the	 complainant
is running a chemical factory.	The complainant says that he
is  the	 founder and President of  various  cooperative	 and
educational  institutions and that he is also  the  founder-
President  of Sahakari Shikshan Prasarak  Samithi,  Siddapur
and  is connected with certain other  educational  societies
and  banks.  He says that by sincere and selfless work	done
in  these  institutions he has acquired a  high	 status	 and
position in the society and that though he is the cousin  of
Shri  Ramakrishna  Hegde,  the	former	Chief  Minister	  of
Karnataka,  he is not associated with his  political  party.
According  to the complainant, the first  respondent-accused
is an active politician.  During the relevant period, he was
the  President of a political party -called  'Kranthiranga'.
The first respondent aspired to become the Chief Minister of
Karnataka  but	he  was frustrated in his  efforts  by	Shri
Ramakrishna Hegde who became the Chief Minister.  The  first
respondent  was,  therefore, waiting for an  opportunity  to
tarnish	  the  image  of  Shri	Ramakrishna   Hegde.	Shri
Ramakrishna Hegde contested to the Legislative Assembly from
Kanakapura  Constituency.  The first respondent	 set-up	 his
candidate against Shri Hegde.  In the course of the election
campaign,  the first respondent held a press  conference  on
April 28, 1983 at his residence at Bangalore.  Respondents 2
and 3 who are the Editor and Chief Reporter respectively  of
the  newspaper "Samyukta Karnataka", a daily, also  attended
the press conference.  The first respondent made  scandalous
and  false  imputations against the complainant	 during	 the
said  press conference and requested the  correspondents  to
publish	 the  same in their newspapers.	 The  news  item  as
published  in  "Samyukta  Karnataka"  daily  (in  its  Hubli
edition) reads thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	      "Involvement   of	 Hegde's  Brother  in	Rice
	      smuggling'?"
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">	      129</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">	      "Bangalore   -   28,  Sri	  S.Bangarappa	 the
	      President	  of  Kanriataka  Krantiranga,	 has
	      accused  to  day	that Sri  Ganesh  Hegde	 the
	      brother of the Chief Minister Sri	 Ramakrishna
	      hegde  is	 involving in smuggling of  rice  to
	      Goa.   Talking at a press conference, he	said
	      that  the	 authorities are not dared  to	take
	      action  against  the  mill  owner	 Sri  Ganesh
	      Hegde."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">		(Translation from Kannada)
</blockquote><p id="p_7">6.   The  complainant submitted that the said imputation  is
false to the knowledge of the first respondent and was	made
with  intention	 to defame and harm the	 reputation  of	 the
complainant.   The allegation of smuggling of  rice  leveled
against	 the  complainant is absolutely false and  that	 the
said false news item has lowered the prestige and reputation
of the complainant and his family in the eyes of the public.
His  case is that he is not the brother of Shri	 Ramakrishna
Hegde as made out in the news item but only a cousin.
</p><p id="p_8">7.   The  learned counsel for the appellants submitted	that
the   framing  of  charge  by  the  Magistrate	is   neither
misdirected  in	 law nor can it be said that  there  was  no
evidence  before  him  upon which he could  have  formed  an
opinion that there is ground for presuming that the  accused
has  committed	the offence within the	meaning	 of  <a href="/doc/415537/" id="a_8">Section
246(1)</a>.	 The learned Magistrate, it is submitted, considered
the  oral and documentary evidence, the decisions  cited  by
both  the  sides  and under a reasoned	order  rejected	 the
objections  raised  by the first respondent and	 framed	 the
charge.	  The learned Sessions Judge dismissed the  Revision
filed  by  the	first respondent holding  that	the  learned
Magistrate has acted properly and in accordance with law  in
framing	 the  charge  and  that there  are  no	grounds	 for
interfering with his orders.  A second Revision does not lie
under the code, and though an application under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_9">Section	 482</a>
of  the Code of Criminal Procedure is not barred,  the	High
Court  cannot  sit and act as the  second  Revisional  Court
while  exercising  the	powers	under  <a href="/doc/903398/" id="a_10">Section	482</a>.	This
provision  can	be invoked only where there is an  abuse  of
process of Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice.
Learned counsel complained that the learned Single Judge has
examined  the  matter as if he were an appellate  court	 and
quashed the charge on that approach and that he has exceeded
his  jurisdiction  in  doing so and  in	 interfering  at  an
interlocutory stage.
</p><p id="p_9">8.   Shri Sheshagiri Rao, the learned counsel for the  first
respondent  justified  the reasoning and conclusion  of	 the
learned	 Single Judge.	He submitted that the  complaint  is
the  result of political vendetta, that it is not a  genuine
grievance  and that the first respondent was not acting	 out
of any extraneous motives in making the statement complained
of.  Learned counsel submitted that the first respondent  is
an  active politician, that subsequently he has also  become
the  Chief Minister of Karnataka and that he made the  said-
statement  under  the bonafide belief that it is  true.	  He
made  the said statement, submitted the learned counsel,  in
good faith and in public interest.  The first respondent was
not  actuated  by any motives of personal gain	or  personal
animosity.  Learned counsel further submitted that the	said
publication  was  in the year 1983, that twelve	 years	have
passed	by  since  then and that any  interference  at	this
distance  of time may not be called for in the interests  of
justice.
</p><p id="p_10">9.   the complaint has been tried, it is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">130</span>
stated,	 according to the warrant procedure, at the  request
of  the	 first	respondent.  <a href="/doc/1842242/" id="a_11">Section  244(1)</a>  provides	that
"(W)hen, in any warrant-case instituted otherwise than on  a
police	report, the accused appears or is brought  before  a
Magistrate,  the  MagistratE  shall  proceed  to  hear	 the
prosecution and take all such evidence as may be produced in
support of the prosecution." SeCtion 245(1) says that "(1)f,
upon taking all the evidence referred to in <a href="/doc/1842242/" id="a_12">section 244</a>, the
Magistrate  considers, for reasons to be recorded,  that  no
case  against  the  accused  has been  made  out  which,  if
unrebutted,  would  warrant his conviction,  the  Magistrate
shall  discharge him." <a href="/doc/415537/" id="a_13">Section 246(1)</a> then says "(1)f,	when
such  evidence has been taken, or at any previous  stage  of
the case, the magistrate is of opinion that there is  ground
for presuming that the accused has committed an offence tri-
able under this Chapter, which such magistrate is  competent
to  try,  and  which, in his opinion,  could  be  adequately
punished by him, he shall frame in writing a charge  against
the accused.  "
</p><p id="p_11">10.  <a href="/doc/181589/" id="a_14">Section  399</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure  confers
upon  the Sessions Judge the power to revise any order	made
by  the Magistrate but sub-section (3) thereof	declares  at
the same time that "(W)here any application for revision  is
made  by  or  on behalf of any person  before  the  Sessions
Judge,	the  decision  of  the	Sessions  Judge	 thereon  in
relation  to  such  person shall be  final  and	 no  further
proceedings  by	 way  of revision at the  instance  of	such
person	shall be entertained by the High Court or any  other
Court."
</p><p id="p_12">11.  <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_15">Section  482</a> of the Code saves the inherent  powers  of
the High Court.	 It reads:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">	      "482.  Saving of inherent powers of High Court
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">	      -	 Nothing  in this Code shall  be  deemed  to
	      limit  or	 affect the inherent powers  of	 the
	      High  Court  to  make such orders	 as  may  be
	      necessary	 to give effect to any	order  under
	      this Code, or to prevent abuse of the  process
	      of  any Court or otherwise to secure the	ends
	      ofjustice."
</blockquote><p id="p_13">12.While  it  is  true that availing of the  remedy  of	 the
revision  to the Sessions Judge under <a href="/doc/181589/" id="a_16">Section 399</a>  does	 not
bar a person from invoking the power of the High Court under
<a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_17">Section	 482</a>, it is equally true that the High Court  should
not  act  as  a second Revisional Court under  the  garb  of
exercising  inherent powers.  While exercising its  inherent
powers	in  such a matter it must be conscious of  the	fact
that the learned Sessions Judge has declined to exercise his
revisory  power	 in  the  matter.   The	 High  Court  should
interfere  only where it is satisfied that if the  complaint
is allowed to be proceeded with, it would amount to abuse of
process of Court or that the interests of justice  otherwise
call  for quashing of the charges.  A few decisions of	this
Court	may  usefully  be  referred  at	 this	stage.	  <a href="/doc/1218313/" id="a_18">In
Mrs.Dhanalakshmi  v.  R.Prasanna  Kumar	 &amp;  Ors</a>.  (AIR	1990
S.C.494) this Court stated in a case of similar nature:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">	      "<a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_19">Section 482</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure
	      empowers	the  High  Court  to  exercise	 its
	      inherent	powers	to  prevent  abuse  of	 the
	      process  of Court.  In proceedings  instituted
	      on complaint exercise of the inherent power to
	      quash  the proceedings is called for  only  in
	      cases  where the complaint does  not  disclose
	      any  offence  or is  frivolous,  vexatious  or
	      oppressive.  If the allegations set out in the
	      complaint	 do  not constitute the	 offence  of
	      which cognizance is taken by the Magistrate it
	      is open to the High Court to quash
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">	      131</span>
	      the  same in exercise of the  inherent  powers
	      under  <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_20">Section  482</a>.   It	 is  not,   however,
	      necessary	 that there should be  a  meticulous
	      analysis of the case, before the trial to find
	      out  whether the case would end in  conviction
	      or  not.	 The complaint has to be read  as  a
	      whole.   If it appears on a  consideration  of
	      the allegations, in the light of the statement
	      on oath of the complainant that ingredients of
	      the offence/ offences are disclosed, and there
	      is  no material to show that the complaint  is
	      mala  fide  frivolous or	vexatious,  in	that
	      event  there  would be  no  justification	 for
	      interference by the High Court.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">	      The  High Court without proper application  of
	      the  principles  that have been laid  down  by
	      this Court in <a href="/doc/179764/" id="a_21">Sharda Prasad Sinha v. State  of
	      Bihar</a>, (1977) 2 SCR 357 : (AIR 1977 SC  1754),
	      <a href="/doc/1271780/" id="a_22">Trilok  Singh v. Satya Deo Tripathi</a>, 1980	 Cri
	      LJ  822: AIR 1979 SC 850 and <a href="/doc/1654416/" id="a_23">Municipal  Corpn.
	      of Delhi v. Purshotam Dass Jhunjunwala</a>, (1983)
	      1	 SCR  895: (AIR 1983 SC	 158)  proceeded  to
	      analyse  the  case of the complainant  in	 the
	      light  of	 all the probabilities in  order  to
	      determine	  whether  a  conviction  would	  be
	      sustainable and on such premises arrived at  a
	      conclusion  that	the proceedings	 are  to  be
	      quashed against all the respondents.  The High
	      Court  was clearly in error in  assessing	 the
	      material	before	it and concluding  that	 the
	      complaint	 cannot be proceeded with.  We	find
	      there  are  specific allegations in  the	com-
	      plaint  disclosing the ingredients of the	 of-
	      fence  taken  cognizance of.  It	is  for	 the
	      complainant to substantiate the allegations by
	      evidence at a later stage.  In the absence  of
	      circumstances  to	 hold prima facie  that	 the
	      complaint is frivolous when the complaint does
	      disclose the commission of an offence there is
	      no   justification  for  the  High  Court	  to
	      interfere.  "
</blockquote><p id="p_14">13.	 To  the  same	effect is  the	holding	 in  another
decision  in <a href="/doc/1871696/" id="a_24">State of Bihar v. Murad Ali Khan &amp;	 Ors</a>.  (1988
(4) S.C.C.655). This Court said:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">	      "It  is trite that jurisdiction under  <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_25">Section
	      482</a>,  <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_26">Cr.P.C</a>., which saves the inherent  power
	      of the High Court, to make such orders as	 may
	      be  necessary to prevent abuse of the  process
	      of  any Court or otherwise to secure the	ends
	      of justice, has to be exercised sparingly	 and
	      with   circumspection.   In  exercising	that
	      jurisdiction the High Court should not  embark
	      upon an enquiry whether the allegations in the
	      complaint	 are  likely to	 be  established  by
	      evidence or not.	That is the function of	 the
	      trial  Magistrate	 when  the  evidence   comes
	      before him, Though it is neither possible	 nor
	      advisable to lay down any inflexible rules  to
	      regulate	 that	jurisdiction,	one   thing,
	      however, appears clear and it is that when the
	      High  Court  is called upon to  exercise	this
	      jurisdiction  to	quash a	 proceeding  at	 the
	      stage  of the Magistrate taking cognizance  of
	      an  offence  the High Court is guided  by	 the
	      allegations,  whether those  allegations,	 set
	      out  in the complaint or the charge-sheet,  do
	      not in law constitute or spell out any offence
	      and that resort to criminal proceedings would,
	      in the circumstances amount to an abuse of the
	      process of the court or not.  "
</blockquote><p id="p_15">14.  Examined from the above stand point,it would be evident
that  the learned Single Judge of the High Court has  really
gone  beyond  the  purview of <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_27">Section 482</a>  in  quashing	 the
charge.	  He has not held that the evidence adduced  by	 the
complainant, oral and documentary, if unrebutted, would	 not
have  warranted	 the conviction of the	accused	 within	 the
meaning	 of  <a href="/doc/886596/" id="a_28">Section  245(1)</a> nor has he	 held  that  on	 the
evidence  adduced,  the learned Magistrate  could  not	have
reasonably  formed  an	opinion that  there  is	 ground	 for
presuming that the accused has committed an offence, as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">132</span>
contemplated by <a href="/doc/1152043/" id="a_29">Section 246(1)</a>.	 The learned counsel for the
respondent  has laid great stress upon the  observations  of
the learned Magistrate in para 26 of his order, which reads:
"A.   1 has challenged the evidence of all  these  witnesses
generally  and more particularly of the evidence of  P.W.  1
the  complainant.   In	my  opinion,  at  this	stage,	 the
evidentiary  value  of the documents  and  creditability  of
witnesses  cannot  be  considered in  view  of	the  settled
principles by Supreme Court of India in the decisions  cited
supra.	 All the contentions advanced on behalf	 of  accused
persons,  could be weighed at the time of final disposal  of
the  matter.  Therefore I am rather constrained	 to  refrain
from  examining	 any of the contentions	 canvassed  for	 the
accused	 or  considering  the repercussions  made  of  cross
examination  of witnesses, lest any observations made by  me
may  prejudice either of the parties at the time  of  trial.
Further the evidence referred to in <a href="/doc/1568411/" id="a_30">Section 245</a>, relates  to
evidence  before  charge.   Therefore I do  not	 propose  to
examine	 any  of  the contentions urged for  accused  No.  1
during the course of arguments and about the decisions cited
at the Bar on behalf of accused persons."
</p><p id="p_16">15.  The   learned   counsel  contended	  that	 the   above
observations  indicate that the learned Magistrate  has	 not
applied his mind to the evidence before him at all and	that
he has mechanically framed the charge.	We do not think that
the  learned counsel is right.	The said  observations	were
made  by  the  learned	Magistrate  with  reference  to	 the
decision of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/147262/" id="a_31">Akbar Dar v. State of Jammu
and  Kashmir</a>  (1982  SCC  (Criminal)  148)  referred  to  in
preceding  para 21 and should not be read in  isolation.   A
reading	 of the order does show that the learned  Magistrate
has  considered the oral and documentary evidence at  length
and finally expressed his opinion in paragraph 30 thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">	      "On going through the evidence adduced  before
	      court by the complainant at this stage.  I  am
	      of  the  considered opinion that	there  exist
	      grounds  to frame charge against A.1 to 3	 for
