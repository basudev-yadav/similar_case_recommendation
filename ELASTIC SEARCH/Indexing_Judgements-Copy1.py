This logo\\n     consists of three parallel lines at the base surmounted by a semi circle\\n     which is further surmounted by a crown like structure. The said logo was\\n\\nCS(OS) 2587/2010                                                   Page 4 of 13\\n      created at the instance of the plaintiff by Shobhagya Advertising Service.\\n     By virtue of an assignment in favour of the plaintiff by Shobhagya\\n     Advertising Service, the plaintiff is the proprietor of the copyright in the\\n     logo.    Copy of the Copyright Assignment Letter from Shobhagya\\n     Advertising Service to the Plaintiff is exhibited as Ex. PW-1/10.\\n10. Ms.Dogra, has also deposed that the design of the packaging of the\\n     plaintiff\\'s HERO HONDA spare parts was created by Mansa Packers (P)\\n     Ltd. which assigned the copyright in the packaging to the plaintiff. A copy\\n     of the Copyright Assignment Letter from Mansa Packers (P) Ltd. to the\\n     plaintiff is exhibited as Ex. PW-1/11. Samples of the plaintiff\\'s products\\n     bearing the said logo are collectively exhibited as Ex. PW-1/12 (i) to 1/12\\n     (iii).\\n11. This witness has also deposed that the said \"Hero Honda\" logo and the\\n     packaging design, layout, etc. constitute original artistic works within the\\n     meaning of Section 2 (c) of the Copyright Act, 1957 and the plaintiff is\\n     exclusively entitled to reproduction of the said logo as well as the\\n     packaging, being the proprietor thereof.\\n12. PW-1 has also deposed that the defendant, Mr. Rafiq Memon is the\\n     proprietor of Aamna Sales (Scooter House) having its office at Near\\n     Police Station, Opp. Girls School, Manendragarh - 497442, District:\\n     Manendragarh, Chhattisgarh, as recorded in the Local Commissioner\\'s\\n     report dated January 19, 2011, which is exhibited as Ex. PW-1/13. It is\\n     also deposed that defendant is engaged in the business of selling spare\\n     parts for two wheeler vehicles including counterfeit products bearing the\\n     plaintiff\\'s registered trade mark and logo.\\n13. It is also deposed that in October 2010, the plaintiff, through its\\n     representative/investigator appointed to ascertain infringing parties\\n\\nCS(OS) 2587/2010                                                Page 5 of 13\\n      involved in selling counterfeit products in Manendragarh, learnt that the\\n     defendants are engaged in selling motorcycle parts bearing the plaintiff\\'s\\n     registered trademark and logo which do not originate from the plaintiff.\\n     The investigator filed an affidavit dated December 14, 2010 with which\\n     photographs of the defendant\\'s products and defendant\\'s premises were\\n     attached. The Affidavit dated 14.12.2010 is exhibited as Ex. PW-1/14.\\n14. PW-1 has deposed that the products viz. one pack of Disk Clutch Friction,\\n     one Element Air Cleaner and one Valve Kit purchased by the investigator\\n     from the premises of the defendant prominently bears the plaintiff\\'s\\n     registered trademark HERO HONDA as well as the logo; and the quality\\n     and packaging of the defendant\\'s products as well as the prices at which\\n     the defendants\\' products are available clearly demonstrates that the said\\n     products are not manufactured by the plaintiff; and the poor finish of the\\n     logo on the defendants\\' products packaging also indicates that the said\\n     products do not originate from the plaintiff. She has deposed that the\\n     plaintiff\\'s spare parts department carried out a thorough check on the\\n     parts purchased from the defendant and came to the conclusion that\\n     following points indicate that the products purchased are counterfeits and\\n     non-genuine:\\n        a)       The price label is white in colour unlike that of the original\\n                 products which is green in colour.\\n        b)       The MRP of the counterfeit products is different from that of\\n                 the original products:\\n             \\uf0b7      Disk Clutch Friction: Counterfeit- Rs. 75 per unit vs.\\n                    Original- Rs. 82 per unit\\n             \\uf0b7      Element Air Cleaner: Counterfeit- Rs. 75 per unit vs.\\n                    Original - Rs. 61 per unit\\n\\n\\n\\nCS(OS) 2587/2010                                              Page 6 of 13\\n          c)      The word \"GENUINE\" printed on the price label of the\\n                 counterfeit products is in simple ink unlike the thermochromic\\n                 ink used in the original products.\\n         d)      The crown-like structure and the semicircle in the Hero Honda\\n                 logo printed on the borders of the packaging of these\\n                 counterfeit products, are overlapping one another.\\n         e)      The holographic strip on the price label of these counterfeit\\n                 products is a poor imitation of the Plaintiff\\'s original\\n                 holographic strip as it lacks the kinetic effect, 3D logo effect\\n                 and HH expanding and shrinking effect as in the original\\n                 products.\\n         f)      The description of the Element Air Cleaner on these\\n                 counterfeit products is as \"Element A & B Air Cleaner\"\\n                 instead of Element A Air Cleaner as in the original item.\\n         g)      The part No. on the counterfeit Disk Clutch Friction is\\n                 22201GF6000LS whereas on the original item it is\\n                 22201GF6000S.\\n         Samples of the defendant\\'s products have been filed and are\\n         collectively exhibited as Ex. PW-1/15 (i) to Ex. PW-1/15 (iii).\\n15.   Ms.Dogra has deposed that the unauthorized reproduction of the\\n      plaintiff\\'s registered trademark HERO HONDA amounts to infringement\\n      of the Registered Trademark Nos. 419115 and 513474 of the plaintiff; and\\n      the unauthorized reproduction of the plaintiff\\'s HERO HONDA logo and\\n      packaging amounts to infringement of the copyright vested with the\\n      plaintiff. She has also deposed that use of the plaintiff\\'s registered trade\\n      mark HERO HONDA amounts to a false statement as to the source\\n\\n\\nCS(OS) 2587/2010                                                Page 7 of 13\\n       identifier; and the use of the plaintiff\\'s registered trademark and the logo\\n      by the defendants would cause confusion and deception in the minds of\\n      the general public at large about a connection or affiliation with the\\n      plaintiff since the trademark connotes and denotes the plaintiff\\'s products\\n      alone; and the defendants are clearly passing off their goods as those\\n      originating from the plaintiff.\\n16.   PW-1 has further deposed that the plaintiff has been extremely diligent\\n      and proactive in protecting its intellectual property rights and has\\n      successfully taken legal actions against various third parties violating the\\n      plaintiff\\'s exclusive rights in the HERO HONDA trade mark and logo.\\n      Copies of the orders passed by this Court in various matters relating to\\n      third party infringers are collectively exhibited as Ex. PW-1/16 (Colly).\\n17.   This witness has also deposed that the defendants\\' conduct is clearly\\n      dishonest and malafide and guided by the desire to make unjust gains and\\n      is also perpetuating a fraud on the consumers; and the malafides of the\\n      defendants are plainly evident from the fact that the defendants have\\n      slavishly copied the minutest of details of the plaintiff\\'s products to\\n      deceive the customers. The counterfeit goods recovered from the\\n      defendants\\' premises during the execution of the local commission were\\n      three (3) packets (each containing two pieces) of counterfeit Swing Arm\\n      Bush.    It is also deposed that the counterfeit goods found at the\\n      defendants\\' premises during the execution of the local commission were\\n      six (6) pieces of counterfeit clutch plates and twenty (20) pieces of\\n      counterfeit Bearings bearing the plaintiff\\'s registered trade mark HERO\\n      HONDA and logo; and the defendants and his associates wrongfully\\n      removed and concealed the counterfeit products from the custody of the\\n      Local Commissioner during the course of the commission proceedings as\\n\\n\\n\\nCS(OS) 2587/2010                                                 Page 8 of 13\\n       recorded in the Local Commissioner\\'s report.           This witness has also\\n      deposed that to this effect plaintiff has filed a contempt petition CCP No.\\n      124 of 2011 and the same is pending before this Hon\\'ble Court. PW-1\\n      has further deposed that the Investigator had purchased counterfeit\\n      products viz. one pack of Disk Clutch Friction, one Element Air Cleaner\\n      and one Valve Kit from the defendant, thus the defendant is clearly\\n      indulging in manufacture and sale of a variety of counterfeit products; and\\n      since the defendant did not disclose their books of accounts during the\\n      Local Commission, it is not possible to obtain an accurate estimate of the\\n      volume of sales they have affected and over what period of time and at\\n      what profits. It is also deposed that the plaintiff estimates that by reason\\n      of the illegal trade activities of the defendants, the loss suffered in its\\n      business shall be to the tune of over Rs. 20,05,000/- whereas the damage\\n      to its goodwill and reputation cannot be assessed in monetary terms.\\n18.   I have heard counsel for the plaintiff and perused the plaint and the\\n      accompanying documents and the evidence led by the plaintiff.                The\\n      evidence of the plaintiff remained unrebutted. In this case at the stage of\\n      filing of the suit, interim orders were granted and Local Commissioner\\n      was also appointed to seize the goods in question. The goods were taken\\n      possession of and then released on superdari to the defendant. The\\n      plaintiff has established that the plaintiff is the proprietor of the registered\\n      trade mark HERO HONDA and logo. The plaintiff also hold the copyright\\n      in the logo and the packing material. The aforesaid facts and\\n      circumstances show that the plaintiff has the exclusive right to use the\\n      trademark HERO HONDA and the logo as also the packaging material in\\n      question. The defendant is attempting to counterfeit the products of the\\n      plaintiff and pass off its goods as that of the plaintiff. This not only\\n      causes loss of profits to the plaintiff, but results in inferior products made\\n\\n\\nCS(OS) 2587/2010                                                    Page 9 of 13\\n       available to the public at large who are deceived by the conduct of the\\n      defendant.\\n19.   In view of the above, the plaintiff is entitled to a decree of permanent\\n      injunction against the defendant from dealing with the goods having\\n      infringing mark in terms of prayers (a) to (c) of paragraph 20 of the plaint.\\n20.   The last aspect to be considered is the issue of damages for loss of\\n      reputation and business as also the cost of the present proceedings. It is\\n      trite to say that the defendant has deliberately stayed away from the\\n      present proceedings with the result that an enquiry into the accounts of\\n      the defendant for determination of damages cannot take place. However,\\n      the infringement of the trademark of the plaintiff as also its logo is not in\\n      dispute. The plaintiff has claimed damages to the tune of Rs.20,05,000/-\\n      for loss of sale and reputation payable to the plaintiff.   The attention of\\n      this Court has been drawn to a number of judgments in this behalf where\\n      dealing with similar situations, damages have been awarded.\\n21.   In the case of \\'M/s L.T. Overseas Ltd. v. M/s Guruji Trading Co. and\\n      Anr. [CS (OS) No. 2711/1999] decided on 07.09.2005 this court had\\n      granted Rs.3 lakhs damages to the plaintiff. In the case of Relaxo Rubber\\n      Limited and Anr. v. Selection Footwear and Anr., 1999 PTC 578, the\\n      defendant did not file the written statement after taking time for the same\\n      and a decree was passed under Order VIII Rule 10 of the Code of Civil\\n      Procedure, 1908. Against the claim of tentative damages of Rs.5 lakhs,\\n      Rs.3 lakhs was awarded as damages. In another case of Hindustan\\n      Machines v. Royal Electrical Applies, 1999 PTC (19) 685, a sum of Rs.3\\n      lakhs was awarded.\\n22.   In   the     case   of   Time    Incorporated     v.   Lokesh     Srivastava\\n      and Anr., 2005 (30) PTC 3 (Del) where apart from compensatory\\n\\nCS(OS) 2587/2010                                                  Page 10 of 13\\n      damages of Rs.5 lakhs, punitive damages have also been awarded. It\\n     would be useful to reproduce paras 7 and 8 of the said judgment, which\\n     are as under :-\\n23.   Learned counsel for the plaintiff states that damages have been claimed in\\n      the present suit and the plaintiff is entitled to the damages to the tune of\\n      Rs.20,05,000/-.\\n24.   I am in agreement with the aforesaid submission of learned counsel for\\n      the plaintiff that damages in such cases must be awarded and a defendant,\\n      who chooses to stay away from the proceedings of the Court, should not\\n      be permitted to enjoy the benefits of evasion of court proceedings. Any\\n      view to the contrary would result in a situation where the defendant who\\n      appears in Court and submits its account books would be liable for\\n      damages, while a party which chooses to stay away from court\\n      proceedings would escape the liability on account failure of the\\n      availability of account books. A party who chooses to not participate in\\n\\n\\n\\nCS(OS) 2587/2010                                                 Page 12 of 13\\n       court proceedings and stays away must, thus, suffer the consequences of\\n      damages as stated and set out by the plaintiff. There is a larger public\\n      purpose involved to discourage such parties from indulging in such acts of\\n      deception and, thus, even if the same has a punitive element, it must be\\n      granted. R.C. Chopra, J. has very succinctly set out in Time Incorporated\\'s\\n      case (supra) that punitive damages are founded on the philosophy of\\n      corrective justice. That was the case where the publishers of Time\\n      Magazine had come to Court and one of the factors which weighed while\\n      awarding punitive damages was that the readers had been sufferers of the\\n      infringement of the mark of the plaintiff. The only difference is that in the\\n      present case it is the consumer of the products of the plaintiff, who have\\n      suffered as a consequence of the infringement of the mark and logo of the\\n      plaintiff by the defendant.\\n25.   For the reasons stated above, the plaintiff has made out a case for grant of\\n      decree as prayed in the plaint. Accordingly, the order dated 21.12.2010 is\\n      confirmed and the suit is decreed in favour of the plaintiff and against the\\n      defendant with costs. Plaintiff is also entitled to the damages to the tune\\n      of Rs.5.0 lacs.\\n                                                                  G.S.SISTANI,J\\nFEBRUARY 28, 2012\\nssn\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCS(OS) 2587/2010                                                 Page 13 of 13\\n'}},\n",

The plaintiff filed the instant suit under Sections 134 and 135 of Trademark Act, 1999 as well as under Section 51 of Indian Copyrights Act seeking permanent injunction against the defendant alleging therein that the defendant was infringing the trademark and logo of the plaintiff viz 'Marc'.\\n2. It is submitted by the plaintiff that the plaintiff conceived and coined word 'Marc' and started using it as its trademark as well as logo since 1981 and developed the goodwill and reputation under the above trademark and logo. The plaintiff had become the owner of the trademark and logo because of exclusive use and the goods of the plaintiff bearing this trademark were distributed in major parts of the country. The plaintiff's trademark/logo 'Marc' was duly registered under the Trademark Act under No. 420735B in Class '9' and under No. 420736 in Class '1' and 420737B in Class '7' on 16.4.1984. The trademark was registered in respect of the goods under Class '7', '9' and '11'. The trademark was renewed from time to time and the registration was still valid. By virtue of the registration of this trademark in favor of the plaintiff and by way of long use, the plaintiff had exclusive right over the trademark within the meaning of Section 28 and 29 of the Trademark Act and the plaintiff filed number of applications for registration of the trademark in different classes. The plaintiff has been advertising and promoting this trademark through different means and has given wide publicity to this trademark through newspapers, trade literatures and trade hoardings. The plaintiff also gave its sale figures starting from 1981-82. The total annual sale figure during 1981-82 was Rs. 9,75,822/- and the sale figures for 2003-2004 was Rs. 14,65,02,583/-. There has been gradual increase in the sales from 1981 to 2004 It is stated that the plaintiff was using highest standards of business and quality and the trademark/logo 'Marc' of the plaintiff has become distinctive indicative of the plaintiff and the plaintiff's goods and business. It is alleged that defendant No. 1 and their authorized dealers were using the trademark/logo 'Marc' in an identical and deceptively similar manner as being used by the plaintiff with the same get up and make up for the goods like electrical switches and accessories. Both plaintiff's and the defendants' goods and business were same or similar and they are dealing with same line of business in the market. The trademark of the defendant was bound to cause deception and confusion in the normal course of business activities of the plaintiff. The defendants adopted the trademark/logo 'Marc' out of greed with a view to take advantage of the goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff and to create a confusion amongst the market and the consumers. The trademark adopted by the defendants amounted to indulgence in unfair trade and competition and was a dishonest, tainted and ill-motivated. The defendants were trying to cash in on the reputation and goodwill of the plaintiff and in turn were damaging the reputation of the plaintiff. The defendants were guilty of infringement of the trademark and logo of the plaintiff and were also passing off of their goods as those of the plaintiff thereby the defendants were violating not only the rights under the Trademark Act, 1999 but also common law rights of the plaintiff. Due to the activities of the defendants, the plaintiff was suffering tremendously in the business and goodwill and intending buyers were being deceived. The plaintiff came across the goods of the defendants towards the end of March 2005 being imitating trademark and the plaintiff inquired in the market at its level that the defendant had started commercially using the trademark only recently and the defendants were carrying their activities in a clandestine and deceitful manner. It is alleged that the defendants were not issuing any formal bills or invoices.\\n3. In the application under Order 39 Rule 1 and 2 CPC, the plaintiff sought ad interim injunction against the defendants restraining them from using the trademark /logo 'Marc' or any other trademark or logo identical or deceptively similar to that of the plaintiff.\\n4. In written statement filed by the defendants, the defendants claimed that the plaintiff was manufacturing certain electrical accessories and gadgets under the Trademark 'Marc' whereas the defendant No. 1 was using the trademark in respect of switches, sockets, holders, three pin plugs etc. The trademark of the defendant No. 1 was entirely different in writing, style, get up, layout, logo and colour combination from that of the plaintiff. There was no infringement of the trademark of the plaintiff, neither action for passing off of the goods was maintainable. The documents filed by the plaintiff show that the plaintiff was manufacturer of water heaters and was marketing fans under the trade names like Usha, Innova etc. The defendants were neither manufacturing nor marketing electrical accessories as the one being marketed by the plaintiff, therefore, no passing off action lies against the defendants. It is further submitted that the plaintiff had no right or title to sue the defendants since the trademark 'Marc' was registered in the name of the defendant under Number 1012263 in Class '9' since April 2001 in a different artistic style get up and lay out, which was entirely different from that of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was neither manufacturing nor marketing electrical accessories like switches, holders, distribution boxes etc, being manufactured by the defendants and the goods of the plaintiff and defendants were altogether different. It is further submitted that the word 'Marc' being used by the plaintiff as well as by the defendants was not an invented or coined word and it was only a mis-spelt form of the original word 'mark' and word 'Marc' is in common use by several manufacturers in respect of the electrical and electronic appliances/goods and plaintiff cannot claim to be the sole proprietor of the word 'Marc'. The defendant had applied for trademark 'Marc' for electrical switches, holders, sockets etc in Class '9' on 28.5.2001. The defendant received examiner 's report on 21st September 2002. The defendant filed application of user and the application of the defendant was advertised in Trademark Journal Mega-14 dated 25.10.2003. There was no opposition to the registration by the plaintiff or anyone else within the meaning or scope of Section 21 of the Trademark Act and, therefore, defendant became the registered owner of the trademark 'Marc' for the goods being manufactured by the defendants within the meaning of Section 28. The plaintiff had no exclusive right to use the word 'Marc' in respect of the goods to that of the plaintiff. All allegations made by the plaintiff against the defendants were denied. It was denied that the defendant was selling the goods without valid invoices and vouchers or that the defendants were infringing the trademark and logo of the plaintiff or passing off its goods as that of the plaintiff. It is submitted that the defendants were manufacturing their goods as per ISI standard and were registered with ISI. They were manufacturing the standard quality products and they have a stake in the quality of the goods and the trademark 'Marc' in respect of the goods they were manufacturing. The defendant No. 1 has been exclusively and uninterruptedly using the trademark and logo 'Marc' since April 2001 and the claim of the plaintiff was false.\\n5. The defendants also filed a counter claim against the plaintiff giving same facts and praying an injunction against the plaintiff that the plaintiff be restrained from using the trademark and logo 'Marc' in respect of the goods like electrical switches, plugs, electrical holders, change over, distribution boxes etc. with trademark 'Marc'. Similarly an application under Order 39 Rule 1 and 2 has been made by the defendants for permanent injunction has been made in the counterclaim.\\n6. I have perused the documents filed by the both parties. The documents filed by the plaintiff would show that the plaintiff was using the word 'Marc' for ceiling fans, exhaust fans, wall mounted fans, water heaters, oil heaters and room heaters. The entire trade literatures of the plaintiff is in respect of these items only. The plaintiff has also filed the defendant's catalogue in respect of switches which show that the defendant was using the trademark 'Marc' for electrical switches, plugs, etc. In the registration certificate filed by the plaintiff, different items for which it got the trademark registered are given and these items are plugs, pressure cookers, milk cookers, table lamp, electrical fans, bulb holders, lighting fixtures and fittings installation, Florance tube etc. However, except for geysers, room heaters, oil heater, fans, literature of invoices of no other item has been placed on record being marketed or manufactured by the plaintiff. The defendant, on the other hand, has placed on record its own trade literatures and packing materials in respect of the goods being manufactured by it and the defendant is manufacturing electrical switches, cut outs, plugs, holders, change overs, regulators, sockets, tubes strips etc. The defendant has also placed on record the registration of trademark 'Marc' under Class '9' for its goods. It has also placed on record the other documents showing that the trademark 'Marc' was not a coined word and was a commonly used word by several other companies and manufacturers. A search from ROC has been placed on record showing that at least 54 companies were having the word 'Marc' as their first trade name coupled with other names and words. The plaintiff has also placed on record Internet search in respect of the use of word 'Marc' by other manufacturers and there are several manufacturers who use word 'Marc' either as a trade name or as logo or as trademark in respect of different goods. He has placed the list of at least 20 such manufacturers who were using the trademark/logo of trade name 'Marc' for various goods.\\n7. It is argued by counsel for the plaintiff that the plaintiff company M/s Marc Enterprise Private Limited was using the trademark/logo 'Marc' for last 25 years and has earned goodwill and reputation. The trademark of the plaintiff was registered with the Registrar even for those items which were being manufactured by the defendant and since the plaintiff was a registered proprietor of the trademark, the subsequent registration of the trademark obtained by defendant, does not give a right to the defendant to use the trademark 'Marc' for similar or same goods. The plaintiff was manufacturing electrical appliances and the goods being manufactured by the defendant were also electrical items and there was every possibility that the consumer would consider that the goods manufactured by the defendant were goods of the plaintiff. The plaintiff being the registered proprietor of the trademark has exclusive right to use the trademark in respect of the goods and services in respect of which the trademark was registered.\\n8. On the other hand, counsel for the defendant has argued that the plaintiff was not manufacturing any of the items being manufactured by the defendant. The plaintiff has not placed on record a single document showing that it has sold switches, holders, switch overs, plugs, sockets etc. and all invoices and documents placed on record are in respect of electrical appliances like heaters, fans etc. Since the trademark of the defendant was also registered, the plaintiff cannot claim any exclusive right to restrain the defendant from using the trademark 'Marc' for its own goods. It has also been submitted that the visual representation of the trademark by the defendant was entirely different to that of the plaintiff qua colour scheme and other aspects are also quite different.\\n9. A comparison of the trade literatures placed on record by the plaintiff with that of the defendant would show that the defendant is not copying the style and trademark of the plaintiff. While in case of plaintiff, all the letters are of same height and written in a plain simple and bold manner and there is a circle before word 'Marc' wherein word 'M' is made at the bottom of the circle in an artistic manner. The literatures of the defendant shows that the defendant has used the word 'Marc' in an altogether different manner. The first and last word are of the same height and in between the two words 'a' and 'r' are half the size and width and above that is a 'thunder' sign and the words 'tm' are written above the word 'c'. There is no circle before 'marc' The trade literatures also shows that defendant has shown only those items which are being manufactured by the defendant like electrical switches, sockets, switch over, regulators etc. There is no similarity either qua colour combination or visual representation of the two marks. The plea of the plaintiff that the defendant was copying its logo and had also copied the colour combination, colour scheme, is prima facie baseless.\\n10. It is an undisputed fact that the defendant was also a registered proprietor of the trademark 'Marc' and it was being used by defendant for different goods. In P.M. Diesels Pvt. Ltd. v. Thakural Mechanical Works, PTC (Supp.) (2) 863 (Del.), this Court, inter alia, observed as under:\\n15. In the present case the plaintiff is the registered proprietor of the trademark 'Field Marshal', in respect of diesel oil engines or parts thereof. The defendants, on the other hand, are also the registered proprietor of the trademark 'Field Marshal', but in respect of centrifugal pumps etc. Inasmuch as both the plaintiff and the defendants are the registered proprietors of the trademark which are identical, namely 'Field Marshal' the provisions of Section 28(3) of the Act would be applicable to the present case. By virtue of this provision, the exclusive right to use the trademark 'Field Marshal', shall not be deemed to have been acquired either by the plaintiff or by the defendant as against each other, but both the plaintiff as well as the defendant have otherwise the same rights as against other persons as they would have if they were the sole proprietors. Section 28(3) therefore, protects the proprietory rights of both the plaintiff as well as the defendant. They would be entitled to take action against anyone, if the trademark is infringed, but neither the plaintiff nor the defendant are entitled to take action against each other because both of them are registered proprietors of identical trademark, though in respect of different types of goods.\\n16. Learned Counsel for the plaintiff sought to reply upon a decision in the case of the Valentine Extract Company Limited (1901 (18) RPC 175) so as to contend that an injunction can be issued restraining the registered owner of a trademark from using the said mark. The head note of the said report reads as follows:\\nV, in 1897, registered three Trademark, each consisting of the word\\n \\n\\n'Valtine' for all goods in Classes 3 and 42, and in Class 43 for beer and spirits, and purported to assign them to a Limited Company formed to carry on the business of meat extract manufacturer, with his good will, if any. Another Company obtained an injunction restraining the Limited Company from selling meat extract or meat juice under the name 'Valtine' and subsequently moved to remove the marks from the Register of Trade Marks, the grounds of the application being that at the date of the assignment V. had no goodwill to assign, that the marks were deceptive, and had not been used except for meat extract. An Order was made moving the marks from the Register with costs.\\n17. In my opinion, the aforesaid decision can be of no assistance to the plaintiff. Firstly, Mr. Justice Farewell of the Chancery Division had no occasion to consider or deal with a provision similar to Sections 28 and 31 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. The submission of Mr. Anand, learned Counsel for the defendant is that in fact the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act applicable in England at that time did not contain a provision similar to Sections 28 and 31 of the Indian Act. Secondly, no contention was raised before the Court in Valentine's case that an injunction cannot be granted restraining the registered owner from using the trademark.\\n11. In Jindal Industries Limited v. Nirmal Steel Tubes Pvt. Ltd. 1995 PTC 75 this Court refused to issue injunction against the defendant having trademark 'Nirmal' shown across the map of India in oval shape whereas the trademark of the plaintiff was 'Jindal' written across the map of India in Oval shape, since defendant was registered owner of trademark.\\n12. In Tee Cee Hosiery Works v. Grover Sons, FAO 97/1987, 2004(29) PTC 532 (Del.) defendant was the registered proprietor of trademark 'SPLASH'. This Court held that no injunction would lie against the appellant since the appellant was holding a registered trademark in its name and the remedy available to the respondent was to have the trademark cancelled.\\n13. The plea of the plaintiff is that the plaintiff was the registered proprietor of trademark in Class '9', through the defendant was also a registered proprietor of same trademark for Class '9', but since the plaintiff's trademark was registered earlier in time, the defendant should be restrained from manufacturing the goods. If the plaintiff had been manufacturing the same items as were being manufactured by the defendant, the plaintiff would have a case. In the instant case, however, plaintiff is not manufacturing the goods which were being manufactured by the defendant. Even if the plaintiff has got the trademark registered for a class of items, the plaintiff was not using this trademark for the goods which were being manufactured by the defendant and the defendant, therefore, cannot be restrained from being using the trademark 'Marc' for the goods manufactured by it.\\n14. In Sona Spices Pvt. Ltd. v. Soongachi Tea Industries Pvt. Ltd. 2007 (34) PTC 91(Del.) the plaintiff was the owner of registered trademark 'Sona' in Class '30' but was using it for spices only whereas the defendant was also registered trademark owner of trademark 'Sona' in respect of class '30' and was using it for Tea and other beverages. The trademark of the plaintiff was registered in October, 1980. The trademark of defendant was registered in respect of Tea in June 1983. The plaintiff contended that it was prior user of trademark 'Sona' and has commenced its business sometime in 1975 and defendant was passing off its tea as that of the plaintiff. This Court observed that plaintiff has not made out a prima facie case for interference even though plaintiff may be entitled to say that its user of trademark 'Sona' can extend beyond spices such as tea but the plaintiff has not utilized its trademark for manufacture of tea, prior to 1993 while the defendant was manufacturing the tea much prior to 1993 i.e. since 1978-79 and was user of trademark 'Sona' in respect of Tea. The plaintiff had taken no steps to protect its interests in respect of trademark 'Sona' regarding manufacture and sale of tea. The Court, therefore, held that there was no case in favor of the plaintiff and refused to grant injunction to the plaintiff against the use of the trademark 'Sona' by defendant.\\n15. In Canon Kabushiki Kaisha v. B. Mahajan and Ors 2007 (35) PTC 265(Del) the applicant sought interim injunction against the trademark and copyrights of mark 'Canon' used for imaging equipments and information systems alleging that defendant was using the trademark 'canon' for similar style and get up in goods consisting of nuts, bolts and fasteners etc. This Court observed that while considering the action of passing off, the Court has to keep in mind if there was likelihood of even in the minds of the customers. If there was dissimilarity in the goods and services, the possibility of confusion and suspicion would normally be less. This Court also observed that the plaintiff in fact has not used its registered trademark in respect of the goods falling in Class '6' and '20' and, therefore, there seems to be no force in the defendants submission that the registration obtained by the plaintiff is liable to be taken off the register under Section 47 of the Trademarks Act because of its use. The defendants had been using the trademark 'canon' as part of their trademark since 1995 for fasteners, nut, bolts and the application of the defendant was also advertised in trademarks journals based on users. The defendant had also participating in various exhibitions and openly using the the mark 'canon' as part of their trade name and style and the plaintiffs did not even claim to have objected to the same. The Court refused to issue interim injunction in favor of the plaintiff. This Court also observed that a large number of entities world over were apparently using the mark 'canon' as part of their style and trademarks. Thus, the mark 'canon' was not distinctive of plaintiff's goods world over.\\n16. In Vishnudas trading as Vishnudas Kishendas v. Vazir Sultan Tobacco Co. Ltd. 1996 PTC (16) 512 (SC) the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as under:\\n In our view, if a trader or manufacturer actually trades in or manufactures only one or some of the articles coming under a broad classification and such trader or manufacturer has no bona fide intention to trade in or manufacture other goods or articles which also fall under the said broad classification, such trader or manufacturer should not be permitted to enjoy monopoly in respect of all the articles which may come under such broad classification and by that process preclude the other traders of manufacturers to get registration or separate and distinct goods which may also be grouped under the broad classification. If registration has been given generally in respect of all the articles coming under the broad classification and if it is established that the trader or manufacturer who got such registration had not intended to use any other article except and articles being used by such trader or manufacturer, the registration of such trader is liable to be rectified by limiting the ambit of registration and confining such registration to the specific article or articles which really concern the trader or manufacturer enjoying the registration made in his favor. In our view, if rectification in such circumstances is not allowed, the trader or manufacturer by virtue of earlier registration will be permitted to enjoy the mischief of trafficking in trade mark. Looking to the Scheme of the registration of trade mark as envisaged in the Trade Mark Act and the Rules framed there under, it appears to us that registration of a trademark cannot be held to be absolute, perpetual and invariable under all circumstances.\\n17. I find that the plaintiff has failed to show that it has a prima facie case that the defendant was copying its trademark and logo. The style and logo of circle with 'M' was not at all there in the literature of defendant and trademark 'MARC' was also written in different style and manner. The defendant was neither marketing nor manufacturing the goods being marketed/manufactured by the plaintiff. The defendant was registered proprietor of the trademark 'MARC' for the goods being manufactured by it. The word 'MARC' was not a coined word or invention of the plaintiff. It was and is being extensively used world over as a trade name, a trade style and as a first name of the company.\\n18. In view of above scenario, I find that no case is made out for issuing injunction either against the plaintiff or against the defendants from using the trademark/logo 'MARC'. It is further directed that in all their literatures, the plaintiff and defendants shall write the name of the company prominently to indicate as to who was the manufacturer of the goods and on packing materials both plaintiff and defendants shall write the name of the company/manufacturer so that the customers know who is the manufacturer.\\n19. With above directions, both the applications stand disposed of. No orders as to costs.\\nCS(OS) No. 1059/2005\\n \\n\\nList on 8th August 2008.\\n\"}},\n",

A colour is not the property of any individual, but colour combinations used in a particular pattern may create identification with a product.\\n2. \"What\\'s in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would also smell as sweet\", said William Shakespeare. There is but still a tendency to copy the names because a rose is a rose. An amalgam of colour combinations, names and logos may create a total identification with a product and the allegation of copying the same has given rise to the present litigation.\\n3. The plaintiff is a registered partnership firm engaged in the business of manufacture of incense sticks or agarbathies. Initially, the business was established as a proprietorship concern in 1948 by the father of the present partners of the plaintiff firm and is stated to be now a part of the RANGSONS GROUP started by late Shri N. Ranga Rao. The diversified business now carried on by the Group is stated to not only include the business in question, but also other businesses like electronics and education, though the flagship firm of the Group is remain the plaintiff concern.\\n4. The plaintiff initially is stated to have adopted the brand-name CYCLE BRAND AGARBATHIES and CYCLE THREE-IN-ONE AGARBATHI which is stated to remain the largest selling brand of agarbathies in India. However, apart from the said brand, the plaintiff is also manufacturing number of other brands such as LIA, SANDALUM & CHANDANAM, PARAMPARA, INDIAN BRIDE, PEHCHAN, CYCLE POPULAR, ISHTA, ALL IN 1, NR YAGNA, RHYTHM AMBER & ORIENT, BANSURI, MOODS, PRESTIGE, HONEY ROSE, FLUTE INIMAI & NAVIN, FAIRY TALE AND RAHASYAMAI.\\n5. The plaintiff claims to be a pioneer in the agarbathi industry with various innovating marketing techniques as also packaging. The plaintiff is, thus, stated to have inter alia introduced the concept of three fragrances in one pack, professionalise techniques for marketing and management, hexagonal and rectangular packaging. The plaintiff is stated to have won export awards both from Union of India and Government of Karnataka.\\n6. The plaintiff claims to be marketing its products all over India and spends money in creating consumer awareness and brand building. The Marketing and Sales Division under M/s. Prosperity Marketing Services (P) Ltd., Mysore is stated to employ more than 250 sales and marketing people and the amount spent on advertisements alone for the financial year 2002-2003 is stated to be Rs. 389.7 lakhs.\\n7. The plaintiff claims that its strength lies in making innovative and original brands of fragrances keeping in mind the preferences and requirements of consumers across classes. Thus, some of the agarbathi products are more used during prayer or pooja, while others are used for creating ambiance or atmosphere. These cater to different times of the day or different types of moods. In this process of innovation, one of the range of products, which was introduced by the plaintiff in the market is LIA range of products. This name is stated to have been adopted in 2001 and copies of some purchase orders have been filed for the relevant period.\\n8. The LIA range of agarbathies consists of variety of exclusive fragrances including ROSE LIA, FRESH / SEASHORE LIA, SANDAL / CHANDANAM LIA, JASMINE LIA, NATURE\\'S GIFT LIA, VIBRANT / RAINBOW LIA, SPICE WORLD LIA, FRUIT LIA.\\n9. The mark LIA is stated to be distinctive and arbitrary in nature as the word \\'LIA\\' has no meaning. The word \\'LIA\\' is also stated to be uncommon in agarbathi market where most brands are based on the name of Gods or words associated with worship and rituals. The word \\'LIA\\' is, thus, stated to be extremely contemporary and is claimed to have a sophisticated ring to it which sets it apart from other brands in the agarbathi market. One of the features of the marketing of these agarbathies is stated to be the introduction of packs of 35 sticks range at Rs. 15/-. This packaging is stated to be distinctive as compared to most agarbathies in the market sold in boxes of 20-22 sticks per box and offered @ Rs. 10/- per box.\\n10. The get-up and colour scheme of this range of LIA is stated to be distinctive and the packaging cartons are of different colours depending on each colour conjuring associations with the concerned fragrance. Despite this, there is a uniformity in the scheme of the base consisting of pastel shade softening to whitish towards the centre of the box where the logo / trademark of LIA is printed. The LIA trademark is written in sloping font at slightly upward angle with a line underscoring the word \\'LIA\\'. The text regarding the name of fragrance, the brand-name of the product and the general effect and the fragrance is printed below the LIA logo. A motif of the plant / location associated with the fragrance is printed above the LIA logo. Small semi-circular and ribbon banners containing text are also printed on the cartons and on the side of the cartons, the brand-name is printed in Devnagiri, Tamil, Kannada, Telugu and Malayalam scripts. In view thereof, it is stated that the labels are extremely attractive and eye-catching and have gained enormous reputation in the market. The impact is composite consisting of the brand-name LIA, the colour scheme of the cartons and the various shades used for each fragrance, the labeling, the design lay-out as well as the unique price range, as such the plaintiff claims to own all the common law rights in the LIA brand-name and all the various products in the said range. The art work in lay-out plan of the cartons are stated to have been designed by professionals for the plaintiff firm and the rights are stated to vest in the plaintiff under Section 17 of The Copyright Act, 1957.\\n11. The plaintiff has set out in the plaint the registration details of the artistic works on the carton for several of the LIA range of products, which have been registered on 22.07.2003 for SANDAL, JASMINE, ROSE, SPICE, FRUIT AND FRESH LIA range. The plaintiff has also stated that an application is pending before the Trademark Registry for the mark and label LIA for agarbathies in Class 3.\\n12. In a short span of time of marketing of this product under LIA range, the same is stated to have become extremely popular and earned enormous goodwill and reputation. The turnover, as certified by the Chartered Accountants, for the two financial years has been given as under:-\\n  Year Turnover for LIA range of products\\n2002-2003 Rs. 243.67 Lakhs\\n2003-2004 Rs. 413.17 Lakhs\\n \\n\\n13. The plaintiff claims to have large presence in Delhi apart from all over the country including for the LIA range of products. The products are stated to have been advertised in major national and regional dailies and the expenditure for the financial year 2003-2004 for this range of products is stated to be Rs. 12.39 Lakhs. The sales are stated to have been rising and the products identified with the packaging used in connection with the LIA products, which is claimed to be the single source identifier of the said product.\\n14. The plaintiff is aggrieved by the products sold by the defendants in and around Delhi under the name of DIA in cartons which are claimed to be identical to that of the plaintiff\\'s LIA cartons. The DIA range of agarbathies of the defendants is being sold in identical fashion in respect of six of plaintiff\\'s LIA products. Defendants No. 1 and 2 are the Directors of defendant No. 3 company, while defendant No. 4 is the Sales and Marketing Division of defendant No. 3. The mark is stated to be deceptively similar to the plaintiff\\'s LIA mark - both phonetically and visually and the essential and distinctive features of the packaging of LIA agarbathies is stated to have been copied. There is also commonality in the choice of names, price and quantity of the sticks per pack and theme and layout packaging is claimed to be more than a mere co-incidence.\\n15. The plaintiff has emphasized the fact that the defendant claims to have an address, which is printed on the side of the carton, as follows:-\\nDivya Incense (India) Pvt. Ltd. \\n# 13, Divya Mansion, 1st Main Road, \\nSrirampuram, Saibaba Nagar, \\nBangalore - 560 021.\\n16. The plaintiff claims that on investigation, it has been revealed that there is no such office at the given address, but that there is a building called Keerthi Mansion where there is a board carrying the name Keerti Parimala Works. The goods of the defendants are stated to be manufactured at NOIDA unit and the defendants also have a showroom in Gaziabad. The defendants\\' cartons have fragrance names printed on the side of the carton in Devnagri, Tamil, Kannada and Telugu scripts even though the business of the defendants and their sales really run in U.P. and Delhi. This is stated to be deliberately done to cause deception so that the public assumes that the products of defendants are actually of the plaintiff.\\n17. The plaintiff has also referred to the fact that the name DIA is not co-incidental since the defendants are trading under the name and style \\'Divya Inscense (India) Pvt. Ltd.\\', thus, the word \\'DIVYA\\' as such could have been chosen and the word \\'DIA\\' is stated to have been chosen solely due to its visual and phonetic similarity to the plaintiffs LIA mark. The plaintiff claims that the test of unsuspecting consumer with average intelligence and imperfect recollection must be applied and if the said test is applied, the consumer is bound to be deceived. The get-up of the two products is stated to be identical and the product is being sold at the unusual rate of Rs. 15/- for 35 sticks in the same fashion as the plaintiff\\'s product.\\n18. The plaintiff has set out in detail the distinctive features, which are common in the two get-ups and it would be appropriate to reproduce the same:-\\nA.

In order to appreciate the visual impact of the two products, it is appropriate to incorporate in the judgment the respective cartons of the plaintiff and the defendants, which are as under:-\\n ...\\n20. The plaintiff claims that the aforesaid is not a mere co-incidental act, but is a deliberate act of copying in order to deceive the customers and to cause confusion amongst the mind of the said customers. The defendants are, thus, alleged to be attempting to ride piggy back on the reputation and fame of the plaintiff\\'s products and it is not a case of one product being copied, but the entire range itself being copied. The defendants are further alleged to be attempting to utilise the substantial reputation and goodwill of the plaintiff and it is all the more because of the nature of the products where packaging forms an essential and integral part of identification of the products. The defendants\\' act is alleged to be a misrepresentation in the course of trade so as to cause deception about its origin or at least claim an indirect connection with the plaintiff.\\n21. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants\\' act amount to an attempt to pass off its goods as that of the plaintiff, an act of unfair competition, infringement of copyright of the plaintiff and dilution. The deception is stated to be bound to lead to confusion in passing off of the goods and even if the customer evinces interest in the defendants\\' products based on its get-up, the same would be \\'initial interest confusion\\', which is also a species of passing off. The aspect of dilution is explained as a consequence of utilisation by the defendants of the plaintiff\\'s goodwill arising from the high quantity of products and sales standards and the act of the defendants would, thus, constitute dilution of the plaintiff\\'s brand-name equity in the products.\\n22. The plaintiff has prayed for a decree of permanent injunction in respect of six packages of DIA products in question, which are similar to the LIA products; decree for delivery up; and for damages of Rs. 21,50,000/-.\\n23. At the stage of the suit being entertained and summons being issued, the interim relief was granted in favor of the plaintiff and Local Commissioners were appointed, who submitted their reports. The situation on visit to the office of M/s. Divya Incense (India) Pvt. Ltd. at Srirampuram, Bangalore has been explained by the Local Commissioner and it was found that the premises belong to M/s. Keerti Parimala Works, who were manufacturers and suppliers of agarbathi. The said Works also did job work for M/s. Divya Incense. At some stage, M/s. Divya Incense had its office in the premises, but the same was stated to have been subsequently moved to another address at Bangalore at 19/2, 2nd Cross, Robertson Block, Ramachandrapuram, Bangalore. This office of M/s. Divya Incense was also stated to be managed by Mr. Sunder Raj, who was the proprietor of M/s. Keerti Parimala Works. This new premises was also visited by the Local Commissioner. The six brand-names of DIA were manufactured there on job-work basis by M/s. Keerti Parimala Works, who purchased raw agarbathies from M/s. Divya Incense, Bangalore. The goods after packaging were then shipped to M/s. Divya Incense, NOIDA.\\n24. The Ghaziabad office of the defendants was also visited by the Local Commissioner who found the alleged infringing material. Similar position arose in respect of the Local Commissioner, who visited the office of the defendants at Ramesh Nagar and NOIDA, U.P.\\n25. The defendants have contested the suit and one of the principal defenses is that the trademark of the defendants is not DIA, but LOTUS DIA. This is compared with the plaintiff\\'s CYCLE brand. It is, thus, claimed that LOTUS DIA is a composite mark and, thus, there is no question of deception. It is also claimed that the word \\'LIA\\' is not a trademark and is being used as only a quality mark. The defendants have claimed to have adopted the trademark LOTUS DIA bona fide during the course of business, which is distinct from the mark of the plaintiff. The word \\'DIA\\' is stated to be an ordinary word used in reference to \\'small earthern lamps\\', which is commonly used on religious occasions.\\n26. Insofar as the infringement of copyright is concerned, it is claimed that the trade dress and the artistic features are completely different for the two. The allegation of passing off has been denied and it has been claimed that the plaintiff has, in fact, come with unclean hands before the Court. The defendants claim to have achieved sales worth Rs. 5.75 Lakhs in 2003-2004 and about Rs. 10.15 Lakhs from 01.04.2004 to 0.08.2004. The defendants claim to have engaged the services of an artist at Bangalore to create the copyright and the labels / packaging. It is, thus, stated that the plaintiff is not entitled to any relief of injunction or damages.\\n27. On the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed:-\\n\"1. Whether the plaintiff is registered partnership firm and the suit is filed and instituted through a competent person and to what effect?\\n2. Whether the plaintiff is the proprietor both under the statutory and common law of the alleged trademarks and copyrights LIA and artistic works / copyright bearing the same in relation to its alleged products being incense sticks / agarbathies?\\n3. Whether the defendant impugned trademark \\'LOTUS DIA\\' and its artistic features and labels are identical with or deceptively similar to the trademark / copyrights of the plaintiff sued upon amounting to infringement and passing off and to what effect?\\n4. Whether the plaintiff is guilty of suppressing material facts and making false statements and to what effect?\\n5. Whether the defendants have honestly adopted and used his subject matter trademark since 2003 in relation to incense sticks (agarbathies) and to what effect?\\n6. Whether the defendants, in the alternative, are entitled to benefit of honest and concurrent users and to what effect?\\n7. Whether the suit is barred by delay, acquiescence, laches, estoppel and waiver?\\n8. Relief.\"\\n28. On 25.08.2004, learned counsel for the parties agreed that the plaintiff would not claim damages and the defendants would not press the decision on Issue No. 1 relating to the competency of institution of the suit. It was also agreed that the documents filed by both the parties may be read in evidence without formal proof and no oral testimony was required for adjudication of the suit.\\n29. Parties were head at length and the matter in question is really one of legal issues to be examined in the context of the documents filed by the respective parties. The findings arrived at on the issues are set out hereinafter.\\nWhether the plaintiff is registered partnership firm and the suit is filed and instituted through a competent person and to what effect?\\n30. The issue relating to competency of the person to institute the suit has not been pressed by the defendants and it is, thus, not disputed that the suit has been properly instituted. It may be noticed that the details in respect of the partnership firm have also been set out with relevant supporting documents as also the authority of Mr. V. Ganesh, the constituted attorney of the plaintiff vide Power of Attorney dated 06.03.2004 to institute the suit. The issue is, thus, answered in favor of the plaintiff.\\nWhether the plaintiff is the proprietor both under the statutory and common law of the alleged trademarks and copyrights LIA and artistic works / copyright bearing the same in relation to its alleged products being incense sticks / agarbathies?\\nWhether the defendant impugned trademark \\'LOTUS DIA\\' and its artistic features and labels are identical with or deceptively similar to the trademark / copyrights of the plaintiff sued upon amounting to infringement and passing off and to what effect?\\n31. Issues No. 2 and 3 have to be dealt with together as they relate to the proprietorship right of the plaintiff as also the allegation of the defendants infringing the right. The plaintiff has claimed that the mark LIA is completely distinctive mark, which is arbitrary in nature and has no meaning. The name LIA is also stated to be extremely uncommon in the agarbathi market. The packaging is stated to have distinctive features and the general colour scheme and lay-out of the package is alleged to have an inalienable association with the plaintiff firm\\'s LIA brand.\\n32. The composite effect of the shades used for each fragrance, the labeling, design lay-out as well as the unique price range is claimed to leave an indelible association with the plaintiff\\'s firm\\'s LIA brand. The plaintiff\\'s claim is of ownership and of copyright in the LIA brand as also the ownership and the copyright in the entire get-up, the lay-out and trade dress. The application of the plaintiff before the Trademark Registry is stated to be pending and the plaintiff claims to have acquired goodwill in the mark based on sales figures. In this behalf, the annual turn over figures have been given, which is in the range of Rs. 413.17 Lakhs for the financial year of 2003-2004.\\n33. The plaintiff has emphasized the fact that the name DIA is similar to LIA and the word \\'DIA\\' has been chosen with dishonest intention of trading on the goodwill of the plaintiff\\'s LIA. In this behalf, the crucial question would be whether the trade-name under which the defendants are marketing is actually DIA or LOTUS DIA as claimed by the defendant?\\n34. Learned counsel for the plaintiff sought to emphasize that the defendants could better have kept the word DIVYA which is the name of the company and the motive behind the name DIA was that phonetically and visually, it was similar to the word LIA. Not much can be made out from the plea of the plaintiff that the defendants have been selling agarbathies under different brand-names since even the plaintiff has admittedly been selling agarbathies under different brand-names.\\n35. Learned counsel for the plaintiff contended that the defendants had copied almost all the essential features of the plaintiff\\'s get-up including the colour scheme, logo, text, picture / motif and the use of vernacular scripts on the side of the carton. The details of this as alleged by the plaintiff have already been set out herein-above in the tabular form.\\n36. A further plea raised by the plaintiff is based on the allegation against the defendants of attempting to mislead the customers as to the source / origin of the goods. This arises from the allegation made in the plaint as well as in the report of the Local Commissioner, who visited Bangalore, to show that while the business of the defendants was being carried on at U.P. and NOIDA, the use of the scripts of Devnagri, Tamil, Kannada and Telugu was only to give an impression as if the product was of the plaintiff. The address given was also stated to be incorrect.\\n37. The allegation of the plaintiff is of identical get-up to confuse the customer in order to ride piggy back on the reputation of the plaintiff. In this behalf, a lot of emphasis has been laid on the fact that the product packaging is an extremely important factor in the consumers\\' purchase decision as it indicates to the customer not only the factual information about the product, but also an overall brand image. An allegation has also been made of the fact that the defendant has used \\'TM\\' next to its name, which is normally used for reference to pending trademark registration, even though the defendants did not have a pending application for the name DIA at the time of filing of the suit. The significance of the addition of word \\'LOTUS\\' is sought to be diluted in terms of the submissions made by learned counsel for the plaintiff on account of two factors - firstly, the defendants admittedly attempted to file an application for registration of the mark DIA in Class 3 and the application was not for LOTUS DIA and secondly, the primary ingredients of the defendants\\' mark is DIA and the word \\'LOTUS\\' is an extremely insignificant part of the defendants\\' logo, get-up and packaging. Thus, merely by adding a prefix, the defendants cannot claim that the essential feature is different. In this behalf, it is also stated that the word \\'LOTUS\\' being a name of the flower is naturally associated with fragrance and is, therefore, descriptive and laudatory in respect of agarbathies and cannot serve as a trademark in relation to agarbathies as its use in this respect is descriptive of character and quality of goods. Thus, the word LOTUS even when used on conjunction with the word DIA, it is the word DIA which remains the essential feature of the mark.\\n38. The written synopsis of the plaintiff contain an elaborate list of judgments, but ultimately learned counsel for the plaintiff confined the reference to only some of the judgments on each of the propositions of law, which was arising for adjudication.\\n39. The first aspect to be considered, as noticed above, is the impact of the use of the word \\'LOTUS\\' as a prefix to the word \\'DIA\\'. Learned counsel for the plaintiff contended that when two marks have an overall similarity (whether phonetic or visually) and are used in relation to the goods of the same description, then the mere addition of a prefix or suffix is not of much significance as the test is of unwary purchaser of average intelligence and imperfect recollection, who would not split the words into their component parts, but would be deceived by their overall similarity. In this behalf, learned counsel referred to judgment of the Supreme Court in Ruston & Hornsby Ltd. v. The Zamindara Engineering Co.  wherein it was held that in an action of this kind, the test as to the likelihood of confusion or deception arising from similarity of marks is the same both in infringement and passing off actions. Where the mark is identical, in an infringement action, the Court will not enquire whether the infringement is such as is likely to deceive or cause confusion. However, where the alleged infringement consists of using not the exact mark on the register, but something similar to it, the test of infringement is the same as an action for passing off. The Supreme Court was dealing with two words \\'RUSTON\\' and \\'RUSTAM\\'. It was held that the trademark is deceptively similar and the mere fact that the word \\'INDIA\\' is added to the respondent\\'s trademark of \\'RUSTAM\\' is of no consequence and the appellant would be entitled to succeed in the action of infringement of the trademark.\\n40. Learned counsel for the plaintiff next referred to judgment of the Supreme Court in Parle Products (P) Ltd. v. J.P. & Co., Mysore, PTC (Suppl) (1) 346 (SC) to advance the proposition that if the overall visual impression from the colour scheme, arrangement of lettering, shape of container, packaging, get-up, trade dress leads to confusion in the minds of the consumer as to the source / origin of the goods and renders the two goods deceptively similar, especially in the case of unwary and gullible customers, it would amount to passing off as well as infringement of the copyright in the packaging and there would be sufficient justification for restraining the defendant. In such cases, proof of actual confusion was not required. It was observed by the Supreme Court as under:-\\n \"9. It is therefore clear that in order to come to the conclusion whether one mark is deceptively similar to another, the broad and essential features of the two are to be considered. They should not be placed side by side to find out if there are any differences in the design and if so, whether they are of such character as to prevent one design from being mistaken for the other. It would be enough if the impugned mark bears such an overall similarity to the registered mark as would be likely to mislead a person usually dealing with one to accept the other if offered to him. In this case we find that the packets are practically of the same size, the colour scheme of the two wrappers is almost the same; the design on both though not identical bears such a close resemblance that one can easily be mistaken for the other. The essential features of both are that there is a girl with one arm raised and carrying something in the background there is a farm house with a fence. The word \\'Glucose Biscuits\\' is one and \\'Gluco Biscuits\\' on the other occupy a prominent place at the top with a good deal of similarity between the two writings. Anyone in our opinion who has a look at one of the packets today may easily mistake the other if shown on another day as being the same article which he had seen before. If one was not careful enough to note the peculiar features of the wrapper on the plaintiffs\\' goods, he might easily mistake the defendants\\' wrapper for the plaintiffs\\' if shown to him some time after he had seen the plaintiffs. After all, an ordinary purchaser is not gifted with the powers of observation of a Sherlock Holmes. We have therefore no doubt that the defendants\\' wrapper is deceptively similar to the plaintiffs\\' which was registered. We do not think it necessary to refer to the decisions referred to at the bar as in our view each case will have to be judged on its own features and it would be of no use to note on how many points there was similarity and in how many others there was absence of it.\"\\n41. Learned counsel for the plaintiff also referred to judgment of Yves St Laurent Parfums and Anr. v. Louden Cosmetics Ltd., 39 IPR 11, which is a judgment of the High Court of New Zealand. Both the parties to the suit were manufacturers of different perfumes and the issue related to the infringement of trademark and passing off of the brand-names of different perfumes. It was observed as under:-\\n \"The plaintiffs allege that the defendant has used similar trade marks, get-up or packaging, smell or attributes individually or together or in any combination and have thereby caused the defendant\\'s products to be passed off as and for products of or associated with or originating from or having the endorsement or approval of the plaintiffs. They also allege that the defendant has deceived or caused confusion of the public and by reason of all such conduct has caused and will continue to cause loss to the plaintiffs.\\n The law of passing off protects reputation and goodwill by proscribing the misappropriation of it by another\\'s misrepresentation. The proscribed activity involves a misrepresentation made by a person in the course of trade to prospective consumers of the trader\\'s goods or services, such misrepresentation being reasonably foreseeable as injurious to the business or goodwill of another trader and in fact damaging to the goodwill of the trader who sues. The nature of a relevant misrepresentation can vary. Often it takes the form of a representation that the goods being sold by the defendant are a plaintiff\\'s goods. There may, however, be a representation that the goods being sold by the plaintiff are the defendant\\'s goods, the calculated damage being the appropriation by the defendant of customs which would have gone to the plaintiff. An example is found in the case of Bristol Conservatories Ltd. v. Conservatories Custom Built Ltd. (1989) RPC 455. As the essence of the tort is damage to another\\'s business or goodwill by a competitor\\'s misrepresentation, the form of misrepresentation, the way in which it functions, may vary and yet be actionable. It is not necessary for a misrepresentation to be crass. It may be acute and involve a complex of mechanisms of misrepresentation. A representation may operate by invoking a recollection of a plaintiff\\'s intellectual property, and in a number of ways, no single one of which may be compelling but the combination of which is effective. In the contemporary market, where products are advertised and promoted in ways which effectively use the qualities of electronic media, and plainly exploit modern knowledge of psychology and sociology, misrepresentations may relate to distinctive mental images and connotations in which a plaintiff has acquired a proprietary interest.\\n \"... the tort is no longer anchored, as in its early nineteenth century formulation, to the name or trade mark of a product or business. It is wide enough to encompass other descriptive material, such as slogans or visual images, which radio, television, or newspaper advertising campaigns can lead the market to associate with a plaintiff\\'s product, provided always that such descriptive material has become part of the goodwill of the product.\\nCadbury Schweepes v. Pub Squash Co. (1981) 1 All ER 213 at 218g; (1980) 32 ALR 387.\\n A relevant deception need not be intentional, but where it is logic may result in a finding that the premeditated conduct has succeeded: Cadbury Schweppes v. Pub Squash Co, supra, at All ER 221c; Slazenger & Sons v. Feltham & Co (1889) 6 RPC 531 at 538. In the present case, there was a deliberate policy of emulation of the names and get-up of designer fragrances and this policy has been practiced for many years. That the policy has generally been successful is an inevitable conclusion. Further, it is not by mere coincidence but a foreseeable consequence of the design policy that retailers should apprehend and exploit the correlation between Constance Carroll\\'s perfumes and the fragrances of the great designer houses.\\n I turn now to consider the second cause of action specifically in relation to the respective goods of the plaintiffs and the defendant. I do not think it necessary to add much to the comparisons of names and appearances considered earlier in this judgment.\\nParis / Paradise\\n \\n\\n One need only look from one product to the other to be struck by the similarity which is the product of the nature of the goods (female perfumes), the names, and the combination of dusky pink, black and gold. In my opinion the defendant\\'s product appropriates the goodwill of the plaintiffs by suggesting an association of manufacturing origin between the two; and/or by associating itself with the promotional image of Paris as the fragrance promoted by pink and feminity; and/or by suggesting through the emulation of distinctive colours that Paradise is a less expensive variation of Paris; and/or by implying that the perfume called Paris and the perfume called Paradise are the same but sold by the defendant under the name Paradise; and/or merely by creating the opportunity for confusion in order to exploit it.\\n Any or any combination of these mechanisms of appropriation is enough in all the circumstances to entitle the plaintiffs to injunctive relief and damages or compensation. The passing off is achieved by combining a name which has similarities in its initial letters to Paris, the emotional delight evoked by both the words \\'Paris\\' and \\'Paradise\\', the soulfulness of that city and associations with heaven, and the calculated use of the colours of the Paris get-up.\\nKouros/Kosmos\\n \\n\\n In view of the comparisons made earlier in this judgment, the evidence of the eyes, even the contrived election of the initial letter \"K\" for Cosmos, all that need be said is that the defendant\\'s Kosmos is a blatant copy of the get-up of Kouros, with all the same types of appropriation of the goodwill of the plaintiffs as examined in connection with Paris and Paradise above. Kosmos is not impugned in the statement of claim but if it were it would succumb. The plaintiffs are entitled to the injunctive and pecuniary remedies.\\nJazz/Java\\n \\n\\n Here again the plagiarism is obvious and deliberate. There is no association between bold black and white in juxtaposition, including in respect of the letters, with the country people or culture of Java. Nor of course is the design of the Java package random coincidence. The juxtaposition of solid black and white panels, albeit triangular rather than rectangular, combined with the unusual placement by monochromatic contrast, emulates the colours, patterns, letters and general graphical characteristics of the get-up of Jazz and the images which are emphasised in the promotion of it. These has been a deliberate and successful attempt to emulate the distinctively created features and promotional image of Jazz, for the purpose of exploiting and replicated designs and impressions. The plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive and pecuniary remedies for the passing off.\\nOpium/Optimism/Optimist\\n \\n\\n As noted earlier in this judgment, Opium has a get-up which is deliberately and obviously Asian, and features colours of ochre, gold and navy. Optimism uses similar colours but its impression cannot reasonably be regarded as Asian or reminiscently Asian in its impression. The Collection 2000 variant, Optimist has leafy depictions reminiscent to a New Zealand eye of Polynesian palms, and the mixture of silver, navy and ochre is hardly evocative of the colours used in Opium. The plaintiffs cannot expect to stifle competition by seeking to preclude any other product which is vaguely but not confusingly similar. In respect of Opium the claim of passing off fails.\"\\n42. Learned counsel for the plaintiff contended that this rule apply even if the trade-names are different by reference to the judgment of learned Single Judge of this Court in Colgate Palmolive Company and Anr. v. Anchor Health and Beauty Care Pvt. Ltd., 2003 (27) PTC 478 (Del) wherein it was observed as under:-\\n\"52. It is the overall impression that customer gets as to the source and origin of the goods from visual impression of colour-combination, shape of the container, packaging, etc. If illiterate, unwary and gullible customer gets confused as to the source and origin of the goods which he has been using for longer period by way of getting the goods in a container having particular shape, colour combination and get-up, it amounts to passing off. In other words, if the first glance of the article without going into the minute details of the colour combination, get-up or layout appearing on the container and packaging gives the impression as to deceptive or near similarities in respect of these ingredients, it is a case of confusion and amounts to passing off one\\'s own goods as those of the other with a view to encash upon the goodwill and reputation of the latter.\\n53. The plaintiffs have succeeded prima facie in showing from the look of trade dress of the two articles, one manufactured by the plaintiff and another by the defendant from the point of view of not only unwary, illiterate customer / servants of the household but semi-literate also as the trademarks. \"Colgate\" and \"Anchor\" are written in English language cannot be distinguished by ordinary customer of a country where bare literacy level is abysmally low. There is every likelihood of confusion as to the source on account of the similarity of substantial portion of the container having particular colour combination and also shape of the container which alone helps in determining the allegations of passing off despite stripes in the same colour or in different colour. The criteria is the overall impression from the look of packaging / container containing the goods and articles that can legitimately injunct its rival. Such an action on the part of infringing party also has an element of unfair competition.\\n54. May be, no party can have monopoly over a particular colour but if there is substantial reproduction of the colour combination in the similar order either on the container or packing which over a period has been imprinted upon the minds of customers it certainly is liable to cause not only confusion but also dilution of distinctiveness of colour combination. Colour combination, get-up, layout and size of container is sort of trade dress which involves overall image of the product\\'s features. There is a wide protection against imitation or deceptive similarities of trade dress as trade dress is the soul for identification of the goods as to its source and origin and as such is liable to cause confusion in the minds of unwary customers particularly those who have been using the produce over the long period.\\n55. The difference in the style of the words appearing on the container or packing identifying its manufacturers by way of style, colour combination or textures or graphics is certainly significant or relevant for determining the overall imitation of the container but if a product having distinctive colour combination, style, shape and texture has been in the market for decades as in this case it is in the market since 1951 it leads to ineluctable inference of having acquired secondary meaning on account of its reputation and goodwill earned at huge cost.\\n56. It is not the diligent or literate or conscious customer who always remain conscious to the quality of goods he has been purchasing which determines an offence of passing off. It is the unwary, illiterate and gullible persons who determine by arriving at a conclusion whether the infringed goods are confusingly similar in colour combination, get-up, layout printed over the container or packing. If it is not so then the offence of passing off will cease to have its existence once the guilty party chooses a different trade name.\"\\n43. Learned counsel for the plaintiff further submitted that even if the defendants are not enjoined from using specific colours, they can be enjoined from using them in particular graphic display, which is confusingly similar to the logo format implied by the plaintiff. This plea really arises from the stand of the learned counsel for the defendants that the plaintiff cannot have copyright in specific colours, especially taking into consideration the nature of the product, e.g., incense with fragrance of sandalwood will be required to have a trade dress of sandalwood. In this behalf, learned counsel referred to judgment of the Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit of U.S. in Vision Sports Inc. v. Melville Corporation, 12 USPQ 2d 1740. In the said case, a judgment of the Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit in Cf. Chevron Chem. Co. v. Voluntary Purchasing Groups, Inc., 21 USPQ 904 was quoted with approval where it was observed as under:-\\n \"(2) ... \"protect the combination of particular hues of these colors, arranged in certain geometric designs, presented in conjunction with a particular style of printing, in such fashion that, taken together, they create a distinctive visual impression. ...\"\\n44. Another interesting observation made in the said judgment of Vision Sports Inc.\\'s case (supra) relates to the finding that a conscious imitation supports presumption that similarity will cause customer confusion. Likelihood of confusion in the trade dress context is evaluated by reference to the same factors used in the ordinary trademark context; strength of the trade dress, similarity between plaintiff\\'s and defendant\\'s trade dress, evidence of actual confusion, marketing channels used, type of goods and likely degree of purchaser care, and the defendant\\'s intent in selecting its trade dress, The likelihood of confusion determination in trade dress cases must be made in the light of \\'the total effect of the defendant\\'s product and package on the eye of the ordinary purchaser\\'.\\n45. Learned counsel also advanced the proposition that while second comer will not be barred from making and selling the same product as the first comer, the second comer is under an obligation to name and dress his product in such a manner as to avoid all likely confusion. In this behalf, learned counsel referred to judgment of the Court of Appeals, Second Circuit in Harold F. Ritchie, Inc. v. Chesebrough-Pond\\'s, Inc., 126 USPQ 310 where it was specifically observed that as under:-\\n \"Second comer has duty to so name and dress his product as to avoid all likelihood of consumers confusing it with product of first comer; although second comer may endeavor to capture first comer\\'s market, he must do this by giving his product a name and dress descriptive and fanciful in its own right and selling it on its own merit, not by confusing public into mistakenly purchasing his product for competitor\\'s; second comer must create reputation of his own and not trade on goodwill of another product already established at considerable cost and risk; important in determining whether second comer\\'s entrance into market creates possible confusion is any evidence of conscious imitation of first comer\\'s product.\\n In determining whether there is confusing similarity, court should consider names of products in conjunction with similarity of presentation of products with respect to their design and general appearance, containers, tubes, price, size, smell and other nonfunctional aspects; admittedly there is nothing to prevent second comer from selling identical product of the first comer, providing second comer so names and dresses its product as to avoid all likely confusion; test has not been met where not only was there conscious imitation, but also actual confusion resulted from similarity of name and dress.\"\\n46. The aforesaid judgment was referred to with approval in the judgment of Court of Appeals, Second Circuit in Perfect Fit Industries, Inc. v. Aeme Quilting Co., Inc., 205 USPQ 287.\\n47. Learned counsel for the defendants, on the other hand, has referred to the fact that the mark of the plaintiff is still unregistered. It is, thus, contended that the action can only be one of passing off. In this behalf, learned counsel has referred to judgment of the Apex Court in American Home Products Corporation v. Mac Laboratories Pvt. Ltd. and Anr.,  where in 36, it was observed that the proprietor of an unregistered trademark whose mark is unauthorisedly used by another cannot sue for infringement of such trademark and his remedy only lies in bringing up of passing off action even though the same is an inconvenient remedy as compared to infringement action. This is so since in a passing off action, the plaintiff will have to prove that his mark has by user acquired such reputation as to become distinctive of the plaintiff\\'s goods so that if it is used in relation to any goods of the kind dealt with by the plaintiff, it will be understood by the trade and public as meaning that the goods are the plaintiff\\'s goods.\\n48. It was, thus, contended by learned counsel for the defendants that once the parameters of a passing off action are considered, the defendants in any case are entitled to escape liability if they can show that the added matter is sufficient to distinguish their goods from those of the plaintiff. In this behalf, learned counsel has referred to judgment of the Apex Court in Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma v. Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories,  where it was observed in para 28 as under:-\\n \"28. The other ground of objection that the findings are inconsistent really proceeds on an error in appreciating the basic differences between the causes of action and right to relief in suits for passing off and for infringement of a registered trade mark and in equating the essentials of a passing off action with those in respect of an action complaining of an infringement of a registered trade mark. We have already pointed out that the suit by the respondent complained both of an invasion of a statutory right under Section 21 in respect of a registered trade mark and also of a passing off by the use of the same mark. The finding in favor of the appellant to which the learned Counsel drew our attention was based upon dissimilarity of the packing in which the goods of the two parties were vended, the difference in the physical appearance of the two packets by reason of the variation in their colour and other features and their general getup together with the circumstances that the name and address of the manufactory of the appellant was prominently displayed on his packets and these features were also set out for negativing the respondent\\'s claim that the appellant had passed off his goods as those of the respondent. These matters which are of the essence of the cause of action for relief on the ground of passing off play but a limited role in an action for infringement of a registered trade mark by the registered proprietor who has a statutory right to that mark and who has a statutory remedy in the event of the use by another of that mark or a colourable imitation thereof. While an action for passing off is a Common Law remedy being in substance an action for deceit, that is, a passing off by a person of his own goods as those of another, that is not the gist of an action for infringement. The action for infringement is a statutory remedy conferred on the registered proprietor of a registered trade mark for the vindication of the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods\" (Vide Section 21 of the Act). The use by the defendant of the trade mark of the plaintiff is to essential in an action for passing off, but is the sine qua non in the case of an action for infringement. No doubt, where the evidence in respect passing off consists merely of the colourable use of a registered trade mark, the essential features of both the actions might coincide in the sense that what would be a colourable imitation of a trade mark in a passing off action would also be such in an action for infringement of the same trade mark. But there the correspondence between the two cases. In an action for infringement, the plaintiff must, no doubt, make out that the use of the defendant\\'s mark is likely to deceive, but where the similarity between the plaintiff\\'s and the defendant\\'s mark is so close either visually, phonetically or otherwise and the Court reaches the conclusion that there is an imitation, no further evidence is required to establish that the plaintiff\\'s rights are violated. Expressed in another way, if the essential features of the trade mark of the plaintiff have been adopted by the defendant, the fact that the get-up packing and other writing or marks on the goods or on the packets in which he offers his goods for sales show marked differences, or indicate clearly a trade origin different from that of the registered proprietor of the mark would be immaterial; whereas in the case of passing off, the defendant may escape liability if he can show that the added matter is sufficient to distinguish his goods from those of the plaintiff.\"\\n49. The Division Bench of this Court in Johnson & Johnson and Anr. v. Christine Hoden India (P) Ltd. and Anr., 1988 PTC 39 observed that the main question is not the intention of defendant in using certain words, but the probable effect of such action on minds of the customer. Thus, colour scheme, lettering style, etc. become of significance.\\n50. Learned counsel for the defendants also strongly relied on the fact that the mark of the defendants is a composite mark LOTUS DIA and not merely DIA and, thus, the passing off action should be totally ruled out. In this behalf, learned counsel relied upon the judgment of learned Single Judge of this Court in Bharat Hotels Limited v. Unison Hotels Limited 2004 (28) PTC 404 (Del). The matter in issue related to the use of the word \\'GRAND\\' in respect of the hotel industry.\\n51. A reference was also made to the judgment of a learned Single Judge of this Court in Sunstar Lubricants Limited v. Federal Chemicals Industries 1996 V AD (Delhi) 594 where an interim injunction was declined on the ground that there was no deceptive similarity between the trademark GOLDEN CRUISER 1200 and SUPER SUN CRUISER 2001. It may be noticed that the finding was arrived at on the basis that the two trademarks were phonetically different and the get-up and colour scheme of the boxes were entirely different.\\n52. Similarly, in Fitchetts Ltd. v. Loubet & Co. Ltd. (1919) 36 R.P.C. 296 Ch.D. in respect of soap and soap powder, the action for infringement and passing off was rejected in respect of the two trademarks LITO and Y-TO as compared to RITO.\\n53. In Thomas A. Smith Ltd.\\'s Appln., (1913) 30 R.P.C. 363 Ch.D., the application for registration was allowed for collars and shirts under the trademark LIMIT and it was held not to be similar with SUMMIT.\\n54. Learned counsel for the defendants submitted that for establishing confusion and deception, overall impact has to be seen in entirety and not parts have to be picked up in isolation. Learned counsel referred to the judgment of Division Bench of this Court in Kellogg Company v. Pravin Kumar Bhadabhai, 1996 PTC (16) 187. The contention of similar get-up or trade dress was held not to be tenable. The dispute related to the plaintiff\\'s sale of cornflake with cartons having the description inscribed as KELLOGG\\'S CORNFLAKE. The respondent was selling cornflake using a carton more or less similar in size, but with the title AMIS ARISTO CORN FLAKES written just at the place where the appellant\\'s display the words KELLOG\\'S CORNFLAKE. The important aspect was in relation to the principles to be kept in mind in respect of confusion and deception. The Division Bench came to the conclusion that the principal of fading memory or imperfect recollection should not be pressed too far and the goods in question sold to people belonging to middle class or upper middle class, who are fairly educated, has to be tested accordingly. It was held that there was no chance of deception. The Division Bench in para 10 while dealing with the aspect of trade dress observed as under:-\\n\"10. The law relating to \\'trade dress\\' is very clear. Kerly in \\'Law of Trade Marks\\' (12th Ed., 1986, para 16.67) says that it is usually true in some degree that a trader\\'s goods are recognised by their general appearance, or \\'get-up\\'. Accordingly, resemblance or \\'get-up\\' is not uncommonly an ingredient in passing off and it is possible for imitation of get-up alone to amount to passing off. Such cases are rare, since few traders rely on get-up alone to distinguish their goods, so that trade names and word trade marks are ordinary present too;\" and the author says:\\n \"and in these days, in this country, a difference in names is enough to warn the public that they are getting one trader\\'s goods and not the others\" (Sapers v. Specters (1953)70 RPC 173).\"\\n55. In paras 15 to 23 of the judgment, the Division Bench referred to the judgment of the House of Lords in Schweppes Ltd. v. Gibbens, (1905) 22 R.P.C. 601 as under:-\\n\"15. In Schewappers Ltd. v. Gibbens (1905) 22 RPC, the appellant was selling Soda Water in bottles, with a neck label around then, the body of the label bring of chocolate colour with a white border and a red medallion in the centre of the label. The respondents, subsequently, sold soda water in bottles with a somewhat similar neck lable round them in some colour and with a central red medallion. However, appellants\\' labels showed \\'Scheweppe\\'s soda water\\' printed on them in white characters while respondents\\' contained the name \\'Gibbens Soda Water\\'. Action by plaintiffs failed. It was held by the House of Lords that a fraudulent intent cannot be presumed in spite of the similarities in the bottles, labels colour and medallion because the distinguishing feature of name adopted by defendants showed that they had no intention to deceive purchasers. Lord Halsbury LC said:\\n \"I should have thought if you looked at the two bottles together no human being could have mistaken one for the other. If \\'Royal\\' and \\'Flag\\' were sufficiently distinctive in the case to which the learned counsel called our attention (Payton & Co. v. Snelling Lampard & Co. (17 RPC 628), I should have thought \\'Gibbens\\' and \\'Schwappes\\' are equally impossible to be confounded with each other.\"\\n16. Lord Halsbury said it was \\'ridiculous\\' to apply the principle of similarity in trade-dress in such a situation. He said:\\n \"I can quite understand a case in which, although colourably a defendant has introduced his own name, yet the nautre of the wrapping up, the nature of the package itself, or, in this case, the share of the bottle, may all have been so closely imitated that the mere introduction of some distinctive mark to which no ordinary observer would have applied his mind, will not get rid of the obvious intention to pass one goods off as the other; but to apply the proposition to this case appears to me to be a little short of ridiculous.\\n17. It was held that the name of \\'Gibbens\\' was so plainly placed upon the bottle as it could possibly be and it was in the place where \\'Schweppes\\' was on the bottle of the appellant, and there was no intention to deceive.\\n18. The above case also answers the contention of fraudulent intent argued by the appellant\\'s counsel before us. Similar views as to absence of fraudulent intent were expressed in Schwappes Pty Ltd. v. The Pub-squash Co. Ltd. also, to which we have already referred and which came from New South Wales before the Privy Council (1981) RP 429 (PC).\\n19. In the present case, in spite of any other close resembleness in the cartons, the name \\'AIMS\\' written prominently on the respondents carton would, in our view, prima facie, as in case before Lord Halsbury show that there was no intention on the part of the defendant to play fraud by misrepresenting his goods as the goods of the applicant. In that very case, Lord Halsbury emphasised the need to see the whole description on the goods as one whole and not the individual features in isolation. He said:\\n\"Inasmuch as you and certainly not to impute fraud without proof, you are not to suggest that people are fraudulently committing some commercial trick without sufficient evidence, and I cannot conceive here how anybody could gravely argue that the one thing could be mistaken for the other by anybody who looked as it.\\nThe whole question is these cases is whether the thing - taken in its entirety, looking at the whole thing, is such that in the ordinary course of things a person with reasonable apprehension and with proper eyesight would be deceived.\"\\n20. Thus the above case also lays down that the trade dress or rather the whole thing must be seen in its entirety and not parts in isolation. It is not permissible, therefore, to say that the square on the left side top had a small red nd green border or there was a red band horizontally and defendant\\'s carton if examined from close quarters, showed these features. Viewed as a whole, one can see that the words Kelloggs\\' and AIMS are prominently displayed on each and therefore there can be no confusion, prima facie.\\n21. That brings us finally to the question of the failing memory of the customer. The argument is that customers have short memory and that if the trade dress is similar, the customers are likely to get confused.\\n22. It has now been held that there are limitations to the theory of imperfect memory. Halsbury\\'s Laws of England (4th Ed.) (Vol. 8, para 139) says that this principle of imperfect recollection must not be pressed too far. It says:-\\n \"The Tribunal must bear in mind that the marks will not normally be seen side by side and guard against the danger that a person seeing the new mark may think that it is the same as one he has seen before, or even that it is a new or associated mark of the proprietor of the formal mark. However, the doctrine of imperfect recollection must not be pressed too far Chappie Ltd. v. Spratt\\'s Patent Ltd. (1954) 71 RPC 455 at 457). Marks are often remembered by general impressions of by same essential feature (De cordova Vick Chemical Co. (1951) 68 RPC 106 (PC) at 289 (on appeal 71 RPC 348, CA).\\n23. In fact in Scheweppes Ltd. case above referred to, Lord Halsbury said \"and if a person is so careless that he does not look, and does not, ... treats the label fairly but takes the bottle without sufficient consideration and without reading what is written very plainly indeed up - the face of the label on which the trade has placed his own name, then you certainly cannot say he is deceived - in fact, he does not care which it is. That would be the true interference which I think a person would draw from conduct so described.\"\\n56. The defendants also emphasised the fact that the plaintiff was not the owner of the copyright or the labels and cartons under The Copyright Act, 1957 in view of the provisions of Sections 14, 17 and 18 thereof.\\n57. The judgment of the Division Bench in Kellogg Company\\'s csae (supra) generated further arguments as to whether it correctly reflected the position of law on this aspect, as referred to by learned counsel for the defendants. This controversy has arisen on account of the fact that the principles laid down in Kellogg Company\\'s case (supra) were based on the dictum of Lord Halsbury in Schweppes Ld.\\'s case (supra) where in para 23 a reference was made to a customer who was so careless that he does not look and treats the label fairly, but takes the bottle without sufficient consideration and without reading what is written very plainly. Such a customer was held not a person who would form the basis of a test for passing off. Learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that this dictum was a departure from the settled law of the Apex Court in relation to passing off matters that the case of passing off has to be decided on the comparison of broad similarities and the test is always from the point of view of an unwary purchaser. Learned counsel contends that this judgment was impliedly overruled in view of the subsequent judgments of the Supreme Court.\\n58. In S.M. Dyechem Ltd. v. Cadbury (India) Ltd. AIR 2000 SC 2114, the dictum of Lord Halsbury was relied upon and it was laid down that in case of an infringement of passing off, the broad dissimilarities need to be compared. The comparing marks were of the plaintiff PICNIK and defendant PICNIC. Injunction was declined. It was observed in para 54 as under:-\\n \"53. As to scope of a buyer being deceived, in a passing off action, the following principles have to be borne in mind. Lord Romer, LJ has said in Payton & Co. v. Snelling Lampard & Co., (1990) 17 RPC 48 that it is a misconception to refer to the confusion that can be created upon an ignorant customer. The kind of customer that the Courts ought to think of in these cases is the customer who knows the distinguishing characteristics of the plaintiff\\'s goods, those characteristics which distinguish his goods from other goods in the market so far as relates to general characteristics. If he does not know that, he is not a customer whose views can properly be regarded by the Court. (See the cases quoted in N.S. Thread & Co. v. Chadwick & Bros., AIR 1948 Madras 481, which was a passing off action). In Schweppes\\'s case, Lord Halsbury said,if a person is so careless that he does not look and does not treat the label fairly but takes the bottle without sufficient consideration and without reading what is written very plainly indeed up the face of the label, you cannot say he is deceived.\"\\n59. The aforesaid judgment of the Supreme Court in M/s. S.M. Dyechem Ltd.\\'s case (supra) was reviewed by the Apex Court in Cadila Health Care Ltd. v. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd., . In the said judgment, it was observed as under:-\\n\"17. Our attention was drawn to a recent judgment of this Court in S.M. Dyechem Ltd. v. Cadbury (India) Ltd.  where in a passing off action, the plaintiff, which was carrying on the business under the mark of \\'Piknik\\', filed a suit for injunction against the defendant which was using the mark of \\'Picnic\" for some other chocolates sold by it. On the allegation that the defendant\\'s mark was deceptively similar, the trial Court had issued an injunction which was reversed by the High Court. On appeal, the decision of the High Court was affirmed. On appeal, the decision of the High Court was affirmed. One of the questions, which this Court considered, was that for grant of temporary injunction, should the Court go by the principle of prima facie case, apart from balance of convenience, or comparative strength of the case of either parties or by finding out if the plaintiff has raised a \\'triable issue\\'. While considering various decisions on the point in issue, this Court rightly concluded at page 591 (of SCC): at p. 2181 of AIR SCW; 2121 of AIR and 1348 of CLC (para 21) as follows:\\n \"Broadly, under our law as seen above, it can be said that stress is laid down on common features rather than on differences in essential features, except for a passing reference to a limited extent in one case.\"\\nNotwithstanding the aforesaid observations this Court in Dyechem\\'s case (200 AIR SCW 2172: AIR 2000 SC 2144: 2000 CLC 1338) (para 35) (supra) proceeded to observe as follows:-\\n \"It appears to us that this Court did not have occasion to decide, as far as we are able to see, an issue where there were also differences in essential features nor to consider the extent to which the differences are to be given importance over similarities. Such a question has arisen in the present case and that is why we have referred to the principles of English Law relating to differences in essential features which principles, in our opinion, are equally applicable in our country.\"\\n18. We are unable to agree with the aforesaid observation in Dyechem\\'s case (supra). As far as this Court is concerned, the decisions in the last four decades have clearly laid down that what has to be seen in the case of passing off action is the similarity between the competing marks and to determine whether there is likelihood of deception or causing confusion. This is evident from the decisions of this Court in the cases of National Sewing Thread Co. Ltd.\\'s case , Com Products Refining Company\\'s case , Amritdhara Pharmacy\\'s case . Durga Dutt Sharma\\'s case , Hoffmann-La Roche and Co. Ltd\\'s case . Having come to the conclusion, in our opinion incorrectly, that the difference in essential features is relevant, this Court in Dyechem\\'s case (supra) sought to examine the difference in the two marks \\'Piknik\\' and \\'Picnic\\'. It applied three tests, they being 1) is there any special aspect of the common feature which has been copied? 2) mode in which the parts are put together differently i.e. whether dissimilarity of the part or parts is enough to make the whole thing dissimilar and 3) whether when there are common elements, should one not pay more regard to the parts which are not common, while at the same time not disregarding the common parts? In examining the marks, keeping the aforesaid three tests in mind, it came to the conclusion, seeing the manner in which the two words were written and the peculiarity of the script and concluded that \"the above three dissimilarities have to be given more importance than the phonetic similarity or the similarity in the use of the word PICNIC for PIKNIK.\\n19. With respect, we are unable to agree that the principle of phonetic similarly has to be jettisoned when the manner in which the competing words are written is different and the conclusion so arrived at is clearly contrary to the binding precedent of this Court in Amritdhara\\'s case  where the phonetic similarity was applied by judging the two competing marks. Similarly, in Durga Dutt Sharma\\'s case , it was observed that \"in an action for infringement, the plaintiff must no doubt, make out that the use of the defendant\\'s mark is likely to deceive, but where the similarity between the plaintiff\\'s and the defendant\\'s mark is so close either visually, phonetically or otherwise and the Court reaches the conclusion that there is a imitation, no further evidence is required to establish that the plaintiffs rights are violated.\"\\n20. Lastly, in Dyechem\\'s case (2000 AIR SCW 2172: AIR 2000 SC 2114: 2000 CLC 1338) (supra) it was observed in Para 54 (of SCC): (Para 53 of AIR SCW, AIR CLC) as under:-\\n \"As to scope of a buyer being deceived, in a passing off action, the following principles have to be borne in mind. Lord Romer, L.J. has said in Payton and Co. v. Shelling, Lampard and Co. (1990) 17 RPC 48 that it is a misconception to refer to the confusion that can be created upon an ignorant customer that the Courts ought to think of in these cases is the customer who knows the distinguishing characteristics of the plaintiff\\'s goods, those characteristics of the plaintiff\\'s goods, those characteristics which distinguish his goods from other goods in the market so far as relates to general characteristics. If he does not know that, he is not a customer whose views can properly be regarded by the Court. (See the cases quoted in N.S. Thread and Co. v. Chadwick and Bros. AIR 1948 Madras 481 which was a passing off action.) In Schweppes Case (1905) 22 RPC 601 (HL) Lord Halsbury said, if a person is so careless that he does not look and does not treat the label fairly but takes the bottle without sufficient consideration and without reading what is written very plainly indeed up the face of the label, you cannot say he is deceived.\"\\nThese observations appear to us to be contrary to the decision of this Court in Amritdhara\\'s case (AIR 1963 449) (supra) where it was observed that the products will be purchased by both villagers and townfolk, literate as well as illiterate and the question has to be approached from the point of view of a man of average intelligence and imperfect recollection. A trade may relate to goods largely sold to illiterate or badly educated persons. The purchaser in India cannot be equated with a purchaser of goods in England. While we agree that in trade mark matters, it is necessary to go into the question of comparable strength, the decision on merits in Dyechem\\'s case, 2000 AIR SCW 2172: AIR 2000 SC 2114: 2000 CLC 1338) (supra) does not, in our opinion, lay down correct law and we hold accordingly.\"\\n60. It was, thus, submitted by the learned counsel that the judgment based on the principle laid down by Lord Halsbury in Schweppes Ld.\\'s case (supra) would not hold good law in view of the fact that those very principles in Schweppes Ld.\\'s case (supra) are held not to be applicable in view of reconsideration of the issue in Cadila Health Care Ltd.\\'s case (supra).\\n61. The aforesaid submission is, of course, without prejudice to the stand of the plaintiff\\'s counsel that, in the present case, there is absolute copying of the mark and get-up.\\n62. One other aspect, which has to be considered vis-a-vis Kellogg Company\\'s case (supra) as also the issue of the class of purchaser, it was observed as under:-\\n\"24. Having dealt with the contention of imperfect memory of the customer, we shall now deal with the class of purchasers, which is also an important factor. Who are the persons who go to purchase \\'Kelloggs\\' Corn flakes? Prima facie, in our opinion, these people belong to a middle-class or upper middle class and above who are fairly educated in English and are able to distinguish \\'Kelloggs\\' and what is not \\'Kelloggs\\'. In American Jurisprudence (2d) (Trade Marks) (Supp) para 19 (page 178) it is said that it is necessary to note the fact:\\n \"that customers for fasteners are sophisticated and discerning, that defendant acted with good faith.\"\\n25. The case was one where customers were purchasers of fasteners in the automobile industry. (Standard Pressed Steel Co. v. Midwest Chrome Process Co. LDC III (US PU 106\".) Again Kerly, Law of Trademarks (12th ed. 1980) (para 1706) says that:\\n \"If the goods are expensive and not of a kind usually selected without deliberation, and the customers generally educated persons, these are all matters to be considered (Pianolist (1906) 23 RPC 774: Claudins Ash v. Invica (1911) 28 RPC 597; 29 RPC 465 (CA) (HL) (dentists), Rysta (1943) 60 RPC 87).\\n26. In Pianolist\\'s case (1906) (23) RPC 774 an application was made for the registration as a trade mark of the word \\'Neela\\' for \\'piano player, being a musical instrument included in class 9\\'. Coming to know of this application, the registered proprietors of the trade mark \"Pianole\" who were registered for all goods in class 9, opposed the above application for registration. The Registrar overruled the objection and ordered registration. On appeal, Justice Parker said that having regard to the kind of customers for such goods and the distinction in the names, there was not likely to be any confusion and dismissed the appeal.\\n27. If that was so between \\'Neole\\' and \\'Pianole\\', the case of Kellogg\\'s and AIMS, in our prima facie view, presents no difficulty for distinct identification. Parker J. in fact observed in the above case:\\n \"Of course, one knows that the persons who buy these articles are generally persons of some education, ... my opinion is, having regard to the nature of the customer, the article in question and the price at which it is likely to be sold, and all the surrounding circumstances, no man of ordinary intelligence is likely to be deceived....\"\\n28. We are, on the facts of the case before us, prima facie of the same opinion in regard to Kelloggs and AIMs.\"\\n63. I have given a deep thought to these rival contentions.\\n64. It would be appropriate to first consider the parameters on which the alleged deception has to be. In this behalf, the judgment in Kellogg Company\\'s case (supra) is extremely relevant. There has been reference made to Schweppes Ld.\\'s case (supra) to come to the conclusion that if a person is so careless that he does not look and does not treat the label fairly, then he is not the person who would form the basis of the test. There is force in the contention of learned counsel for the plaintiff that the dictum in Kellogg Company\\'s case (supra) to the extent it relied upon Schweppes Ld.\\'s case (supra) would not hold good in view of the subsequent development of law in M/s. S.M. Dyechem Ltd.\\'s case (supra) and the review thereof in Cadila Health Care Ltd.\\'s case (supra), the Apex Court while relying upon the observations in Schweppes Ld.\\'s case (supra) observed that if the customer does not distinguish the characteristics of the two packings, then he is not a customer whose view can properly be regarded by the Court. However in Cadila Health Care Ltd.\\'s case (supra), this very aspect was specifically considered. The Apex Court took note of the earlier judgments in this behalf and came to the conclusion that the decisions of the Apex Court in the last four decades preceding clearly laid down that what had to be seen in the case of a passing off action between the competing marks and the likelihood of deception or confusion. The Apex Court found that the principle of phonetic similarity cannot be jettisoned and in determining the test vis-a-vis the person who has to be kept in mind as a customer, the views expressed in Schweppes Ld.\\'s case (supra) were found to be contrary to the decision of the Apex Court in Amritdhara Pharmacy v. Satya Gupta, .\\n65. In Amritdhara Pharmacy\\'s case (supra), the product was examined from the prospect of it being purchased by villagers and townfolk, literate as well as illiterate and, thus, the question has to be approached from the point of view of a man of average intelligence and imperfect recollection. A trade may be related to goods largely sold to illiterate or badly educated persons and the purchaser in India cannot be equated with a purchaser of goods in England.\\n66. The aspect, which is important, is the nature of the product. To this extent, apparently the views expressed in Kellogg Company\\'s case (supra) were also based on this nature of product. As noticed above, the class of purchaser purchasing Kellog\\'s Cornflakes were stated to be people belonging to the middle class or the upper middle class who are fairly educated in English. Such category of customers were categorised as sophisticated and discerning. The question remains whether the product in question in the present case being the agarbathies can be categorised as such. In my considered view, the answer would be an emphatic No. The very nature of product is such that it is bought not only by a sophisticate and discerning customer, but people from all walks of life. The use of such fragrance sticks is largely for the purposes of pooja, but it is also used for other purposes of fragrance in the rooms, etc. The average customer is not one who will make a detailed scrutiny colour by colour, mark by mark to find out whether the product is of the plaintiff or the defendants. The profile of the customer will vary from the rich to the poor. It has also to be kept in mind that, in fact, the more discerning and rich customer may not even go to buy such a product himself, but would possibly dispatch the house-help to obtain the same. Thus, the factors which weighed in Kellogg Company\\'s case (supra) would hardly apply to the present case.\\n67. It is in view of the aforesaid position that the two products have to be compared. There is some substance in the plea of learned counsel for the defendants that the plaintiff cannot have a monopoly on colours. This is so as in case of an agarbathi with sandal incense, naturally the colour of sandal or the pieces of sandal being shown on the container found form an essential ingredient. Similar position would be with rainbow. Of course, the stand of the plaintiff is that LAVENDER of the defendants is similar to RAINBOW of the plaintiff, while the defendants contend that LAVENDER itself would have a purple tinge of the colour. The NATURE\\'S GIFT of the plaintiff has a shade of green with a whitish mogra on it. The MOGRA of the defendants is also green with larger number of mogras on it. In this behalf, the contention of the plaintiff is that if mogra is whitish, there was no reason to necessarily adopt the green colour. Similarly, in respect of ROSE, which is of different colours, there was no reason why the defendants should have taken the same pink colour as of the plaintiff.\\n68. The parameters laid down for such comparison have been set out in judgment of the Apex Court in Parle Products (P) Ltd.\\'s case (supra) for deciding whether one mark is deceptively similar to another, the broad and essential features of the two have to be considered. They are not to be placed side by side to find out differences in the designs and it would suffice if the mark bears an overall similarity to the mark. As pithily observed, an ordinary purchaser is not gifted with the powers of observation of Sherlock Holmes. However, this principle would not apply to mere colours. Colours are after all only certain hues.\\n69. The aspect of copyright in colours have been examined in a recent judgment of learned Single Judge of this Court in IA Nos. 3412/2002 & 4489/2003 IN CS (OS) No. 672/2003 titled \\'Colgate Palmolive Co. Limited and Anr. v. Mr. Patel and Anr.\\' decided on 06.10.2005. The colours in question were red and white colours of COLGATE. It was held that essential features of the plaintiffs\\' mark were the word \\'COLGATE\\' and red and white colour scheme taken together. In the said case, a reference was made to judgment of the Apex Court in Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma\\'s case (supra) to emphasize that in case of passing off action, the defendant may escape liability if he can show that the added matter is sufficient to distinguish his case from those of the plaintiff. This would be different from the parameters and action for infringement of trademark. An interesting plea raised in Colgate Palmolive Co. Ltd.\\'s case (supra) was that the judgment in Ruston & Hornsby Ltd.\\'s case (supra) was per incuriam since the Court did not note its earlier judgment in Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma\\'s case (supra). This plea was negated. Learned Single Judge referred to some judgments of the U.S. Courts in this behalf. It would be useful to refer to the observations made in Colgate Palmolive Co. Ltd.\\'s case (supra) in some detail. It was observed in the relevant paragraphs as under:-\\n\"33. While the law laid down in other common law jurisdictions such as the U.K. and U.S.A. is not binding on this Court but it can nevertheless furnish a useful guide for this Court. At this stage it is profitable to set out the following position of law laid down in Campbell Soup Co. v. Armor & Co. (81 USPQ 430):-\\nAt para 6 page 432, it was observed that\\n  \\n\\n\"... It is worth the space involved to call attention to just what it is the plaintiff\\'s claim. Their suit here is based solely upon their claimed exclusive right to the use of red and white in packaging their food products. While their registration describes the red over white as a rectangular design, when the colours appear on their packages they appear in the form of an endless band which runs around the entire container. The Campbell red is not the same as the Carnation red. Indeed, the Camation red is not the same on all of its products, according to the sample labels offered in the plaintiff\\'s exhibits. The red used by Armour is a specially blended color. The usual Armour Label is white over red instead of red over white, as the plaintiffs use the colour, but in some cases Armour uses red and white bands vertically.\\nWhat the plaintiffs are really asking for, then, is a right to the exclusive use of labels which are half red and half white for food products. If they may thus monopolize red in all of its shades the next manufacturer may monopolize orange in all its shades and the next yellow in the same way. Obviously, the list of colors will soon run out....\"\\nAt para [8], it was observed:-\\n\"That a man cannot acquire a trade mark by color alone has been stated a good many times in decisions and textbooks ....\"\\n\"... When we say that plaintiffs cannot have exclusive right to a trade mark of a red and white label, we are by no means denying their right to acquire a trade mark when the color is combined with other things in a distinctive design. As a matter of fact, the distinctiveness of plaintiff\\'s packages does not depend upon colour alone, although each has been granted registration of a trade mark described in terms of color. Each has its name in one of the color bands in a uniform and specified type of script. Each has a very distinctive design on its label. Carnation has a small bouquet of carnation flowers. Campbell has a medallion of individual design, Armour, too, does not depend upon color alone. It uses different colors with different products and each has the Armour name in an individual type of script accompanied by the star which it says has been the mark of its goods over many years.\\n\"In denying the plaintiffs the exclusive use of color alone we are not passing upon the question whether they have acquired trade marks entitled to protection in the sum total of the combinations which make up their respective labels for their goods.\"\\n34. In order to counter the position of law laid down in Campbell Soup\\'s case (supra) the plaintiff had relied on the judgment in the case of Master Distributors v. Pako Cororation, 25 USPQ2d 1794, wherein the following position of law was laid down:-\\n \"We are not persuaded by the three traditional arguments against protection the color depletion theory, shade confusion, and the functionality doctrine. Nor are we impressed by the argument that \"consistency and predictability\" require a per se prohibition against trademark protection for color alone. We believe that not allowing manufacturers to protect color marks when all the traditional requirements have been met will actually promote inconsistency and confusion.\\n Proponents of the color depletion theory assert that there are only a few possible colors a manufacturer can choose for a product, and allowing one manufacturer to monopolize one color \"in all of its shades\" will inhibit competition. Campbell Soup Co. v. Armour & Co.., 175 F.2d 795, 798 [81 USPQ 430] (3rd Cir.), Cert. Denied, 338 U.S. 847 [83 USPQ 543] (1949). We agree that allowing a manufacturer to monopolize red \"in all of its shades\" would deplete the color choices available to other market participants. Allowing a manufacturer who has met all the normal requirements for obtaining trademark protection to protect a specific shade of color, however, is another matter....\"\\n35. In my view, this judgment agrees with the Campbell Soup\\'s case (supra) and in fact relates to shades of colours and not a particular colour. Even if this decision is held to take a view contrary to that in Campbell\\'s soup\\'s case (supra), I would prefer the reasoning laid down in Campbell\\'s soup\\'s case as it is more logical and appeals to this Court as it inhibits a chromatic monopoly.\\n36. In Life Savers Corp. v. Curtiss Candy Co., 85 USPQ 440, it was held as follows:-\\n\"4. That a man cannot acquire a trade mark by color alone has been stated a good many times in decisions and text books.\" Campbell Soup Co., et al. v. Armour & Co., 3 Cir., 175 F.2d 795, 798 [81 USPQ 430, 433]. As a rule color cannot be monopolized to distinguish a product. Diamond Match Co. v. Saginaw Match Co., 6 Cir. 142 F. 727, 729, cert. Den.203 U.S. 589, Color is not subject to trade mark monopoly except in connection with some definite arbitrary symbol or design. James Heddon\\'s Sons v. Millsite Steel & Wire Works, Inc., 128 F.2d 6, 9 [53 USPQ 579, 581-582]. In the Campbell Soup Co. case, supra, the court said (p. 798 [81 USPQ at 432]):\\n\"What the plaintiffs are really asking for, then, is a right to the exclusive use of labels which are half red and half white for food products. If they may thus monopolize red in all of its shades the next manufacturer may monopolize orange in all of its shades and the next yellow in the same way. Obviously, the list of colors will soon run out.\"\\n37. In GAF Corporation v. Ciba-Geigy Ltd., 184 USPQ 253, it was held as follows:-\\n \"[3] Applicant\\'s cover is green, the entire cover is green. The overall application of color green to cover of a book lacks distinction. It is matter of common knowledge that covers of books are presented in overall colors and it is clear beyond per adventure that the color green of applicant\\'s goods is not capable of distinguishing applicant\\'s book as to origin from other books having green covers. Further, color is not subject to trademark exclusiveness except in connection with some definite arbitrary symbol or design. See: Life Savers Corporation v. the Curtiss Candy Company, 85 USPQ 440 (CA 7, 1950); Lucien Lelong, Inc. v. Lenel, Inc. et all., 85 USPQ 117 (CA 5, 1950); National Candle Company, Inc. v. Viscount Manufacturing Co., Inc., 130 USPQ 452 (DC NJ, 1961); Landis Machine Company v. Chaso Tool Company, Inc., 53 USPQ 200 (DC Mich., 1942); Neuhoff Brothers v. Oscar Mayer Packing Company, Inc., et. al, 98 USPQ 194 (DC Tex. 1953); Fram Corporation v. Boyd, 109 USPQ 4 (CA 5, 1956); Mershon Company v. Pachmayr, 105 UPSQ 4 (CA 9, 1955). Since applicant cannot acquire exclusiveness in a green colored cover for books, said color cannot be capable of distinguishing applicant\\'s publication.\"\\n40. It is also worthwhile to quote Mccarthy on Trademarks where at para 7.44 it was observed as follows:-\\n\"Prior to the Supreme Court\\'s 2000 Wal-Mart decision, some had read the Court\\'s Qualitex opinion as not settling the issue of whether a single product color can ever be so unusual as to be \"inherently distinctive\" and hence protectable without proof of secondary meaning. However, in the author\\'s opinion, the Court, albeit not in so many words, said that for this type of trademark or trade dress, a single color per se can never be classified as inherently distinctive and will always require proof of secondary meaning for protection and registration.\\nThis dispute came to an end when the U.S. Supreme Court in its Wal-Mart decision cleared up once and for all any lingering doubts about the rule in the Qualitex case. In Wal-Mart, the Supreme Court looked back to its previous decision and stated that in Qualitex, it had held that no single color can ever be inherently distinctive. Single color always requires proof of secondary meaning.\"\\n Thus, even in the U.S., the position of law is that colours per se cannot be claimed as trade marks. It has been consistently held that colour must combine with other things to acquire a distinctive design which may afford protection to the defendant.\\n41. In the book \"Designer\\'s guide to color\\' by James Stockton, it has been stated as follows:-\\n\"The many psychological aspects of color often seem more emotional and personal than scientific, the determining agreement in relation to colors is sometimes difficult. However, most people do agree that some color combinations imply heat and some cold, and that some cannote pleasure and other pain. Painters, and particularly the Impressionists, have relied on these ideas to produce dimension, form and mood. Red can be among other things, either a welcome or a warning, conveying either warmth or danger. The \"voice\" of a color depends largely on the colors that are placed next to it is the essence of this book.\\nRoche Laboratory has developed an elaborate \"spectrum of human emotions\" color wheel. It is beautifully presented in Living by Design: Words and Pictures, by Pentagram (published by Lund Humphries, London, and the Whitney Library of Design, New York, 1978). Unchallenged, it assigns \"reserved\" to blue, \"active\" to red, and so on. Regardless of the absolute accuracy of these designations, that moods can be evoked and manipulated by our historical and cultural associations with color is certain. Some combinations immediately evoke the 1950s, the military, the Federal period, and a feeling of the baroque. Generally, color can produce an appropriate setting, tone or mood for the subject at hand. This sort of color use is nowhere more powerful than in the theater, opera and ballet. On stage, color is seldom static; and constantly layered and shifting combinations of color and are carefully modulated and controlled can benefit an entire production. As in the print media, the trained and deliberate placement on stage of small areas of color contributes to the emotional impact of the larger piece.\"\\n\"Variations on Red\\n \\n\\n About 4000 years ago in the Orient people dabbed red clay on their lips to ward off unwanted spirits, and even in recent times some Asian fishermen have worn red loin cloths to ward off sharks; red has endowed with special charms. In fact, along with black and white red may be one of humankind\\'s three basic colors, as defined by some anthropologists and ethnologists. White and red are associated with life activities; black usually indicates death, misfortune or evil, or simply opposition to white\\'s yielding and acceptance and purity. As clearly in opposition as are black and white to North American eyes are red and white to people in other quarters of the world, and dichotomous red generally assumes the most active and overt role.\"\\n \"Although it is an alternative way of getting your message across, you need more than just a broad swathe of colour. Malboro\\'s brand is indicated by the red & white chevrons, but without the shape. I am not sure how effective it could be. There is a stage when colour ceases to be ownable.\" (Jez. Frampton, Chief Executive of brand consulting Interbrand Http://ad-rag.com/114708.php)\\n \\n\\nThe Color Wheel\\n \\n\\nA color circle, based on red, yellow and blue, is traditional in the field of art. Sir Isaac Newton developed the first circular diagram of colors in 1666. Since then scientists and artists have studied and designed numerous variations of this concept. Differences of opinion about the validity of one format over another continue to provoke debate. In reality, any color circle or color wheel which presents a logically arranged sequence of pure hues has merit.\\nPRIMARY COLORS\\n \\n\\nRed, yellow and blue\\n \\n\\nIn traditional color theory, these are the 3 pigment colors that can not be mixed or formed by any combination of other colors. All other colors are derived from these 3 hues.\\n[Source:http://www.colormatters.com/colortheory.html]\\n \\n\\nPrimary Colors: The primary colors consist of 3 unique colors, red-yellow-blue. When mixing these 3 colors hues, at least in theory, all the other hues of the color wheel, including black can be created.\\nColor Associations:\\nPrimaries red, blue, yellow. The ultimate contrast of hue and the greatest luminosity. Primaries express fundamental qualities, folk art, embroidery, costumes, etc. They are exuberant, decorative, tonic, vigorous, decisive.\\n[Source: http://www.artsparx.com/color_basicprinc.asp]\\n \\n\\nOur color wheel starts with the 3 primary colors, placed in an equilateral triangle.\\n[Source:http://www.artsparx.com/colorwheel.asp]\\n \\n\\n42. The above texts and the colour diagrammes also indicate that the exclusivity and monopoly of a colour and a colour scheme is not favored. Not only is the red colour one of the seven primary colours but it along with white and black colours has in fact been described as one of the three basic colours in nature. Furthermore, even though the colour combination of the registered mark indicates red and white, in essence the carton of the plaintiffs for which registration has been granted is entirely in red except the logo in the form of the word \\'COLGATE\\' and other small ancillary words such as the price, quality etc. which are printed in white. It is this placement of small print in white containing the word \\'COLGATE\\' in a small area placed on the back ground in red which contributes to the commercial impact of the plaintiff\\'s carton in the market place and indeed gives exclusivity and distinctiveness to the plaintiff\\'s mark. Thus, the mark COLGATE in white on a red background highlights the plaintiff\\'s product and gives a distinct identity to the combination, and such a combine is certainly entitled to protection from not only passing off, but infringement too. However, I am also of the view that the red and white colour combination per se without the word/mark \\'COLGATE\\' is not entitled to protection from infringement.\\n43. Thus, in so far as the plea of infringement of the registered mark of the plaintiffs by the defendant\\'s mark is concerned, I am unable to come to a finding that in view of the aforesaid discussion, the plaintiff\\'s mark can be said to have been infringed by the defendant\\'s mark.\\n70. Learned Single Judge also considered the issue of passing off action and referred to judgment of the Apex Court in Cadila Health Care Ltd.\\'s case (supra) and some other judgments of this Court in paras 40 to 46 as under:-\\n\"44. However, de hors the finding that there was no infringement of the plaintiff\\'s registered mark by the defendant\\'s mark, the plea of passing off is required to be considered on its own. The Hon\\'ble Supreme Court in Cadila Health Care Ltd. v. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Limited,  laid down the following authoritative position of law in respect of tests for ascertaining passing off:-\\n\"35. Broadly stated, in an action for passing-off on the basis of unregistered trade mark generally for deciding the question of deceptive similarity the following factors to be considered:\\n(a) The nature of the marks i.e. whether the marks are word marks or label marks or composite marks i.e. both words and label works.\\n(b) The degree of resembleness between the marks, phonetically similar and hence similar in idea.\\n(c) The nature of the goods in respect of which they are used as trade marks.\\n(d) The similarity in the nature, character and performance of the goods of the rival traders.\\n(e) The class of purchasers who are likely to buy the goods bearing the marks they require, on their education and intelligence and a degree of care they are likely to exercise in purchasing and/or using the goods.\\n(f) The mode of purchasing the goods or placing orders for the goods.\\n(g) Any other surrounding circumstances which may be relevant in the extent of dissimilarity between the competing marks.\\n36. Weightage to be given to each of the aforesaid factors depending upon facts of each case and the same weightage cannot be given to each factor in every case.\"\\n45. In , Vicco Laboratories Bombay v. Hindustan Rimmer, Delhi, which on facts was rather similar to the present case, the following position of law was laid down by this Court in respect of two competing creams:-\\n \"13. The plaintiff\\'s claim passing of by the defendants of their product as and for the product of the plaintiff\\'s on the basis of copy of the distinctive get-up and colour scheme of the collapsible tubes and the cartons by them. The defendants are not entitled to represent their goods as being the goods of the plaintiffs. The two marks \\'Vicco\\' and \\'Cosmo\\' used by the plaintiffs and defendants respectively are no doubt different and the mark \\'Cosmo\\' by itself is not likely to deceive but the entire get-up and the colour scheme of the tube and carton adopted by the plaintiffs and the defendants are identical in every detail and are likely to confuse and deceive the customer easily. The get-up and the colour scheme of the plaintiffs adopted in every detail by the defendants for their tube and carton cannot be said to have been adopted by the defendants unintentionally. Further the defendants allege that they started selling their product in the carton and tube in question from No. 1977 while the plaintiffs have been selling their product in the said carton and the tube since April, 1975. the suit was originally filed in Feb., 1978 at Bombay and ex-parte injunction was granted on 29th August, 1978. The plaintiffs are prior users of their product in the carton and the tube.\"\\n46. It was also held by this Court as under in Colgate Palmolive Co. v. Anchor Health and Beauty Care [2003(27) PTC 478 (Del)]:\\n \"54. May be, no party can have monopoly over a particular colour, but if there is substantial reproduction of the colour combination in the similar order either on the container or packing which over a period has been imprinted upon the minds of customers it certainly is liable to cause not only confusion but also dilution of distinctiveness of colour combination. Colour combination, get up, lay out and size of the container is sort of trade dress which involves overall image of the product\\'s features. There is a wide protection against imitation or deceptive similarities of trade dress as trade dress is the soul for identification of the goods as to its source and origin and as such is liable to cause confusion in the mind of the unwary customers particularly, those who have been using the product over a long period.\"\\n71. The judgments of the U.S. Courts referred to above including Yves St Laurent Parfums\\'s case (supra), Vision Sports Inc.\\'s case (supra), Cf. Chevron Chem. Co.\\'s case (supra), Harold F. Ritchie, Inc.\\'s case (supra) and Perfect Fit Industries, Inc.\\'s case (supra) also succinctly deal with the aspect of trademark, get-up and packaging. It is the whole combination which has to be seen to come to the conclusion whether the same would liable to cause confusion to the average customer. Thus, though there may not be any right in any single colour, there can be use of combination of colours coupled with the mark and the manner of arrangement on the box / container, which would be of significance. Thus, in Harold F. Ritchie, Inc.\\'s case (supra), it was held that the second comer has a duty to so name and dress his product as to avoid all likelihood of confusion amongst the consumers. The important test is whether there is any evidence of conscious imitation of the first comer\\'s product. The plaintiff is certainly the first comer, though there is some dispute about the date/year from which the sales have proceeded. This Court, thus, has to consider the names of the products in conjunction with similarity of presentation of products with respect to the design and general appearance, container, tubes, price, etc. Thus, what is not important is the exclusive use of a particular colour, but the use of colour in a particular graphic display in a logo format, which may cause confusion.\\n72. It is in the aforesaid context that a mere prefix or suffix would certainly not suffice, but the mark has to be seen as a whole. The judgments of the Apex Court in Ruston & Hornsby Ltd.\\'s case (supra) and Parle Products (P) Ltd.\\'s case (supra) may be usefully referred to for this purpose.\\n73. There is no doubt that the word LOTUS is used as a prefix by the defendants. However, what is of significance is the manner of placement of LOTUS. The font is smaller and less significant. The significance is on the word \\'DIA\\'. The font used for writing DIA is similar to the one used in writing LIA. It is similarly underlined in the same style of a curve-line underneath. As stated above, though the word \\'LIA\\' has two dots below the line, it is not that each feature has to be seen with the magnifying glass. It is the overall impact which has to be considered.\\n74. Interestingly, defendants have admittedly applied subsequently for registration of the mark DIA and not LOTUS DIA. The essential ingredient feature of the mark is DIA and not LOTUS DIA. It is not just a case of phonetic similarity, a prefix being added, a similar colour scheme, similar packaging with certain endorsement, but all these aspects taken collectively to see the import of the trade dress used by the plaintiff and the defendants. If each individual feature is taken into consideration, maybe there would be some minor differences. However, that is not material.\\n75. A perusal of the boxes show that the colour scheme has a pattern, though the colours in its hues may vary slightly. They have a pastel base with softening to whitish towards the centre of the box and again going up to a darker colour. The NATURE\\'S GIFT LIA has a mogra flower. The defendants have adopted mogra flower to sell the MOGRA incense sticks. Mogra is of a whitish colour and if the object is to give an indication of the nature of incense, it was certainly not necessarily to use only green colour. Similarly, for the rose, it is the pink colour. It is not only an aspect of imitation of one particular colour scheme or fragrance, it is the series of such six packages which has been adopted. In such a case, the object of the defendants itself appears to be to mislead the customer into believing that the product is of the plaintiff or at least has some connection with the product of the plaintiff.\\n76. The defendants are primarily based in the North, yet they have chosen to inscribe on the side of the box with vernacular scripts of Devnagri, Tamil, Kannada and Telugu in the same pattern. At the cost of repetition, it may be emphasized that this factor alone is not relevant, but is coupled with the other factors discussed above. Even the address indicated of the defendants was not found to be correct, but was given of the person who was doing work for the defendants on job-work basis. The address of the plaintiff was at Mysore while that of the defendants was given at Bangalore.\\n77. The overall visual impression from the colour scheme, the arrangement of the mark, the style of writing of the mark, the general get-up and trade dress leads to the conclusion that there is a clear attempt on the part of the defendants to pass off their goods as that of the plaintiff and, thus, the test laid in Parle Products (P) Ltd.\\'s case (supra) is clearly satisfied. The ingredients of a passing off action have been very succinctly set out in Yves St Laurent Parfums\\'s case (supra), which sets out that a misrepresentation need not to be crass, but may involve a complex mechanism of misrepresentation. Thus, the representation may operate in a number of ways, no single one of which may be compelling but a combination of which is effective. This is the position in the present case. One only needs to look at two products side by side to see the striking similarity in various combination of factors. It is the overall impression that a customer gets to the source and origin of the goods from visual impression of colour combination, packaging and the get-up, which is of relevance and if an unwary and gullible customer gets confused, it amounts to a passing off as set out in Colgate Palmolive Co. Ltd.\\'s case (supra). No doubt, there is no monopoly in colour combinations, but what is relevant in the present case is that there is substantial reproduction of the colour combination in a similar pattern in each packet and there are similar six series of packets. The defendants being the second comers owed a duty to name and dress their product in such a manner as to avoid all likelihood of consumers confusing it with the product of the first comer [Harold F. Ritchie, Inc.\\'s case (supra)].\\n78. A result of the comparison of six containers shows that there is similarity in colour pattern, phonetic similarity in the trade-name, the use of colours in a particular pattern - whiteness towards the centre and again darker colour at the base and the top, writing on Devnagri and other scripts in a similar fashion, which leaves little doubt about the motive of the defendants. The packaging is identical and so is the pricing. If all these factors are taken into account, I have no doubt that the clear object of the defendants was to deceive the unsuspecting customers, who come from various stratas of society and are not a discerning customers.\\n79. The plaintiff has given detailed figures of its sales under this particular brand-name and colour scheme. The artistic work of the plaintiff was registered. The turnover for the range of products for the financial year of 2002-2003 is Rs. 243.67 Lakhs and for the financial year of 2003-2004 is Rs. 413.7 Lakhs. This is duly supported by the Chartered Accounts\\' certificate. As against this, the defendants claim sales for the financial year of 2003-2004 of Rs. 5.75 Lakhs and for the first five months of the financial year of 2004-2005 of Rs. 10.15 Lakhs.\\n80. For all aforesaid reasons, Issues No. 2 and 3 are answered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants.\\n81. The aforesaid findings, thus, show that the defendants\\' packaging is identical or deceptively similar to that of the plaintiff and the defendants are attempting to pass off their product as that of the plaintiff.\\nISSUE No. 4:\\nWhether the plaintiff is guilty of suppressing material facts and making false statements and to what effect?\\n82. Issue No. 4 relates to the claim of the defendants that the plaintiff is guilty of suppression of material facts in respect of the date from which its sales started. No sales figure of 2001 onwards have been given and before the Registering Authority, the application shows sales from 2002. Thus, the claim of user since 2001 has been falsely made. I am of the considered view that nothing much turns on this since the plaintiff is the prior user and figures have been given from 2003-2004 onwards. The plaintiff may have begun the process in 2001 and applied for registration in 2004. Thus, the issue is answered in favor of the plaintiff.\\nWhether the defendants have honestly adopted and used his subject matter trademark since 2003 in relation to incense sticks (agarbathies) and to what effect?\\nWhether the defendants, in the alternative, are entitled to benefit of honest and concurrent users and to what effect?\\n83. Issues No. 5 and 6 are linked since they arise from the claim of defendants having honestly adopted and used his subject matter trademark since 2003 or at least be entitled to benefit of honest concurrent user. The findings arrived at in respect of Issues No. 2 and 3 show that the defendants have, in fact, deliberately attempted to pass off their goods as that of the plaintiff and if all the features are taken together, it is a clear case of deception. Thus, the defense of honest concurrent use can hardly be said to be available to the defendants. Thus, Issues No. 5 and 6 are answered against the defendants.\\nWhether the suit is barred by delay, acquiescence, laches, estoppel and waiver?\\n84. Issue No. 7 relates to the bar on account of delay, acquiescence, laches, estoppel and waiver. The defendants have really not even advanced any submissions on this aspect. The written synopsis of defendants, in fact, does not even refer to this aspect and even on the facts, such a case can hardly be made out. Thus, the issue is answered against the defendants.\\nRelief.\\n85. The question now arises as to what is the relief to which the plaintiff would be entitled to in view of the fact that the relief of damages has already been given up. It has to be kept in mind that the defendants are not to be precluded from using a particular colour or a mark, but the total get-up and trade dress of the plaintiff and the defendants being similar, the defendants cannot be permitted to manufacture and sell agarbathies / incense sticks in the packaging as is being done at present.\\n86. The plaintiff is, thus, entitled to a decree of permanent injunction against the defendants or anyone acting under the defendants or its retailers, stockists, agents, etc. from in any manner manufacturing or selling agarbathies / incense sticks in the offending packaging under the trade-name DIA and the colour scheme of the packaging or in any manner in packaging, which are substantial reproduction of the packaging of the plaintiff. The decree would, thus, operate in respect of the offending packaging in question or any deceptively similar packaging to that of the plaintiff sold under the trade-name LIA and the manner of the representation of colour schemes in the range of the products.\\n87. The plaintiff shall also be entitled to costs.\\n88. Decree-sheet be drawn up accordingly.\\n'}},\n",

The plaintiff has filed a suit for permanent injunction for infringement of trademark, copyright, passing off, delivery up, rendition of accounts, damages, etc. against the defendant. The plaintiff is a limited company incorporated and registered under the Companies Act, 1956 and is a Joint Venture incorporated on 19.01.1984 whereby 26% of the equity is held by the Indian Group being the Hero Group and 26% by the Honda Motors Company of Japan, while the remaining equity is stated to be widely spread. The plaintiff is involved in the business of manufacture and sale of motorcycles under the trademark HERO HONDA since 09.04.1985. It is stated that apart from the said business, the plaintiff is also engaged in the manufacture of sale of readymade garments, hosiery, gloves, etc.\\n \\n\\n2. The Joint Venture Group is stated to be mainly dealing with the manufacture of cycle and cycle parts and the Japanese Joint Venture partner, Honda Motor Co. Ltd. is an internationally renowned name and trademark HONDA. The Joint Venture, thus, adopted the trademark HERO HONDA to reflect the goodwill of the business of both the two Joint Venture Groups as an arbitrarily coined trademark.\\n3. The plaintiff has set out the sales figures in para 5 of the plaint as under:-\\n  ------------------------------------------------------------\\n5. The plaintiff claims that by adoption of long and extensive user goods bearing the trademark HERO HONDA are exclusively associated with the products originating from the plaintiff. Apart from the Common Law Rights, the plaintiff is also the registered proprietor of the following marks:-\\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n6. The plaintiff has adopted a logo to represent its products consisting of three parallel lines at the base surmounted by a semi-circle, which is surmounted by a crown like structure. This logo was created by M/s. Shobhagya Advertisiing Services on behalf of the plaintiff and is, thus, claimed to be the original artistic work of the plaintiff within the meaning of Section 2(c) of The Copyright Act, 1957. The packaging of spare parts was created by M/s. Mansa Packagers Pvt. Ltd., which is an artistic work owned by the plaintiff.\\n7. The plaintiff came to know that there were several unscrupulous traders manufacturing motorcycle parts and other items bearing the plaintiff trademark HERO HONDA and the logo with the result that there was not only loss of profit, but the brand equity of the plaintiff was affected on account of inferior quality of the product sold in the market by such traders. The public was also stated to be, thus, a direct sufferer of the same. The defendant is stated to be one such trader. The plaintiff purchased the product of the defendant and found that apart from infringing the logo and the mark of the plaintiff, the product was of poor quality in finish and packaging. Thus, the defendant was counterfeiting the product of the plaintiff and selling the goods as that of the plaintiff. There was also violation of the registered trademark of the plaintiff.\\n8. At the stage of filing of the suit, interim orders were granted and Local Commissioner was also appointed to seize the goods in question. The goods were Page 2505 taken possession of and then released on superdari to the defendant. The defendant, however, did not put in appearance and was proceeded ex parte. The plaintiff has filed the affidavit of ex parte evidence of Shri Sanjay Mittal, the constituted Attorney of the plaintiff. The witness has proved the certified copy of the Board Resolution of the plaintiff along with the Power of Attorney as Exhibit P-1, which authorised institution of the suit. The sample invoices of the plaintiff have been proved as Exhibit P-2 and the advertisements of the plaintiff as Exhibit P-3. The Certificate of Registration of the two trademarks referred to above have been proved as Exhibit P-4 and Exhibit P-5. The plaintiff has proved as Exhibit P-6 the assignment made by M/s. Shobhagya Advertisiing Services in respect of the logo and as Exhibit P-7 the assignment in respect of the the packaging by M/s. Mansa Packagers Pvt. Ltd. The plaintiff has relied on the affidavit of one Shri Rajiv Manchanda filed in the proceedings showing the cash memo of purchase of the defendant as well as the photographs of the product of the defendant. The said affidavit has been exhibited as Exhibit P-8 while the photographs of the product and packaging are exhibited as Exhibit P-9.\\n9. The aforesaid facts and circumstances show that the plaintiff has the exclusive right to use their trademark HERO HONDA and the logo as also the packaging material in question. The defendant is attempting to counterfeit the products of the plaintiff and pass off its goods as that of the plaintiff. This not only causes loss of profits to the plaintiff, but results in inferior products made available to the public at large who are deceived by the conduct of the defendant.\\n10. In view of the aforesaid, the plaintiff is entitled to a decree of permanent injunction against the defendant from dealing with the goods having infringing mark in terms of prayers (a) to (c) of para 18 of the prayer clause.\\n11. Insofar as the prayer (d) is concerned, the seized goods were released on superdari by the Local Commissioner to the defendant and the said goods are liable to be destroyed. The plaintiff is, thus, entitled to a decree of delivery up of all the infringing products so that the same can be destroyed.\\n12. The last aspect to be considered is the issue of damages for loss of reputation and business as also the cost of the present proceedings.\\n13. Insofar as the issue of damages is concerned, learned counsel for the plaintiff submits that even in the absence of specific evidence to the same effect, such damages can be granted.\\n14. It is trite to say that the defendant has deliberately stayed away from the present proceedings with the result that an enquiry into the accounts of the defendant for determination of damages cannot take place. However, the infringement of the trademark of the plaintiff as also its logo is not in dispute. The plaintiff has claimed token damages and compensation of Rs. 5 lakhs as it was not possible to determine the exact nature of damages at the stage of filing of the suit. The attention of this Court has been drawn to a number of judgments in this behalf where dealing with similar situations, damages have been awarded.\\n15. In Relaxo Rubber Limited and Anr. v. Selection Footwear and Anr., 1999 PTC 578, the defendant did not file the written statement after taking time for the same and a decree was passed under Order VIII Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Against the claim of tentative damages of Rs. 5 lakhs, Rs. 3 lakhs Page 2506 was awarded as damages. Similarly in Hindustan Machines v. Royal Electrical Applies, 1999 PTC (19) 685, a sum of Rs. 3 lakhs was awarded. In the recent judgments, this Court in CS (OS) No. 2711/1999 titled \\'L.T. Overseas Ltd. v. Guruji Trading Co. and Anr.\\' decided on 07.09.2005 had granted Rs. 3 lakhs damages in a similar case. In the present case, punitive damages have not been specifically claimed.\\n16. Learned counsel for the plaintiff has, however, drawn the attention of this Court to the judgment of this Court in Time Incorporated v. Lokesh Srivastava and Anr., 2005 (30) PTC 3 (Del) where apart from compensatory damages of Rs. 5 lakhs, punitive damages have also been awarded. It would be useful to reproduce paras 7 and 8 of the said judgment, which are as under:-\\n\"7. Coming to the claim of Rs. 5 lacs as punitive and exemplary damages for the flagrant infringement of the plaintiff\\'s trade mark, this Court is of the considered view that a distinction has to be drawn between compensatory damages and punitive damages. The award of compensatory damages to a plaintiff is aimed at compensating him for the loss suffered by him whereas punitive damages are aimed at deterring a wrong doer and the like minded from indulging in such unlawful activities. Whenever an action has criminal propensity also the punitive damages are clearly called for so that the tendency to violate the laws and infringe the rights of others with a view to make money is curbed. The punitive damages are founded on the philosophy of corrective justice and as such, in appropriate cases these must be awarded to give a signal to the wrong doers that law does not take a breach merely as a matter between rival parties but feels concerned about those also who are not party to the lis but suffer on account of the breach. In the case in hand itself, it is not only the plaintiff, who has suffered on account of the infringement of its trade mark and Magazine design but a large number of readers of the defendants\\' Magazine \\'TIME ASIA SANSKARAN\\' also have suffered by purchasing the defendants\\' Magazines under an impression that the same are from teh reputed publishing house of the plaintiff company.\\n8. This Court has no hesitation in saying that the time has come when the Courts dealing actions for infringement of trade marks, copy rights, patents, etc. should not only grant compensatory damages but award punitive damages also with a view to discourage and dishearten law breakers who indulge in violations with impunity out of lust for money so that they realize that in case they are caught, they would be liable not only to reimburse the aggrieved party but would be liable to pay punitive damages also, which may spell financial disaster for them. In Mathias v. Accor Economi Lodging, Inc., 347 F.3d 672 (7th Cir. 2003) the factors underlying the grant of punitive damages were discussed and it was observed that one function of punitive damages is to relieve the pressure on an overloaded system of criminal justice by providing a civil alternative to criminal prosecution of minor crimes. It was further observed that the award of punitive damages serves the additional purpose of limiting the defendant\\'s ability to profit from its fraud by escaping detection and prosecution. If a tortfeasor is caught only half the time he commits torts, then when he is caught he should be punished twice as heavily in order to Page 2507 make up for the reason that it is very difficult for a plaintiff to give proof of actual damages suffered by him as the defendants who indulge in such activities never maintain proper accounts of their transactions who they know that the same are objectionable and unlawful. In the present case, the claim of punitive damages is of Rs. 5 lacs only which can be safely awarded. Had it been higher even this court would not have hesitated in awarding the same. The Court is of the view that the punitive damages should be really punitive and not flee bite and quantum thereof should depend upon the flagrancy of infringement.\"\\n17. Learned counsel for the plaintiff states that damages have been claimed in the present suit, though it is not specified separately as to the nature of damages. Learned counsel further states that in any case the plaintiff should be entitled to at least the damages of Rs. 5 lakhs.\\n18. I am in agreement with the aforesaid submission of learned counsel for the plaintiff that damages in such cases must be awarded and a defendant, who chooses to stay away from the proceedings of the Court, should not be permitted to enjoy the benefits of evasion of court proceedings. Any view to the contrary would result in a situation where the defendant who appears in Court and submits its account books would be liable for damages, while a party which chooses to stay away from court proceedings would escape the liability on account failure of the availability of account books. A party who chooses to not participate in court proceedings and stay away must, thus, suffer the consequences of damages as stated and set out by the plaintiff. Of course, this would not imply that the plaintiff would be entitled to any figure quoted by it which may be astronomical. The figure of Rs. 5 lakhs as damages can hardly be said to be astronomical keeping in mind the nature of deception alleged by the plaintiff which not only causes direct loss to the plaintiff, but also affects the reputation of the plaintiff by selling sub-standard goods in the market where the public may be deceived in buying the goods thinking the same to be that of the plaintiff. There is a larger public purpose involved to discourage such parties from indulging in such acts of deception and, thus, even if the same has a punitive element, it must be granted. R.C. Chopra, J. has very succinctly set out in Time Incorporated\\'s case (supra) that punitive damages are founded on the philosophy of corrective justice. That was the case where the publishers of Time Magazine had come to Court and one of the factors which weighed while awarding punitive damages was that the readers had been sufferers of the infringement of the mark of the plaintiff. The only difference is that in the present case it is the consumer of the products of the plaintiff, who have suffered as a consequence of the infringement of the mark and logo of the plaintiff by the defendant.\\n19. The second aspect emphasized in Times Incorporated\\'s case (supra) has also material bearing as the object is to relieve the pressure on over-loaded system of criminal justice by providing civil alternative to criminal prosecution of minor crimes. The defendant could have been prosecuted for such counterfeiting, but the plaintiff has considered appropriate to confine the relief to civil proceedings.\\n20. Learned counsel for the plaintiff also rightly points out that instead of the plaintiff utilising its energy for expansion of its business and sale of its Page 2508 products, the resources have to be spread over a number of such litigations to bring to book the offending traders in the market. In such a case, both compensatory and punitive damages ought to be granted apart from the costs incurred by the plaintiff in such litigation.\\n21. In view of the aforesaid position, a decree for permanent injunction is passed in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant restraining the defendant from selling motorcycle parts bearing the trademark HERO HONDA with or without the logo or any other trademark deceptively similar to the plaintiff\\'s mark HERO HONDA and logo as also selling such goods in the packaging identical or deceptively similar to that of the plaintiff. A decree is also passed in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant for the defendant to hand over the seized goods released by the Local Commissioner on superdari to the defendant so that the same can be destroyed by the plaintiff. A decree of damages is also passed in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant for a sum of Rs. 5 lakhs. The plaintiff shall also be entitled to costs of the present proceedings.\\n22. Decree-sheet be drawn up accordingly.\\n23. It is, however, observed on a perusal of the plaint that the suit is deficiently stamped in view of judgment of this Court in CS(OS) No. 1165/2001 titled \\'Pfizer Products, Inc. v. B.L. & Co. and Ors.\\' decided on 03.10.2005. Learned counsel for the plaintiff states that he will file the deficient court fee within a week. Decree-sheet be drawn up only on such court fee being paid.\\n'}},\n",

The case of the plaintiffs is that plaintiff No.1, M/s Eaton Corporation\\nis a company organized and existing under the laws of United States of\\nAmerica. The plaintiff No.2, Eaton Power Quality Pvt. Ltd., New Delhi is\\nthe subsidiary of plaintiff No.1.\\n3.    The plaintiff No.1 (the expression whereof shall include its\\npredecessors-in-interest and title) are engaged in the business of the\\nmanufacture and sale of \"electric apparatus for use in operating machines,\\nengines and motor by current control and electrical supplies, consisting of;\\ncontrollers for dynamoelectric machines to wit; starting, stopping, reversing,\\nand speed regulating apparatus for motors, and voltage and current\\nregulating apparatus for generators and like control apparatus for rotary\\nconvertors; current breakers; magnetic brakes for various types of\\nmachines; lifting and separating magnets and controls therefor; solenoids;\\nelectric panel boards and other goods included in Class 9.\\n4.    It is alleged in the plaint that the plaintiff No.1 founded in 1911 and\\nincorporated in Ohio in 1916 is a well known premier diversified fortune\\n200 industrial company having a manufacturing presence in Australia,\\nBrazil, Canada, China, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Dominican Republic,\\nFrance, Germany, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico,\\nMonaco, Netherlands, Poland, Puerto Rica, Singapore, South Africa, South\\n\\n\\n\\nCS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012                          Page 2 of 72\\n Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, United Kingdom and United\\nStates of America and has been selling their products under various well\\nknown trademarks. It is a global corporate being into business for more\\nthan 100 years, employing approximately 73,000 employees worldwide and\\nselling its products to customers in more than 150 countries. During the year\\n2010, their market value is estimated to be $19.92 billion USD approx.\\n5.    It is also alleged that the plaintiff No.1 mainly deals in four distinct\\nindustrial segments namely Electrical, Fluid Power, Truck and Automotive\\nwherein they are considered to be the global leaders. Plaintiffs deals in the\\ndesigns, manufacture, marketing and serving of electrical         systems and\\ncomponents for power quality, distribution and control; fluid power systems\\nand services for industrial, mobile and aircraft equipment; intelligent truck\\ndrive train systems for safety and fuel economy; and automotive engine air\\nmanagement systems, power train solutions and specialty controls for\\nperformance, fuel economy and safety.\\n6.    The trade mark \"CUTLER-HAMMER\" was first adopted by Cutler-\\nHammer Inc., predecessor-in-interest and title of plaintiff No.1 in the year\\n1893 in respect of electric apparatus for use in operating machines and\\ngoods mentioned above.\\n7.    The plaintiffs‟ contention is that the predecessor-in-title of\\nCutler-Hammer Inc. first shipped the goods included in Class 9 under\\ntrademark \"CUTLER-HAMMER\" to India in the year 1919. Since that\\ntime, the plaintiff‟s predecessor-in-interest and title and then plaintiffs have\\ncontinued to use the said trademark in respect of goods of its manufacture\\nand sale so much so that the plaintiffs‟ trademark \"CUTLER-HAMMER\"\\nhave come about to be exclusively identified and recognized by the\\n\\n\\n\\nCS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012                            Page 3 of 72\\n purchasing public and the members of the trade with the goods of the\\nplaintiffs and none else.\\n      The trade mark \"CH\" was first adopted by Cutler-Hammer Inc.,\\npredecessor-in-interest and title of plaintiff No.1 in the year 1954 in India\\nin respect of goods falling in Class 9 and has been used in India initially by\\nthe plaintiffs‟ predecessor-in-interest and title and then by plaintiffs from\\nseveral years.\\n8.    Plaintiffs‟ trademarks \"CUTLER-HAMMER\", \"CH Control\" and\\n\"CH (label)\" are being used in several countries in the world. The list of\\ncountries in which products bearing the trademark \"CUTLER-HAMMER\",\\n\"CH Control and \"CH (label)\" has been filed.\\n9.    Plaintiffs‟ trademarks \"CUTLER-HAMMER\", \"CH Control\" and\\n\"CH (label)\" are also the subject matter of numerous registrations in number\\nof countries of the world covering variety of goods falling in international\\nClass 9. Copies of a sample of some of the registration certificates have\\nbeen filed on record.\\n10.   The registration of the trademark \"CUTLER-HAMMER\" under\\nNo.164435 was applied by Cutler-Hammer Inc. on 8th June, 1954 as per the\\nprovisions of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 in India. Plaintiff\\nNo.1 acquired the company Cutler-Hammer Inc. in the year 1978 whereby\\nrequest on Form-24 dated 28th November, 1979 was filed.           Pursuant to\\nrequest on Form-24 and order dated 23rd January, 1980, plaintiff No.1 was\\nregistered as subsequent proprietor by virtue of Certificate of Merger.\\n11.   The plaintiff No.1 also registered the trade mark(s) \"CH (label)\", \"CH\\nControl\" and \"CH\" in respect of electric goods included in Class 9 under the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012                           Page 4 of 72\\n provisions of Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 in India. The details\\nof these trademarks are as follows:\\n12.   The registration of the abovementioned trademark \"CUTTER-\\nHAMMER\" under No.164435 confers an exclusive right on the plaintiffs to\\nthe use of the said trademarks under Section 28 of the Trade Marks Act,\\n1999. The use of any mark which may be identical and/or deceptively\\nsimilar thereto in respect of the same or similar description of goods or\\nservice constitute an act of infringement under Section 29 of the Trade\\nMarks Act, 1999 as well as passing off.\\n13.   The contention of the plaintiffs is that          trademarks \"CUTLER-\\nHAMMER\", \"CH Control\" and \"CH (label)\" enjoys                 wide reputation,\\nrecognition and popularity in the Indian and world market for high quality\\nof products sold under it. These trademarks have created its own identity\\nin the market and have immensely contributed in generation of goodwill so\\nmuch so that it has acquired the trans-border reputation which has spilled\\nover to India.\\n14.   The defendant, BCH Electric Limited having its office at 1101, New\\nDelhi House, 27-Barakhamba Road, New Delhi-110 001 also at, Block\\n1E216, AJC Bose Road, Kolkata-700017 and 20/4, Mathura Road\\n\\n\\n\\nCS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012                               Page 5 of 72\\n Faridabad-121 006, Haryana is also engaged in the business of manufacture\\nand sale of electric goods falling in Class 9.\\n15.   The defendant (the expression whereof shall include its predecessor-\\nin-interest and title) was set up in the year 1965 as a result of the joint\\nventure between the plaintiffs‟ predecessor-in-interest and title, Cutler-\\nHammer Inc. and some Indian partners in the name of CUTLER-HAMMER\\nINDIA LIMITED. The name of defendant Company was later changed to\\nBhartia Cutler-Hammer Ltd. In the year 1995, it was renamed as Bhartia\\nIndustries Limited. With effect from 25th October, 2007, the name was\\nagain changed to BCH Electric Limited, the present defendant herein.\\n16.   From the year of its incorporation, defendant entered into various\\nagreements with plaintiffs‟ predecessor-in-interest and title, Cutler-Hammer\\nInc. to flourish Cutler-Hammer Inc.‟s business in India. These agreement\\nincluded „Sales Agreement‟ and „License and Technical Service Agreement‟\\ndated 3rd June, 1974 whereby defendant has accepted the ownership of the\\nCutler-Hammer Inc. over the trademarks/trade names and further agreed to\\nnot to do anything which will impair Cutler-Hammer Inc.‟s ownership\\nover these trademarks/trade names.\\n17.   In the year 1979, Cutler-Hammer Inc. entered into trading name\\nagreement with Bhartia Cutler-Hammer Limited (now defendant) whereby\\ndefendant was granted the right to use the words CUTLER-HAMMER as\\npart of the corporate title by Cutler-Hammer Inc.      The said agreement\\nallowed defendant to use the words \"Cutler-Hammer\" as part of their\\ncorporate title in a limited way/manner and in connection with goods\\nmanufactured under the license from Cutler-Hammer Inc. The agreement\\nspecifically mentions that Cutler-Hammer Inc. is the owner of the words\\n\\n\\n\\nCS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012                        Page 6 of 72\\n \"CUTLER-HAMMER\" when used as a registered or unregistered\\ntrademark, corporate title or trading style in the field of activity in which\\nparties are engaged.\\n18.       On 19th February, 1979, a registered user agreement was executed\\nbetween Bhartia Cutler-Hammer Limited (now defendant) and Cutler-\\nHammer Inc. whereby defendant was granted non-exclusive right to use the\\nfollowing registered trademarks:\\n19.       Defendant was allowed to use the trademark \"CUTLER-HAMMER\"\\nunder No.164435 in conjunction with the word Bhartia. Whereas the other\\ntwo trademarks were allowed to be used along with the legend \"Made in\\nIndia by Bhartia Cutler-Hammer Limited, a wholly Indian owned Licensee\\nof Cutler-Hammer, Inc. U.S.A.\\n20.       In the User Agreement, defendant acknowledged and admitted the\\nCutler-Hammer Inc.‟s title and proprietorship in the trademarks \"CUTLER-\\nHAMMER, CH & CH Control\". The agreement clearly mentions in clause\\n7 that:\\n       The duration of the abovementioned agreement was for seven years\\nwhich had expired in the year 1986.\\n21.   The plaintiffs have set up their case against the defendant by making\\nvarious allegations that the defendant is deliberately, fraudulently and with\\nmalafide intentions of trading upon the reputation and goodwill attached to\\nplaintiff‟s trademark CUTLER-HAMMER, CH Control & CH (label), is\\nusing it without obtaining any consent, permission or valid license.\\n      The dishonest and malafide intentions of defendant are apparent from\\nthe fact that despite being aware of the reputation of plaintiff‟s trademark\\n\"CH (label)\" worldwide including India and proprietorship of plaintiff No.1\\nover the trademark \"CH Control\" under No.205632 in Class 9 since 3rd\\nNovember, 1975 in accordance with the provisions of Trade and\\nMerchandise Marks Act, 1958 and having admitted rights of plaintiff no.1 in\\nthe Registered User Agreement, defendant applied for registration of the\\nidentical/deceptively similar trademark under No.582999 in Class 9 in the\\nyear 1992 and obtained registration thereof by playing fraud on the registry\\nand making false claim of proprietorship and user thereof.\\n22.   It is alleged in the plaint that the defendant taking advantage of this\\nsituation filed an application under No.582999 for registration of the\\ntrademark \"CH Control\" through the same service provider. The defendant\\nhas obtained the registration of the said mark wrongfully and in bad faith by\\ncommitting fraud over the Registry.\\n23.   It is also alleged against the defendant that by committing fraud,\\ndefendant applied for registration of the identical/deceptively similar\\ntrademark \"CUTLER-HAMMER (Device)\" under No.1189782 in Class 9 in\\nthe year 2003. The plaintiff No.1 filed notice of opposition opposing\\n\\n\\nCS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012                          Page 8 of 72\\n registration of the impugned mark subject matter of Application No.1189782\\non/or around 23rd June 2004 with the Registrar of Trade Marks at New\\nDelhi.     The said opposition proceedings initiated by the plaintiffs are\\npending.\\n24.      In the year 2007, defendant made another attempt to register identical\\nand/or deceptively similar trademark \"BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER\\n(Label)\" under application No.1562940 in Class 9 and the same is pending\\nas objected by the plaintiffs.\\n25.      It is submitted that defendant was aware of the reputation and\\nproprietorship of plaintiff No.1 over trademarks \"CUTLER-HAMMER\",\\n\"CH Control\" and \"CH\" in respect of the goods of its manufacture and sale\\nprior to its incorporation and has adopted and used the identical and/or\\ndeceptively similar trademarks with dishonest and malafide intentions to\\ntrade upon the reputation and goodwill of plaintiffs and to earn profits in an\\nillegal manner. By committing such acts, defendant has not only infringed\\nplaintiff‟s proprietary rights vested in their registered trademark \"CUTLER-\\nHAMMER\" and other abovementioned trademarks but also committed acts\\nof passing off their inferior quality goods and business as and for the\\nquality products and business of plaintiff. The defendant has no plausible\\nreason to choose identical/deceptively similar marks CUTLER-HAMMER,\\nBHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER, CH (logo) and/or CH Control as a trade\\nmark for their products.\\n26.      The defendant‟s products are bound to be falsely associated being part\\nof range of products of the plaintiff. The use of identical and/or deceptively\\nsimilar trademarks CUTLER-HAMMER, BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER,\\nCH (logo) and/or CH Control on the part of the defendant is unlawful and\\n\\n\\n\\nCS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012                           Page 9 of 72\\n constitutes violation of the plaintiff‟s rights as are protected under the\\nprovision of Section 29 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 and under the\\ncommon law.\\n27.     On 19th December, 2011, plaintiffs published a caution notice\\nannouncing their statutory rights over the trademark \"CUTLER-HAMMER\"\\nin Class 9 since the year 1954.           In response to the caution notice, the\\ndefendant through their counsel sent a reply to the caution notice via email\\nand registered post on 22nd December, 2011. By way of the said reply,\\ndefendant claimed proprietary rights in the trademark BHARTIA CUTLER-\\nHAMMER and CH Control. By way of the said reply; plaintiff came to\\nknow that defendant has also applied for registration of trademark\\n\"BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER\" under No.1562940 in Class 9. It was\\nrevealed by the plaintiffs from the website of Registrar of Trademarks about\\nthe filing of application for registrations of the same very trademarks which\\nwere earlier used by the defendant under permissive use of the trademarks\\nbelonging to the plaintiffs.\\n28.     The plaintiffs, thereafter, have filed the suit for permanent injunction\\nrestraining infringement of trademarks, passing of, unfair competition and\\nrenditions of accounts and damages against the defendant. Along with suit,\\nthe plaintiffs also filed an application being I.A. No.1204/2012 under\\nOrder XXXIX, Rules 1 & 2 CPC for grant of interim injunction against the\\ndefendant from using the trade marks CUTLER-HAMMER and CH in any\\nmanner by the defendant by passing off their goods as that of the plaintiffs.\\nThe abovementioned suit was filed in the month of January, 2012. The\\ndefendant filed its written statement and reply in the month of February,\\n2012.\\n 29.   The defendant also filed suit against the plaintiffs being CS(OS)\\nNo.575/2012 in the month of March, 2012 along with interim application\\nbeing I.A. No.4318/2012 seeking injunction against the plaintiffs for\\nissuance of groundless threats to the dealers of the defendants.\\n30.   Both sides have made their submissions in their respective interim\\napplications. As the facts in both matters are common, therefore, by this\\ncommon order, the pending two interim applications are being decided by\\nthe single order.\\n31.   Various defences have been raised by the defendant in its written\\nstatement and reply to the interim application filed by the plaintiffs.\\nMr.Sandeep Sethi, learned Senior counsel appearing on behalf of defendant\\nhas made his submission that no case of infringement of trademarks has\\nbeen made out by the plaintiffs against his client as plaintiff No.1 has not\\nacquired any rights in the mark CUTLER-HAMMER under No.164435\\nwhich was in the name of Cutler-Hammer, Inc. The said registration is not\\nvalid. The defendant‟s application for rectification/removal/cancellation of\\nthe mark is pending with the Trade Marks Registry. The trade mark\\nCUTLER-HAMMER is not being used by plaintiffs in India; abandoned by\\nplaintiffs and, therefore, no goodwill/reputation vests in the said marks in\\nfavour of plaintiffs. The trade mark CUTLER-HAMMER is associated in\\nIndia with defendant and its products/business.\\n      The trade mark              (CH being the abbreviation of CUTLER-\\nHAMMER) is registered under No.582999 in Class 9 in the name of\\ndefendant since the year 1992.        Therefore, the plaintiffs have failed to\\nestablish even prima facie case of infringement of trademarks.\\n 32.   The second submission of Mr.Sethi is that the plaintiffs have also\\nfailed to make out any case of passing off as the plaintiffs are not using the\\n\\n\\nmarks CUTLER-HAMMER,                      ,     ,     ,          and/or variants\\nthereof in relation to their business/products in India. No products of\\nplaintiffs bearing any of the aforesaid trademarks are available for sale in\\nIndia. The aforesaid marks have been abandoned by plaintiffs. In fact, no\\nproducts bearing the said marks have been produced/filed in the Court.\\nThere is no goodwill/reputation vested in favour of plaintiffs in the said\\nmarks.\\nsaid products and are distinctive of its products/business by virtue of\\ncontinuous and extensive use for several decades. There is no evidence of\\nconfusion and deception placed by the plaintiffs on record. There is no\\nlikelihood of confusion/deception as plaintiffs‟ products bearing the said\\nmarks are not available in India. Therefore, no damage would be caused to\\nplaintiffs on account of use of the said marks by defendant. On the contrary,\\ndefendant will suffer irreparable loss, damage and injury, if plaintiffs\\ncommence use of the said marks in India. Rather the plaintiffs have\\nabandoned their trademarks in India who themselves have allowed removal\\nof their following trade marks in India and other countries as admitted by the\\nplaintiffs in their rejoinder due to non-payment of their renewal fee and have\\nnot taken any steps for restoration. The details are as under:\\n      (Hereinafter the abovementioned logos or variant thereof would\\n      be referred as \"CH\" logo, and logo of CUTLER-HAMMER as\\n      \"CUTLER-HAMMER\")\\n\\n33.   Despite having incorporated a subsidiary in India i.e. plaintiff No.2 as\\nfar back as in the year 1996, plaintiff No.1 has not used the said marks in\\nrespect of its products/business and neither raised any objection against\\ndefendant‟s activities in India. Plaintiffs‟ products available in India do not\\ndepict/bear the trade marks „CUTLER-HAMMER‟ or „CH‟ or variants\\nthereof. Products purchased by defendant on 22nd, December, 2011 which\\ndoes not show use of the said marks. The invoice raised in respect of the\\nsaid products also does- not show use of the marks. Plaintiffs have filed few\\npurchase orders of 2009, 2010 and 2011 however, the same do not show any\\nactual sale of the products in India under the mark CUTLER-HAMMER.\\nFurther, plaintiffs have relied on a catalogue of 2001 pertaining to Canada to\\ncorrelate the product codes. No document has been placed on record by the\\n\\n\\n\\nCS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012                           Page 13 of 72\\n plaintiffs establishing use of the marks in question post 1986, thereby\\nconfirming that plaintiff No.1 lost interest/rights in the marks CUTLER-\\nHAMMER, CH post 1986 and have commenced use only recently so as to\\nride on the goodwill and reputation vesting in the defendant‟s marks.\\n34.   The sales figures provided by plaintiffs for the years 2008-2011 in\\nrespect of their products are vague, misleading, unsubstantiated and scanty\\ninasmuch as the same are neither indicative of sales in India nor discloses\\nuse of these trademarks. The sales figures of Rs.35 lac, which at any rate are\\nvague, unsubstainated and denied, provided by plaintiffs towards sale of\\nproducts in the year 2008 bearing the marks in question are no match to the\\nsales generated by defendant in the year 2008 i.e. `1,94,82,68,813/-.\\n35.   No document including promotional materials/advertisements has\\nbeen placed on record by the plaintiffs establishing use of the marks in\\nquestion post 1986. The Caution Notice published by the plaintiffs on\\n19th December, 2011 in the daily, „The Times of India‟ was confined to the\\ntrade mark CUTLER-HAMMER and there was no whisper of the marks CH\\nand/or variants thereof.\\n36.   Nothing on record to show that the Registered User Agreement dated\\n19th February, 1979 was recorded with the Trade Marks Registry as per\\nSection 48 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958, thus, it does not\\nlie in the mouth of the plaintiffs to say that „use‟ would accrue to the\\nplaintiffs for the period 1979-1986.\\n37.   It is also argued by Mr.Sethi that the present action of the plaintiffs\\nsuffers from long delay, laches, acquiesces and waiver on the part of\\nplaintiffs. Therefore, the plaintiffs are entitled for the discretionary relief of\\ninjunction.\\n         It is admitted by the defendants that after the expiry of the\\nRegistered User Agreement in 1986, defendant continued to use, inter alia,\\nthe trademarks BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER, CUTLER-HAMMER, CH\\nwith the full knowledge, consent and encouragement of Plaintiff No.1 by\\nway of addressing letters by the plaintiffs themselves and various meetings\\nand discussions between the parties at least for the last 25 years.\\n38.     Certain following illustrative instances have been given by the\\ndefendant in order to show the knowledge of the plaintiffs about the\\ncontinuous user of trademarks in question:\\ni)      Plaintiffs have admitted to the fact that the letters exchanged between\\nPlaintiff No.1 and Defendant reflected Defendant‟s use of the trade marks\\nBHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER, CUTLER-HAMMER, CH on the letter\\nhead.\\nii)     Plaintiff No.1 had entered into Sales Agreements on 13th July, 1988\\nand 4th September, 1990 with defendant‟s affiliate viz. Bhartia International\\nPrivate Limited (which later merged into defendant); License and Technical\\nService Agreements dated 10th April, 1990 and 11th December, 1992 with\\ndefendant and Export Agreement dated March 16, 1994 between plaintiff\\nNo.1 and defendant.\\niii)    Plaintiff No.1 and Defendant exchanged various correspondences and\\nvisited each other‟s offices/factories in India and the USA in connection\\nwith business as well as to explore new business opportunities. The letters\\naddressed by defendant clearly reflected use of the trade marks BHARTIA\\nCUTLER-HAMMER, CUTLER-HAMMER, CH on the letterhead. The\\nproduct brochure forwarded to plaintiff No.1 also bore the trademarks/\\nnames BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER and CH of the defendant. The\\n\\n\\nCS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012                           Page 15 of 72\\n representatives of plaintiffs who visited the office/factory of defendant could\\nnot have missed defendant‟s use of the said marks.\\n39.    Plaintiffs\\' Indirect Knowledge\\n\\ni)     When the plaintiff No.1 had filed fresh application seeking\\nregistration of the mark „CUTLER-HAMMER‟ under No.642706 on 11th\\nOctober, 1994, the Examination Report issued by the Trade Marks Registry\\non 22nd October, 1999 cited defendant‟s prior mark „CUTLER-HAMMER‟\\nunder No.582999 against plaintiffs‟ application. There was opposition from\\nthe plaintiffs‟ side.\\nii)    Mr.Jamshed Khurram, Director - Sales & Marketing PD, South Asia\\nof plaintiff No.2 and Mr.Ajay Jain, President of plaintiff No.1‟s affiliate\\ncompany Moeller HPL India Private Limited were employees of the\\ndefendant during 2004-2005 and 2001-2005 as Business Manager (OEM)\\nand General Manager (Sales and Marketing) respectively.\\niii)   Plaintiff No.2 was incorporated on 1st March, 1996 and has an office\\nat Delhi. Defendant also has an office at Delhi. The Directors and other\\nsenior employees of Plaintiff No.2 have been in constant touch with\\nDefendant and have visited its offices.\\niv)    Being in the same line of business, Plaintiff No.2 is deemed to have\\nbeen aware of Defendant‟s business/products bearing the marks, BHARTIA\\nCUTLER-HAMMER, CUTLER- HAMMER and CH. Defendant has been\\ncontinuously and extensively using the marks, BHARTIA CUTLER-\\nHAMMER, CUTLER-HAMMER and CH in respect of its products/business\\nfor nearly half a century and products bearing the said marks are available\\nin every nook and corner of the country. Therefore, the plaintiffs/their\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012                          Page 16 of 72\\n predecessor had waived their rights, if at all, in the trade marks CUTLER-\\nHAMMER, CH and variants thereof.\\n         It is not open now for the plaintiffs to exit from India and then return\\nafter lapse of a few decades and seek to restrain the defendant, an Indian\\ncompany, which has, in the meantime, established a goodwill/reputation in\\nits favour. Upon realizing the magnitude of defendant‟s business and its\\nreputation in the market vis-à-vis plaintiffs‟ failure to gain market share in\\nIndia, they are now attempting to usurp defendant‟s business/trade marks in\\nIndia.\\n40.      Mr.Sethi argued that law assists those who are vigilant about their\\nrights and not those who sleep over their rights - Vigilantibus Non\\nDormientibus Acquitas Subveniunt\\'. Plaintiffs are, therefore, estopped, both\\nin law and equity from asserting rights over the statutory and proprietary\\nrights of Defendant in the marks, BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER,\\nCUTLER-HAMMER and CH.\\n41.      It is also challenged by the defendant that the plaintiff No.1 has\\nacquired the company Cutler-Hammer, Inc. in the year 1978, as it is the\\nadmitted position that the plaintiffs have made the application on 28th\\nNovember, 1979 on Form TM-24 for recordal of change in ownership in the\\nTrade Marks Registry, Kolkata. Pursuant to the said request and order\\nthereon dated January 23, 1980, Plaintiff No.1 was registered as subsequent\\nproprietor of the mark CUTLER-HAMMER by virtue of Certificate of\\nmerger. Plaintiffs have not filed any documents to show that the said\\nregistration and/or any other marks were part of the merger.\\n         On 31st May, 2010, plaintiff No.1 also filed a request on Form TM- 33\\n(for recordal of change of name) with the Registry indicating that Cutler-\\n Hammer, Inc. is the subsequent proprietor of the said mark and that „Cutler-\\nHammer, Inc.‟ has, by virtue of Certificate of Amendment of Certificate of\\nIncorporation dated 20th August, 2003, changed its name to „Eaton\\nElectrical, Inc.‟ After raising objection by the defendant on 28th April, 2012,\\nplaintiffs vide letter dated 2nd May, 2012 filed a request with the Trade\\nMarks Registry, Mumbai withdrawing the said request. In the said letter,\\nplaintiffs for the first time disclosed that there are two, Cutler-Hammer Inc.\\n\\n      In view of above, the plaintiffs herein have no locus to seek an\\ninjunction against the defendant.\\n42.   It is also alleged by the defendant that the balance of convenience\\nexists in favour of defendant, as the defendant is a leading manufacturer and\\ndistributor of premium low voltage electrical and electronics products in\\nIndia. The defendant presently employs approximately 1800 personnel and\\n150 engineers including a strong R&D department. It has over 30 sales\\noffices with numerous „Resident Engineer‟ locations strategically spread all\\nover India and over 500 dealers and thousands of sub-dealer network to\\nbetter serve its customers. The defendant‟s products are exported to over 25\\ncountries, either directly, or through authorized distributors in jurisdictions\\nsuch as Europe, Far East, Middle East, Africa and South-East Asia. In fact,\\non account of extensive and continuous use of the trade marks by the\\ndefendant in respect of its products/business for over 25 years, a prima facie\\ncase exists in favour of the defendant and against the plaintiffs.\\n      The following judgments are referred by the defendant in support of\\nits submissions:\\n43.   The defendant in its case is seeking, inter alia, an injunction against\\nplaintiffs from extending threats to its affiliates, customers, distributors,\\ndealers, agents etc., as plaintiffs are wrongly claiming rights in the marks\\n„CUTLER-HAMMER‟ and CH and issuing threats to defendant‟s dealers,\\ndistributors and agents thereby hampering its business and creating\\nconfusion in the minds of the discerning members and also by issuing\\npublication of the Caution Notice for the mark „CUTLER-HAMMER‟. On\\n6th January, 2012, plaintiff No.1, through its lawyers, addressed a „cease and\\ndesist‟ letter to defendant calling upon it to refrain from using the marks\\nCUTLER-HAMMER and „CH‟ (label) and/or any deceptive variation/s\\nthereof and termed its products as „counterfeit‟.\\n44.   The defendant is the proprietor of the trade mark „CUTLER-\\nHAMMER‟ registered in Class 9, registration of which dates back to 14th\\nOctober, 1992. Plaintiffs‟ use of the mark „CUTLER-HAMMER‟ which is\\nidentical/deceptively similar to defendant‟s registered trade mark „CUTLER-\\nHAMMER‟ in relation to identical goods/products is tantamount to\\ninfringement of defendant‟s statutory rights vesting in its registered and\\nreputed trade mark „CUTLER-HAMMER‟. Goodwill and reputation\\nsubsisting    in   defendant‟s     trademarks/logos,   CUTLER-HAMMER,\\nBHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER and CH any use of the said marks and/or\\ndeceptive variations thereof would mislead and deceive the public/\\nconsumers into believing that plaintiffs‟ business/products originate from\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012                         Page 20 of 72\\n defendant. Thus, plaintiffs are guilty of passing off as plaintiffs are\\nintentionally and blatantly violating defendant‟s rights in the aforesaid\\ntrademarks and a case of misappropriation leading to deception amongst the\\nmembers of trade and public is clearly made out against plaintiffs.\\n      The balance of convenience exists in favour of defendant, as due to\\nlong, continuous and extensive use of the marks/logos, BHARTIA\\nCUTLER-HAMMER, CUTLER-HAMMER and CH in India for the last\\nseveral decades, the same are well-known and deserve protection. On the\\nother hand, the plaintiffs have recently commenced use of „CUTLER-\\nHAMMER‟ who had earlier abandoned the marks „CUTLER-HAMMER‟\\nand CH and variants thereof in India as well as internationally, thus they\\nhave no authority/justification to assert rights over the same. Use of the\\naforesaid mark by plaintiffs is with the sole intention of riding upon\\ndefendant‟s fame and goodwill garnered over the years.\\n45.   An irreparable harm and injury is being suffered by defendant by\\nvirtue of (i) publication of Caution Notice by plaintiff No.1 claiming\\nexclusivity over the mark CUTLER-HAMMER; (ii) issuance of threats to\\nPlaintiff/its dealers/distributors; and (iii) plaintiffs‟ recent commencement of\\nuse of the mark „CUTLER-HAMMER‟ which is identical/deceptively\\nsimilar to defendant‟s registered and well-known trademarks, BHARTIA\\nCUTLER-HAMMER, CUTLER-HAMMER and CH. Plaintiffs being in the\\nsame trade and business as defendant, it will cause irreversible damage to\\nthe goodwill, fair name, reputation and integrity of defendant, its businesses\\nand the much renowned and well-known trademarks/logos BHARTIA\\nCUTLER-HAMMER, CUTLER-HAMMER and CH.\\n46.   In case, pleadings of both the parties are read, it is not disputed by the\\ndefendant that trademarks CUTLER-HAMMER and the device CH are well\\n\\n\\nCS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012                           Page 21 of 72\\n known trademarks, there would be confusion and deception if both the\\nparties are allowed to use the same trademarks. The defendant has also not\\ndisputed the facts that two sets of trademarks are same and are being used by\\nboth parties in relation to same product. The defendant has also not denied\\nthat the defendant entered into an agreement „Registered User Agreement‟\\nbearing the said trademarks and the defendant has filed the applications for\\nregistrations of the same very trademarks which were earlier being used as a\\npermissive-use under the licence agreements. The plaintiffs‟ oppositions to\\nthe various applications for registration filed by the defendant are pending.\\nThe main case of the defendant is that after breaking relation between the\\nparties, the defendant has been using the same very trademarks for the last\\n25 years within the knowledge of the plaintiffs. The defendant has acquired\\nunique and independent goodwill and reputation of trademarks in India and\\nabroad. The plaintiffs on the other hand abandoned their trademarks as\\nsome of trademarks are not renewed. The plaintiffs have not been using the\\ntrademarks in India and other parts of the world. The defendant is the\\nregistered proprietor of trade mark logo of CH in Class 9 as on 14 th October,\\n1992. The plaintiffs are unnecessary harassing the defendant by extending\\ntheir threats by various ways. Therefore, the plaintiffs are not only entitled\\nfor injunction prayed for rather they should be restrained from extending\\ntheir threat as prayed in the application for injunction filed by the defendant.\\n47.   In order to decide these two applications, the following issues are to\\nbe considered by the Court:\\n48.   Some relevant dates and events are necessary to mention here in order\\nto deal with the submissions of the parties. As per the case of the plaintiff\\nCutler-Hammer Mfg.

The plaintiffs‟ case now rest on:\\n52.      From the pending applications filed by the defendant as well as\\nregistrations, it appears that the defendant has claimed its own user of the\\ntrademarks also for the period when the defendant was using the trademarks\\nas permissive user as a licensee of the plaintiffs.\\n53.      Although the defendant‟s case in the written statement is also that\\nafter expiry of user agreement, the defendant continued to use the marks\\nwith the knowledge of the plaintiffs at least for the last 25 years.\\n 54.          These two versions of the defendant are clearly contrary to each other.\\n55.          From the material placed on record, it reveals that the plaintiffs are\\nprior adopter and user of trademarks than the alleged user claimed by the\\ndefendant in the world market including India as the plaintiff No.1\\n(including its predecessor) is the prior adopter and user of the\\ntrademark(s) CUTLER-HAMMER and CH worldwide including India.\\nThe details are given as below:-\\n56.          Plaintiffs‟ trademarks were registered prior in point of time to the user\\nclaim by the defendant in its trade marks application as the plaintiff‟s\\ntrademark CUTLER-HAMMER bearing No.164435 in Class 09 is\\nregistered since 8th June, 1954 when the defendant company was not even in\\nexistence.\\n57.          The plaintiffs‟ trademark CH bearing application No.164434 in\\nClass 09 was registered since 8th June, 1954.                Further, the plaintiff‟s\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012                                 Page 31 of 72\\n trademark CH bearing application No.205632 in Class 09 was registered\\nsince 3rd November, 1961. However, the said registrations were removed for\\nnon-payment of renewal fee due for period 1989 - 1996.\\n58.     Legal Proceeding Certificates, i.e. certified copies of registrations\\nreveal that the plaintiff No.1 is the subsequent registered proprietor of the\\ntrademark cutler-hammer bearing No.164435 in Class 09. The said\\ntrademark was initially registered in the name of CUTLER-HAMMER, INC.\\nIn the year 1979, CUTLER-HAMMER, INC. merged with and into Plaintiff\\nno.1. Therefore, pursuant to request on form TM-24 dated 28th November,\\n1979 by erstwhile agents Remfry & Son (now Remfry & Sagar) and order\\nthereon dated 23rd January, 1980, Eaton Corporation (Plaintiff No.1) became\\nthe subsequent registered proprietor as from 30th March, 1979 by virtue of\\nCertificate of Merger.\\n59.     Defendant‟s objections that the plaintiff No.1 has not acquired any\\nrights in the trademark CUTLER-HAMMER under No.164435 is without\\nany substance on account of following reasons:\\n        It is informed by Mr.Sudhir Chandra, learned Senior counsel that the\\nsaid request for recordal of plaintiff No.1 as subsequent registered proprietor\\nof the trademark CUTLER-HAMMER in application No.164435 was filed\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012                          Page 32 of 72\\n by Remfry & Sagar who are now counsel for defendant. It is not open for\\ncounsel for defendant to now challenge the said order of the Registrar which\\nwas passed on the basis of request made through them and on their\\ndeclaration made in form TM-24 dated 28th November, 1979, as law does\\nnot permit a person to both approbate and reprobate. This principle is based\\non the doctrine of election which postulates that no party can accept and\\nreject the same instrument and that \"a person cannot say at one time that a\\ntransaction is valid and thereby obtain some advantage, to which he could\\nonly be entitled on the footing that it is valid, and then turn round and say it\\nis void for the purpose of securing some other advantage\".

The following documents are referred by the plaintiffs to show prima\\nfacie evidence of use of trademarks by the plaintiffs in India:\\n62.      It is not denied by the defendant about the execution of Registered\\nUser Agreement dated 19th February, 1979 and its pleadings. The record\\nalso reveals that an application in the prescribed manner was filed in the\\nTrademark Registry. However, there is no evidence on record to show\\nwhether the said application for registration of Registered User Agreement\\nwas accepted or not.\\n         It is argued by Mr.Sudhir Chandra that since the plaintiff No.1\\ncompany had a base in USA, therefore, defendant (which is an Indian\\nCompany) was to complete all the legal formalities of registration of\\nRegistered User Agreement at the Trade Marks Office through the\\ntrademark agent Remfry & Sons (now Remfry & Sagar). Entire\\ndocumentation (Form TM-28, TM-48 and Affidavit to that effect) required\\nto register the Registered User Agreement dated 19th February, 1979 was\\nduly completed by plaintiff no.1 as well as defendant.\\n         Both, Cutler-Hammer, Inc. and defendant authorized Remfry & Sons\\n(now Remfry & Sagar) to act as an agent for entering Bhartia Cutler-\\nHammer Limited as a Registered User. Further, the filing and registration of\\nthe Registered User Agreement was left to defendant. As M/s. Ramfry and\\nSagar is now appearing as attorney on behalf of the defendant they may be\\nin better position to inform the Court about its outcome.        However, at\\npresent, it is immaterial if the application for user agreement is not accepted\\nor not as the defendant has admitted the factum of user agreement between\\n\\n\\n\\nCS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012                          Page 38 of 72\\n the parties.

It is not a case of the defendant that they were not aware of\\nproprietorship of plaintiffs over the trademarks in question. Despite\\nacknowledging and admitting the proprietary rights of plaintiffs in the\\ntrademark CH and further expressly agreeing not to apply for registration of\\nthe said marks in various agreements executed between the parties, the\\ndefendant dishonestly adopted the impugned mark CUTLER HAMMER and\\napplied for registration thereof in the year 1992 under No.582999. The same\\nis registered by committing fraud on the Registry and making false claim of\\nproprietorship and user thereof. The rectification for removal of impugned\\ntrademark from the Register is filed by plaintiff No.1 on 20th July, 2012 and\\nthe same is admitted by Intellectual Property Appellate Board and numbered\\nas ORA/269/2012/TM.DEL. Defendant had no plausible explanation/\\njustification to adopt the marks, CUTLER-HAMMER, BHARTIA\\nCUTLER-HAMMER and CH and/or variants thereof. Even after obtaining\\nregistration of the mark \"CH (logo)\" with the word CONTROL, the\\ndefendant was using the mark CH without using the word CONTROL below\\nthe logo as appeared from registration obtained by the defendant who has\\n\\nalso applied for registration of trademark         in various Classes which\\nis similar to plaintiffs‟ trademark CH.\\n66.   Despite acknowledging and admitting the proprietary rights of\\nplaintiffs over the trademark CUTLER HAMMER and further expressly\\nagreeing not to apply for registration of the said mark in various agreements\\nexecuted between the parties, the defendant dishonestly adopted the\\nimpugned mark CUTLER HAMMER and applied for registration thereof in\\n\\n\\n\\nCS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012                        Page 48 of 72\\n the year 2003. The plaintiff no.1 filed notice of opposition opposing\\nregistration of the impugned mark subject matter of Application No.1189782\\non/or around 23rd June, 2004 with the Registrar of Trade Marks at New\\nDelhi. The said opposition proceedings are pending.\\n      In the year 2007, defendant made another severe attempt to register\\nidentical and/or deceptively similar trademark(s) BHARTIA CUTLER-\\nHAMMER, CUTLER HAMMER and CH and silently filed 21 applications\\nin various Classes with an intention to obtain proprietary rights over the said\\nimpugned marks which are identical/ deceptively similar to plaintiff‟s\\ntrademarks in disguise. The said applications are pending for registration.\\nSurprisingly, out of 21 applications filed in the year 2007, only one\\napplication for registration of trademark CUTLER HAMMER is in relation\\nto goods of defendant‟s manufacture and sale that is Class 09. Rest of the\\napplications is filed in respect of goods/ services not related to defendant‟s\\nbusiness.\\n67.   As per Clause III of Sales Agreement 1977-1988 the defendant agreed\\nnot to claim its rights of ownership in trademarks and trademarks which are\\nproperty of the plaintiffs and the defendant will not impair plaintiffs‟\\nownership of such trademarks and will not use to indicate in anyway that the\\ndefendant is part of the plaintiffs. Similarly, in the License And Technical\\nService Agreement as per 7.7 of the Agreement, it was agreed that the\\nlicensee shall not apply or obtain registration of any trademarks and shall not\\nchallenge the validity or contest the right of the proprietor and in the user\\nagreement between 1979-1986 in Clause 7 the defendant recognized the\\nright the trademarks of the owner and the defendant shall not acquire and\\nshall not claim any title to the said trademarks by virtue of the licence\\n\\n\\n\\nCS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012                          Page 49 of 72\\n granted to the defendant and user shall at all times have the benefit of the\\ntrademark owner.\\n68.   However, the defendant despite of abovementioned stipulations which\\nare of the binding clauses has acted absolutely opposite to the agreements\\nintentionally and deliberately as appeared from its acts and deeds. The\\ndetails of wrongful act of the defendant are given as under:-\\n69.   A mere justification is not enough that as the plaintiffs have not used\\nthe trademarks in India, the defendant is entitled to use the same trademarks\\n\\n\\nCS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012                              Page 50 of 72\\n who can also claim proprietary rights independently as there is delay on the\\npart of the plaintiffs.\\n70.    It is necessary here to discuss the similar aspect which has been dealt\\nwith by the Division Bench of this Court and the Supreme Court who have\\nrejected the similar submissions of the defendant in same situation. The\\njudgments are as follow:-\\n71.    Transborder Reputation\\n\\n(i)    In the case of N.R. Dongre v. Whirlpool Corporation, 1996 (16) PTC\\n585, the appellants got registered the mark \"Whirlpool\" in respect of\\nwashing machines. The Whirlpool Corporation filed a suit for passing off\\naction brought by the respondents to restrain the appellants from\\n\\n\\nCS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012                            Page 51 of 72\\n manufacturing, selling, advertising or in any way using the trade mark\\n\"Whirlpool\" of their product. It was held that the passing off an action was\\nmaintainable in law even against the registered owner of the trademark. It\\nwas held that the name of \"Whirlpool\" was associated for long with the\\nWhirlpool Corporation and that its trans-border reputation extended to India.\\nIt was held that the mark \"Whirlpool\" gave an indication of the origin of the\\ngoods as emanating from or relating to the Whirlpool Corporation. It was\\nheld that an injunction was a relief in equity and was based on equitable\\nprinciples. It was held that the equity required that an injunction be granted\\nin favour of the Whirlpool Corporation. It was held that the refusal of an\\ninjunction could cause irreparable injury to the reputation of the Whirlpool\\nCorporation, whereas grant of an injunction would cause no significant\\ninjury to the appellants who could sell their washing machines merely by\\nremoving a small label bearing the name \"Whirlpool\".\\n(ii)   In the case of Milment Oftho Industries & Ors. Vs. Allergan Inc,\\n2004 (28) PTC 585 (SC), the Apex Court in para 9 and 10 of the judgment\\nheld as under:\\n(iii)   Yet in another landmark judgment by the Supreme Court in the case\\nof Baker Hughes Ltd. & Anr. Vs. Hiroo Khushlani & Anr., 2004 (29) PTC\\n153 (SC) dealt with the same aspect and held as under in paras 3 to 6:\\n(iv)   In the case of Daimler Benz Aktiegesellschaft and Another Vs. Hybo\\nHindustan, AIR 1994 Delhi 239, a learned Single Judge of this Court, while\\ncommenting upon the trans-border reputation of trade name „Benz‟, held as\\nfollows:\\n(v)    In Apple Computer Inc. Vs. Apple Leasing and Industries, (I.A.\\nNo.7678 of 1989 in Suit No.2751 of 1989, decided on May 10, 1991) it\\nwas held by this Court that in order to prove a prima facie case for grant of\\ninterim injunction it was not necessary for the plaintiff in a passing off\\naction to prove that it was carrying on business in India. For the grant of\\ninterim injunction it was enough that the plaintiff had a reputation in India.\\nIn that case the principle laid down in Budweiser\\'s case (1984) FSR 413,\\nnamely, that unless there was a business activity in the place where passing\\noff was alleged to have taken place, action for passing off could not be\\nmaintained, was departed from. It was also recognised that there was a\\nstrong trend to prevent deception of the public, whether it was deliberate or\\ninnocent. This principle is more relevant to India because there is a greater\\nneed to catch up with the more advanced countries in the matter of\\nbusiness enterprises including manufacture of products and services. This\\n\\n\\n\\nCS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012                           Page 56 of 72\\n can only be possible when a foreign trader has the confidence that its trade\\nmark/name will be safe and will not be imitated. Transfer of technology\\nand collaboration will get a big boost if unfair competition is avoided and\\nnobody is allowed to thrive at somebody else\\'s reputation and goodwill.\\n(vi)   The Madras High Court in Haw Par Bros. International Ltd. Vs.\\nTiger Balm Co. (P) Ltd. and Others, 1996 PTC (16) (DB) 311, on review\\nof several decisions of the various Courts agreed with the view taken by\\nthis Court on the question of trans-border reputation. In Kamal Trading\\nCo. Vs. Gillette UK Ltd., Middle Sex, England, (1988) 1 P L R 135, the\\nprinciple laid down by the Budweiser\\'s case was not accepted by a\\nDivision Bench of the Bombay High Court. The Bombay High Court\\nexpressing its view held as follows:\\n Plea of defendant, delay, latches, waiver and acquiesces on part of the\\nplaintiff in bringing the suit for infringement/passing off\\n\\n72.   It is not denied by the defendant that the plaintiffs (including its\\npredecessor) had a business relationship with Defendant since its\\nincorporation in the year 1965. The plaintiffs and their predecessor entered\\ninto several agreements with the defendant whereby defendant was given\\nright to use plaintiffs‟ trademarks subject to certain conditions and\\nlimitations.\\n72.1 It is a matter of record that the last License and Technical Service\\nAgreement with defendant was executed on 11th December, 1992 and had a\\nterm of 8 years and expired in the year 2000. This implies that defendant had\\npermission to use the words CUTLER-HAMMER till the year 2000.\\n72.2 In the year 2004, plaintiff no.1 filed Notice of Opposition to\\ndefendant‟s application for registration of mark CUTLER-HAMMER\\nbearing No.1189782 in Class 09. On opposition being filed by the plaintiffs,\\ndefendant was put to notice in the year 2004 itself. Any use after the notice\\nbeing sent to defendant was at its own risk and consequence. Amar Singh\\nChawla vs. Rajdhani Roller Flour Mills Pvt. Ltd., 1990 PTC 220.\\n72.3 The plaintiff No.1 opposing registration of the mark CUTLER-\\nHAMMER (Device) subject matter of Application No.1189782, stopped\\nusing the impugned arrangement/marks openly. It was only in the year 2011\\nat Hanover Fair, Germany plaintiff found that the defendant\\'s goods were\\nbeing displayed in the fair under the trademark CUTLER-HAMMER\\n\\nand/or         .\\n72.4 Thereafter, Plaintiff approached a District Court, Braunschweig,\\n\\n\\n\\nCS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012                        Page 58 of 72\\n Germany and obtained a relief of temporary injunction on 7th April, 2011\\nagainst defendant restraining them to use the trademark CUTLER-\\nHAMMER and/or               .\\n72.5 Thereafter, the defendant vide its letter dated 23rd August, 2011 gave\\ndisclosure of information and indemnification of damages to avoid further\\nlitigation. Defendant vide its letter dated 23rd August, 2011 accepted the\\npreliminary injunction and admitted that the use of marks by them was an\\ninfringing act.\\n73.   It is the case of the plaintiffs that on 19 th December, 2011 the\\ndefendant‟s goods under the impugned marks BHARTIA CUTLER-\\nHAMMER and CH (logo) were discovered from the market against a cash\\nmemo. Plaintiffs also obtained the price list of defendant‟s products printed\\nin the year 2011 from one of their distributor and noticed that defendant\\ncontinued use of the impugned arrangement/ marks CUTLER-HAMMER,\\nBHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER and CH (logo) on their products. Caution\\nnotice was published by Plaintiff No.1 in respect of trademark CUTLER-\\nHAMMER. On 6th January, 2012, Cease & Desist notice was sent by\\nPlaintiff No.1 to Defendant. On 18th January, 2012, Plaintiff filed suit for\\ninfringement and passing off against defendant being CS(OS) No.156/2012.\\n74.   From the above, it is clear that there has been no acquiescence on part\\nof plaintiffs. As all agreements pertaining to trademark rights executed\\nbetween the parties had specific clauses pertaining to trademark rights which\\nspecify that:\\n75.   It is settled law that where there is fraud, there is no room for doctrine\\nof acquiescence to operate. The acquiescence cannot be inferred merely by\\nreason of the fact that the plaintiff has not taken any action against the\\ninfringement of its rights. Even if the defendant has been using both the\\ntrademarks from the period when the relation between the parties are broken.\\nIs it possible that the defendant would and could take any benefit out of it\\nknowing the said trademarks are belonging to the plaintiffs? Can the\\ndefendant in the facts of the present case is entitled to take the defence of\\nestoppel, acquiesces, delay, latches and abandonment of the same trade\\nmarks by the plaintiff?\\n76.   This aspect has been dealt with by the Division Bench of this Court in\\nthe case of Rob Mathys India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Synthes Ag Chur, 1997 (17)\\nPTC (DB) as under:\\nABANDONMENT OF TRADE MARK:\\n77.    Though, there is Section 102 of the Act relating to abandonment, it is\\n\\n\\nCS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012                           Page 62 of 72\\n confined to abandonment of an application for registration of Trade Mark\\nand it is not applicable to the present situation. Consequently, one has to\\nrevert back to common law rules.\\n      However, here, in view of the peculiar circumstances and non-user of\\nthe trade mark in India by the respondents and plaintiffs Nos. 1 and 2\\nthemselves, the question of abandonment is also required to be seen.\\n      Question of abandonment depends on determining the intention to be\\ninferred from the facts of each case. While a mere non-user for a few years\\nmay not amount to abandonment of a trademark if referable to accountable\\nfacts, a long unexplained non user may suggest an intention to abandon the\\nmark. (See Whirlpool Company & Anr. v. N.R. Dongre & Ors., 1995 (32)\\nDRJ 318).\\n      However, it may be mentioned that a Division Bench of Calcutta\\nHigh Court in J. N. Nicols (Vimto) Limited v. Rose & Thistle & Anr., AIR\\n1994 Calcutta 43 took the view that where an application for removal of\\nregistered trade mark was filed for non-user of the same for a long period,\\nthe defense of import ban as special circumstance for the said non-user\\ncannot be granted when other similar product was manufactured and freely\\nsold during that period in spite of the import restriction. Hence the onus has\\nnot been discharged by the registered proprietor of trade mark for excusing\\nhim from non-user during the prescribed period, preceding the application\\nfor removal of registered mark. The existence of special circumstance must\\naffect the trade as a whole and the onus of establishing that the case comes\\nwithin the ambit of Section 46(3) lies on the registered proprietor of the\\ntrade mark. It may be shown that the non-user was due to special\\ncircumstance of the trade only and not by reason of some other cause which\\n\\n\\n\\nCS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012                         Page 63 of 72\\n would have otherwise been inoperative even in the absence of the special\\ncircumstances. If the non-user was, in fact, by reason of some other factors\\napart from the special circumstances, question of a defense under\\nSection 46(3) being made available to the proprietor of the mark does not\\nand cannot arise. A specific case shall have to be made and proved with\\nnecessary documentary evidence that the non-user was the direct effect of\\nthe existence of the special circumstances. The special circumstances cannot\\nbe taken note of as a defense if the non-user is by reason of a voluntary act.\\nThis view taken by Calcutta High Court might have helped the proceedings\\nunder Section 46 of the Act. But here in this case due to special kind of\\nrelationship between the respondents No.1 and 2 and between respondent\\nNo.2 and the appellant in the trade and there being no intention to abandon\\nor not to use the trade mark in relation to the goods to which the registration\\nof the trade mark related, the appellant even for that purpose is not entitled\\nto claim removal from register of the trade mark the device and word\\n\"Synthes\" on the ground of alleged non-user. In the present case, the\\nquestion of abandonment has to be judged in the peculiar set of facts. Here\\nthe plaintiff/respondent No.1 is one who is not indulging in any trading\\nactivities not only in India but also outside India. The plaintiff/respondent\\nNo.2 does not have any registration as registered user of the trade marks in\\nIndia. It is not the case here where the trade mark has not been got renewed\\nby plaintiff/respondent No.1. It is different thing to look at the situation from\\nthe point of view of trafficking in trade marks. But in the face of renewal of\\nthe trade mark and allowing the plaintiff/respondent No.2 to use the same\\nexclusively and further tacitly allowing the appellant to use it, it is difficult\\nrather not possible to say that the trade mark in this case has been\\nabandoned.\"\\n 78.   In the case of Morgardshammar India Limited & Ors. Vs.\\nMorgardshammar AB, 2013 (53) PTC 186 (Del.) (DB) it was held as\\nunder:\\n79.   The defendant has intentionally and deliberately claimed the false user\\nof marks CUTLER-HAMMER/ BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER and CH\\nfrom several decades\". The defendant has claimed use of the trademark\\nCUTLER HAMMER from the year 1968 and other marks from the year\\n1977 and has produced on record the Sales figures along with Certificate of\\nChartered Accountant from the year 1976- 2010 are wrong and not\\nsubstantiated by any documentary evidence. It is the admitted position that\\nduring the said period the user of defendant was permissive user. The\\nclaiming user being proprietor during the licensing period was fraudulent\\nand dishonest as per settled law.\\n      Even false claims made by defendant as to \"advertisement and\\npromotion of products under marks CUTLER-HAMMER/ BHARTIA\\nCUTLER-HAMMER and CH from the year 1976-2011\".                    In most of the\\nperiod, the defendant‟s user was permissive user.\\n80.   In Rob Mathys India Pvt. Ltd. v. Synthes Ag Chur, 1997 (17) PTC\\n669 (DB), this Court echoed the view expressed by the Supreme Court in\\nPower Control Appliances v. Sumeet Machines Pvt. Ltd., JT 1994 (2) SC\\n17 to the effect that it is a settled principle of law relating to trademarks that\\nthere can be only one mark, one source and one proprietor. A trademark\\ncannot have two origins. It was held that after termination of the\\ncollaboration agreement between the parties to that litigation, the appellant\\n\\n\\nCS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012                             Page 66 of 72\\n therein, not the owner of the trademark, could not use the word \"Synthes\" or\\nthe trademark \"AO/ASIF\" after revocation of the collaboration agreement.\\n         The Division Bench of this Court in the case of J.K. Jain v. Ziff\\nDavies, 2000 PTC 244 (DB) held that an ex licensee, having taken the\\nbenefit of an agreement with the licensor is estopped from resisting an\\napplication for an injunction by the licensor after termination of the\\nagreement between the parties.\\n81.      In the case of Hindustan Pencils Pvt. Ltd. Vs. M/s India Stationery\\nProducts Co., reported in AIR 1990 Delhi 19, in para-31 it was held as\\nunder:\\n84.   None of the cases referred by the defendant is applicable to the facts\\nand circumstances of the present case. The defendant‟s counsel has failed to\\nrefer even a single case in which the injunction has been refused by any\\nCourt with similar circumstances. The facts in cases referred are materially\\ndifferent and do not help the case of the defendant.\\n85.   Rather, in case the law with regard to the rightful owner of the\\ntrademark and the act of ex-licensee is examined, it emerges that either\\nduring the licensing period of agreement or after expiry, it is implicit and\\nclear that the ex-licensee is not entitled to claim the ownership of a\\ntrademark nor he is permitted by law to file an application for registration of\\nthe trademark in his name nor is entitled to file the petition for rectification\\nof the same very trademarks in which ex-licensee was using the trademarks\\nas a permissive user, otherwise it would amount to fraud and\\nmisrepresentation.    The ex-licensee under no circumstances can declare\\nhimself as owner of the trademark to claim the concurrent user because as\\nper scheme of the Act, the benefit of concurrent user can be derived by a\\n\\n\\n\\nCS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012                           Page 69 of 72\\n party whose user is honest and boanfide. In the present case, both things are\\nmissing. In other words, he cannot be allowed to make a hole in the plate in\\nwhich he was eating; such wrongful user would be considered as stolen\\nproperty which cannot become rightful property in any amount of user.\\nBALANCE OF CONVIENCE IN FAVOUR OF PLAINTIFF\\n\\n86.   Plaintiff No.1 founded in 1911 and incorporated in Ohio in 1916 is a\\nwell known premier diversified fortune 200 industrial company having a\\nmanufacturing presence in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Costa Rica,\\nCzech Republic, Dominican Republic, France, Germany, India, Indonesia,\\nIreland, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Monaco, Netherlands, Poland,\\nPuerto Rica, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland,\\nTaiwan, Thailand, United Kingdom and United States of America and has\\nbeen selling their products under various well known trademarks.\\n85.1 Plaintiffs‟ trademarks CUTLER-HAMMER/CH logo are well known\\ntrademarks having extra territorial goodwill and reputation worldwide.\\nPlaintiff No.1 has trans-border reputation extending to India. The use of\\nidentical/ deceptively similar trademarks on part of Defendant is bound to\\nconfer an undue advantage of reputation and goodwill of plaintiffs‟ well\\nknown marks to the defendant and such use would be detrimental to the well\\nknown character and reputation thereof. The plaintiffs are the registered\\nproprietor of trademark CUTLER-HAMMER under No.164435 in Class 09.\\nWhereas the defendant does not have any statutory right in the trademark\\nCUTLER-HAMMER/ BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER and its variants.\\n85.2 The plaintiffs have been using the trademarks worldwide and there is\\nno reason to assume that the same were abandoned. Mere fact that the\\nregistrations of few trademarks inadvertently lapsed and then no steps were\\n\\n\\nCS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012                         Page 70 of 72\\n taken to reinstate the said registration on account of adopting the new\\nversion of it, the same is no ground to claim that plaintiffs have abandoned\\nthe trademarks.\\n85.3 The fact that the defendant until the year 2000 has manufactured\\nlicense products using plaintiff‟s know how and technical data and for which\\nDefendant has paid royalties as well itself supports that defendant cannot on\\nits own manufacture goods of same engineering standard even if the\\ndefendant is using the marks since the year 1986 with the knowledge of the\\nplaintiffs, such user will always be considered as dishonest and fraudulent.\\n87.     The plaintiffs establish a prima facie case for grant of an interim\\ninjunction. The balance of convenience is also in favour of the plaintiffs and\\nagainst the defendant. The plaintiffs shall suffer an irreparable loss and\\ninjury to its hard earned goodwill, reputation and business unless the\\ndefendant is restrained from continuing with its illegal trade activities during\\nthe pendency of the suit.\\nRELIEF\\n88.     In view of the above said reasons, the prayer made in the plaintiffs‟\\napplication being I.A.No.1204/2012 is allowed. Accordingly, the defendant,\\nits dealers, agents and representatives on its behalf are restrained from\\nusing    impugned    arrangement     and/or   mark(s)   CUTLER-HAMMER,\\nBHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER, CH(logo) or CH CONTROL or any other\\nmark as may be identical and/or deceptively similar to the plaintiffs‟\\nregistered trade mark CUTLER-HAMMER under No.164435 in Class 9\\namounting to infringement thereof and also from manufacturing and\\nselling, offering for sale, directly or indirectly dealing in goods included\\nin Class 9 and/or any other cognate or allied goods or the goods of the\\n\\n\\n\\nCS(OS) No.156/2012 & CS(OS) No.575/2012                           Page 71 of 72\\n same description under the impugned arrangement and/or mark(s)\\nCUTLER-HAMMER, BHARTIA CUTLER-HAMMER, CH (logo) or\\nCH CONTROL or any other mark as may be identical and/or deceptively\\nsimilar to the plaintiffs‟ trade mark CUTLER-HAMMER and CH (label)\\nand from doing any other act as is likely to cause confusion & deception\\namounting to passing off their goods and/or business as and for\\nthe goods and/or business of the plaintiffs.

The case of the Plaintiff is that the Plaintiff was\\n       formerly        known        as     Rampur       Distillery        and      was\\n       established in the year 1943. In the year 1999, the\\n       Plaintiff       launched          its   brand       under        the     house\\n       mark/trademark Radico.\\n3.

Deed of assignment\\n       dated 5.10.2005 was executed in favour of the Plaintiff.\\n       The assignment is stated to cover all the intellectual\\n       property residing in the said trademarks including\\n       copyrights in the Logos/legends of the trademarks and\\n       the        packaging       material      being       used         with      those\\n       trademarks. The Plaintiff also has registrations in its\\n       favour in respect of some of the trademarks.\\n5.     As per the Plaintiff, the trademarks were first adopted\\n       by the Plaintiff\\'s predecessor in interest since the year\\n       1994        or    thereabouts          and    were         used     by       them\\n       continuously and uninterruptedly before the trademarks\\n       were assigned to the Plaintiff in 2005. Thereafter the\\n       Plaintiff claims to have used the said trademarks and\\n       labels in respect of alcoholic beverages continuously\\n       since        then     and       has     been       using          the      marks\\n       uninterruptedly to date.\\n6.     It    is    the     case   of    the    Plaintiff      that       though        the\\n       advertisement of alcoholic beverages is not allowed ,\\n       the Plaintiff has promoted the alcoholic beverages\\n       under the mark and their labels throughout the country.\\n       As per the Plaintiff by virtue of such long, continuous\\n\\n\\n\\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013                 Page 5 of 75\\n        and uninterrupted use, excellent quality and extensive\\n       promotion of the said trademarks, they have come to be\\n       associated exclusively with the Plaintiff in respect of\\n       alcoholic beverages. It is contended that the t rademarks\\n       being arbitrary marks for alcoholic beverages are thus\\n       liable to be afforded the highest degree of protection\\n       under the Trademarks Act, 1999.\\n7.     As per the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff became aware in the\\n       month        of    April      2012      that     the       Defendant   was\\n       manufacturing and marketing BRIHAN\\'S DANZ NO. 1\\n       WHISKY in bottles that had an identical trademark to\\n       the Plaintiff\\'s trademark for an identical product being\\n       an alcoholic beverage.\\n8.     The Plaintiff issued a legal notice dated 26.04.2012 to\\n       the Defendant calling upon them to cease and desist\\n       from using the bottles bearing the Plaintiff\\'s registered\\n       trademarks. It is contended that the Defendant failed to\\n       respond to the said notice. The Plaintiff again came\\n       across       products       manufactured           and      marketed     by\\n       Defendant         under the         trademark          BRIHMA\\'S        GOA\\n       imprinted on their labels for their alcoholi c beverage. It\\n       is contended that upon performing due diligence it was\\n\\n\\n\\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013          Page 6 of 75\\n        found that Defendant were also advertising other\\n       products identical to that of the Plaintiff\\'s products. By\\n       notice dated 30.07.2013, the Plaintiff called upon the\\n       Defendant to immediately cease and desist from using\\n       infringing trademarks. The Plaintiff thereafter has filed\\n       the present suit\\n\\n9.     The Defendant has in its defence contended that the\\n       suit of the Plaintiff\\'s is barred by delay, laches and\\n       acquiescence. It is contended that the Plaintiff knew\\n       about the use of the disputed marks by BMSS and the\\n       use by the Defendant since the year 2008. It is\\n       contended that BMSS by deed of assignment dated\\n       16.12.2010          assigned        certain      trademarks   to     the\\n       Defendant. It is contended that the Defendant had\\n       acquired the said trademarks along with their goodwill\\n       and as such was entitled to use the said trademarks.\\n10.    The Defendant apart from specific defences raised to\\n       the 5 trademarks in issue have raised the common\\n       defence in respect of all five marks i.e. (i) that the\\n       excise authorities have approved the mark and label of\\n       the Defendant and as such Defendant is entitled to use\\n       the same, (ii) further that BMSS was using the\\n\\n\\n\\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013      Page 7 of 75\\n        trademarks since the year 2008 and the Defendant has\\n       been using them since 2011 and as such the Plaintiff\\n       being aware of the user is not entitled to the relief of\\n       injunction (iii) the Defendant has also applied for\\n       registration and/or is the registered proprietor of some\\n       of the marks.\\n11.    Apart from the general pleas applicable to all the\\n       impugned trademarks, the Defendant has also raised\\n       trademark specific pleas.\\nPlaintiff\\'s BRIHAN\\'S NO. 1 WHISKY V/S Defendant\\'s\\nBRIHAN\\'S DANZ NO. 1 WHISKY\\n\\n\\n\\n       Plaintiff\\'s                               Defendant\\'s\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013   Page 8 of 75\\n 12.    It is      contended by the              Defendant         that the   said\\n       \"BRIHAN‟S DANZ NO. 1 WHISKY\" trademark was\\n       assigned to the Defendant under a deed of assignment\\n       dated 16.12.2010 for valuable consideration. It is\\n       contended that by virtue of the said deed of assignment\\n       the Defendant is exclusively entitled to use the said\\n       trademark. It is contended that the Defendant has\\n       already filed an application for registration of the\\n       trademark, which is in process. It is contended that\\n       BMSS since 02.12.2008 and thereafter the Defendant\\n       since 21.9.2011 is continuously using the said Mark\\n       and as such is entitled to use the same.\\n 13.    The case of the Plaintiff on the contra is that BMSS by\\n       deed of assignment dated 05.10.2005 assigned various\\n       trademarks         along with their goodwill for a sale\\n       consideration of Rupees 17.5 Crores. The trademark\\n       BRIHAN\\'S NO. 1 WHISKY was one such trademark.\\n       It is contended that the Defendant has adopted a\\n       deceptively similar trademark BRIHAN\\'S DANZ NO.\\n       1 WHISKY, the only distinction being the word \\'Danz\\'.\\n       It is submitted that the Plaintiff acquired the entire right,\\n       title and interest in the said Mark through deed of\\n       assignment dated 05.10.2005.\\n14.    It is contended that the assignment of trademark\\n       BRIHAN\\'S DANZ NO. 1 WHISKY by BMSS to the\\n       Defendant is patently wrong and illegal and BMSS\\n       could not have assigned the said trademark to the\\n       Defendant in the year 2010 in view of the earlier\\n       assignment of BRIHAN\\'S NO. 1 WHISKY AND\\n       BRIHAN\\'S NO. 1 in favour of the Plaintiff along with\\n       all goodwill, common law rights, labels, logo etc.\\n\\n15.    It is contended that the two marks BRIHAN\\'S DANZ\\n       NO. 1 WHISKY and BRIHAN\\'S NO. 1 WHISKY are\\n       deceptively similar and since the Plaintiff is the sole\\n\\n\\n\\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013   Page 10 of 75\\n        and exclusive proprietor through prior assignment and\\n       has continuous and uninterrupted use r since 2005, the\\n       Defendant cannot use a deceptively similar mark. It is\\n       further contended that the Defendant\\'s label clearly\\n       shows the mala fide intention in adoption of the said\\n       Mark as the word DANZ is written in small and\\n       inconsequential lettering as compared to the w ords NO.\\n       1 WHISKY AND BRIHAN\\'S.\\nPlaintiff\\'s BRIHAN\\'S PREMIUM WHISKY, BRIHAN\\'S\\nPREMIUM BLUE WHISKY V/S Defendant\\'s BRIHAN\\' S\\nPREMIUM BLUE WHISKY\\n\\n                    Plaintiff\\'s                            Defendant\\'s\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013     Page 11 of 75\\n 16.    The Defendant in the Written Statement has contended\\n       that the impugned trademark was initially assigned by\\n       BMSS to the Plaintiff under the Assignment Deed\\n       dated 25.10.2005. It is contended that thereafter as the\\n       Plaintiff was not interested in acquiring the said\\n       trademark, therefore the Plaintiff agreed to reassign the\\n       said trademark in favour of BMSS vide letter dated\\n       July 2006. It is contended that the reassignment of\\n       trademark in favour of BMSS was further confirmed\\n       through the emails exchanged between the Plaintiff and\\n       BMSS. It is contended that after the assignment of the\\n       same in favour of BMSS on 03.07.2006, the Plaintiff\\n       never used the trademark either in the form of label or\\n       word per se.\\n17.    It is contended that after getting the reassignment of the\\n       said Mark, BMSS assigned the same in favour of the\\n       Defendant under the Deed of Assignment of 2010 and\\n       as such the Defendant claims to have become the\\n       owner of the said trademark.\\n18.    The Plaintiff has contended that though there were\\n       some discussions in the year 2006 between the Plaintiff\\n       and BMSS for the reassignment of the said Mark,\\n\\n\\n\\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013   Page 12 of 75\\n        however these never fructified and the mark was never\\n       reassigned to BMSS. It is contended that the Defendant\\n       has failed to show any Re-assignment Deed, assigning\\n       the mark back to B MSS. It is contended that the letter\\n       dated 03.07.2006 was a communication between the\\n       Plaintiff and BMSS which further stipulated that the\\n       parties would be entering into a Re-assignment Deed. It\\n       is contended that the email exchanged in 2011 rather\\n       confirmed the fact that the reassignment did not take\\n       place.\\n19.    It is submitted by the Plaintiff that since there is an\\n       admission that the Plaintiff was assigned the Mark by\\n       BMSS         in     2005       and     thereafter          there   was      no\\n       reassignment back to BMSS, the 2010 Assignment\\n       Deed under which the Defendant claims to have\\n       acquired rights is illegal and cannot be enforced. It is\\n       thus contended that the very adoption by BMSS and the\\n       subsequent         assignment         to the      Defendant        and the\\n       adoption by the Defendant is dishonest and in violation\\n       of the rights of the Plaintiff.\\n Plaintiff\\'s BRIHAN\\'S GOA V/S Defendant\\'s BRIHM A\\'S\\nGOA & NO VA GO A\\n     Plaintiff‟s              Defendant‟s\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013   Page 14 of 75\\n 20.    It is contended by the Defendant that on 19.05.1994,\\n       BMSS         applied      for      registration     of     the   trademark\\n       BRIHAN\\'S GOA. On 20.07.2005 the said trademark\\n       was registered in favour of BMSS. On 29.05.2006, the\\n       Plaintiff      became        the     subsequent        proprietor.    It    is\\n       contended that on 26.11.2009 rectification was filed in\\n       respect of the said trademark.\\n21.    It is contended that the Plaintiff was not using the label\\n       registered but was using a different label.

It is contended that the two marks are\\n       not deceptively similar, further it is contended that the\\n       word GOA             is a     geographical         name    and nobody\\n       including the Plaintiff has the exclusive right over the\\n       word GOA.\\n22.    The Plaintiff has contended that mere pendency of the\\n       rectification proceedings filed by a 3 rd party does not\\n       disentitled the Plaintiff from enforcing its rights against\\n       the Defendant. It is contended that the two marks and\\n       labels are deceptively similar and likely to cause\\n       confusion. It is contended that even geographical marks\\n       are entitled to protection. It is contended that the mark\\n       and the label used by the Defendant is identical to that\\n       of the Plaintiff and has been adopted to mislead the\\n       public. It is submitted by the Plaintiff that there are\\n       certain disputes that arose with BMSS in the year 2009\\n       for the use of the mark GOA by BMS S and some\\n       settlement terms were proposed but they were never\\n       finalized.

It is submitted\\n       that the said permission was never granted to BM SS. It\\n       is submitted that since BMSS and the Plaintiff shared a\\n       unique relationship, the discussion was being carried\\n       on but that would not entitle the Defendant to claim\\n       any benefit of the said discussion.\\n23.    It is contended by the Plaintiff, that the Plaintiff\\n       through its Assignor BMSS had been continuously\\n       using the mark GOA since 1994 and because of long\\n       extensive and continuous use of the said trademark , the\\n       consuming public associated the product of the Plaintiff\\n       bearing the trademark BRIHAN‟S GOA and the GOA\\n       LABEL with the Plaintiff. It is contended that the label\\n       of the Defendant is deceptively similar.\\n24.    It is contended by the Defendant, that the Defendant\\n       was the owner of the said trademark by virtue of the\\n       assignment by BMSS in the year 2010. It is submitted\\n       that the label NOVA GOA was approved by the excise\\n       authorities on 15.06.2009 and the Defendant was using\\n       the said label since 21.09.2011. It is submitted that the\\n       Plaintiff was aware of the use of the said Mark.\\n 25.    It is contended by the Plaintiff that the Defendant\\'s\\n       label was a colorable imitation of the Plaintiff\\'s label\\n       amounting to infringement of copyright and is also\\n       likely to mislead the consuming public. It is submitted\\n       by the Plaintiff that the Defendant was relying on\\n       unsigned Minutes of Meeting and one-sided emails to\\n       try to mislead the Court. It is submitted that from the\\n       documents filed by the Defendant, it was clear that\\n       BMSS was seeking the Plaintiff\\'s permission to do\\n       certain acts for a limited purpose. Further, it is\\n       contended that the said documents prima facie show\\n       that BMSS was acknowledging that the Plaintiff was\\n       the owner of the GOA trademark.\\n26.    It is submitted by the Plaintiff that the mark GOA was\\n       an essential feature of the mark NOVA GOA and\\n       therefore violates the rights of the Plaintiff.\\n                                                                  .....Contd\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013   Page 18 of 75\\n Plaintiff\\'s BRIHAN\\'S DOCTOR (WORD PER SE) &\\nBRIHAN\\'S DOCTOR BRANDY (LABEL) V/S Defendant\\'s\\nBRIHMA\\'S O RIG INAL DOCTOR BRANDY\\n       Plaintiff\\'s                               Defendant\\'s\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013   Page 19 of 75\\n 27.    It is submitted by the Defendant in the Written\\n       Statement that            on     04.06.1976 BMSS              applied for\\n       registration        of     the     said      trademark        BRIHAN‟S\\n       DOCTOR              BRANDY           and        claimed    users     since\\n       01.06.1972.

On 29.07.1978 the mark was\\n       registered in favour of BMSS. On 29.05.2006, the\\n       Plaintiff became the subsequent proprietor. It is further\\n       contended by the Defendant that the registration of the\\n       Mark is subject to the disclaimer of the word DOCTOR\\n       and the Plaintiff does not have the exclusive right to\\n       use the word DOCTOR.\\n28.    It is contended that the Defendant was using a different\\n       mark         i.e.     BRIHMA‟S              ORIGINAL           DOCTOR\\n       BRANDY. It is contended that the use of the said label\\n       by     the    Defendant          with     the    registered    trademark\\n       BRIHMA‟S in no way amounts to infringement of the\\n       registered trademark BRIHAN\\'S DOCTOR (word per\\n       se) of the Plaintiff. It is contended that the trademarks\\n       BRIHAN\\'S AND BRIHMA‟S are distinct and different.\\n 29.    It is contended that the label used by the Defendant is\\n       distinct from the label used by the Plaintiff. It is\\n       contended that in the year 2009 some disputes arose\\n       between BMSS and the Plaintiff with regard to the use\\n       of    the     labels     BRIHMA‟S            ORIGINAL      DOCTOR\\n       BRANDY. It is contended that the disputes were\\n       resolved in the meeting held on 20.09.2009 and\\n       recorded in the Minutes of Meeting and according to\\n       the said Minutes of Meeting the labels were amended\\n       by BMSS to the satisfaction of the Plaintiff.\\n30.    It is submitted that the Plaintiff agreed not to take any\\n       objection or legal action against BMSS on the sale of\\n       the two brands BRIHMA‟S GOA and BRIHMA‟S\\n       ORIGINAL DOCTOR BRANDY . It is contended that\\n       BMSS has been continuously, with the knowledge and\\n       consent of the Plaintiff, used the said amended/agreed\\n       labels till the same were assigned to the Defendant and\\n       as such the Defendant has the right to use the said\\n       labels.\\n31.

If the essential features of the trademark of\\n                     the Plaintiff have been adopted by the\\n                     Defendant, the fact that the get-up, packing\\n                     and other writing or marks on the goods or\\n                     on the packets shows marked differences, or\\n                     indicate clearly a trade origin different from\\n                     that of the registered proprietor of the mark\\n                     would be immaterial.2\\n\\n\\n1\\nKaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma v.

Rejecting the plea of abandonment of a mark because\\n       of addition and alteration to the original mark, the\\n       Bombay High Court in the case of SKOL B REWERIES\\n       (SUPRA ) laid down as under:\\n       19.     Mr. Bookwala contended that the Plaintiff\\n               had abandoned the registered label mark.\\n               Relying upon paragraph 8 of the plaint read\\n               with Exhibit \"E\" thereto he submitted that\\n\\n\\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013   Page 27 of 75\\n                the mark actually used by the Plaintiff was\\n               entirely different from the registered mark.\\n               The registered mark he submitted had never\\n               been used and must therefore be deemed to\\n               have been abandoned. Exhibit \"E\" to the\\n               plaint is a photograph of a bottle with the\\n               label    affixed     thereon.   The    words\\n               \"HAYWARDS 5000\" form not only an\\n               important but a predominant part of the\\n               label. These letters and numerals are in the\\n               centre of the label and are about four times\\n               the size of the letters and numerals of the\\n               other material on the label. Reliance\\n               however is placed on the fact that the label\\n               in addition thereto contains considerable\\n               other material. Firstly the word PREMIUM\\n               is added to the registered mark. Below the\\n               mark \"HAYWARDS 5000\" are the words\\n               \"PREMIU M SUPER STRONG BEER\".\\n               Below these words is the device of a star\\n               within a circle and below the same the\\n               quantity is mentioned as 650 ml. Above the\\n               mark are the words \"THE ORIGINAL\". The\\n               use     of     this    additional    material,\\n               Mr.Bookwalla contended, established that it\\n               is not the registered trademark that has been\\n               used by the Plaintiff but another trademark\\n               altogether.\\n       20.     The added material in the present case does\\n               not indicate that the Plaintiff has abandoned\\n               the registered mark or the word mark\\n               \"HAYWARDS 5000\". Nor does it indicate\\n               that the label on the bottle containing the\\n               Plaintiffs product does not constitute the use\\n\\n\\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013   Page 28 of 75\\n                of the registered label mark. The submission\\n               that any variation or deviation from the\\n               registered mark does not constitute use of\\n               the registered mark is not well founded.\\n               Indeed in most cases the label affixed on the\\n               products or packages containing the\\n               products would contain in addition to the\\n               trademark, registered or unregistered, other\\n               material. The added material may be of the\\n               proprietors volition as well as on account of\\n               statutory compulsion. For instance the\\n               labels may contain the name of the entity\\n               packing/bottling the goods, the name and\\n               address of the manufacturer and the quantity\\n               of the contents of the package upon which\\n               the label is affixed. The label may also\\n               contain certification obtained by the\\n               manufacturer       and     the     proprietors\\n               compliance with statutory requirements\\n               whether compulsorily required to be stated\\n               or not. If Mr. Bookwalla\\'s submission is\\n               accepted it would lead to the absurd result\\n               that the mere introduction/mention of such\\n               material would lead to the conclusion that\\n               the registered mark has not been used and\\n               consequently must be deemed to have been\\n               abandoned by the proprietor thereof. So\\n               long as the registered mark is used in\\n               substantially the same manner in w hich it is\\n               registered it must be deemed/considered to\\n               constitute the use of the registered mark\\n               itself. Where the use of a mark, registered or\\n               unregistered, is apparent the mere addition\\n               of material on the label or other material on\\n               which it appears would not lead to the\\n\\n\\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013   Page 29 of 75\\n                conclusion that the mark has not thereby\\n               been used. In either case the use of the mark\\n               must be apparent to wit, the Court must be\\n               satisfied that despite the added material the\\n               trademark has been used. The use of the\\n               mark must be as a trademark and must be\\n               obvious/perceptible. The mark must not be\\n               lost as a result of the added material for then\\n               it is not to the use of the mark for the\\n               purpose of an infringement or a passing of\\n               action.\\n38.

It is thus clear that there cannot be two assignments of\\n       a mark. If two assignments of a mark were permissible,\\n       then there would be confusion with regard to the origin\\n       of the goods or services. The basic principle underlying\\n       protection of intellectual property rights is that the\\n       purchaser of the goods should be clear as to the source\\n       of the goods. If the source of the goods is unclear or\\n       there is confusion as to the origin/source of the goods\\n       in the mind of the ultimate user than the very concept\\n       of protection of intellectual property right would be\\n       defeated.\\n42.    It is more in the interest of the general public than in\\n       the interest of the proprietors of the mark that the re\\n       should be no confusion as to the origin/source of the\\n       goods. If two assignments of a mark were permissible\\n       then there would be confusion in the mind of the\\n       ultimate user as to who is the proprietor of the goods.\\n       The consumer would never be certain about the quality\\n       of the goods sought to be purchased.\\n43.    Keeping in view the interest of ultimate consumers, the\\n       courts have laid down the principle of one mark one\\n       proprietor. However there may be situations where a\\n\\n\\n\\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013   Page 33 of 75\\n        proprietor of a mark being unaware of the prior mark\\n       honestly adopts a mark which is identical or similar to\\n       the earlier mark and puts the same to use, he may, in a\\n       passing of action, be                 entitled, in the         facts    and\\n       circumstances of the case, to set up the defence of\\n       honest concurrent use. Though in an infringement\\n       action of a registered mark, this defence may not be\\n       available.\\n44.    Where there is a dishonest adoption in the first instance,\\n       the period of use is of no consequence. If it prima facie\\n       appears that the adoption of a mark was dishonest then\\n       even if the Defendant has been using the mark for a\\n       considerably long period of time it would be of no\\n       consequence even in a passing off action. What is\\n       relevant is whether the adoption was honest or not.\\n       Only where the adoption of the mark is honest that the\\n       Defendant          would       be     entitled,      subject   to      other\\n       conditions being satisfied, to set up the defence of\\n       honest and concurrent user. Where the adoption of the\\n       mark is not honest then the defence of honest and\\n       concurrent user would not be permitted to be set up.\\n 45.    Coming to the facts of the present case, it would be\\n       necessary to examine the terms and conditions of the\\n       two Assignment Deeds to ascertain the rights that have\\n       accrued to the two rival parties.\\n46.    Both the Plaintiff and Defendant have set up their\\n       respective         Assignment          Deeds        from        a    common\\n       predecessor BMSS. The Plaintiff has relied upon the\\n       Assignment           Deed       dated       05.10.2005          (hereinafter\\n       referred to as the 2005 Assignment Deed) and the\\n       Defendant has relied upon the Assignment Deed dated\\n       16.12.2010         (hereinafter        referred      to    as       the   2010\\n       Assignment Deed).\\n47.    With regard to the 2005 Assignment Deed in favour of\\n       the Plaintiff, there is no dispute by the Defendant that\\n       the 2005 Assignment Deed has been executed. The\\n       Defendant has categorically admitted in the written\\n       statement        that    2005      Assignment          Deed         has   been\\n       executed by the Assignor BMSS.\\n48.    The Plaintiff has disputed the execution and validity of\\n       the 2010 Assignment Deed but for the purposes of\\n       decision of the application, since only a prima facie\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013             Page 35 of 75\\n        view is to be taken, it is assumed that the 2010\\n       Assignment Deed has been duly executed.\\n49.    Prima facie what is to be considered is the effect of the\\n       2005 Assignment Deed vis-à-vis the 2010 Assignment\\n       Deed.\\n50.    The Defendant has admitted that the 2005 Assignment\\n       Deed was duly executed and that it did create rights\\n       and interest in favour of the Plaintiff with regard to the\\n       trademarks that are subject matter of the said deed .\\n51.    If the       rights     and interests         created by the    2005\\n       Assignment Deed in favour of the Plaintiff were\\n       absolute then one has to determine whether there was\\n       any residuary rights in the said marks left for BMS S to\\n       subsequently assign to the Defendant by way of the\\n       2010 Assignment Deed.\\n2005 ASSIGN MENT DEED\\n\\n52.

The Deed further stipulates that the Assignee shall be\\n       entitled to use the trademarks and be entitled to the\\n       goodwill of the business related to the trade marks of\\n       the Assignor in connection therewith without any\\n       objection or interruption by the Assignor or on any\\n       person claiming under it. The Assignor agreed never to\\n       adopt, use, register or seek to register any mark which\\n\\n\\n\\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013             Page 42 of 75\\n        would be identical with or similar to or deceptively\\n       similar to the trademarks .\\n60.    The Assignee undertook that the words BRIHANS and\\n       BRIHANS logo will be used exclusively by Assignee\\n       strictly for the assigned trademarks only which were\\n       covered under this deed. It was agreed by the Assignee\\n       that the Assignor had full right to assign any o ther\\n       word and label of the Assignor other than those\\n       covered under the said deed. The Assignee agreed that\\n       the     ownership         of   the     word      BRIHANS         and     the\\n       BRIHANS            logo     shall     remain       with    the   Assignor\\n       exclusively forever as before and the Assignee shall not\\n       use the word BRIHANS or BRIHANS logo for any\\n       other products manufactured or marketed by Assignee,\\n       without the prior written consent of the Assignor.\\n61.    The Assignor was free to manufacture/bottle its own\\n       products under other brands/trademarks (other than\\n       those covered under the said deed) as well as products\\n       of other manufacturers under the brand names of such\\n       manufacturers. The Assignee had the unrestricted right\\n       to assign or otherwise dispose of this assignment or any\\n       of its rights, in whole or in part.\\n 62.     The clauses of the Deed further imply that the Plaintiff\\n        had absolute right to use the assigned marks for the\\n        products in respect of which the same had been applied.\\n        Even BMSS could not apply the marks for the same\\n        products and it could use the marks for p roducts other\\n        than those covered by the Deed. The Plaintiff also had\\n        the right to protect the marks assigned even from\\n        misuse by BMSS.\\n2010 ASSIGNMENT DEED\\n\\n63.     The sale consideration of the 2010 Assignment Deed is\\n        Rs. 1,000/- only.\\n64.     By the 2010 Assignment Deed, the Assignor BMSS has\\n        assigned to the Defendant 74 Trademarks.\\n65.     Annexure A lists out 74 brands/trademarks assigned by\\n        the said deed of 2010. The brands assigned and\\n        contained in Annexure A relevant for the present\\n        controversy are as under:66.     It may be noted that out of the 74 trademark, the\\n        Assignor has used the word BRIHMA‟S only for the\\n        two impugned            marks       i.e. BRIHMA‟S                GOA       and\\n        BRIHMA‟S ORIGINAL DOCTOR BRANDY apart\\n        from the word per se BRIHMA‟S.\\n67.     Comparison of the two Assignment Deeds shows that\\n        the Assignor BMSS has sought to assign the same mark\\n        to both the Plaintiff and the Defendant. Once the\\n        Assignment in favour of the Plaintiff was complete, the\\n        Assignor did not have the power to give what was\\n        already given to the Plaintiff and was no longer it\\'s to\\n        give. Further, the 2010 Assignment Deed to the extent\\n        it assigns the marks already assigned w ould be contrary\\n\\n\\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013             Page 45 of 75\\n        to Section 40 of the Trademarks Act, 1999 as it results\\n       in the creation of concurrent exclusive rights in more\\n       than one person, which would be likely to deceive and\\n       cause confusion.\\n68.    In view of the law as laid down by the CLASSIC\\n       E QUIPMENTS CASE (SUPRA ) once the 2005 Assignment\\n       Deed was executed, BMSS ceased to have any right,\\n       title or interest in the trademarks assigned and as such\\n       could not re-assign them by the 2010 Assignment Deed.\\n       The 2010 Assignment Deed to the extent it seeks to\\n       assign the trademarks already assigned would be\\n       invalid and inoperative.\\n69.    The Defendant has not denied the execution and\\n       validity of the 2005 Assignment Deed on the contrary\\n       there is an admission that the same has been duly\\n       execute and it conveys the title in favour of the\\n       Plaintiff.\\n70.    The trademarks assigned by the 2005 Assignment Deed\\n       to the Plaintiff and relevant for the present controversy\\n       are BRIHANS PREMIUM WHISKY, BRIHANS NO.\\n       1 WHISKY, BRIHAN‟S NO. 1, BRIHAN‟S WHISKY,\\n       BRIHAN‟S PREMIUM BLUE WHISKY, BRIHANS\\n\\n\\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013   Page 46 of 75\\n        DOCTOR BRANDY, BRIHAN‟S DOCTOR , GOA\\n       DRY        GIN      &    LIM E       35     UP,     BRIHAN‟S   GOA,\\n       BRIHAN‟S GOA SPECIAL DRY GIN.\\n71.    Once the abovementioned trademarks were assigned to\\n       the Plaintiff, BMSS could not have adopted, used or\\n       assigned, identical or deceptively similar trademarks.\\n       The      2010     Assignment          Deed seeks to assign the\\n       following trademarks to the Defendant that are claimed\\n       to be identical or deceptively similar: BRIHAN‟S\\n       PREMIU M BLUE, BRIHAN‟S DANZ NO. 1, NOVA\\n       GOA PREMIXED DRY GIN, BRIHMA‟S GOA, and\\n       BRIHMA‟S ORIGINAL DOCTOR BRANDY .\\n72.    Another important factor to be noticed in the 2010\\n       Assignment Deed is that for the impugned marks the\\n       user claimed by BMSS is that of 2008 onwards. From\\n       the own showing of the Defendant the adoption of the\\n       deceptively similar marks are much after the adoption\\n       of the mark by the Plaintiff coupled with the fact that\\n       the Plaintiff has purchased the said marks along with\\n       their goodwill and is entitled to take benefit of the user\\n       of the predecessor i.e. of BMSS. Since BMSS prior to\\n       the assignment of 2005 has claimed to been using the\\n\\n\\n\\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013   Page 47 of 75\\n        marks for a considerably long period of time and has\\n       assigned the said marks along with goodwill to the\\n       Plaintiff, the benefit of the said user would inure to the\\n       Plaintiff      who       had     for    a    valuable      consideration\\n       purchased the said marks along with their goodwill.\\n73.    The adoption of the impugned marks by the Defendant\\n       coupled with the user of its predecessor i.e. BMSS\\n       would be that of 2008 or so, which is subsequent to the\\n       adoption of the marks by the Plaintiff coupled with the\\n       user of its predecessor.\\n74.    The fact that the 2010 Assignment Deed refers to the\\n       status of application for some of the impugned marks\\n       as \"to be applied\" and for other impugned marks the\\n       date as 04.12.2008, prima facie shows a conscious\\n       decision on the part BMSS and Defendant not to refer\\n       to any prior user as it was clear to them that the user of\\n       BMSS prior to the said period had been assigned to the\\n       Plaintiff. If there was any residual rights remaining in\\n       BMSS, then BMSS would not have shown the date of\\n       adoption of the said marks as 2008 rather it would have\\n       claimed user since 1974 or so.\\n 75.    It is settled law that for comparing two marks for their\\n       deceptive similarity, the two marks as a whole have to\\n       be considered. The mark or words comprised in a mark\\n       cannot be split-up for the purposes of comparison. The\\n       test is, if the two competing marks when taken as a\\n       whole and compared, then whether there is any\\n       deceptive similarity between the two or not. The test is\\n       not that the words in the mark be split up to ascertain\\n       whether there are any dissimilarities or not. The rival\\n       marks have to be compared as a whole. The two\\n       competing marks must be judged both by their look and\\n       by their sound. All the surrounding circumstances must\\n       be      considered        (AMRITDHARA               PHARM ACY        CASE\\n\\n       (SUPRA )).\\n76.    Even if some words comprised in a mark are generic,\\n       still    the     mark       taken      as     a    whole       can   attain\\n       distinctiveness of the product of the proprietor. For\\n       example the words „Premium‟ and „Whisky‟ may be\\n       generic words but when coupled with the other words\\n       like     BRIHAN‟S then the                  mark as        a   whole     i.e.\\n       BRIHAN‟S PREMIUM WHISKY w ould be capable of\\n       distinctiveness. More so when the mark is a registered\\n       mark.\\n 77.    Concerted effort was made by the Defendant to point\\n       out to the various dissimilarities in the impugned marks.\\n       It was contended that there was difference in the colour\\n       of the background of the label, in one there was a\\n       single tree and in the other there was a double tree, the\\n       picture of the Castle was different, different font was\\n       being used, the word blue was missing and there were\\n       other visual dissimilarities.\\n78.    If the essential features of the trademark of the Plaintiff\\n       have been adopted by the Defendant, the fact that the\\n       get-up, packing and other writing or marks on the\\n       goods or on the packets shows marked differences, or\\n       indicate clearly a trade origin different from that of the\\n       registered proprietor of the mark, would still be\\n       immaterial (AMERICAN HOME PRODUCTS (SUPRA )).\\n       Broad and essential features of the two are to be\\n       considered. They should not be placed side by side to\\n       find out if there are any marked differences in the\\n       design and get up.\\n79.    The test laid down by the Supreme Court is that the two\\n       competing marks are not to be kept side -by-side to\\n       ascertain whether there are any dissimilarities but the\\n\\n\\n\\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013   Page 50 of 75\\n        true test is that of an imperfect recollection of a person\\n       of average intelligence. Competing marks have to be\\n       compared keeping in mind an unwary purchaser of\\n       average         intelligence        and      imperfect           recollection\\n       (AM RITDHARA PHARMACY CASE (SUPRA )).\\n80.    If the above tests were to be applied to the impugned\\n       marks and the labels adopted by the Defendant, then it\\n       is clear that the test is fully satisfied in the facts of the\\n       present case.\\n81.    The plea raised by the Defendant that the Plaintiff is\\n       not entitled to any injunction as there is delay in\\n       approaching the court is not sustainable. The Plaintiff\\n       has contended that the Plaintiff on becoming aware of\\n       the     adoption        of    the     marks       by       the    Defendant\\n       immediately issued the cease and desist notice and\\n       approached the court. Further, it is contended that the\\n       adoption of the similar mark by B MSS was itself\\n       dishonest and the alleged subsequent assignment to the\\n       Defendant in 2010 was also malafide. In the facts of the\\n       present case, BMSS being the assignors of the mark to\\n       the Plaintiff in 2005 cannot claim that the alleged\\n       adoption of identical or deceptively similar marks in\\n\\n\\n\\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013            Page 51 of 75\\n        2008 was honest and as such cannot be permitted to set\\n       up the defence of honest and concurrent user. It is\\n       further contended by the Plaintiff that the Plaintiff\\n       became aware of the use by the Defendant in 2012 and\\n       issued a cease and desist notice to the Defendant in\\n       2012 who failed to respond to the same. Thereafter , it\\n       is contended that the products were not visible in the\\n       market and therefore the Plaintiff did not take any\\n       action. Plaintiff again came across the infringing\\n       products in July 2013 when the second cease and desist\\n       notice was issued and the present suit was filed. It is\\n       denied that the Plaintiff was aware of the disputed\\n       labels since 2008.\\n82.    The contention of the Defendant, that both parties i.e.\\n       BMSS and the Plaintiff were getting their products\\n       manufactured under similar trademarks and selling\\n       them through the same channel of suppliers and as such\\n       there was acquiescence on the part of the Plaintiff, is\\n       not sustainable without proof of the same. The mere\\n       fact that the bottling plant was common would not ipso\\n       facto imply that the Plaintiff were aware that BMSS\\n       was using an identical mark or that the Plaintiff had\\n       agreed to BMSS adopting a similar mark. Since the\\n\\n\\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013   Page 52 of 75\\n        Plaintiff has denied this fact and there is nothing prima\\n       facie on record to show that the Plaintiff consented to\\n       the same, it is a plea that would require the parties to\\n       lead     evidence        and      would       be    considered     at     an\\n       appropriate stage.\\n83.    It is an admitted position that the Plaintiff acquired\\n       rights under the 2005 Assignment Deed and BMSS had\\n       divested itself of all its rights under the said Deed.\\n       BMSS had also agreed not to use the Marks assigned to\\n       the Plaintiff or to use Marks that are deceptively\\n       similar to the Marks assigned to the Plaintiff. The plea\\n       that BMSS was also using a similar mark to that of the\\n       mark that was assigned would only go on to show that\\n       BMSS was using the mark in breach of the 2005\\n       Assignment Deed. It had agreed not to use any\\n       deceptively similar mark to the mark assigned to the\\n       Plaintiff. BMSS, itself being the Assignor of the m arks\\n       cannot set up a defence of an honest concurrent user.\\n       On the other hand, it would go on to show that the\\n       adoption of the marks that were deceptively similar to\\n       the marks assigned was dishonest. The fact that the\\n       mark was adopted dishonestly and put to use would not\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013         Page 53 of 75\\n        entitle the Defendant or its predecessor to claim the\\n       defence of honest concurrent user.\\n84.    Since BMSS was itself the assignor of the marks, it\\n       cannot claim that it adopted the deceptively similar\\n       marks without the knowledge of the existence of the\\n       marks of the plaintiff. The Plea that the Plain tiff by its\\n       silence and inaction permitted the marks of BMSS to\\n       grow cannot come to the aid of BMSS as the adoption\\n       was not without the knowledge of the marks of the\\n       Plaintiff. BMSS adopted deceptively similar marks\\n       with full knowledge and at its own risk. Since the\\n       adoption of the deceptively similar marks by BMSS\\n       was with the knowledge of the marks of the Plaintiff,\\n       the defendant being an assignee of the deceptively\\n       similar marks from BMSS cannot thus claim to be in a\\n       better position that its assignor.\\nBRIHAN\\'S DANZ NO. 1 WHISKY\\n\\n85.    The defence raised by the Defendant in respect of\\n       BRIHAN‟S DANZ NO. 1 WHISKY is not sustainable.\\n       The contention that BRIHAN‟S was always secured\\n       and there is a disclaimer with regard to the words NO.\\n       1 WHISKY and that the Plaintiff is not using the word\\n\\n\\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013   Page 54 of 75\\n        DANZ is also not sustainable. The Defendant is\\n       attempting to dissect the trademark into different words.\\n       The test is that the mark as a whole has to be\\n       considered. The mark is not to be dissected into its\\n       various components to see whether individually there is\\n       any similarity or distinctiveness. What is relevant is not\\n       to dissect the words but the trademarks as a whole\\n       along with its trade dress, layouts, color scheme, and\\n       other components that go into making a mark including\\n       logo, label, ticket etc. have to be considered. One has to\\n       see whether the mark when it is examined as a whole is\\n       capable of distinguishing the goods or services of the\\n       proprietor of the mark from the goods and services of\\n       the others. If the test is satisfied then the mark as a\\n       whole       would       be    a    distinctive       mark    capable     of\\n       protection. When the mark of the Plaintiff BRIHAN‟S\\n       NO. 1 WHISKY is looked at as a whole, it is prima\\n       facie clear that the mark is distinctive and thus capable\\n       of protection.\\n86.    The      Trademark           BRIHANS          NO.      1    WHISKY        is\\n       registered and was assigned by BMSS to the Plaintiff.\\n       The Defendant claims that the mark BRIHAN‟S DANZ\\n       NO. 1 WHISKY was assigned to it by BMSS.

The      contention of the             Defendant           that there was\\n       disclaimer to the use of the words \"No. 1 & Whisky\"\\n       and that the Plaintiff has changed the labels from the\\n       ones that were assigned by BMSS does not further the\\n       case      of   the     Defendant.         The     Plaintiff    being     the\\n       proprietor of a mark or logo or a label is also entitled to\\n       use the marks, logos or labels that are modifications,\\n       variation       of    the    same.       The     contention      that    the\\n       registered label is not w hat is being put to use and that\\n       what was assigned is not being used also does not merit\\n\\n\\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013         Page 56 of 75\\n        any consideration. The variations in the mark that is\\n       assigned and mark that is being presently used are very\\n       insignificant and minor. The mark when taken as a\\n       whole shows that what is being used is very similar to\\n       the one that was assigned. Further, for the plea of\\n       passing off, the registration would not be relevant what\\n       is relevant is the user.\\n88.    It has been laid down in the CADBURY INDIA L IM ITED\\n       (SUPRA ) that the disclaimer on a registration certificate\\n       does not prohibit, in any manner, the right given to a\\n       person to bring a passing off action in respect of a trade\\n       mark       which       though       registered,          but     contains       a\\n       disclaimer with regard to any portion thereof. The\\n       Supreme Court in ASHOK CHANDRA RAKHIT (SUPRA )\\n       laid down that the dis claimer is only for the purposes of\\n       the Act.

Since the two marks BRIHAN‟S NO. 1 WHISKY and\\n       BRIHAN‟S DANZ NO. 1 WHISKY are deceptively\\n       similar and the Plaintiff is admittedly the prior user of\\n       the     trademark        BRIHAN‟S            NO.     1     WHISKY,       the\\n       Defendant is liable to be restrained from using the\\n       deceptively similar mark.\\nBRIHAN\\'S PREMIU M BLUE WHISKY\\n\\n90.    With regard to the trademark BRIHAN‟S PREMIUM\\n       BLUE WHISKY, it is admitted by the Defendant, that\\n       the said mark was assigned by BMSS to the Plaintiff.\\n       What is contended by the Defendant is that the Plaintiff\\n       thereafter reassigned the mark back to B MSS. This\\n       contention        presupposes          the    validity     of   the   2005\\n       Assignment Deed. It presupposes that the deed was\\n\\n\\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013         Page 58 of 75\\n        duly executed and all rights of BMSS in the said\\n       trademark were duly conveyed to the Plaintiff. What\\n       has to be seen thereafter is whether there was any re-\\n       conveyance or reassignment by the Plaintiff back to\\n       BMSS or not?\\n91.    The Defendant has not placed on record any deed of\\n       reassignment of the said mark in favour of BMSS by\\n       the     Plaintiff. Reliance           is      placed       on letter   dated\\n       03.07.2006. The said letter only states that the Plaintiff\\n       has      agreed      to    reassign        the    brand        \"BRIHAN‟S\\n       PREMIU M BLUE WHISKY\" to BMSS and would be\\n       entering into a supplemental agreement towards this. It\\n       further states that a draft agreement would be sent\\n       shortly. It is not the case of the Defendant that any\\n       Agreement          or     Deed     of      Re-assignment         was     ever\\n       executed between the Plaintiff and BMSS. The letter on\\n       the contrary confirms that the Plaintiff had become the\\n       owner/proprietor              of        the      mark.         Once        the\\n       assignment/conveyance was complete in favour of the\\n       Plaintiff the only way that BMSS could have adopted\\n       the mark was by way of a Re -assignment. The\\n       Defendant has neither pleaded nor relied upon any\\n       Deed of Re-assignment. As there is no Deed of Re-\\n        assignment so there is no question of B MSS adopting\\n       the same mark or assigning it to the Defendant by the\\n       2010 Assignment Deed.\\n92.    Even in the 2010 Assignment Deed, BMSS has stated\\n       that the registration of the said mark is still to be\\n       applied. BMSS, having assigned the mark to the\\n       Plaintiff and thereafter entering into negotiation with\\n       the Plaintiff for reassignment of the mark back to itself,\\n       can never take the plea of honest concurrent user. Since\\n       BMSS could not have adopted the mark there is no\\n       question of BMSS thereafter reassigning the mark to\\n       the Defendant.\\n93.    The contention of the Defendant that the Plaintiff is not\\n       entitled to an injunction as the Plaintiff has neither used\\n       the label nor the mark BRIHAN‟S PREMIUM BLUE\\n       WHISKY is not sustainable. It is an admitted position\\n       that the Plaintiff had purchased the said mark along\\n       with its goodwill from BMSS. BMSS ha d assigned the\\n       mark to the Plaintiff and agreed not to use any mark\\n       identical or similar to the marks assigned. Further , the\\n       Plaintiff has contended that it has been using the said\\n       mark uninterruptedly. Whether the Plaintiff has in fact\\n\\n\\n\\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013   Page 60 of 75\\n        used the mark or not after the assignment is an aspect\\n       which would be looked into after the parties have led\\n       that evidence.\\n94.    As per the Plaintiff the adoption of the mark by BMSS\\n       and the Defendant is not honest. It is contended that the\\n       Plaintiff was originally using the label with a windmill\\n       which was subsequently changed to a castle and the\\n       Defendant also changed their label to a castle which\\n       prima      facie establishes that the                 adoption by the\\n       Defendant was not honest.\\n95.    Further, the defence of the Defendant that the Plaintiff\\n       is    using       the    trademark         BRIHAN‟S         PREMIUM\\n       WHISKY and not                  BRIHAN‟S PREMIUM                BLUE\\n       WHISKY amounts to an admission that the Plaintiff is\\n       using the trademark BRIHAN‟S PREMIUM WHISKY.\\n       The trademark BRIHAN‟S PREMIU M WHISKY and\\n       BRIHAN‟S PREMIUM BLUE WHISKY are also\\n       deceptively similar. The use of the mark BRIHAN‟S\\n       PREMIU M BLUE WHISKY by the Defendant is likely\\n       to create an impression in the mind of the consumers\\n       that the proprietor of both the marks i.e. BRIHAN‟S\\n       PREMIU M             BLUE          WHISKY             and   BRIHAN‟S\\n\\n\\n\\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013      Page 61 of 75\\n        PREMIU M WHISKY is the same. Since the Plaintiff is\\n       admittedly the prior user of the trademark BRIHAN‟S\\n       PREMIU M WHISKY, the Defendant is liable to be\\n       restrained from using the mark BRIHAN\\'S PREMIUM\\n       BLUE WHISKY.\\nBRIHMA\\'S GOA/NOVA GOA\\n\\n96.    With regard to the trademark GOA SPECIAL DRY\\n       GIN the contention of the Defendant is that what was\\n       assigned was a label in a different style than what is\\n       being used by the Plaintiff. It is contended that there is\\n       no excise license to show that GOA SPECIAL D RY\\n       GIN was being used.\\n97.    The case of the Plaintiff is that the Defendant is using a\\n       mark BRIHMA‟S GOA which is very similar to the\\n       mark BRIHAN‟S GOA of the Plaintiff.\\n98.    On applying the test of an unwary purchaser of average\\n       intelligence and imperfect recollection and comparing\\n       the two conflicting mark, it is apparent that there is a\\n       great degree of similarity between the two rival marks\\n       in terms of their trade dress, get up, presentation, color\\n       scheme and layouts.\\n 99.    The word GOA is a geographic name and in terms of\\n       the law as laid dow n in the cases of HI -T ECH PIPES\\n       L IM ITED (SUPRA ) and SUNDAR NAGAR ASSOCIATION\\n       (SUPRA ), a name originally purely geographical in its\\n       significance        may become             so associated with the\\n       Plaintiff‟s goods or services that its use on its own as a\\n       trade mark or name without adequate distinction will\\n       amount to passing off, especially if it is used in\\n       conjunction with get-up or other indicia similar to that\\n       used by the Plaintiff.\\n100. The word GOA by itself may not be capable of\\n       protection as a trademark but when coupled with the\\n       mark BRIHAN‟S the                    mark      prima       facie   becomes\\n       distinctive. The fact that the BMSS had adopted the\\n       word BRIHMA‟S as a prefix to the word GOA shows\\n       that it was aware that it could not us e the mark GOA\\n       with the prefix BRIHAN‟S as the same would be\\n       deceptively similar. The words BRIHAN‟S GOA and\\n       BRIHMA‟S GOA are also deceptively similar. The fact\\n       that the Defendant is claiming to be a successor from\\n       BMSS and is not claiming any independent right to the\\n       said mark, prima facie establishes that the Defendant\\n       cannot also use a deceptively similar mark.\\n 101. Since the Plaintiff admittedly is the prior user of the\\n       trademark BRIHAN‟S GOA, the Defendant is liable to\\n       be restrained from using the deceptively similar mark\\n       BRIHMA‟S GOA.\\n102. However as regards the mark NOVA GOA of the\\n       Defendant is concerned, it is seen that the Defendant is\\n       not using the words BRIHAN‟S and/or BRIHMA‟S\\n       either as a prefix or as a suffix with the impugned mark.\\n       The trade dress, getup, layout, colour scheme etc. of\\n       the two rival marks BRIHAN‟S GOA and NOVA GOA\\n       is also not similar.\\n103. Prima facie the Plaintiff has not been able to show that\\n       the mark NOVA GOA being used by the Defendant is\\n       being used in conjunction with get -up or other indicia\\n       similar to that used by the Plaintiff more so when the\\n       words BRIHAN‟S or BRIHMA‟S are not being used\\n       therein. Thus there does not prima facie seem to be any\\n       likelihood of confusion between the two rival marks.\\n104. Since the Defendant is using the said mark without the\\n       suffix or prefix BRIHAN‟S or BRIHMA‟S, and in a\\n       trade dress and get up that is not similar of that of the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013   Page 64 of 75\\n        Plaintiff, the Defendant is not liable to be restrained\\n       from continuing to use the same.\\nBRIHMA\\'S ORIGINAL DOCTOR BRANDY\\n\\n105. The case of the Plaintiff is that the Defendant is using\\n       the       mark        BRIHMA‟S              ORIGINAL       DOCTOR\\n       BRANDY which is very similar to the Plaintiff‟s mark\\n       BRIHAN‟S DOCTOR BRANDY.\\n106. On applying the test of an unwary purchaser of average\\n       intelligence and imperfect recollection and comparing\\n       the two conflicting mark, it is apparent that there is a\\n       great degree of similarity between the two rival marks\\n       in terms of their trade dress, get up, presentation, color\\n       scheme and layouts.\\n107. The words DOCTOR and BRANDY by itself may not\\n       be capable of protection as a trademark but when\\n       coupled with the mark BRIHAN‟S the mark prima\\n       facie becomes distinctive. The fact that the BMSS had\\n       adopted the word BRIHMA‟S as a prefix to the words\\n\\n\\n\\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013   Page 65 of 75\\n        ORIGINAL DOCTOR BRANDY shows that it was\\n       aware that it could not use the mark DOCTOR\\n       BRANDY with the prefix BRIHAN‟S as the same\\n       would be deceptively similar. The words BRIHAN‟S\\n       DOCTOR BRANDY                      and BRIHMA‟S               ORIGINAL\\n       DOCTOR BRANDY are also deceptively similar.\\n108. The fact that the Defendant is claiming to be a\\n       successor        from      BMSS        and     is   not     claiming      any\\n       independent         right to the said Mark, prima                       facie\\n       establishes that the Defendant cannot also use a\\n       deceptively similar mark.\\n109. Since the Plaintiff admittedly is the prior user of the\\n       trademark         BRIHAN‟S             DOCTOR              BRANDY,         the\\n       Defendant is liable to be restrained from using the\\n       deceptively         similar     mark       BRIHMA‟S           ORIGINAL\\n       DOCTOR BRANDY.\\n110. Further perusal of Annexure A to the 2010 Assignment\\n       Deed (marks assigned to Defendant) shows that for\\n       various marks the prefix \"BRIHAN‟S\" is used but for\\n       only two marks i.e. BRIHMA‟S GOA & BRIHMA‟S\\n       ORIGINAL               DOCTOR             BRANDY             the      prefix\\n       \"BRIHMA‟S\"               is    used.       BRIHAN‟S           GOA         and\\n\\n\\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013           Page 66 of 75\\n        BRIHAN‟S             DOCTOR           BRANDY               are   admittedly\\n       assigned to the Plaintiff. The fact that only for these\\n       two brands the prefix BRIHMA‟S is used implies that\\n       the BMSS and Defendant were aware that these two\\n       marks could not be used in their original form. This\\n       prima facie shows a deliberate attempt to circumvent\\n       the stipulation in the 2005 Assignment Deed.\\n111. The         prefixes       BRIHAN‟S             and     BRIHMA‟S              are\\n       deceptively similar. Comparing the rival marks as a\\n       whole (i.e. BRIHAN‟S GOA v/s BRIHMA‟S GOA &\\n       BRIHAN‟S            DOCTOR            BRANDY           v/s       BRIHMA‟S\\n       ORIGINAL DOCTOR BRANDY) it is clear that the\\n       said two prefixes would not make much of a difference\\n       to the marks as a whole and that the two rival marks\\n       would continue to be deceptively similar.\\n112. Further, the email of 2009 exchanged between the\\n       Plaintiff and BMSS, relied upon by the Defendant,\\n       goes to show that BMSS was also aware that it could\\n       not use the Mark BRIHAN‟S GOA and BRIHAN‟S\\n       DOCTOR BRANDY without the permission of the\\n       Plaintiff. The email indicates that the BMSS was\\n       seeking permission for                 manufacture           of a    limited\\n\\n\\n\\nIA Nos. 12710/2013, 12712/2013 & 16926/2013 in CS(OS) 1572/2013            Page 67 of 75\\n        number of cases and was also negotiating for amending\\n       its label to the satisfaction of the Plaintiff.\\n113. Though the Minutes of Meeting dated 20.02.2009\\n       relied upon by the Defendant are disputed by the\\n       Plaintiff, they prima facie show that the Plaintiff was\\n       even in the year 2009 objecting to the adoption of the\\n       two similar marks by BMSS. The fact that BMSS under\\n       whom the Defendant is claimed to have acquired rights\\n       had entered into negotiations with the Plaintiff prima\\n       facie establishes that even BMSS was aware that the\\n       rival Marks were deceptively similar and it could not\\n       use the said Marks without the permission of the\\n       Plaintiff.\\n114. There is nothing on record filed by the Defendant to\\n       show, that the Plaintiff ever expressly agreed to the\\n       user by BMSS of the two impugned marks and if so on\\n       what        conditions.         However,           prima   facie     the\\n       email/minutes amount to an acknowledgment on the\\n       part of BMSS that the Plaintiff was the proprietor of\\n       the said Marks and BMSS could not have used the two\\n       impugned Marks without the permission and consent of\\n       the Plaintiff.\\n 115. Where a trader adopts a deceptively similar mark being\\n       fully aware of the mark of another trader, then he does\\n       so at his own risk. He cannot be permitted to set up the\\n       defence of honest concurrent user who has adopted the\\n       deceptively similar mark being unaware of the earlier\\n       mark.\\n116. Further, the Bombay High Court in the case of SKOL\\n       B REWERIES (SUPRA ) laid down that so long as the\\n       registered mark is used in substantially the same\\n       manner        in    which        it    is   registered      it    must     be\\n       deemed/considered              to     constitute      the   use    of    the\\n       registered mark itself. Where the use of a mark,\\n       registered or unregistered, is appa rent the mere addition\\n       of material on the label or other material on which it\\n       appears would not lead to the conclusion that the mark\\n       has not thereby been used. In either case, the use of the\\n       mark must be apparent to wit, the Court must be\\n       satisfied that despite the added material the trademark\\n       has been used. The use of the mark must be as a\\n       trademark          and    must        be    obvious/perceptible.         The\\n       mark must not be lost as a result of the added material\\n       for then it is not to the use of the mark for the purpose\\n       of an infringement or a passing of action.\\n 117. The plea of the Defendant that sale of liquor is licensed\\n       and it can be marketed only if there is a license granted\\n       and that it has a license duly approved by the excise\\n       authorities and as such it is entitled to use the\\n       impugned marks is also not sustainable. The mere fact\\n       that the excise authorities have granted license to the\\n       Defendant to market its product under a mark which is\\n       similar to that of the Plaintiff would not in any manner\\n       impinge upon the rights of the Plaintiff or dilute the\\n       mark of the Plaintiff. The use of a trademark is\\n       governed by the Trademarks Act, 1999 as also under\\n       the common law. The excise authorities are not\\n       authorities appointed under the Trademarks Act or\\n       vested with the powers under the Trademarks Act. The\\n       examination of a label by the authorities under the\\n       Excise       Act    is    for a purpose            different than that\\n       prescribed under the Trademarks Act for the Registrar\\n       of Trademarks. The mere fact that the label of the\\n       Defendant is approved by the excise authorities would\\n       not permit or entitle the Defendant to use a mark which\\n       is deceptively similar to the mark adopted by the\\n       Plaintiff.\\n 118. Another relevant factor is that the 2005 Assignment\\n       Deed is         an assignment            of    39    trademarks   for a\\n       consideration of Rs. 17.50 Crores whereas the 2010\\n       Assignment Deed is an assignment of 74 trademarks\\n       and that also for a meager consideration of only\\n       Rs.1000/-. It is though contended by the Defendant that\\n       the 2010 Assignment Deed is part of a Business\\n       Transfer Agreement. The said contention would not\\n       prima facie make any difference as the said Assignment\\n       Deed does not mention that there was any other sale\\n       consideration coupled with the Rs. 1,000/- mentioned\\n       therein.\\n119. Further contention of the Defendant that Annexure C is\\n       blank is also of no consequence as the Defendant in its\\n       written statement has itself contended that the Plaintiff\\n       was using the logo or label different from the one that\\n       was assigned implying thereby that it admits that\\n       logos/labels were assigned even though they were not\\n       enumerated in the agreement in annexure C. Further\\n       there is nothing on record to show that the Logos/labels\\n       were not assigned.\\n 120. The Plaintiff has been able to satisfy the three essential\\n       requirements for grant of an ad-interim injunction. The\\n       Plaintiff has been able to show a strong prima facie\\n       case in its favour.

The other parties to these appeals were/are its Directors.  \\n \\tIn the year 1965, one Rambhai Patel started a business of grinding \\nand selling spices under the name and style of \\'Ramdev\\'.  He had three \\nsons and two daughters, Arvindbhai, Hasmukhbhai and Pravinbhai were his \\nsons.  A partnership firm was constituted in the year 1975.  It applied for \\nregistration of the trademark \\'Ramdev\\', which was granted on 03.01.1986 \\nbeing Trademark No.447700. Another partnership deed was executed in \\nsupersession of the earlier partnership deed wherein new partners were \\ninducted.  On 06.01.1989, the appellant company was incorporated \\nwhereby and whereunder the pattern of shareholding amongst the three \\nbrothers was : Arvindbhai Group (40%); Hasmukhbhai Group (30%); and \\nPravinbhai Group (30%). The registered trademark was assigned by  \\n\\'Ramdev Masala Stores\\' in favour of the appellant by a deed dated \\n20.05.1990. However, by the said deed the goodwill was not assigned. The \\ntrademark together with the goodwill was assigned in favour of the \\nappellant company by another deed of assignment dated 20.05.1992.  A \\n\\'user\\' agreement was also entered into by the same parties permitting the \\nfirm \\'M/s. Ramdev Masala Stores\\' to use the said trademark subject to the \\nterms and conditions stipulated therein.  Another partnership firm being \\n\\'Ramdev Masala\\' was started on 01.04.1991 for carrying on the trade of \\ngrinding and trading of masalas.   A user agreement was also entered into \\nby and between the appellant company and the said firm permitting the \\nlatter to use the registered trade mark for seven years i.e. from 01.04.1991 \\nto 31.03.1998 in terms whereof it was stipulated :\\n\"3.\\tAND WHEREAS the User is a firm \\nregistered under the Indian Partnership Act and \\nwishes to use in the city of Ahmedabad except the \\narea of Naroda City of Ahmedabad and district \\nMehsana, Gujarat State (India) registered \\nproprietors aforesaid registered Trade Mark \\n(hereinafter referred to as \"the said Trade Mark\") \\nin respect of the said goods.\"User restricted to the \\ncities of Ahmedabad and Mehsana;\\n4(C)\\tThat the User will continue to use the said \\nmark only so long as he manufactures his goods in \\naccordance with the terms and specifications \\ndevised by the Registered Proprietor.\\n4(E)\\tThat within the terms of this agreement and \\nthereafter the User will not acquire any right to the \\nsaid mark by any means whatsoever except in \\naccordance with law.\\n4(G)\\tThat the User covenants not to use the said \\nTrade Mark in the advertisement, journal label \\nand/ or other documents in such a manner that the \\nsaid Trade Mark may in any way be diluted in \\nrespect of distinctiveness of validity if necessary \\nand indication either usually, phonetically may be \\ngiven to the purchasing public to the extent that the \\nUser uses the said mark by way of permitted use \\nonly.\" \\n\\tIndisputably, the firm \\'Ramdev Masala Stores\\' was dissolved on \\n04.11.1991. Yet again a new partnership firm came into being under the \\nname and style of \\'Ramdev Exports\\'.   The said partnership firm was \\nconstituted for the purpose of export of spices manufactured by the \\nappellant company.  \\nIt is not in dispute that the business of manufacturing and selling of \\nspices under the trade name of \\'Ramdev\\' was being run by the three \\nbrothers through the appellant company.  \\nAnother partnership firm being \\'Ramdev Masala\\' was being run \\nthrough seven outlets for retail sale of the products of the Company.\\nIt is also not in dispute that both the firms \\'Ramdev Masala\\' and \\n\\'Ramdev Exports\\' had distinct and separate existence.  Their areas of \\noperation were also different.  The respective roles assigned to each of the \\npartnership firm had clearly been specified in their respective partnership \\ndeeds.   Whereas M/s. Ramdev Masala was allowed to manufacture and \\ntrade in spices, the business of M/s. Ramdev Exports was limited to export \\nof the spices manufactured by the appellant company. Yet again, the \\npartnership deed of Ramdev Masala was amended on 01.04.1995; in terms \\nwhereof the business of the said firm was confined only to trading in spices \\nmanufactured by the appellant company.  In other words, the respective \\nbusinesses under the partnership deeds of the said firms are stated to be as \\nunder :\\na.\\tType of business of Ramdev Masala under the first partnership deed \\nwas grinding and selling of spices.\\nb.\\tType of business of M/s. Ramdev Masala under the second \\npartnership deed was trading in spices.\\nc.\\tThe business of M/s. Ramdev Exports was exporting the goods \\nmanufactured by the appellant company.\\nDISPUTES\\n\\nDisputes and differences having arisen between the members of the \\nfamily and in particular between the three brothers, the same was settled by \\ntheir well-wishers, pursuant whereto and in furtherance whereof a \\nMemorandum of Understanding (MOU) was executed by and between the \\nparties, to which we would advert to a little later.\\nLEGAL PROCEEDINGS\\n\\nOn the premise that the respondents had been infringing its rights, \\ntrade name and logo, the appellant company filed a suit in the City Civil \\nCourt, Ahmedabad, which was numbered as CS No.828 of 2000, inter alia, \\nfor the following reliefs :\\n\"A)\\tThe defendants by themselves, their \\nservants, agents, partners and all persons claiming \\nthrough or under them be restrained by a perpetual \\norder of this Hon\\'ble Court from, in any manner, \\nusing the trade mark \\'RAMDEV\\' in their label, \\npacking materials, advertising materials, business \\nmaterials etc., in respect of goods which are \\ncovered under registration of the plaintiff\\'s mark \\nand/or any mark which may be identical and/or \\ndeceptively similar to the plaintiff\\'s registered \\ntrade mark and thereby restrain them from \\ninfringing the plaintiff\\'s registered trade mark \\nbearing No. 447700 and  other marks bearing \\nNo.531084, 531085, 545253, 545253, 545255, \\n545257 and 545258.\"   \\nAn application for injunction was also filed wherein the following \\ninterim prayers were made :\\n\"(A)\\tThe defendants by themselves, their \\nservants, agents, partners and all persons claiming \\nthrough or under them be restrained by an order of \\ntemporary injunction of this Hon\\'ble Court from, \\nin any manner, using the trademark \\'RAMDEV\\' in \\ntheir label, packing materials, advertising \\nmaterials, business materials etc. in respect of \\ngoods which are covered under registration of the \\nplaintiff\\'s mark and/or any mark which may be \\nidentical and/or deceptively similar to the \\nplaintiff\\'s registered trade mark and thereby \\nrestrain them from infringing the plaintiff\\'s \\nregistered trade mark bearing No.447700 and other \\nmarks bearing No.531084, 531085, 545253, \\n545255. 545257 and 545258, till the hearing and \\nfinal disposal of the suit.\\n(B)\\tThe defendants by themselves, their \\nservants, agents, partners and all persons claiming \\nthrough or under them be restrained by an order of \\ntemporary injunction of this Hon\\'ble Court from \\nusing in relation to any spices, masala bearing the \\nname \\'RAMDEV\\' as produced with separate list \\nor any label or packing material or advertising \\nmaterial containing the trade mark \\'RAMDEV\\' \\nand/or any mark which is identical and/or mark \\ncontaining word \\'RAMDEV\\' either on label or in \\ntrading style or trading name, so as to pass off the \\ndefendants goods and/or business as that of the \\nplaintiff, till the hearing and final disposal of the \\nsuit.\"  \\nAn application was also filed for appointment of a Court \\nCommissioner.\\nDEFENCES OF THE RESPONDENTS \\t\\n\\n \\tThe principal defences raised by the respondents in the said suit are \\nas under:\\n(i)\\tThe appellant has no exclusive statutory right to use \\'Ramdev\\' \\napart from the label as a whole.   (Sections 15 and 17 issue)\\n\\n(ii)\\tThe first respondent has a right to use the mark as concurrent \\nuser; (Section 29 issue)\\n\\n(iii)\\tThat the use complained of is protected, as bona fide user and \\nfurthermore the appellant is not entitled to the reliefs sought for as \\nthe same were barred under the principles of estoppel, \\nacquiescence, etc.\\n\\n\\nORDER ON THE APPLICATION FOR INJUNCTION\\n\\n \\tBy a judgment and order dated 17.03.2000, the learned Trial Judge \\nopined that the plaintiff company was the owner of the trademark.  It was \\nfurther held that the defendants had started manufacturing and marketing \\nthe same business which is deceptively similar to the trademark of the \\nplaintiff which created confusion in the mind of public.  However, the \\ndefendants were given liberty to manufacture spices in their factory and sell \\nthe same in seven outlets under the trademark \\'Ramdev Masala\\'. \\nOn an interpretation of the said MOU dated 30.05.1998, it was, inter \\nalia, held :\\n\"Therefore, if there is agreement between the \\nparties that the defendant No.1 should purchase \\nspices from the plaintiff for the purpose of retail-\\nsale in 7 outlets, it must have been mentioned in \\nthe MOU. No such condition is mentioned. If that \\nbe so, it cannot be presumed that the defendants \\nshould purchase spices from the plaintiff for the \\npurpose of retail-sale in 7 outlets. In case of \\nwritten-agreement between the parties, it should be \\ntaken as it is. It should be read as it is. No \\nadditional terms and conditions or agreement can \\nbe presumed.  Therefore, in absence of any \\nspecific condition that the defendants should sell \\nspices by using trade-mark \"Ramdev\" in 7 outlets \\nby purchasing the goods from the plaintiff is not \\nbelievable.\\n13.\\tThis condition also does not seem to be \\npossible   \\n           \\n14.\\tThe defendants have arranged for the \\npacking material bearing regd. trade-mark \\n\"Ramdev\" and used the same for the purpose of \\nretail business.  These facts clearly suggest that \\nthere was no restriction on the defendants to \\npurchase spices from the plaintiff for the purpose \\nof retail business in 7 outlets.  On the contrary, the \\ndefendant was at liberty to manufacture in their \\nfactory and sell the same in 7 outlets for the \\npurpose of retail business.\\n15.\\tRelevant portion of MOU is reproduced \\nearlier.  Accordingly, the defendants are permitted \\nto use the trade-mark or logo  \"Ramdev\" for the \\npurpose of retail-sale in 7 outlets.  The words used \\nsuggest that the defendants were entitled to use the \\ntrade-mark \"Ramdev\" without any restriction for \\nthe purpose of retail sale of spices.  It was not \\ncompulsory on the part of the defendants to \\npurchase spices from the plaintiff.  They can \\narrange or manufacture in their way and sell the \\nsame in 7 retail outlets under the trade-mark \\n\"Ramdev\".\\n21.\\tTherefore, he cannot sell spices in other \\nshops under the trade-mark \"Ramdev\".  He can run \\nspices\\' business and other business in his shop \\nRamdev Masala.  The plaintiff cannot restrict \\nhim.\"\\nThe respondents had been selling a large variety of spices under the \\ntrade name \"Swad\".  However, the packings and labels adopted by them \\nwere also held to be deceptively similar to the trade-mark \"Ramdev\" of the \\nappellant.  Although they had been manufacturing and marketing spices \\nunder the trade name \\'swad\\', the respondents had been writing the words \\n\"Ramdev Masala\" in such a manner that it creates confusion in the minds \\nof customers.  It was, therefore, opined that the respondents had been \\npassing off their goods as if it was manufactured by the appellant.  The \\nlearned Judge, however, opined that as per the provisions of the Prevention \\nof Food Adulteration Act, 1955, it was mandatory to disclose the name and \\naddress of the manufacturer they have been writing their name \"Ramdev \\nMasala\" as manufacturer which does not create any deception or confusion.  \\nNoticing that the appellant got it entered in the records of the Registrar of \\nTrade Mark by following due procedure and acknowledging that the \\nappellant company is the registered proprietor of trade name bearing logo \\nof \"Ramdev\", it was held that as the respondents had started manufacturing \\nand marketing spices under the trade name \"swad\" and they had been \\nselling spices in small packets and in view of the averments made by the \\nappellant that the labels and packings adopted by the respondents were \\ndeceptively similar to the registered trademark \\'Ramdev\\' and, therefore, \\npassing off goods as it is manufactured by the plaintiff.  The learned Judge \\nfurther observed :\\n\"Comparing the packing material and label of \\nboth the parties, it is clear that the label of the \\ndefendants is phonetically and visibly similar with \\nthe label of the plaintiff.  It is deceptively similar \\nwith the label of the plaintiff.  It creates deception \\nas well as confusion in the minds of customers \\nwho are literate, illiterate, male or female, who \\nused to purchase in retail market from small shops \\nas well as big departmental stores.  Therefore, \\nthere is every likelihood of passing off the goods \\nof the defendants as if it is manufactured by the \\nplaintiff.\"\\nIt was opined :\\n\"As stated earlier, it is proved that the \\nplaintiff is the regd. proprietor of trade-mark \\n\"Ramdev\" bearing registration No.44770.  The \\nplaintiff has acquired goodwill and reputation of \\nthe trade mark \"Ramdev Masala\" in the market.  \\nPacking and label adopted by the defendants for \\ntheir products \"Swad\" containing the word \\n\"Ramdev Masala\" on the front page of the label in \\nlarger size, in first alphabet definitely creates \\ndeception and confusion.  It is deceptively similar \\nwith the trade-mark of the plaintiff.  Therefore, the \\nplaintiff has proved prima facie case on this point.  \\nAs regards the balance of convenience and \\nirreparable injury, it is settled legal position that in \\ncase of deception public at large is affected.  \\nUnvaried customers are likely to be deceived.  \\nWhen prima facie case is proved, it is necessary in \\nthe interest of justice to maintain status quo.  \\nConsidering above all facts and circumstances, \\ninjunction should be granted against the \\ndefendants.\"\\n\\tThe learned Judge summarised his findings as under :\\n\"Para 41 (i) \\tThe defendant No.1 and \\nconsequently all defendants are entitled to \\nuse trade mark \"Ramdev\" for the retail \\nbusiness of spices in 7 outlets as mentioned \\nin M.O.U.  It is not mandatory for the \\ndefendants to purchase goods from the \\nplaintiff for retail sale in the said outlets.  \\nThe defendants are at liberty to manufacture \\nspices in their factory and carry on retail \\nbusiness in 7 outlets by using trade-mark \\n\"Ramdev\" bearing registration No.44770.\\n(ii)\\tThe defendant No.1 is at liberty to run \\nbusiness under the trade name \"Ramdev \\nMasala\" for retail and wholesale business of \\nspices, instant mix and other articles.  \\nHowever, he should not use trade-mark \\n\"Ramdev\" except 7 outlets as mentioned in \\nM.O.U.\\n(iii)\\tLabel and packing adopted by the \\ndefendants for their goods under the trade-\\nname \"Swad\" containing word \"Ramdev \\nMasala\" is creating infringement of the \\ntrade-mark of the plaintiff as it is \\ndeceptively similar.  Therefore, the \\ndefendants should be prevented in using the \\nword \"Ramdev Masala\" on their label and \\npacking in any manner.  However, the \\ndefendants are at liberty to manufacture and \\nmarket spices in any trade name without \\nusing the word \"Ramdev\" or \"Ramdev \\nMasala\".\\n\\tThe respondents were, thus, restrained by temporary injunction from \\nusing registered trademark, logo \\'Ramdev\\' or any other trademark, which \\nis identical and deceptively similar to the trademark of the appellant in \\nrespect of label and packing material of their goods except in seven outlets \\nmentioned in MOU till final disposal of the suit.   They were held to be at \\nliberty to run business of spices under the trade name \\'Ramdev Masala\\' \\nwithout using the registered trademark \\'Ramdev Masala\\' except in seven \\noutlets.\\nHIGH COURT JUDGMENT\\n\\n\\n\\tBoth the parties preferred appeals thereagainst before the High \\nCourt.  The High Court by reason of its judgment opined:\\n(i)\\tThe chain of events goes to show that the business of grinding \\nspices by using the words \"Ramdev\" and \"Masala\" in the \\nformation of firm name continued all throughout and, thus, the \\nrespondents could be restrained from carrying on business of \\nmanufacturing and selling of spices.  \\n(ii)\\tThe respondents were permitted users in view of the registered \\nuser agreement executed between the parties.  \\n(iii)\\tThe effect of the MOU could not be wholly determined as the \\ndeeds of retirement had not been produced.\\n(iv)\\tEven if the MOU is kept out of consideration in view of the Rules \\nframed under Prevention of Food Adulteration Act and Standards \\nof Weights and Measures Act, the manufacturer is duty bound to \\ndisplay its name and address in the manner, size and placement as \\nprescribed, on the packets.  Thus, once a statute prescribes an \\nobligation on manufacturer and stipulates the minimum standards \\nof measurement, the manufacturer is bound to act in accordance \\nwith law and cannot be restrained from complying with specific \\nstatutory provisions.\\n \\tIt, while upholding the findings of the learned trial Judge contained \\nin paragraphs 41(i) and 41(ii); in respect of the directions contained in Para \\n41(iii), opined:\\n\"42.3 However, finding in paragraph 41(iii) of the \\nimpugned judgment requires to be modified.  The \\ntrial court was in error for the aforestated reasons \\nwhen it held that printing and publication of the \\nprincipal display panel was creating infringement \\nof trade mark as it was deceptively similar.  The \\ndefendants cannot be prevented from using the \\nwords \"Ramdev\" and \"Masala\" on their label and \\npacking in light of the statutory requirements as \\nstated hereinbefore.  However, the defendants shall \\nprint the name of the manufacturer using only the \\nminimum standard prescribed, depending upon the \\nnature of the packing and the placement of the \\nprincipal display panel shall be only at the bottom \\non the reverse side of the packing and the front \\nportion of the packing shall not carry any principal \\ndisplay panel except for its own brand name \\n\"SWAD\".\\nSUBMISSIONS:\\n \\tMr. C.A. Sundaram and Mr. Ashok Desai, learned Senior Counsel \\nappearing on behalf of the appellant, in support of these appeals submitted :\\n(i)\\tThe appellant was entitled to an order of injunction in view of the \\nwell-settled principles of law that in case of a registered trade \\nmark, the use thereof by any other person would constitute an \\ninfringement thereof.\\n(ii)\\tAs there can be only one mark, one source and one proprietor and \\nin particular having regard to the public interest, it was \\nimpermissible for the Trial Judge as also the High Court to allow \\nthe respondents to use the registered trade mark of the appellant \\neither in the seven outlets or the goods manufactured by them \\nindependently.  \\n(iii)\\tThe trade mark \\'Ramdev Masala\\' used by the respondents being \\ndeceptively similar with that of the registered trade mark, the \\nsame would interfere with the quality control product of the \\nappellant and, thus, an order of injunction as was prayed for \\nshould have been passed.\\n(iv)\\tThe learned Trial Judge as also the High Court misconstrued and \\nmisinterpreted the provisions of the 1958 Act vis-`-vis Prevention \\nof Food Adulteration Act and Standards of Weights and Measures \\nAct, as in a case of such nature, a mandatory injunction could be \\nissued directing change of the corporate name of the respondent \\nNo.1; as the appellant\\'s right to protect its trade mark is absolute.\\n(v)\\tBy reason of the MOU, the respondents were only allowed to \\ncarry on the existing trade and thereby the respondents were not \\npermitted to start manufacturing spices under the name and style \\nof \\'Ramdev Masala\\' as would be evident from the fact that they \\nwere only entitled to carry on retail business from the seven \\noutlets for the purpose of selling only the end products upon \\nprinting the words \"not for resale\" which is a clear pointer to the \\nfact that merely a right to trade therefrom and not manufacture of \\nspices in the said name had been granted in terms thereof.\\n\\tMr. F.S. Nariman, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the \\nrespondents, on the other hand, submitted:\\n(i)\\tThe appellant could exercise their right only for the purpose of \\nimplementing the MOU which must be read with the deed of \\nretirement dated 1st June, 1998, the remedies under the Trade \\nMarks Act are not available against the respondents who were \\nmembers of the family.\\n(ii)\\tThe Company, although was not a party to the MOU, but having \\nbeen represented by the Directors therein must be held to be \\nbound thereby and the parties to the MOU having not filed any \\nspecial leave petition in their individual capacities, these appeals \\nare liable to be dismissed.\\n(iii)\\tAs a distinction exists between a lis based on infringement of a \\nregistered trade mark and passing off, the principles which are \\napplicable for grant of injunction in an action for passing off are \\napplicable in the instant case.  \\n(iv)\\tThe claim of the appellant to obtain an order of injunction is \\nclearly barred by Sections 15(1) and 15(2) of the 1958 Act insofar \\nas a distinctive label having been registered as a whole, no order \\ncan be passed restraining the defendants from using a part thereof, \\nas has been held in The Registrar of Trade Marks v. Ashok \\nChandra Rakhit Ltd. [(1955) 2 SCR 252] and Re Cadbury \\nBrothers\\' Application [1915 (2) Ch. 307].\\n(v)\\tThe appellant itself having applied for \\'Ramdev\\' as a separate \\ntrade mark as would appear from a public document, viz., the \\nTrade Mark Journal No. 6 dated 25.11.2003 and the said trade \\nmark having not yet been registered in its favour, no order of \\ninjunction as had been prayed for can be passed in its favour.  \\n(vi)\\tIn any event, if an order of injunction is passed, against the \\nrespondents, they would have to be completely dependent upon \\nthe appellant for carrying on business which would lead to \\ndiscord between the members of the family, which was sought to \\nbe avoided by the MOU.\\n(vii)\\tIn view of the stipulations made in the MOU whereby and \\nwhereunder Shri Arvindbhai became the absolute owner of both \\n\\'Ramdev Exports\\' and \\'Ramdev Masala\\' and Hasmukhbhai and \\nPravinbhai haing given up their right thereupon, the First \\nrespondent is entitled to carry on the said business in those names \\nwhich were not required to be changed by reason of the said \\nMOU.\\n(viii)\\tFurthermore, the stipulations made in the MOU clearly do not \\noblige the respondent to buy any product from the appellant- \\nCompany, and in the event, if it be held that the respondent is \\nbound to sell only the products of the appellant, running of \\nbusiness by the respondent would clearly depend upon the supply \\nof the materials by the appellant alone.\\n(ix)\\tAs by reason of the said MOU, the respondent No.1 became \\nentitled to use of mark from seven outlets, the same envisages its \\nright to sell goods having the said mark and not sell of the \\nplaintiffs\\' goods alone.  The MOU must be interpreted in the light \\nof the deed of retirement dated 1.6.1998, which categorically \\ncontained a stipulation that the continuing partner \"have also \\ndecided to continue the said business in the same firm names, \\nviz., \\'Ramdev Exports\\' and \\'M/s. Ramdev Masala\\'\" and, thus, the \\nappellant cannot now turn round and contend that the respondent \\ncannot carry on business of grinding and selling masala.\\n(x)\\tIn the event the appellant\\'s contention is accepted, the right of the \\nrespondent to continue the business under the name and style of \\nor in the firm name of \\'M/s. Ramdev Masala\\' and \\'Ramdev \\nExports\\' would become inconsistent with the deed of retirement \\nof Hasmukhbhai and Pravinbhai from \\'M/s. Ramdev Masala\\' and \\n\\'Ramdev Exports\\'.\\n \\tDr. A.M. Singhvi, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of \\nsome of the respondents supplemented Mr. Nariman urging that a \\ndocument upon reading contextually may be found to be a family \\nsettlement although the said expression was not used therein.  It was, \\ntherefore, urged that the courts would lean strongly in favour of the family \\nsettlement and the MOU, so read, would operate as estoppel against the \\nother family members who have taken advantage thereof from denying or \\ndisputing implementation thereof.\\nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS\\n\\n \\tIt is not in dispute that the lis between the parties would be governed \\nby the 1958 Act.  \\n \\t\"Deceptively similar\" has been defined in Section 2(d) of the 1958 \\nAct to mean as under:\\n\"A mark shall be deemed to be deceptively similar to \\nanother mark if it so nearly resembles that other mark as \\nto be likely to deceive or cause confusion.\"\\n Section 2(j) defines \"Mark\" to include \"a device, brand, heading, \\nlabel, ticket, name, signature, word, letter or numeral or any combination \\nthereof\".  The expression \"registered proprietor\" has been defined in \\nSection 2(q) to mean a person for the time being entered in the register as \\nproprietor of the trade mark in relation to a trade mark.\\n \\tChapter II provides for appointment of the Controller-General of \\nPatents, Designs and Trade Marks for the purpose of the said Act.  Sections \\n15 and 17 read as under:\\n\"15. Registration of parts of trade marks and of \\ntrade marks as a series.--(1) Where the \\nproprietor of a trade mark claims to be entitled to \\nthe exclusive use of any part thereof separately, he \\nmay apply to register the whole and the part as \\nseparate trade marks.\\n (2) Each such separate trade mark shall satisfy all \\nthe conditions applying to and have all the \\nincidents of, an independent trade mark.\\n (3) Where a person claiming to be the proprietor of \\nseveral trade marks in respect of the same goods or \\ndescription of goods which, while resembling each \\nother in the material particulars thereof, yet differ \\nin respect of--\\n (a) statement of the goods or services in relation to \\nwhich they are respectively used or proposed to be \\nused; or\\n(b) statement of number, price, quality or names of \\nplaces; or\\n(c) other matter of a non-distinctive character \\nwhich does not substantially affect the identity of \\nthe trade mark; or\\n (d) colour;\\nseeks to register those trade marks, they may be \\nregistered as a series in one registration.\\n17. Registration of trade marks subject to \\ndisclaimer.If a trade mark  - \\n(a) contains any part--\\n (i) which is not the subject of a separate application \\nby the proprietor for registration as a trade mark; or\\n (ii) which is not separately registered by the \\nproprietor as a trade mark; or\\n (b) contains any matter which is common to the \\ntrade or is otherwise of a non-distinctive character,\\nThe tribunal in deciding whether the trade mark \\nshall be entered or shall remain on the register, may \\nrequire, as a condition of its being on the register, \\nthat the proprietor shall either disclaim any right to \\nthe exclusive use of such part or of all or any \\nportion of such matter, as the case may be, to the \\nexclusive use of which the tribunal holds him not to \\nbe entitled, or make such other disclaimer as the \\ntribunal may consider necessary for the purpose of \\ndefining the rights of the proprietor under the \\nregistration:\\nProvided that no disclaimer shall affect any rights \\nof the proprietor of a trade mark except such as \\narise out of the registration of the trade mark in \\nrespect of which the disclaimer is made.\"\\n \\tChapter III provides for the procedure for and duration of \\nregistration.  The 1958 Act envisages filing of an application (Section 18), \\nadvertisement thereof (Section 20), opposition thereto (Section 21) and \\ncorrection and amendment thereof (Section 22).  Registration of a trade \\nmark is envisaged in Section 23 of the 1958 Act, the effect whereof is \\nstated in Section 27 thereof.\\n \\tThe rights which are conferred by registration are stated in Section \\n28 of the 1958 Act in the following terms:\\n\"28. Rights conferred by registration.--(1) \\nSubject to the other provisions of this Act, the \\nregistration of a trade mark in Part A or Part B of \\nthe register shall, if valid, give to the registered \\nproprietor of the trade mark the exclusive right to \\nthe use of the trade mark in relation to the goods or \\nservices in respect of which the trade mark is \\nregistered and to obtain relief in respect of \\ninfringement of the trade mark in the manner \\nprovided by this Act.\\n(2) The exclusive right to the use of a trade mark \\ngiven under sub-section (1) shall be subject to any \\nconditions and limitations to which the registration \\nis subject.\\n(3) Where two or more persons are registered \\nproprietors of trade marks, which are identical with \\nor nearly resemble each other, the exclusive right \\nto the use of any of those trade marks shall not \\n(except so far as their respective rights are subject \\nto any conditions or limitations entered on the \\nregister) be deemed to have been acquired by any \\none of those persons as against any other of those \\npersons merely by registration of the trade marks \\nbut each of those persons has otherwise the same \\nrights as against other persons (not being \\nregistered users using by way of permitted use) as \\nhe would have if he were the sole registered \\nproprietor.\"\\n Section 29 provides for the consequences of infringement of trade \\nmarks in the following terms:\\n\"29. Infringement of registered trade marks.--\\n(1) A registered trade mark is infringed by a \\nperson who, not being a registered proprietor of \\nthe trade mark or a registered use thereof using by \\nway of permitted use, uses in the course of trade \\nmark which is identical with, or deceptively \\nsimilar to, the trade mark in relation to any goods \\nin respect of which the trade mark is registered and \\nin such manner as to render the use of the mark \\nlikely to be taken as being used as a trade mark.\\n(2) In an action for infringement of a trade mark \\nregistered in Part B of the register an injunction or \\nother relief shall not be granted to the plaintiff if \\nthe defendant establishes to the satisfaction of the \\ncourt that the use of the mark of which the plaintiff \\ncomplains is not likely to deceive or cause \\nconfusion or to be taken as indicating a connection \\nin the course of trade between the goods in respect \\nof which the trade mark is registered and some \\nperson having the right, either as registered \\nproprietor or as registered user, to use the trade \\nmark.\"\\n Section 33 provides for saving of vested rights.\\nINTERPRETATION OF DEED  PRINCIPLES OF\\n\\n \\tMOU, for the purpose of these appeals, may be treated to be a family \\nsettlement.  It is, however, well-known that intention of the parties to an \\ninstrument must be gathered from the terms thereof examined in the light of \\nthe surrounding circumstances.  [See Sohan Lal Naraindas v. Laxmidas \\nRaghunath Gadit, (1971) 1 SCC 276]\\n\\n \\tIn Delta International Ltd. v. Shyam Sundar Ganeriwalla [(1999) 4 \\nSCC 545], this Court noticed:\\n\"17.

Deputy Director \\nof Consolidation and Others [(1976) 3 SCC 119] and Hari Shankar \\nSinghania & Ors. v. Gaur Hari Singhania & Ors. [JT 2006 (4) SC 251].\\n \\tAlthough at one point of time the appellant-Company had taken a \\nstand that it being not a party to the MOU, it is not bound by the terms \\nthereof but the same would not mean that in an action for infringement of \\ntrade mark, when the MOU was put as a shield to its claim, it could not \\nhave taken recourse to proper interpretation thereof for the purpose of \\ndetermination of the rights of the parties to use the trade mark in question.  \\nIt is not a case where the courts refused to lean in favour of family \\narrangement or base its decision on technical or trivial ground.  We have \\nbeen taken through the MOU again and again.  It fell for judicial \\ninterpretation.  Interpretation processes were undertaken by the Courts \\nbelow.  The same would also be reviewed by us hereafter.\\nMOU  ANALYSIS OF\\n\\n\\n \\tThe appellant before us is a Company registered and incorporated \\nunder the Companies Act.  Indisputably, the parties to the MOU being \\nArvindbhai, Hasmukhbhai and Pravinbhai were its Directors.  They are all \\nbrothers.  All the shares of the Company were held by them and their \\nfamily members.  The Company although is a juristic person was not made \\na party thereto.  The effect of the Company being not a party may have to \\nbe considered by the Trial Court in the suit; but, as the parties for the \\npurpose of disposal of this appeal proceeded on the basis that the MOU was \\nentered into by and between the parties thereto; an endeavour shall be made \\nto construe the same as it stands.  We would, however, like to observe that \\nin the event any other attending circumstances are brought on record by \\nway of adduction of oral evidences, if permissible in law, warranting a \\ndifferent interpretation of the said MOU, the learned Trial Judge would be \\nat liberty to do so.  We may furthermore place on record that we are \\nconstruing the said MOU only for the purpose of disposal of an \\ninterlocutory matter which would not, thus, be binding on the courts below \\nat the final hearing of the suit.\\n\\tThe broad propositions which are evident from a perusal of the said \\nMOU appear to be as under:\\n \\tAmong all the three brothers, Arvindbhai who was the eldest among \\nthem is on one side and Hasmukhbhai and Pravinbhai are on the other.  The \\ndivision of the assets is broadly arrived at in that proportion.  The Counsel \\nappearing before us proceeded on the basis that MOU for all intent and \\npurport was a family settlement.  Disputes and differences having arisen \\nbetween the parties, the said MOU was entered into with a view to resolve \\nthe same as regards the business and property held by them so as to enable \\nthem to be in peace, harmony and understanding in the family.  The said \\nsettlement was arrived at through the mechanism of mediation of the well-\\nwishers of the family.  MOU was, thus, entered into for the purpose of \\ndistribution of the properties and business and the same was given effect to \\non and from 1.4.1998.  It stipulates:\\n(i)\\tManufacturing and selling of masala (spices) and instant mix was \\nbeing done by the Company.\\n(ii)\\tThe goods used to be manufactured in a factory situated in village \\nSola.  Another factory was constructed on block No. 527, 542 and \\n528 at Changodar.  The Joint family, viz., the Partnership \\n(Ramdev Masala) had been selling goods in retail in the name of \\n\\'Ramdev Masala\\' to seven outlets named therein.  \\n(iii)\\tThe export business in respect of goods, viz., pepper-spices, \\ninstant mix, groceries and other articles was being done in the \\nname of Ramdev Exports.\\n \\tThe Trade Mark or trade name which was registered in the name of \\nthe company, viz., Ramdev and its logo of a saint astride on a horse with a \\nstandard went to the Company.  The expression \"Ramdev\" is written in the \\nGujarati language just above the said logo and the word \"masala\" which is \\nagain in the Gujarati language appears just below the same. \\t\\n \\tArvindbhai became the exclusive owner of the business Ramdev \\nExports (Partnership Firm) and Ramdev Masala (another Partnership Firm).  \\nMOU contained a clarification to the effect that the other two brothers, viz., \\nHasmukhbhai and Pravinbhai became the owners thereof and would carry \\non the management of the business of the Company.  The two brothers, \\nHasmukhbhai and Pravinbhai were given the right to carry on export \\nbusiness under the brand name of \\'Ramdev\\' but in a manner which would \\nnot cause any loss to Arvindbhai or vice-versa.  Whereas the land situated \\nat Sola went to Arvindbhai along with the building, the machineries \\nbelonging to the company remained with the Company.  The new factory \\nand machinery also went to the Company.  A right of pre-emption in \\nrespect of the trade mark Ramdev was also created in terms whereof \\nHasmukhbhai and Pravinbhai was to offer sale of the said trade mark to \\nArvindbhai in the event they intend to do so.  It was, thus, made clear that \\nthe manufacturing activities were to be restricted to the Company through \\nHasmukhbhai and Pravinbhai.\\n \\tThe two brothers, viz., Hasmukhbhai and Pravinbhai, also had the \\nright to carry out export business under the brand name of Ramdev but in a \\nmanner which would not cause any loss to the eldest brother or vice-versa.\\n \\tWe have noticed hereinbefore that the partnership Ramdev Masala \\nhad an user agreement for seven years from 1.4.1991 which lapsed on \\n31.3.1998.  MOU came into force with effect from 1.4.1998.  By reason of \\nthe said MOU prima facie Arvindbhai had not been given any \\nmanufacturing right through the user agreement.  The trade mark Ramdev, \\nthus, belonged exclusively to the Company.\\n \\tAlthough several trade marks were registered and belonged to the \\nCompany, we are primarily concerned with the trade mark bearing No. \\n447700 having the aforementioned description.  \\n \\tBoth the learned Trial Judge as also the High Court proceeded on the \\nbasis that in terms of the said MOU, the Company acquired an exclusive \\nright to use the same.\\n\\tIt is not in dispute that the respondents have been manufacturing \\nspices under and name and style of \\'Swad\\'.  The said mark is a registered \\none.  \\n \\tThe Courts below proceeded on the basis that the mark used by the \\nrespondents are deceptively similar to the trade mark registered in favour of \\nthe appellant.  There is no dispute in regard to the said findings.  We would \\nhereinafter consider the effect thereof.\\nTRADE MARK-CONCEPT\\n\\n \\tThe concept of trade mark dates back to ancient times.  Even in the \\nHarappan Civilization marks of trade with foreign countries such as \\nMesopotamia and Babylonia were found embossed on articles.  The law of \\ntrade marks was formalised with the process of registration which gave \\nexclusivity to a trader right to deal in goods using a symbol or mark of \\nsome sort to distinguish his goods from similar goods sold by other traders.  \\nEven today the grant of a trade mark is an indicator of exclusivity in trade \\nunder that mark and this right cannot be transferred.  Only a limited right of \\nuser can be granted via licence.\\nIn The Modern Law of Trade Marks by Christopher Morcom, \\nButterworths 1999, it is stated:\\n\"The concept of distinguishing goods or services \\nof the proprietor from those of others was to be \\nfound in the requirements for a mark to be \\nregistrable.  Essentially, whatever the wording \\nused, a trade mark or a service mark was an \\nindication which enabled the goods or services \\nfrom a particular source to be indentified and thus \\ndistinguished from goods or services from other \\nsources.  In adopting a definition of \\'trade mark\\' \\nwhich simply describes the function in terms of \\ncapability of \\'distinguishing the goods or services \\nof one undertaking from those of other \\nundertakings\\' the new law is really saying \\nprecisely the same thing.\"\\n In Gujarat Bottling Co. Ltd. and Others v. Coca Cola Co. and Others \\n[(1995) 5 SCC 545], it was held that licensing of trade mark is governed by \\ncommon law which is also statutorily permissible provided:\\n\" (i) the licensing does not result in causing \\nconfusion or deception among the public; (ii) it \\ndoes not destroy the distinctiveness of the trade \\nmark, that is to say, the trade mark, before the \\npublic eye, continues to distinguish the goods \\nconnected with the proprietor of the mark from \\nthose connected with others; and (iii) a connection \\nin the course of trade consistent with the definition \\nof trade mark continues to exist between the goods \\nand the proprietor of the mark\"\\n \\tMaking use of another\\'s trade mark is not only a violation of \\nbusiness ethics but has also been linked to dishonestly making use of the \\ngoodwill and reputation built up and associated with the mark.\\n \\tIn Laxmikant V. Patel v. Chetanbhai Shah and Another [(2002) 3 \\nSCC 65], it was stated:\\n\"10. A person may sell his goods or deliver his \\nservices such as in case of a profession under a \\ntrading name or style. With the lapse of time such \\nbusiness or services associated with a person \\nacquire a reputation or goodwill which becomes a \\nproperty which is protected by courts. A \\ncompetitor initiating sale of goods or services in \\nthe same name or by imitating that name results in \\ninjury to the business of one who has the property \\nin that name. The law does not permit any one to \\ncarry on his business in such a way as would \\npersuade the customers or clients in believing that \\nthe goods or services belonging to someone else \\nare his or are associated therewith. It does not \\nmatter whether the latter person does so \\nfraudulently or otherwise. The reasons are two. \\nFirstly, honesty and fair play are, and ought to be, \\nthe basic policies in the world of business. \\nSecondly, when a person adopts or intends to \\nadopt a name in connection with his business or \\nservices which already belongs to someone else it \\nresults in confusion and has propensity of diverting \\nthe customers and clients of someone else to \\nhimself and thereby resulting in injury.\"\\nPURPOSE OF TRADE MARK\\n\\n \\tA trade mark is the property of the manufacturer.  The purpose of a \\ntrade mark is to establish a connection between the goods and the source \\nthereof which would suggest the quality of goods. If the trade mark is \\nregistered, indisputably the user thereof by a person who is not otherwise \\nauthorised to do so would constitute infringement.  Section 21 of the 1958 \\nAct provides that where an application for registration is filed, the same can \\nbe opposed.  Ordinarily under the law and, as noticed hereinbefore, there \\ncan only be one mark, one source or one proprietor.  Ordinarily again right \\nto user of a trade mark cannot have two origins.  The first respondent herein \\nis a rival trader of the appellant-Company.  It did not in law have any right \\nto use the said trade mark, save and except by reason of the terms contained \\nin the MOU or continuous user.  It is well-settled that when defences in \\nregard to right of user are set up, the onus would be on the person who has \\ntaken the said plea.  It is equally well-settled that a person cannot use a \\nmark which would be deceptively similar to that of the registered trade \\nmark.  Registration of trade marks is envisaged to remove any confusion in \\nthe minds of the consumers.  If, thus, goods are sold which are produced \\nfrom two sources, the same may lead to confusion in the mind of the \\nconsumers.  In a given situation, it may also amount to fraud on the public.  \\nA proprietor of a registered trade mark indisputably has a statutory right \\nthereto.  In the event of such use by any person other than the person in \\nwhose name the trade mark is registered, he will have a statutory remedy in \\nterms of Section 21 of the 1958 Act.  Ordinarily, therefore, two people are \\nnot entitled to the same trade mark, unless there exists an express licence in \\nthat behalf.\\nDIFFERENT FUNCTIONS OF A TRADE MARK\\n \\t\\nWe may now note a few precedents on the function of a trade mark.\\nIn Sumat Prasad Jain v. Sheojanam Prasad (Dead) and Others and \\nState of Bihar [(1973) 1 SCC 56], this Court held:\\n\"Thus, the distinction between a trade mark and \\na property mark is that whereas the former denotes \\nthe manufacture or quality of the goods to which it \\nis attached, the latter denotes the ownership in \\nthem. In other words, a trade mark concerns the \\ngoods themselves, while a property mark concerns \\nthe proprietor. A property mark attached to the \\nmovable property of a person remains even if part \\nof such property goes out of his hands and ceases \\nto be his.\"\\nIn Canon Kabushiki Kaisha v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. [(1999) \\nRPC 117], the European Court of Justice emphasised the test of likelihood \\nof confusion in the following terms:\\n\"40. That view is also confirmed by the judgment \\nof the court in SABEL, in which it held that the \\n\"likelihood of confusion mustbe appreciated \\nglobally, taking into account all factors relevant to \\nthe circumstances of the case\" (at paragraph 22).  \\nIt is true that that statement was made in a different \\ncontext: the court was there considering the \\nquestion whether conceptual similarity of the \\nmarks alone could give rise to confusion within the \\nmeaning of Article 4(1)(b), in a situation in which \\nthe goods in question were clearly the same.  \\nHowever, the statement is one of general \\napplication.\"\\n In Baker Hughes Limited v. Hiroo Khushalani [1998 PTC (18) 580],  \\nthe question as regards likelihood of confusion even by the enlightened \\npublic was noticed in the following words :\\n\"Again in Grotrian, Helfferich, Schulz, Th. \\nSteinweg Nachf, a Corporation Vs. Steinway & \\nSons, a corporation, 365 F.Supp. 707 (1973), \\nstriking a similar note the Court held as under:\\n\"Plaintiff argues that purchaser will not be \\nconfused because of the degree of their \\nsophistication and the price (B & L Sales \\nAssociates Vs. H. Daroff & Sons, Inc., \\nsupra, 421 F.2d at 354). It is true that \\ndeliberate buyers of expensive pianos are \\nnot as vulnerable to confusion as to products \\nas hasty buyers of inexpensive merchandise \\nat a newsstand or drug store [Callmann, \\nUnfair Competition Trademarks and \\nMonopolies, (3d ed. 1971)]. The \\nsophistication of buyers, however, does not \\nalways assure the absence of confusion \\n[Communications Satellite Corp. Vs. \\nComcet, Inc., 429 F.2d at 1252]. It is the \\nsubliminal confusion apparent in the record \\nas to the relationship, past and present, \\nbetween the corporate entities and the \\nproducts that can transcend the competence \\nof even the most sophisticated consumer. \\nMisled into an initial interest, a potential \\nSteinway buyer may satisfy himself that the \\nless expensive Grotrian-Steinweg is at least \\nas good, if not better, than a Steinway. \\nDeception and confusion thus work to \\nappropriate defendant\\'s good will. This \\nconfusion, or mistaken beliefs as to the \\ncompanies\\' interrelationships, can destroy \\nthe value of the trademark which is intended \\nto point to only one company [American \\nDrill Busing Co. v. Rockwell Mfg. Co., 342 \\nF.2d 1922, 52 CCPA 1173 (1965)]. Thus, \\nthe mere fact that purchasers may be \\nsophisticated or discriminating is not \\nsufficient to preclude the likelihood of \\nconfusion. \"Being skilled in their own art \\ndoes not necessarily preclude their \\nmistaking one trademark for another when \\nthe marks are as similar as those here in \\nissue, and cover merchandise in the same \\ngeneral field\" [Id]. \\nHaving regard to the above discussion prima facie \\nI am of the opinion that the word Baker occurring \\nin the corporate name of the second defendant \\nsuggests its connection or nexus with \\'Baker\\', \\nwhich depicts a wrong picture as from February, \\n1995 \\'Baker\\' has terminated its relation with the \\ndefendants. The continuance of the word Baker as \\npart of the corporate name of the second defendant \\nis likely to cause deception and confusion in the \\nmind of the customers. There would be no \\njustification for the second defendant to use the \\nword Baker as part of its corporate name after the \\nties between the first plaintiff and the second \\ndefendant have ceased to exist.\"\\n \\tThe said decision has been noticed by this Court in Baker Hughes \\nLtd. and Another v. Hiroo Khushlani and Another [(2004) 12 SCC 628].\\n In Milmet Oftho Industries and Others v. Allergan Inc. [(2004) 12 \\nSCC 624], in regard to medicinal products, this Court opined:\\n\"Whilst considering the possibility of likelihood \\nof deception or confusion, in present times and \\nparticularly in the field of medicine, the courts \\nmust also keep in mind the fact that nowadays the \\nfield of medicine is of an international character. \\nThe court has to keep in mind the possibility that \\nwith the passage of time, some conflict may occur \\nbetween the use of the mark by the applicant in \\nIndia and the user by the overseas company. The \\ncourt must ensure that public interest is in no way \\nimperilled\" \\n\\tWe may in this connection notice a recent judgment of the European \\nCourt of Justice in Canon Kabushiki Kaisha (supra) wherein it was opined:\\n\"28. That case concerned the interpretation of \\nArticle 4(1)(b) of the Directive in so far as it refers \\nto \"a likelihood of confusion on the part of the \\npublic, which includes the likelihood of \\nassociation with the earlier trade mark\".  The court \\nexplained that it had been submitted that \"the \\nlikelihood of association may arise in three sets of \\ncircumstances: (1) where the public confuses the \\nsign and the mark in question (likelihood of direct \\nconfusion); (2) where the public makes a \\nconnection between the proprietors of the sign and \\nthose of the mark and confuses them (likelihood of \\nindirect confusion or association); (3) where the \\npublic considers the sign to be similar to the mark \\nand perception of the sign calls to mind the \\nmemory of the mark, although the two are not \\nconfused (likelihood of association in the strict \\nsense). (Paragraph 16 of the judgment).\\n29. The court stated that it was therefore necessary \\nto determine \"whether Article 4(1)(b) can apply \\nwhere there is no likelihood of direct or indirect \\nconfusion, but only a likelihood of association in \\nthe strict sense\" (paragraph 17 of the judgment).  It \\nconcluded: \"The terms of the provision itself \\nexclude its application where there is no likelihood \\nof confusion on the part of the public\".  (paragraph \\n18 of the judgment).  Thus, the court held that \"the \\nmere association which the public might make \\nbetween two trade marks as a result of their \\nanalogous semantic content is not in itself a \\nsufficient ground for concluding that there is a \\nlikelihood of confusion\" within the meaning of \\nArticle 4(1)(b).\"\\nTRADE MARK AND GOODWILL\\n\\n \\tTraditionally, a trade mark has always been considered a vital and \\ninseparable part of the goodwill of the business.  In fact, the sale of a trade \\nmark without the sale of the goodwill to the same buyer is considered null \\nand void.  However, the trade mark can be assigned with or without the \\ngoodwill of business though subject to certain conditions.  [See V.A. \\nMohta\\'s Trade Marks, Passing Off and Franchising, pages 12, 313.]\\n\\nENTITLEMENT TO USE\\n\\n \\tThe contention of the appellant before the Courts below was that its \\nright to the said trade mark has been entrenched by the respondents on \\naccount of use of the same as part of the trade name in view of the fact that \\nalthough it has started the business in the trade name \\'Swad\\', the first \\nrespondent, on the label and the packing material of the said product, had \\nprinted the name of the manufacturer \\'Ramdev Masala\\' in such a prominent \\nmanner that the same would create an impression in the mind of the \\nordinary unwary customer that the same is a product of the appellant \\nCompany.  It also alleged that the respondents had adopted advertisements, \\nmarketed and displayed boards in such a manner so as to deliberately \\ndeceive the customer.  \\n\\tThe concurrent finding of fact arrived at by both the courts was that \\nthe packing material and wrapper of both the parties was phonetically and \\nvisibly similar to the registered mark.  The packing material and label used \\nby the respondents were deceptively similar to that of the appellant and the \\nsame creates deception as well as confusion in the minds of customers who \\nare literate, illiterate, male or female, who used to purchase in retail market \\nfrom small shops as well as big departmental stores.\\nThe learned Trial Court as also the High Court proceeded on the \\nbasis that the respondents are entitled to use the said trade mark by reason \\nof the stipulations contained in the said MOU as a result whereof they \\nbecame entitled to use the trade mark Ramdev for their retail business of \\nspices in seven outlets, which used to be belonging to the company.  The \\nsaid outlets were meant to be used for retail sale of the products of the \\nappellant alone.\\n \\tThe learned Trial Judge as also the High Court, however, failed to \\nnotice two significant and important provisions in the said MOU, viz., (i) \\nthe defendants could not carry on business in wholesale of the said \\nproducts; (ii) it was meant to be sold directly to the consumers and on the \\nproductions \"not for resale\" was required to be printed on each packet.  \\nWhat, therefore, could be done by the respondents was to sell the products \\nof the appellant through the said outlets.  It was one of the primary business \\nof the partnership firm which was given to the first respondent.  Prima \\nfacie, therefore, the first respondent could sell only the product of the \\nappellant. The respondents, however, were not restrained from \\nmanufacturing spices in their own factory.  They were entitled to do so.  \\nThey started the same under the brand name of \\'Swad\\'.  They could even \\nuse the same retail outlets for the purpose of promoting their own products \\nbut prima facie they could not use the mark registered in the name of the \\nappellant Company.  The registration number of trade mark is 447700.  \\nOnce the appellant had acquired goodwill and reputation thereto, in the \\nevent of any infringement to the said right, the remedies provided for in the \\n1958 Act would be available to it.  The terms of the MOU, in our opinion, \\nare clear and unambiguous.  It was required to be construed, even if it was \\nobscure to some extent by making attempt to uphold the one which would \\nbe in consonance with law and not offend the same.  Quality control by a \\nregistered trade holder vis-`-vis the one produced by an unregistered one is \\none of the factors which is required to be taken into consideration for the \\npurpose of passing an order of injunction.  It is one thing to say that the \\nrespondents were permitted to carry on trade but it would be another thing \\nsay that they would be entitled to manufacture and market its products \\nunder a name which would be deceptively similar to that of the registered \\ntrade mark of the appellant.  So long the parties to an arrangement can \\ncontinue to carry out their respective businesses without infringing the right \\nof another, indisputably the terms thereof must be given effect to.  But the \\nmatter would be entirely different when a party who has not been expressly \\nauthorised to manufacture the goods in which the Company had been \\ncarrying on business under the same name, the respondents under law could \\nnot have been permitted to carry on the manufacturing and marketing of \\ntheir products under the same name.  In a case of this nature, even a \\nmandatory injunction can be granted.  The respondents in the instant case \\nhave adopted a part of the appellant\\'s registered trade mark as a part of its \\ncorporate name.  They had merely been permitted to trade from seven \\noutlets.  In that view of the matter, they had a limited right under the MOU \\nand by reason thereof they could not have been permitted to start \\nmanufacturing of spices under the name and style of \\'Ramdev Masala\\'.  \\nEven under the common law, licence has to be interpreted to subsume the \\nlaw and prevent the mischief which is deceptive having regard to the fact \\nthat trafficking in trade mark is not permitted.  \\n \\tIt is true that the respondents have been permitted in terms of the \\nMOU to continue their business in the name of the partnership firm and to \\nuse the label mark, logo, etc. but the said MOU must be construed in the \\nlight of the law operating in the field.  For the said purpose, prima facie, the \\ndeeds of retirement are not required to be looked into.  When a right to use \\na trade mark is given, such a right can be exercised only in the manner laid \\ndown therein.  If in absence of any express licence or agreement to use its \\nlabel the respondents use the self-same trade mark, the same would not \\nonly lead to confusion but may also cause deception.  Even a common law \\nlicence, it is well-settled, cannot result in the dilution of the trade mark.\\n \\tIn that view of the matter, we are not in a position to subscribe to the \\nviews of the learned Trial Judge and the High Court that although the first \\nrespondent would be at liberty to carry on the business of manufacture of \\nspices, it can use the mark \\'Ramdev\\' only in seven outlets.  It evidently in \\nview of the legal position, could do so in respect of the products of the \\nappellant alone, which would be evident from the fact that at the relevant \\npoint of time, the respondents were not carrying any such business.  The \\ndirection of the learned Trial Judge that the respondents should be \\nprevented from using the word \"Ramdev Masala\" and their label and \\npacking, however, has been over-turned by the High Court on the premise \\nthat they are required to observe the statutory requirements under the \\nPrevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1955 as also the Standards of \\nWeights and Measures Act, 1976.\\nNON-OBSTANTE PROVISIONS \\n\\n\\tThe non-obstante nature of a provision although may be of wide \\namplitude, the interpretative process thereof must be kept confined to the \\nlegislative policy.  A non-obstante clause must be given effect to, to the \\nextent the Parliament intended and not beyond the same. [See ICICI Bank \\nLtd. v. Sidco Leathers Ltd. & Ors., 2006 (5) SCALE 27]\\n\\n \\tThe question which also escaped the attention of the High Court was \\nthat having regard to the non-obstante clause contained in the 1958 Act \\nordinarily for any purpose, the trade mark cannot be infringed.  If an \\ninfringement of trade mark is established, the onus would be on the \\ndefendants to show that he is entitled thereto either by reason of \\nacquiescence on the part of the owner of the registered trade mark or he \\nhimself has acquired a right thereto.  The Provisions of the Standards of \\nWeights and Measures Act or the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act do \\nnot confer such right.  Yet again, significantly, a pre-emptive right had been \\nconferred in favour of the first respondent which is itself suggestive of the \\nfact that the first respondent admitted and acknowledged the right of the \\nappellant to the said trade mark.  \\n \\tIn the MOU, furthermore it was categorically stated that the use of \\nthe trade mark was only to the extent of retail sale as on the packages, the \\nwords \"not for resale\" were to be printed.  If the parties intended to allow \\nthe first respondent herein to manufacture his own products and to market \\nthe same by using the name of Ramdev Masala, the question of grant of a \\nright to sell only in retail and that also printing the words \\'not for resale\\' \\nwould not have arisen.  A manufacturer is not only entitled to sell his own \\nproducts in retail but also in wholesale.  It can use any outlet for the said \\npurpose whether belonging to it or any other.  It would lead to an anomaly \\nif it be held that the first respondent would be permitted not only to sell the \\nproducts of the appellant but also its own products under the same trade \\nname albeit only from the seven outlets.\\n \\tBy reason of the said MOU, the respondents are not bound to buy \\nany product from the appellant but there is an obligation on the part of the \\nappellant to supply the same as otherwise it would lead to closure of \\nbusiness of Arvindbhai which would have been the intention of the parties.  \\nWhen the parties had settled their disputes, it was expected that the outlets \\nwould be utilised for the purposes for which they were meant to be utilised.  \\nWhat were the mutual obligations of the parties is a matter which can be \\nconsidered only at the trial or in any other appropriate proceeding, but \\nprima facie it goes without saying that the first respondent, in any event, \\nwas entitled to sell also his own products from the said outlets.  The parties \\nfor the said purpose thought of remaining mutually dependent as it was \\nstipulated that while also competing with each other they would see to it \\nthat by action of one, the other is not harmed at least while exporting the \\nmaterials.  It is, thus, not a case where the appellant having taken advantage \\nof the terms of the MOU had resiled therefrom and in that view of the \\nmatter the principle of estoppel cannot be said to have any application in \\nthe instant case.  \\n\\tWe are also not in a position to accept the submission of Mr. \\nNariman that the MOU must be read with the deed of partnership or the \\ndeeds of retirement whereby and whereunder the firm \\'Ramdev Masala\\' \\nand \\'Ramdev Exports\\' were permitted to use the word \\'Ramdev\\'.  \\nWhat is registered is a logo wherein the words \\'Ramdev\\' and \\n\\'Masala\\' are prominent.  A person may be held to be permitted to carry on \\nbusiness in spices as contradistinguished from the permission to carry on \\nmanufacturing goods which are similar to that of the appellant, but in terms \\nof the statutory provisions, the respondents were not legally permitted to \\nsell its products in packages or labels which would be deceptively similar \\nto that of the registered owner of a trade mark.  The right to manufacture \\nmasala and to sell the same with the registered logo, it will bear repetition \\nto state, was assigned as far back in 1991.  If the contention of the Senior \\nCounsel is accepted, the said purpose would be lost.  In a case of this \\nnature, therefore, ordinarily an injunction would issue.\\nBy reason of interpretation of MOU, trade mark cannot be infringed \\nand further when the right of user has been relinquished, the same could not \\nhave been claimed by the respondents.\\nWAIVER\\n\\n \\tThe matter may be considered from another angle.  If the first \\nrespondent has expressly waived his right on the trade mark registered in \\nthe name of the appellant-Company, could he claim the said right \\nindirectly?  The answer to the said question must be rendered in the \\nnegative.  It is well-settled that what cannot be done directly cannot be \\ndone indirectly.  \\nThe term \\'Waiver\\' has been described in the following words:\\n\"Waiver is the abandonment of a right in such a way that \\nthe other party is entitled to plead the abandonment by \\nway of confession and avoidance if the right is thereafter \\nasserted, and is either express or implied from \\nconductA person who is entitled to rely on a \\nstipulation, existing for his benefit alone, in a contract or \\nof a statutory provision may waive it, and allow the \\ncontract or transaction to proceed as though the \\nstipulation or provision did not exist. Waiver of this kind \\ndepends upon consent, and the fact that the other party \\nhas acted upon it is sufficient consideration\\nIt seems that, in general, where one party has, by his \\nwords or conduct, made to the other a promise or \\nassurance which was intended to affect the legal relations \\nbetween them and to be acted on accordingly, then, once \\nthe other party has taken him at his word and acted on it, \\nso as to alter his position, the party who gave the promise \\nor assurance cannot afterwards be allowed to revert to the \\nprevious legal relationship as if no such promise or \\nassurance had been made by him, but he must accept \\ntheir legal relations subject to the qualification which he \\nhas himself so introduced, even though it is not supported \\nin point of law by any consideration. \\n[See 16 Halsbury\\'s Laws (4th edn) para 1471]  \\n\\n\\tWaiver may sometimes resemble a form of election, and sometimes \\nbe based on ordinary principles of estoppel. [See 45 Halsbury\\'s Laws (4th \\nedn.) para 1269]\\n\\n \\tIn Indu Shekhar Singh & Ors. v. State of U.P. & Ors. [2006 (5) \\nSCALE 107], this Court held:\\n\"They, therefore, exercised their right of option.  \\nOnce they obtained entry on the basis of election, \\nthey cannot be allowed to turn round and contend \\nthat the conditions are illegal\"\\nSECTIONS 15 AND 17 ISSUE\\n\\n \\tSection 15 of the 1958 Act postulates registration of the whole and a \\npart thereof as separate trade marks.  The nature of the trade mark of the \\nappellant has been noticed hereinbefore.  \\n \\tThere are three elements in the said trade mark, viz., \\'Ramdev\\', \\n\\'Masala\\' and the \\'horse\\'.  The deception could be as regard the prominent \\nfeatures of the said trade mark.\\n Section 15 of the 1958 Act, in our considered opinion, is not \\nattracted in the instant case.  By reason of the said provision, registration of \\ntrade mark in regard to the exclusive use is permissible both in respect of \\nthe whole trade mark as also the part thereof separately.  Where such \\nseparate trade mark in regard to a part of it is applied for, the applicant \\nmust satisfy the conditions applying to and have all the incidents of an \\nindependent trade mark.  Sub-section (3) of Section 15 of the 1958 Act \\nprovides for a case where the proprietor of several trade marks claimed \\nregistration in respect of the same goods or description of the goods which \\nwhile resembling each other in the material particulars thereof yet differ in \\nrespect of the matters provided for therein.  We are not, in this case, \\nconcerned with such a legal question.\\n \\tIn Ashok Chandra Rakhit Ltd. (supra), whereupon reliance has been \\nplaced by Mr. Nariman, this Court was concerned with a proprietary mark \\nof \\'Shree\\'.  It was claimed that the mark \\'Shree\\' was a trade mark apart \\nfrom the device as a whole and it was an important feature of its device.  \\nThe respondents were carrying on business in the name and style of Shree \\nDurga Charan Rakshit.  It was in the peculiar factual background obtaining \\ntherein, this Court, referred to the decision of Lord Esher in Pinto v. \\nBadman [8 RPC 181] to say that where a distinctive label is registered as a \\nwhole such registration cannot possibly give any exclusive statutory right \\nto the proprietor of the trade mark to the use of any particular word or name \\ncontained therein apart from the mark as a whole.  This Court in the \\naforementioned factual backdrop opined:\\n\"This, as we have already stated, is not quite \\ncorrect, for apart from the practice the Registrar \\ndid advert to the other important consideration, \\nnamely, that on the evidence before him and the \\nstatement of counsel it was quite clear that the \\nreason for resisting the disclaimer in this particular \\ncase was that the Company thought, erroneously \\nno doubt but quite seriously, that the registration of \\nthe trade mark as a whole would, in the \\ncircumstances of this case, give it a right to the \\nexclusive use of the word \"Shree\" as if separately \\nand by itself it was also its registered trade mark \\nand that it would be easier for it to be successful in \\nan infringement action than in a passing off action. \\nIt was precisely the possibility of such an \\nextravagant and untenable claim that called for a \\ndisclaimer for the purpose of defining the rights of \\nthe respondent company under the registration\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t      (Emphasis supplied)\\n\\n \\t\\n \\tThe said decision has no application to the fact of this case.\\n\\tMr. Nariman is also not correct in contending that only a label has \\nbeen registered and not the name \\'Ramdev\\'.  Definition of \\'mark\\' as \\ncontained in Section 2(j) of the 1958 Act also includes name, signature, etc.\\n\\nSECTION 29 ISSUE\\n\\n \\tSection 28 of the 1958 Act confers the right of registration whereas \\nSection 29 thereof provides for the remedies for infringement of trade \\nmark.  What is needed by way of cause of action for filing a suit of \\ninfringement of trade mark is use of a deceptively similar mark which may \\nnot be identical.  What would be deceptively similar, as defined in Section \\n2(d) of the 1958 Act, would be a mark if it nearly resembles that other mark \\nas to be likely to deceive or cause confusion.  It is, therefore, not a case \\nwhere the respondents could raise valid defence in terms of Section 29 of \\nthe 1958 Act.\\n\\tThe right conferred in terms of Section 28 of the 1958 Act although \\nis required to be read with Sections 15 and 17 thereof but it is difficult to \\naccept that each part of the logo was required to be separately registered.  \\nSection 28 of the 1958 Act confers an exclusive right of using trade mark to \\na person who has got the trade mark registered in his name.  Such right is, \\nthus, absolute.  Sub-section (3) of Section 28 raises a legal fiction for the \\npurposes specified therein but we are not concerned therewith in the instant \\ncase.  Sub-section (2) of Section 29 inter alia provides for the defences.  \\nWe may not in this case go into the question as to whether it was \\nessential having regard to the provisions contained in the MOU that the \\nuser agreement should have been registered in terms of Section 49 of the \\n1958 Act as was opined by the High Court.  But, we have no doubt in our \\nmind that the user agreement having come to an end on 31st March, 1998, \\ni.e., on the expiry of seven years from the date of execution, the \\nrespondents could no more claim any right thereunder.  The user agreement \\nwas valid from 01.04.1991 to 31.03.1998.  The MOU came into force from \\n1.4.1998.  The right to user has not been conveyed by reason of the said \\nMOU.  The cut off date for determining the respective rights of the parties \\nwould, thus, be 1.4.1998.  Submission of the learned counsel that the MOU \\nfor the purpose of Section 28 of the 1958 Act should be read with the \\npartnership deed is not acceptable to us.  In fact, the respondents have \\nconsciously relinquished their right, if any.    \\nIt is not a case where Sections 48 and 49 of the 1958 Act would be \\napplicable so as to enable the respondents to raise a defence in terms of \\nSection 30(1)(b) thereof.  \\n  \\tIt is also not a case where non-registration of MOU as was the case \\nin Amteshwar Anand v. Virender Mohan Singh and Others [(2006) 1 SCC \\n148] was taken as a shield to defeat the purpose of the agreements entered \\ninto by and between the parties.  In that case, however, what was contended \\nwas that the agreement required registration in terms of Section 17(1) of the \\nRegistration Act whereas the High Court had found that the user agreement \\nwas not registered in terms of Section 49 of the Act holding:\\n\"The Composition Deed in this case was a \\ntransaction between the members of the same \\nfamily for the mutual benefit of such members. It \\nis not the appellants\\' case that the agreements \\nrequired registration under any other Act. Apart \\nfrom this, there is the principle that Courts lean in \\nfavour of upholding a family arrangement instead \\nof disturbing the same on technical or trivial \\ngrounds particularly when the parties\\' have \\nmutually received benefits under the arrangement.  \\nBoth the courts below had concurrently found that \\nthe parties had enjoyed material benefits under the \\nagreements. We have ourselves also re-scrutinized \\nthe evidence on record on this aspect and have \\nfound nothing to persuade us to take a contrary \\nview. Furthermore, in this case the agreements had \\nmerged in the decree of the Court which is also \\nexcepted under Sub-section 2(vi) of Section 17 of \\nthe Registration Act, 1908\"\\n\\tIn re Cadbury Brothers\\' Application (supra), it is stated:\\n\"It seems to me manifest that the registration of \\nthis trade mark cannot give rise to any rights \\nexcept a right to the mark as a whole.  It cannot \\ngive any statutory rights at all in respect of the \\nword \"Tudor\"; and, that being so, it is inexpedient \\nto place on the register an unnecessary disclaimer, \\nbecause the effect of so doing is to unsettle the law \\nand give rise to doubts in other cases, where such \\ndisclaimers are not inserted\"\\n \\tFor the self-same reason, this decision is also not applicable.\\nESSENCE OF PASSING OFF ACTION\\n\\n\\tIn a case of this nature, the test for determination of the dispute \\nwould be the same where a cause of action for passing off arises.  The \\ndeceptively similar test, thus, would be applicable herein.\\n \\tThe doctrine of passing off is a common law remedy whereby a \\nperson is prevented from trying to wrongfully utilise the reputation and \\ngoodwill of another by trying to deceive the public through \\'passing off\\' \\nhis goods.\\n \\tIn Kerly\\'s Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names\\' Supplement pages \\n42 and 43, paragraph 16-02, the concept of passing off is stated as under:\\n\"The law of passing-off can be summarised in one \\nshort general proposition no man may pass off his \\ngoods as those of another. More specifically, it \\nmay be expressed in terms of the elements which \\nthe plaintiff in such an action has to prove in order \\nto succeed. These are three in number. \\nFirstly, he must establish a goodwill or reputation \\nattached to the goods or services which he supplies \\nin the mind of the purchasing public by association \\nwith the identifying \\'get-up\\' (whether it consists \\nsimply of a brand name or a trade descrip- tion,or \\nthe individual features of labelling or packaging) \\nunder which his particular goods or services are \\noffered to the public, such that the get-up is \\nrecognised by the public as distinctive specifically \\nof the plaintiff\\'s goods or services. \\nSecondly, he must demonstrate a misrepresentation \\nby the defendant to the public (whether or not \\nintentional) leading or likely to lead the public to \\nbelief that the goods or services offered by him are \\nthe goods or services of the plaintiff.\\nThirdly, he must demonstrate that he suffers or, in \\na quick time action, that he is likely to suffer \\ndamage by reason of the erroneous belief \\nengendered by the defendant\\'s misrepresentation \\nthat the source of the defendant\\'s goods or service \\nis the same as the source of those offered by the \\nplaintiff...\" \\nPASSING OFF - INFRINGEMENT\\n\\n \\tAlthough, the defendant may not be using the actual trade mark of \\nthe plaintiff, the get up of the defendant\\'s goods may be so much like the \\nplaintiff\\'s that a clear case of passing off could be proved.  It is also \\npossible that the defendant may be using the plaintiff\\'s mark, the get up of \\nthe defendant\\'s goods may be so different from the get up of the plaintiff\\'s \\ngoods and the prices also may be so different that there would be no \\nprobability of deception of the public.  However, in an infringement action, \\nan injunction would be issued if it is proved that the defendant is \\nimproperly using the plaintiff\\'s mark.  In an action for infringement where \\nthe defendant\\'s trade mark is identical with the plaintiff\\'s mark, the Court \\nwill not enquire whether the infringement is such as is likely to deceive or \\ncause confusion.  The test, therefore, is as to likelihood of confusion or \\ndeception arising from similarity of marks is the same both in infringement \\nand passing off actions.  [See Ruston & Hornsby Ltd. v. The Zamindara \\nEngineering Co., (1969) 2 SCC 727]\\n\\n \\tIn Parle Products (P) Ltd. v. J.P. and Co., Mysore [(1972) 1 SCC \\n618], emphasis was laid on the broad and essential features of the \\nimpugned mark holding:\\n\"It would be enough if the impugned mark bears \\nsuch an overall similarity to the registered mark as \\nwould be likely to mislead a person usually dealing \\nwith one to accept the other if offered to him\"\\n \\tNoticing the similarity of the mark in question with that of the \\nimpugned mark, it was opined that \"if one was not careful enough to note \\nthe peculiar features of the wrapper on the plaintiffs\\' goods, he might easily \\nmistake the defendants\\' wrapper for the plaintiffs\\' if shown to him some \\ntime after he had seen the plaintiffs\\'\".\\n \\tIt was further stated:\\n\"After all, an ordinary purchaser is not gifted \\nwith the powers of observation of a Sherlock \\nHomes. We have therefore no doubt that the \\ndefendants\\' wrapper is deceptively similar to the \\nplaintiffs\\' which was registered. We do not think it \\nnecessary to refer to the decisions referred to at the \\nbar as in our view each case will have to be judged \\non its own features and it would be of no use to \\nnote on how many points there was similarity and \\nin how many others there was absence of it.\"\\nIn Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma v. Navaratna Pharmaceutical \\nLaboratories [AIR 1965 SC 980], this Court held:\\n\"These matters which are of the essence of \\nthe cause of action for relief on the ground of \\npassing off play but a limited role in an action for \\ninfringement of a registered trade mark by the \\nregistered proprietor who has a statutory right to \\nthat mark and who has a statutory remedy for the \\nevent of the use by another of that mark or a \\ncolourable imitation thereof. While an action for \\npassing off is a Common Law remedy being in \\nsubstance an action for deceit, that is, a passing off \\nby a person of his own goods as those of another, \\nthat is not the gist of an action for infringement. \\nThe action for infringement is a statutory remedy \\nconferred on the registered proprietor of a \\nregistered trade mark for the vindication of the \\nexclusive right to the use of the trade mark in \\nrelation to those goods\" (Vide Section 21 of the \\nAct). The use by the defendant of the trade mark of \\nthe plaintiff is not essential in an action for passing \\noff, but is the sine qua non in the case of an action \\nfor infringement. No doubt, where the evidence in \\nrespect of passing off consists merely of the \\ncolourable use of a registered trade mark, the \\nessential features of both the actions might \\ncoincide in the sense that what would be a \\ncolourable imitation of a trade mark in a passing \\noff action would also be such in an action for \\ninfringement of the same trade mark\\n\\n\\nIn Poddar Tyres Ltd. v. Bedrock Sales Corporation Ltd. and another \\n[AIR 1993 Bombay 237], Srikrishna, J., as His Lordship then was, repelled \\nthe contention that any trader who exclusively sells the goods bearing a \\nregistered trade mark, has a right to adopt a trade name which could include \\nthe said trade mark and that such adoption would not amount to \\ninfringement or passing off stating:\\n\"Mr. Rahimtoola was not able to cite any \\nauthority for the proposition propounded, which I \\nfind somewhat startling. The consequences of \\naccepting this proposition would mean that the \\nregistered proprietor would be at the mercy of \\nanyone who sells the goods bearing his trade mark. \\nIn a situation like the present, where the businesses \\nare overlapping, the trade channels are almost \\nidentical and the family background is \\nconspicuous, I am of the view that there would be \\nan inherent likelihood of confusion in the minds of \\nthe public that not only that the goods, which \\nemanate from the first defendants, are \"Bedrock\" \\ngoods, but also further that the first defendants\\' \\nbusiness is somehow intimately connected with the \\nplaintiffs\\', either as a branch, agency or otherwise. \\nThere is also the danger, as rightly emphasized by \\nthe plaintiffs, that any act or omission of the first \\ndefendants would have deleierious repercussion on \\nthe credit, reputation and goodwill of the plaintiffs \\nthemselves. For example, if the first defendants \\nwere to commit an act of insolvency or do any act \\nwhich tarnishes their reputation in the market, \\nthere is imminent likelihood of people jumping \\ninto the confused conclusion that the plaintiffs had \\ncommitted an act of insolvency or that they had \\ndone something objectionable. I am, therefore, \\nunable to accept the contention of the first \\ndefendant that, by their purportedly selling \\nexclusively \"Bedrock\" goods, they are entitled to \\nadopt the word \"Bedrock\" as a part of their \\ncompany name or trading style. That they have \\ndone so is not really disputed. In my view, \\ntherefore, there is both infringement and passing \\noff action, prima facie.\"\\nDe Cordova and Others v. Vick Chemical Co. [1951 (68) RPC 103] \\nis nearer the issue involved herein as in that case the registered trade mark \\nconsisting of the word \\'Vaporub\\' and another registered trade mark \\nconsisting of a design of which the words \\'Vicks Vaporub Salve\\' formed a \\npart.  The defendants in the suit advertised their ointment as \\'Karsote \\nVapour Rub\\'.  It was held that the defendants had infringed the registered \\ntrade mark.\\n \\tThe said decision was quoted with approval by this Court in K.R. \\nChinna Krishna Chettiar v. Shri Ambal and Co., Madras and Another [1969 \\n(2) SCC 131] wherein the question was whether the word \\'Ambal\\' \\nresembles the sound of the word \\'Andal\\'.  It was held to be so upon \\nrejecting an argument advanced on behalf of the defendant that the same \\nhad distinct meanings stating:\\n\"The Hindus in the south of India may be well \\naware that the words Ambal and Andal represent \\nthe names of two distinct Goddesses. But the \\nrespondent\\'s customers are not confined to Hindus \\nalone. Many of their customers are Christians, \\nParsees, Muslims and persons of other religious \\ndenominations. Moreover, their business is not \\nconfined to south of India. The customers who are \\nnot Hindus or who do not belong to the south of \\nIndia may not know the difference between the \\nwords Andal and Ambal. The words have no direct \\nreference to the character and quality of snuff. The \\ncustomers who use the respondent\\'s goods will \\nhave a recollection that they are known by the \\nword Ambal. They may also have a vague \\nrecollection of the portrait of a benign goddess \\nused in connection with the mark. They are not \\nlikely to remember the fine distinctions between a \\nVaishnavite goddess and a Shivaite deity\"\\n \\tWe may not lose sight of the fact that the mark was assigned in \\nfavour of the Company as far back in the year 1992.  The mark did not \\ncome to the company through MOU or otherwise.\\nLACHES AND ACQUIESCENCE\\n\\n\\n \\tThe plea of acquiescence on the part of the appellant herein has been \\nraised on two counts:\\n(i)\\tThe plaintiffs- appellant permitted the respondents to carry on \\nbusiness in the trade name of \\'Ramdev Masala\".\\n(ii)\\tIt is, thus, also not entitled to an order of injunction.\\n \\tThe appellant by a registered notice dated 12/15-12-1998 asked the \\ndefendant Nos. 1 and 7 that the firm \\'Ramdev Masala\\' had been \\nunauthorisedly using the appellant-company registered trade mark in \\nrespect of its product sold and manufactured by them and on the packing \\nmaterials, labels, boxes, poly pouches.  They were called upon to restrain \\nfrom doing so with immediate effect and destroy the necessary label/ \\npackets of packing materials failing which it was threatened that a legal \\naction would be taken.\\n \\tFor determining the said issues, we may notice the following facts. \\n \\tA civil suit was filed by the first respondent in the Ahmedabad City \\nCivil Court wherein a prayer was made that the deed of assignment be \\ndeclared null and void and the appellant herein be permanently restrained \\nfrom using the same as also for a declaration that they are the owners of the \\nsaid trade mark/trade name.  However, an interim order as prayed for \\ntherein was not granted.  A First Information Report was also lodged \\nagainst the respondents by the appellant-Company before the Madhupura \\nPolice Station for commission of an alleged offence under Section 63 of the \\nCopyright Act and Sections 78 and 79 of the 1958 Act as well as Sections \\n417, 420, 419 and 486 of the Indian Penal Code.  An application for \\nquashing the said complaint was filed before the Gujarat High Court on \\n4.8.1999.  It was dismissed by an order dated 26.10.1999.  A Special Leave \\nPetition preferred thereagainst being SLP (Crl.) No. 3900 of 1999 was also \\ndismissed by this Court by an order dated 14.12.1999.  In the meanwhile, a \\nrectification application was filed by the respondents before the Registrar \\nof Trade Mark, Mumbai allegedly stating that the registered trade mark \\nbearing No. 447700 was not being used by the plaintiff, it was not entitled \\nto continue to claim title thereover or use the same.  Various applications \\nwere moreover filed by the respondents herein for rectification of the entry \\nin the register in respect of various label marks of the appellant.  The \\nappellant thereafter issued a public notice on 17.12.1999 calling upon the \\nrespondents to restrain themselves from infringing upon the trade mark of \\nthe appellant, in respect whereto a public notice was also issued by the \\nrespondents herein on 21.12.1999.  The suit thereafter was filed on \\n10.2.2000.  Contention of the respondents in this behalf was that not only in \\nterms of the MOU the appellant had been allowed to carry on business \\nunder the name and style of \\'Ramdev Masala\\', no immediate step having \\nbeen taken after issuance of the public notice dated 15.12.1998 for long \\ntime, they were not entitled to obtain an order of injunction.  Delay in some \\ncases may defeat equity but the chronology of events noticed hereinbefore \\ndo not suggest that the appellant\\'s consciously allowed the respondents to \\nuse the trade mark.  \\nAcquiescence is a facet of delay.  The principle of acquiescence \\nwould apply where: (i)  sitting by or allow another to invade the rights and \\nspending money on it; (ii) it is a course of conduct inconsistent with the \\nclaim for exclusive rights for trade mark, trade name, etc.  \\n\\n\\tIn M/s. Power Control Appliances and Others v. Sumeet Machines \\nPvt. Ltd. [(1994) 2 SCC 448], this Court stated:\\n\"Acquiescence is sitting by, when another is \\ninvading the rights and spending money on it. It is \\na course of conduct inconsistent with the claim for \\nexclusive rights in a trade mark, trade name etc. It \\nimplies positive acts; not merely silence or \\ninaction such as is involved in laches\"\\n \\tIn an infringement of trade mark, delay by itself may not be a ground \\nfor refusing to issue injunction as has been observed by Lahoti, J. (as His \\nLordship then was) in Midas Hygiene Industries (P) Ltd. v. Sudhir Bhatia \\nand Others [(2004) 3 SCC 90] in the following terms:\\n\"The law on the subject is well settled. In cases of \\ninfringement either of trade mark or of copyright, \\nnormally an injunction must follow. Mere delay in \\nbringing action is not sufficient to defeat grant of \\ninjunction in such cases. The grant of injunction \\nalso becomes necessary if it prima facie appears \\nthat the adoption of the mark was itself dishonest.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t    (Emphasis supplied)\\n\\n \\tThe defence of acquiescence, thus, would be satisfied when the \\nplaintiff assents to or lay by in relation to the acts of another person and in \\nview of that assent or laying by and consequent acts it would be unjust in \\nall the circumstances to grant the specific relief.\\n \\tKerr in his \"Treatise on the Law and Practice of Injunction\", Sixth \\nEdition at pages 360-361 states as under:\\n\"Mere delay after knowledge of the infringement \\nto take proceedings, not sufficient to call the \\nStatute of Limitations into operation, or where the \\ninfringement continues, is not, it seems, a bar to \\nthe right of an injunction at the trial.  Lapse of time \\nunaccompanied by anything else is, it seems, no \\nmore a bar to a suit for an injunction in aid of the \\nlegal right than it is to an action deceit.\\n \\tBut delay may cause the Court to refuse an \\ninterlocutory injunction, especially if the defendant \\nhas built up a trade in which he has notoriously \\nused the mark\"\\n\\tSpecific knowledge on the part of the plaintiff and prejudice suffered \\nby the defendant is also a relevant factor. \\t[See Spry on Equitable \\nRemedies, Fourth Edition, page 433]\\n\\n \\tApplying the aforementioned principles in the instant case, it is \\nevident that the time gap between the issuance of the notice and filing of an \\napplication for grant of injunction was not a voluntary act on the part of the \\nappellant herein.  It had to wait for the outcome of various proceedings \\npending before different courts.  The respondents having themselves taking \\nrecourse to judicial proceedings, as noticed hereinbefore, cannot now be \\npermitted to set up the defence of acquiescence on the part of the appellant.  \\nIndisputably, in a case of infringement of trade mark, injunction would \\nordinarily follow where it is established that the defendant had infringed the \\ntrade mark and had not been able to discharge its burden as regard the \\ndefence taken by it.\\n \\tIn Pioneer Electronic Corporation and Another v. Registrar of Trade \\nMarks [(1978) RPC 716], an Australian Court referring to a large number \\nof decisions observed:\\n\"These cases demonstrate that the essential \\nrequirement for the maintenance of the validity of \\na trade mark is that it must indicate a connection in \\nthe course of trade with the registered proprietor, \\neven though the connection may be slight, such as \\nselection or quality control or control of the user in \\nthe sense in which a parent company controls a \\nsubsidiary.  Use by either the registered proprietor \\nor a licensee (whether registered or otherwise) will \\nprotect the mark from attack on the ground of non-\\nuser, but it is essential both that the user maintains \\nthe connection of the registered proprietor with the \\ngoods and that the use of the mark does not \\nbecome otherwise deceptive.  Conversely, \\nregistration of a registered user will not save the \\nmark if there ceases to be the relevant connection \\nin the course of trade with the proprietor or the \\nmark otherwise becomes deceptive.\"\\n \\t[See also Holly Hobbie Trade Mark, (1984) RPC 329.]\\n\\n\\nINJUNCTION ISSUE\\n\\nIt is although beyond any doubt or dispute that the defendant had \\nbeen manufacturing and selling its products; what is sought to be injuncted \\nis using a label which is deceptively similar to that of the plaintiff.\\n \\tOur attention has been drawn to the right of the parties of the second \\nand third part of the MOU to carry out export business in the brand name of \\n\\'Ramdev\\' which, in our opinion, does not advance their case as by reason \\nthereof, the appellant-Company had been also conferred right to carry on \\nthe export business in the name of \\'Ramdev\\'.\\n \\tIt is also not correct that having regard to the fact that the property \\nsituated at Sola having been given in favour of the respondents, they have \\nacquired a vested right in the trade mark as has been urged before us or \\notherwise.  Respondents did not have any right over the trade mark.  They \\nin fact, it will bear repetition to state, assigned the same in favour of the \\nappellant-Company.  They have assigned the said trade mark and having \\nrelinquished their right, Respondents, thus, now cannot fall back on Section \\n33 of the 1958 Act.  It may be true that there exists a distinction between a \\nsuit in a trade mark action against the whole world and a suit for \\nimplementation of division of assets amongst the members of the family. \\nBut, after the MOU was entered into the parties having separated ceased to \\nbe members of a joint family.  What was, thus, essential for determining the \\nright of the parties would be the terms of the MOU.\\n\\tRegistration of a trade mark and user thereof per se may lead to the \\nconclusion that the plaintiff has a prima facie case, however, existence \\nthereof would also depend upon the determination of the defences raised on \\nbehalf of the respondents.  The appellant has raised a triable issue.  The \\nsame by itself although may not be sufficient to establish a prima facie case \\nbut in view of our findings aforementioned, we are satisfied that the \\nappellant has been able to establish existence of a legal right in itself and \\nviolation of the registered trade mark on the part of the respondents.  We \\nhave also considered the comparable strength of the cases of the parties and \\nare of the opinion that the case of the plaintiff-appellant stands on a better \\nfooting than the defendants-respondents.\\n\\tA question as regards the matter relating to grant of injunction has \\nbeen dealt in S.M. Dyechem Ltd. v. Cadbury (India) Ltd. [(2000) 5 SCC \\n573] wherein upon noticing a large number of decisions including Colgate \\nPalmolive (India) Ltd. v. Hindustan Lever Ltd. [(1999) 7 SCC 1] as also the \\nsubsequent distinction made in respect of the decision of the House of \\nLords in American Cyanamid v. Ethicon Ltd. [(1975) 1 All ER 853], it was \\nstated :\\n\"Therefore, in trademark matters, it is now \\nnecessary to go into the question of \"comparable \\nstrength\" of the cases of either party, apart from \\nbalance of convenience.\\nIn M/s. Transmission Corporation of A.P., Ltd. v. M/s. Lanco \\nKondapalli Power Pvt. Ltd.  [JT 2005 (10) SC 542], it was held :\\n \\t\"The interim direction ordinarily would \\nprecede finding of a prima facie case.  When \\nexistence of a prima facie case is established, the \\ncourt shall consider the other relevant factors, \\nnamely, balance of convenience and irreparable \\ninjuries. The High Court in its impugned judgment \\nalthough not directly but indirectly has considered \\nthis aspect of the matter when on merit it noticed \\nthat the Appellant has raised a dispute as regard \\npayment of an excess amount of Rs.35 crores \\nalthough according to the Respondent a sum of \\nRs.132 crores is due to it from the Appellant and \\nthe Appellant had been paying the amount for the \\nlast two years as per the contract.\\nConduct of the parties is also a relevant factor.  If \\nthe parties had been acting in a particular manner \\nfor a long time upon interpreting the terms and \\nconditions of the contract, if pending \\ndetermination of the lis,  an order is passed that the \\nparties would continue to do so, the same would \\nnot render the decision as an arbitrary one, as was \\ncontended by Mr. Rao.  Even the Appellant had \\nprayed for adjudication at the hands of the \\nCommission in the same manner.  Thus, it itself \\nthought that the final relief would be granted only \\nby the Arbitrator.\"\\n \\tWe also do not appreciate the conduct of the respondents.  They were \\naware of the rights under the MOU.  They had all along been enforcing the \\nsame.  Legal defence were available to them under the 1958 Act.  \\nEvidently, they filed a suit to scuttle the intended action on the part of the \\nrespondents pursuant to the public notice dated 15.12.1998.\\n In P.M. Diesels Ltd.  v. Patel Field Marshal Agencies & Others \\n[2001 PTC 20 (Del)], the High Court noticed the distinction between logo, \\ntrade mark and trade name and was of the view that the defendants cannot \\nbe permitted to use the trade name so as to defeat the other portion of the \\norder of injunction already passed against him.  An injunction can also be \\ngranted against the respondents to use the corporate name.\\n\\tRelief by way of interlocutory injunction would be material in a suit \\nfor infringement of trade mark.  Balance of convenience, however, would \\nhave a vital role to play.\\nWe are not oblivious of the fact that respondents have been \\nmanufacturing and carrying on business in the sale of spices under the \\nname \\'Ramdev Masala\\' even during pendency of the suit.  The learned \\nTrial Judge had made an attempt to strike the balance.  The High Court, \\nhowever, had overturned a part of it having regard to the statutory interdict \\ncontained in the Rules made under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act \\nand Standards of Weights and Measures Act.\\n \\tKerly\\'s Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names, Thirteenth Edition \\nstates as under about the general test for grant of an interim injunction:\\n\"In trade-mark infringement cases irreparable \\ndamage, in this sense, is relatively easily shown, \\nsince infringement may easily destroy the value \\nof a mark or at least nullify expensive advertising \\nin a way that is hard to quantify for the purposes \\nof an inquiry into damages.  This has more \\nrecently come to be referred to, in cases where the \\ndefendant\\'s conduct is not directly damaging but \\nmerely reduces the distinctive character of the \\nclaimant\\'s mark, as \"dilution\".\\n\\tIn particular, although it is usually \\nneither necessary nor appropriate to assess the \\ndegree of probability of success which the \\nclaimant\\'s action has (provided that it is arguable, \\nand subject to the principle of American \\nCyanamid that the merits may be resorted to as a \\n\\'tie-breaker\\' if the balance of convenience is very \\neven,) in trade mark and passing off cases, it is \\nvery hard to avoid doing so, since the better the \\nclaimant\\'s case on the likelihood of deception \\n(frequently the major issue) the greater the harm \\nwhich he is likely to suffer.  Accordingly, in \\nappropriate cases, where the state of the evidence \\npermits it, the court may seek to weigh up the \\nmerits in deciding whether to grant interim \\nrelief.\"\\n \\tThus, when a prima facie case is made out and balance of \\nconvenience is in favour of the appellant, it may not be necessary to show \\nmore than loss of goodwill and reputation to fulfil the condition of \\nirreparable injury.  In fact, if the first two pre-requisites are fulfilled, in \\ntrade mark actions irreparable loss can be presumed to have taken place.  \\n\\tThe expression \"irreparable injury\" in that sense would have \\nestablished injury which the plaintiff is likely to suffer.\\n In Mahendra & Mahendra Paper Mills Ltd. v. Mahindra & Mahindra \\nLtd. [(2002) 2 SCC 147], this Court observed:\\n\"23. The Bombay High Court in the case of \\nKirloskar Diesel Recon (P) Ltd. v. Kirloskar \\nProprietary Ltd. considered the scope of granting \\ninjunction in a suit for infringement of a trade \\nmark under Section 106 of the Act by the use of \\nthe mark \"Kirloskar\", held:\\n\"The principle of balance of convenience applies \\nwhen the scales are evenly balanced. The existence \\nof the 1st appellant in each appeal is very recent \\nwhereas the existence of the respondents belonging \\nto \\'Kirloskar Group of Companies\\' has been for \\nover a period of 50 years. On their own showing, \\nthe appellants are not using the word \\'Kirloskar\\' as \\ntrade mark but as part of trading style whereas the \\nrespondents have not only acquired distinctiveness \\nand goodwill in the word \\'Kirloskar\\' but it is even \\nthe registered trade mark of the 1st respondent. \\nThere is sufficient evidence on record to show that \\nthe huge business is carried by \\'Kirloskar Group of \\nCompanies\\'.\\nThere is nothing on record to show the extent of \\nthe business of the appellants. The 2nd appellant \\nhas throughout been aware about the business \\nreputation of the respondents and efforts of the \\nrespondents in protecting their rights in the trade \\nmarks as also of preventing others to use the word \\n\\'Kirloskar\\' as a part of the trading name or trading \\nstyle. By grant of the interim injunction in favour \\nof the respondents, the appellants are not prevented \\nfrom carrying on business without the word \\n\\'Kirloskar\\' forming part of the corporate name of \\nthe 1st appellant in each appeal. In the facts of the \\ncase, the respondents\\' reputation is likely to be \\nadversely affected if the appellants are not \\nprevented from using name of the 1st appellant in \\neach appeal. In the facts of the case, the balance of \\nconvenience is not in favour of the appellants.\\n\\t\\t*\\t\\t*\\t\\t*\\nThe real question in each case is whether there is \\nas a result of misrepresentation a real likelihood of \\nconfusion or deception of the public and \\nconsequent damage to the plaintiff. The focus is \\nshifted from the external objective test of making \\ncomparison of activities of parties to the state of \\nmind of public in deciding whether it will be \\nconfused. With the passage of time and reputation \\nacquired, the trade mark \\'Kirloskar\\' has acquired \\nthe secondary meaning and has become almost a \\nhousehold word. The judgments relied upon by Mr \\nKane pertain to the cases of one type of business \\nand not where variety of businesses have been \\ncarried by the plaintiff and the defendant as in the \\ninstant case. The business activities of the \\nrespondents vary from pin to piano as borne out \\nfrom the object clauses of the memorandums of \\nassociation of the respondents. The appellants have \\nstill to commence their business activities but as \\nmentioned in the memorandums of association of \\nthe 1st appellant in each appeal, some of the object \\nclauses therein overlap with the activities of \\nrespondents and more particularly of Respondents \\n6 and 7.\"\\nAPPELLATE COURT\\'S JURISDICTION TO INTERFERE WITH \\nORDERS OF THE TRIAL JUDGE\\n\\n\\tWe are not oblivious that normally the appellate court would be \\nslow to interfere with the discretionary jurisdiction of the trial court.\\nThe grant of an interlocutory injunction is in exercise of \\ndiscretionary power and hence, the appellate courts will usually not \\ninterfere with it. However, appellate courts will substitute their discretion \\nif they find that discretion has been exercised arbitrarily, capriciously, \\nperversely, or where the court has ignored settled principles of law \\nregulating the grant or refusal of interlocutory injunctions. This principle \\nhas been stated by this court time and time again. [See for example \\nWander Ltd. v. Antox India P. Ltd (1990) Supp SCC 727, Lakshmikant V. \\nPatel v. ChetanBhai Shah (2002) 3 SCC 65 and Seema Arshad Zaheer v. \\nMC of Greater Mumbai (2006) 5 SCALE 263]\\n\\n \\tThe appellate court may not reassess the material and seek to reach a \\nconclusion different from the one reached by the court blow if the one \\nreached by that court was reasonably possible on the material. The \\nappellate court would normally not be justified in interfering with the \\nexercise of discretion under appeal solely on the ground that if it had \\nconsidered the matter at the trial stage it would have come to a contrary \\nconclusion. \\n\\tHowever, in this case the courts below proceeded on a prima facie \\nmisconstruction of documents.  They adopted and applied wrong \\nstandards.  We, therefore, are of the opinion that a case for interference has \\nbeen made out.\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n \\tOur findings aforementioned, it goes without saying, are prima facie \\nin nature.  We place on record that Mr. Nariman contended that there is \\nevidence to show the contrary intention of the parties in respect whereof a \\nlarge number of documents are available.  Evidently respondents may \\nprove.  No such document is, however, before us.  If the respondents, at the \\ntrial, could bring the same on record, evidently the court would be entitled \\nto draw its own inference.  \\n \\tWe have differed with the findings of the courts below primarily on \\nthe interpretation of the MOU.  In that view of the matter, we are of the \\nopinion that in this case this Court would be justified to interfere with the \\nsaid findings.  We are, however, not oblivious of the damages which may \\nhave to be suffered by respondents herein in the event the suit of the \\nappellant is to be ultimately dismissed.  We intend to protect the same also.\\n \\tFor the said purpose, we would take into consideration the terms of \\nthe injunction granted by the Trial Judge that the respondents were entitled \\nto sell their products in the name of M/s. Ram Dev Masala only from the \\nseven outlets.  The modification made by the High Court has already been \\nnoticed by us.\\n \\tWe, in view of our findings aforementioned, direct:\\n(i)\\tThe respondents be restrained from using the trade mark  \\nincluding the trade name \\'Ramdev Masala\\' in any of their \\nproducts.\\n(ii)\\tThey may, however, carry on their business in any other name \\ninsofar as manufacturing of spices is concerned.\\n(iii)\\tThe appellant shall, as and when demands are made, supply \\nspices produced by it for retail sale thereof to seven outlets \\nbelonging to respondents on usual terms, and in respect of such \\narticles on the labels/pouches, on the reverse thereof, the \\nfollowing shall be mentioned in the minimum permissible size in \\nterms of the provisions of Weights and Measures Act and \\nPrevention of Food Adulteration Act:\\n\"This product is manufactured and marketed by M/s.

       "     'content': 'JUDGMENT \\n \\n\\nJ.B. Goel, J.\\n1. Plaintiff No. 1, M/s. Anand Kumar Pradeep Kumar, a partnership firm constituted by Shiv Rattan Aggarwal, Manmohan Lal Aggarwal and Madhu Sudan Aggarwal and plaintiff No. 2 Shiv Kishan Aggarwal all sons of Late Mool Chand have filed a suit for permanent injunction against the defendents alleging that they are the registered proprietors of the trade mark and continuous user through their ancestors since 1941 of the trade mark name and trade mark \"HALDIRAM BHUJIAWALA\". They had strated a shop at 1454, Chandni Chowk, Delhi and doing business there since 1983 using the said \\ntrade mark. The defendents intended to start a new shop to carry on similar business under the same tradename and with the same trademark at Karol Bagh, New Delhi. They sought an injunction. The suit was intially filed in the Court of the District Judge, Delhi on 10.12.1991. However, subsequently, the plaintiff amended the plaint incorporating claim for recovery of damages of Rs. 6.00 lakhs which exceeded the pecuniary jurisdiction of that Court and the plaint was returned under Order 7, Rule 10A of the Code of Civil Procedure (for short the Code). The suit was presented in this Court \\non 17.2.1992. \\n2. Briefly the case of the plaintiffs is that late Shri Ganga Bishan who was also known as Haldiram Bhujiawala, had been doing his business of manufacture and sale of salted preparations like Bhujia, papads and sweets etc. since his chilhood since before 1941 under the name and style of \" Chand Mal Ganga Bishan\" and \"HALDIRAM BHUJIAWALA\" initially in Bikaner and later on also started in Calcutta he formed a partnership firm in the year 1965 under the name and style of M/s. Chand Mal Ganga Bishan with four partners: (1) Ganga Bishan (himself), (2) Mool Chand (his son), (3) Shiv \\nKishan (son of Mool Chand) and (4) Smt. Kamla Devi, w/o Shri Rameshwar Lal(his daughter in law). The said firm had adopted the trademark of HALDIRAM BHUJIAWALA\".\\n3. On 29.12.1972, the said four partners applied to the Registrar of Trademarks for the registration of the said trademark in Class 30. The trademark was advertised in Trademark journal and in due course was registered as No. 285062 ( on 27.1.1981) as on 29.12.1972 in respect of sale of Bhujia, papad fried, namkeen, saltish dal etc. in class 30 in Part A in India except the State of West Bengal in the names of the aforesaid following four partners of the firm, namely: \\n   1. Shri Ganga Bishan @ Haldiram,\\n   2. Shri Mool Chand,\\n   3. Shri Shiv Kishan, and \\n   4. Smt. Kamla Devi.\\n4. The said partnership firm was dissolved by means of dissolution deed dated 16.11.1974 and thereby the registered trade mark No. 285062 was allotted/assigned exclusively to Shri Mool Chand for the whole of India Except the State of West Bengal; and it was agreed that in the territory of the State of West Bengal Smt. Kamla Devi or her representatives could carry on similar business there. Relevant Clause No. 3, 7, and 8 of the Dissolution Deed dated 16.11.1974 provide as under : \\n \"3 That the Second Party shall be entitled to carry on the said business under the name and style of M/s CHANDMAL GANGABISHAN also trading as HALDIRAM BHUJIAWALA having its Head Office at Bhujia Bazar, Bikaner and/or at such other place or places, as he may think fit and proper under the said or style.

Mool Chand is described as party No. 2 and Smt. Kamla Devi as party No. 4.] \\n \\n\\n6. Shri Rameshwar Lal husband of Smt. Kamla Devi simutaneously by a seperate writing of same date also had acknowledged, declared and recognised this right of Mool Chand as a sole/exclusive user and propietor of this trademark. That writing reads as under: \\n \"Dated:16.11.1974. \\nTO WHOM SO EVER IT MAY CONCERN\\n \\n\\n This is to confirm that the name Haldi Ram Bhujiawala (HRB) which was originally adopted and used by my father since 1941 shall remain the sole property of my brother Mool Chand and his representatives for whole of India except the State of West Bengal. I or any of my representatives shall not claim any further right on this and I shall trade under the name Haldi Ram Bhujiawala in West Bengal only. \\n sd/- \\n (RAMESHWAR LAL AGGARWAL) \\n\\n \\n\\n7. Ganga Bishan died in 1980. Mool Chand also died on 30.7.1985 leaving behind him his four sons, namely, Shiv Kishan Aggarwal, Shiv Rattan Aggarwal, Manohar Lal Aggarwal and Madhu Sudan Aggarwal, besides two daughters and his wife. The widow and the two daughters gave \"no objections\", thereby relinquishing their right in the said trademark and agreeing for transfer of the registration of the trademark in the names of the aforesaid four sons of Mool Chand. These four sons of Mool Chand had made an application before the Registrar Trade Marks on 22.11.1985 for renewal and transmission of the said Registered Trade Mark No. 285062 in their names. Their application was allowed and they have been registered as subsequent proprietors of the said trade mark as from 30.7.1985, and the trademark was renewed in their names for 7 years ending on 28.12.1986 as per certificate issued on 28.2.1989. The trade mark was further renewed in their names for 7 years from 29.12.1993. After the institution of this suit the aforsaid four persons have formed a company under the Companies Act, 1956 with the name of M/s. Haldiram India (Pvt.) Ltd. having registered office at B-1/H8, Mohan Cooperative Industrial Estate, Mathura Road, New Delhi and on their application this trade mark was transfered and the said caompany has been \\nregistered as subsequent proprietors of the said trademark as from 27.7.1995. The trademark now stands renewed upto 29.12.2000 in the name of the company. \\n8. Plaintiff No. 1, the partnership firm had strated their business at 1454, Chandni Chowk, Delhi in the year of 1983 doing the same business and using the registered trademark \" Haldiram Bhujiawala\" . It is alleged that the defendants had never carried on the business anywhere else except in Calcutta not they were entitled to carry on business beyond West Bengal and they are not entitled to do business at Karol Bagh, Delhi under the name of Haldiram Bhujiawala nor entitled to use the trademark \"Haldiram Bhujiawala\". And their threat/intention to start such business was illegal. Alongwith the suit an application for ad interim injunction was filed before the learned District Judge. Temporary injunction was granted by the learned Additional District Judge on 10.12.1991. \\n9. The defendants in their written statement have disputed the claim of the plaintiff. They have pleaded that their father late Shri Rameshwar Lal Aggarwal was the first invento, adopter and user of this trade mark since the year 1958, (as against plaintiff\\'s claim since 1965) and doing his business under this tradename and trademark since then; who had also made application for the registeration of this trademark in class 30 in the names of Shri Rameshwar Lal Aggarwal and Shri Prabhu Shanker Aggarwal trading at 7, Jugmohan Mullick Lane, Calcutta-7 claiming its user since \\n1958, which was registered as No. 330375, and later on the trademark was registered in their names as per certificate dated September 11,1980 as on 2.11.1977 and they have been using this trademark continuously. It is thus claimed that they being the prior user of the trademark have better and overriding rights over the rights of the plaintiffs. \\n10. Arguments have been addressed at length. Both claiming roght on the basis of prior user. \\n11. Two questions arise: (1) Who are the first adopters/users of the trademark; and (2) What is the effect of assignment of the trademark in question to be exclusively used by Mool Chand by virtue of dissolution deed dated 16.11.1974? \\n12. It is not disputed that the parties in the suit are the successors (grandsons) of late Shri Ganga Bishan, plaintiff being the sons of his son Mool Chand whereas defendants are the sons of his other son Rameshwar Lal. Both the parties have relied on documents in support of their respective claim. \\n13. It appears that some third party namely Haldiram Madan Lal trading at Calcutta had also sought registration of this very trademark \"Haldiram Bhujiawala\" through Application No. 284166 B in Class 30. Ganga Bishan @ Haldiram s/o Chandmal then aged 75 years had opposed it and in his affidavit filed in Opposition No. CAL-1048 on 25.6.1976, in paras 1 and 2 of his affidavit he had claimed as under: \\n 1. That \"HALDIRAM\" is my nick- name and I have been commonly known and called by the name Haldiram than personal name \"GANGAB ISHAN\".\\n 2. That from my very young age I have been in the business of manufacturing and sale of Bhujia, Papad, Namkin and Sweet-Meals and have been trading under the Trade Name \"HALDIRAM BHUJIAWALA\" at Bikaner. The tradename Haldiram Bhujiawala is presently being used by me.... \\n XXX XXXX XXX\\n\\n \\n\\n14. Rameshwar Lal Aggarwal ( Predecessor-in-interest of the defendants) in Opposition Proceedings against his Application No. 330375 for registration of the trademark in his name, in para 3 of his affidavit dated 19.6.1978 has been admitted the use of this trademark by his father, as under : \\n  3. .....Haldiram form the essential part of the trademark of the firm of my father who was trading in the name and style of \"Haldiram Bhujiawala\" since his young age\".\\n15. This admission made by the predecessor-in-interest of the defendants would bind the latter. It shows that this tradename and trademark was not invented/adopted first by Shri Rameshwar Lal as now claimed by defendants, but by his father late Shri Ganga Bash an since his childhood using the tradename of Haldiram Bhujiawala in the course of his business. Shri Ganga Bishan died in the year 1980 at the age of over 75 years. He must have been using this tradename for over 40 years before his death as claimed by the plaintiffs. \\n16. Plaintiffs have placed on record copy of Certificate No. 137011 dated 27.1.1981 whereby this trademark \" Haldiram Bhujiawala\" (with the logo HRB in a particulars design) has been registered as No. 285062 w.e.f. 29.12.1972 in Class 30 for India except the State of West Bengal in the name of (1) Ganga Bishan @ Haldiram, (2) Mool Chand, (3) Shiv Krishan and (4) Kamla Devi trading under the name of \"Haldiram Bhujiawala\" and \"Chand Mal Ganga Bishan\", Bhujia Bazar, Bikaner. They as parners were using this trademark and their partnership firm was dissolved on the terms agreed in dissolution deed dated 16.11.1974. In its Clauses 3,7, and 8 already reproduced, Shri Ganga Bishan, Shiv Krishan and Smt. Kamla Devi had eliquished/assigned their right and claim in this trade mark in favour of Mool Chand exclusively for the whole of India except the State of West Bengal. \\n17. Shri Rameshwar Lal, husband of Kamla Devi had also bound himself to this effect in his declaration dated 16.11.1974 given simutaneously, Smt. Kamla Devi and her husband and for that matter their heirs and successors are bound by this and they can use the trademark only within the State of West Bengal and not beyond that. On the death of Mool Chand on 30.7.1985, on the application made on 22.11.1985 by his four sons, namely, Shiv Krishan, Shiv Rattan, Manohar Lal and Madhu Sudan to the registration of the trademark was transferred in their names vide certificate dated 28.2.1989 issued by the Registrar of Trademarks inter alia recognising their claim/right on the basis of the said dissolution deed dated 16.11.1974 and as successors in interest of Mool Chand nad trademark was renewed in their names and later this trade mark has been transferred in the name of the aforesaid company formed by them. \\n18. Plaintiff No. 1 a partnership firm constituted by three of the sons of Mool Chand, namely, Madhusudan, Shiv Rattan and Manohar Lal, had started their business at 1454, Chandni Chowk, Delhi on the year 1983 doing the same business under the same trademark. The fact of their doing this business since 1983 at Delhi is not disputed by the defendants in their written statement. Plaintiff No. 2 is the fourth son of Mool Chand who has been registered as joint user with them. The Plaintiffs who are the successors in interest of late Ganga Bishan as well as of Mool Chand are thus the registered proprietors of this trademark having registration as from 29.12.1972. They are also prior user of the tradename and the trade mark in question in Territory other than Calcutta. Use or adoption of this trade mark by Rameshwar Lal as alleged even if it is from the year 1958 has been in Calcutta only as they have not been using the tradename or trademark in Delhi or rather beyond West Bengal. And by virtue of dissolution deed dated 16.11.1974, this trademark has been assigned exclusively to Shri Mool Chand for use in India except the State of West Bengal. Parties to this settlement and their successors in interest are bound by it. The defendant are thus bound by this settlement dated 16.11.1974 and as such they cannot claim any right contrary to its terms. The material placed on record also shows that the defendants have been using this trade mark in relation to their business primarily in Calcutta. In any case it is not their case that they had been doing business in Delhi before this suit was filed on 10.12.1991 nor sale figures in Delhi have been made available. \\n19. It is also seen that the application for registration of this trademark was filed with the Registrar (Trademarks) on 2.11.1977 in the names of Shri Rameshwar Lal Aggarwal and Shri Prabhu Shankar Aggarwal trading at 9, Jagmohan Mullick Lane, Calcutta-7 (which was later on registered as No. 330375 in Class 30 on 11.9.1980) was advertised in the Trademark Journal No. 734 dated January 19,1980 wherein its use was claimed only in Calcutta. Before this application was advertised, the Office of the Registrar had raised an objection in their letter No. U-3/996 dated 14.4.1978, inter alia, to the effect that the trademark \" Haldiram\" was already pending consideration in application No. 285062. To this, a reply dated 18.7.1978 was filed on behalf of the applicants by Shri R. N. Prabhakar as their Advocate/Attorney, and in para 5 of which he has stated as under : \\n 5. As regards the cited pending trademark under Application No. 285062, it is to submit that applicants are the only firm trading under the name Haldiram Bhujiawala at Calcutta and no application is pending in the name of the applicants. \\n20. Obviously, it was intended and was so represented on behalf of the applicants (No. 330375) that the registration was sought for use of the trade mark only in Calcutta. That was obviously in consonance with the \\nright reserved to them under the dissolution deed dated 16.11.1974 and otherwise available to them. \\n21. Further in support of his Application No. 330375 by way of evidence,Rameshwar Lal had filed his affidavit dated 19.6.1978 wherein also he has not alleged or claimed that he was using this trademark outside Calcutta or beyond the State of West Bengal. \\n22. Shri R.N. Prabhakar, Advocate had acted for and represented the (plaintiffs)/applicant in Trade Mark No. 285062 made for registration of the trademark on 29.12.1972 and it was he who had pursued and got the registration transferred in the names of four sons of Mool Chand vide certificate dated 27.1.1981 from the office of the Registrar, Trade Marks, Shri R.N. Prabhakar, Advocate, had also made the other Application (No. 330375) for registration of the trademark on behalf of Rameshwar Lal and Prabhu Shankar Aggarwal on 2.11.1977 it was within his knowledge about the respective rights of the parties in his trademark though in this application or even in reply dated 18.7.1978 he has not categorically disclosed and declared that the applicants were entitled to the use of the trademark and tradename in and not beyond the State of West Bengal, however , he intention obviously was to get the trademark registered for use in Calcutta only. Otherwise it would be a deliberate attempt on his part to have cancealed a material fact to obtain registration in the latter\\'s name . The registrar has not appreciated it and has overlooked that Shri Rameshwar Lal and Prabhu Shankar had claimed registration for use in Calcutta only obviously ignored the application No. 285062 filed on 29.12.1972 for registration of this trade mark for India in names of four other persons already pending consideration and the trademark was registered (330375) vide certificate issued on 11.9.1980. Registration of trade mark on the basis of application (No. 285062) filed on 29.12.1972 is intriguing. There could not be two similar registered trademarks in respect of same goods operating simultaneously. Either the Registrar has been misled or the said Registration No. 330375 has been granted fraudulently and in collusion with the applicants. In respect of a registered trademark , the rights of the parties are to be determined as at the date of application. And Sec. 12(1) of the Act is bar against registered of an identical trademark which is already registered in the name of a different proprietor. Concurrent use by two or more persons of the same trademark for the same goods is completely contrary to the whole essence of trademark jurisprudence for a trademark is intended to denote that the goods come from one source and one source only. \\n23. It appears that after the plaintiff came to know about the registration of this trademark in the name of the defendants/their predecessor, they lodged an opposition with the Registrar, Trade Mark. Though that was disallowed but appeal is admittedly pending before the High Court Calcutta. The registration of the trademark in the name of defendants/their predeceassor in interest having effect beyond the State of West Bengal thus is under dispute. Fraud vitiates all transactions. Registration of the trademark obtained by fraud would not acquire finally/immunity from challenge under Section 32(a) of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 (for short \"the Act\") Which provides as under :- \\n32. Registration to be conclusive as to validity after seven years. - Subject to the provisions of Section 35 and Section 46, in all legal proceedings relating to a trademark registered in Part A of the register including applications undersection 56 (,the original registration of the trademark shall, after the expiry of seven years from the date of such registration, be taken to be avoid in all respect unless it is proved-\\n (a) that the original registration was obtained by fraud ; or\\n \\n\\n (b) xx xx xxx\\n \\n\\n (c) xx xx xx \\n\\n \\n\\n24. A party would not be allowed to take advantage of its own fraud and as such prima facie this trademark could not be availed by the defendants beyond the State of West Bengal. \\n25. The following result emerges from the above discussion:- \\n 1. Late Shri Ganga Bishan who was also known as Haldiram Bhjiawala was the inventor/first adopter and first user of the  tradename \"Haldiram Bhujiawala\" which he had adopted since  his childhood in or before 1941 and he has been doing business in this tradename. \\n 2. He had adopted and used this trademark \"Haldiram Bhujiawala\"  with the logo of \"HRB\" in a particular shape and design  since 1965 while doing business in a partnership under the  names and style of: (1) Chand Mal Ganga Bishan and (2)  Haldiram Bhujiawala with four partners, namely, Ganga Bishan  (himself), Mool Chand, Shiv Kishan and Smt. Kamla Devi. \\n 3. By means of dissolution deed dated 16.11.1974, the trademark  was exclusively assigned to Shri Mool Chand for use in India  except the State of West Bengal. \\n 4. Smt. Kamla Devi who was a party to the dissolution deed as a partner us bound by the terms of this issolution deed. \\n 5. Rameshwar Lal, predecessor-in-interest of the defendants has  also bound himself in his simultaneous declaration made on  16.11.1974 confirming/accepting the same. \\n 6. After the dissolution of the firm 16.11.1974 Shri Mool Chand exclusively became entitled to the use of this trademark in \\n India except in the State of West Bengal. \\n 7. After the death of Shri Mool Chand, this trademark was  transferred to his four sons, namely, Shiv Kishan Aggarwal,  Shiv Rattan Aggarwal, Manohar Lal Aggarwal and Madhu Sudan  Aggarwal w.e.f. July 30, 1985. \\n And they became the registered subsequent proprietor of this  trademark. \\n 8. Subsequently, this trademark was assigned/transferred in the  name of the company Haldiram (India) Pvt. Ltd. in 1995. \\n 9. Defendants or their predecessor-in-interest - Ramashwar Lal  was doing his business only in Calcutta. \\n 10. The plaintiff No.,1 M/s. Anand Kumar, comprising of three  sons of Mool Chand had started a shop in Chandni Chowk in  the year 1983 and using the said trademark. They are prior  used of this trademark in Delhi. They thus are both registered proprietors as well as prior used of this trademark. \\n26. The defendants prima facie are not entitled to its use. They have started a shop in ?Delhi in February, 1992 after this suit was filed, using the tradename trademark of \"Haldiram Bhujiawala\" which is infringement of \\nthe registered trade mark of plaintiff, or in any case passing off. \\n27. Plaintiff have thus prima facie case in their favour. \\n28. Defendants had no business in Delhi when the suit was filed. As such the question of their suffering any legal injury, damage or loss does arise. The balance of convenience is also in favour of the plaintiff as if the defendants are allowed to use indentical trademark concurrently, this will create confusion among the public and loss, harm and injury to the plaintiff. Plaintiff have thus made out a strong case of grant of temporary injunction. \\n29. This application is accordingly allowed and it is hereby ordered as under: \\n 1. Defendants, their agents/representatives/servants or successors-in-interest are hereby restrained by means of interim  injunction from using the tradename and or/trademark \"Haldiram Bhujiawala\" with or without the logo, as registered vide  Registration No. 285062 or any other trade mark identical or  deceptively similar thereto, in India except the State of  West Bengal; \\n 2. The defendants shall submit within two months, statement of  accounts showing the details of the sales made by them in  Delhi since 10.12.1991 using this tradename and /or trademark verifying its correctness on affidavit; \\n 3. The defendants shall make discovery on affidavit within one  month of all the documents, account books, papers etc.  relating to such business since 10.12.1991 and shall filed  an undertaking that they shall not destroy or part with such  documents till further orders of this Court; and\\n \\n\\n 4. They shall make available for inspection by the plaintiffs  all such documents, account books, papers, etc. pertaining  to the said business, if so required. \\n30. Application allowed. \\n'}},\n",

The present suit has been filed for perpetual injunction\\n\\nrestraining passing off and infringement of trade mark, rendition of\\n\\naccounts, damages etc. Plaintiff no. 1 is a permanent resident of Delhi\\n\\nand is the sole proprietor of the trade mark „Anantam‟ registered under\\n\\n\\n\\nCS (OS) No. 602/2009                                            Page 1 of 15\\n No. 1248372 dated 7th November, 2003 in Class 24 and No. 1254084\\n\\ndated 9th December, 2003 in Class 25 with regard to all kinds of\\n\\nreadymade garments like handkerchiefs, dhotis, tissues(piece goods, bed\\n\\nand table covers), lungis etc. The business of these goods is being\\n\\ncarried out from the trade mark „Anantam‟ from the residence of\\n\\nplaintiff no. 1 which is C-2/29, Model Town, Delhi- 110009.\\n\\n3.          The plaintiff no. 1 has been using the said trade mark since\\n\\nSeptember, 2003. From 1st April, 2004 a partnership firm was\\n\\nconstituted by plaintiff no. 1 along with plaintiffs no. 2 and 3 who are\\n\\nher son and daughter respectively and together, the plaintiffs opened up\\n\\na showroom of readymade garments and apparel in shop no. 8-9, First\\n\\nFloor, Metropolitan Mall, MG Road, Gurgaon, Haryana. A partnership\\n\\nfirm by the name of M/s. Anantam was thus created, and the same is\\n\\nplaintiff no. 4 herein.\\n4.          The plaintiffs have submitted that the name Anantam slowly\\n\\nbecame synonymous for quality, durability and the latest designs so\\n\\nmuch so that people from all over India and abroad became its customers\\n\\nand with time, plaintiff no. 1 has come to be referred to as Anantam.\\n\\nFurther, the plaintiffs‟ products have been advertised on television too.\\n\\nThe news channels AAJ TAK and NDTV have taken video shots of the\\n\\nplaintiffs‟ outlet and have aired the same. The increase in sales of the\\n\\nplaintiff no. 4 firm has been from Rs. 1,53,74,331.25 in 2004-05 to Rs.\\n\\n3,48,50,644/- in 2007-08 i.e. more than double in four years. The\\n\\nplaintiffs have acquired a vast amount of goodwill by the name of\\n\\n\\n\\nCS (OS) No. 602/2009                                           Page 2 of 15\\n Anantam.\\n5.         Some time in April, 2007 when an employee of the plaintiffs\\n\\nwent to purchase raw material from the market, the same was refused by\\n\\nshopkeepers who stated that the plaintiffs‟ branch at Jaipur had defaulted\\n\\nin making certain payments and hence, the plaintiffs could not purchase\\n\\nany material. The plaintiffs then sent a legal notice dated 5th May, 2007\\n\\nto the defendant and the defendant replied vide letter dated 6 th August,\\n\\n2007 stating that it had been using the trade mark Anantam since 2005\\n\\nwith respect to readymade garments, jewellery, purses etc. Due to the\\n\\ncontinuing wrong of the defendant, the plaintiffs sent another legal\\n\\nnotice dated 19th December, 2008 to the former stating that if it did not\\n\\ncease its infringing activities and replied within a week, the plaintiffs\\n\\nwould initiate legal proceedings against it. Since no reply was sent by\\n\\nthe defendant and the infringing activities continued, the present suit was\\n\\nfiled.\\n6.         In the present application, the plaintiffs have submitted that\\n\\nthe use of the registered trade mark „Anantam‟ by the defendant in\\n\\nrelation to readymade garments, perfumes, watches, hosiery etc.\\n\\ninfringes valuable rights of the plaintiffs as sub-standard goods are being\\n\\nsold which are of the same classification, nature and description as the\\n\\nplaintiffs products and in fact, are being sold under an identical mark as\\n\\nthe plaintiffs. The use of the mark „Anantam‟ is only to cause confusion\\n\\nand deception in the mind of purchasers and therefore the same is mala\\n\\nfide.\\n\\nCS (OS) No. 602/2009                                             Page 3 of 15\\n 7.          Further, the defendant‟s reply dated 6th August, 2007 to the\\n\\nplaintiffs‟ legal notice dated 5th May, 2007 states that registration of the\\n\\nformer‟s trade mark is pending in Classes 35 and 42. The plaintiffs\\n\\nsubmit that they will take necessary action and file an opposition to the\\n\\ndefendant‟s application.\\n8.          It is the plaintiffs‟ contention that use of an identical mark in\\n\\nrespect of goods which are similar in classification and description\\n\\nwould surely deceive and confuse the ultimate purchasers. There is no\\n\\ndoubt that a person, while buying the goods of the defendant, might\\n\\nthink that he/she is in fact buying the plaintiffs‟ goods.\\n\\n9.          It is on account of the defendant‟s deliberate and mala fide\\n\\nuse of the plaintiffs‟ registered trade mark that the plaintiffs have filed\\n\\nthe present application for an ad-interim injunction restraining the\\n\\ndefendant from infringing the plaintiffs‟ trade mark and from passing off\\n\\nits inferior quality goods as those of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs have\\n\\nalso prayed for damages. The plaintiffs submit that balance of\\n\\nconvenience is in their favour as they are the prior users of the registered\\n\\ntrade mark and prima facie case has also been established. Further, they\\n\\nwould suffer irreparable loss and injury if the defendant did not cease\\n\\nproduction, marketing and sale of its goods under the name „Anantam‟.\\n\\n10.         In its reply, the defendant has stated that the plaintiffs‟ suit\\n\\nought to be dismissed on account of various reasons mentioned in detail\\n\\nin the written statement. Firstly, the suit as filed by plaintiffs no. 2 to 4 is\\n\\nnot maintainable as the plaint has been neither signed nor verified by\\n\\n\\n\\nCS (OS) No. 602/2009                                                 Page 4 of 15\\n them, nor has any counsel been appointed to represent them. Secondly,\\n\\nplaintiff no. 1 has not authorized the other plaintiffs to use the trade\\n\\nmark registered exclusively in her favour. Thirdly, the present suit has\\n\\nbeen filed against a non-juristic person as M/s. Anantam is a proprietary\\n\\nconcern and neither a legal entity not a juristic person, hence the suit\\n\\nought to be dismissed. Further, the plaintiffs have concealed material\\n\\nfacts from the court as the defendant had informed them about its\\n\\npending registration applications in its reply dated 6 th August, 2007 and\\n\\ninstead of filing an opposition, the plaintiffs kept tracking the progress of\\n\\nthe defendant‟s applications and when a certificate of Registration of\\n\\nTrade Mark was issued under No. 1506086 by the Registrar of Trade\\n\\nMarks on 21st November, 2006 (only with regard to class 35) the\\n\\nplaintiffs decided to harass the defendant with the knowledge that the\\n\\ndefendant‟s trade mark was under a different class which had no\\n\\nconnection to the plaintiffs‟ registered trade mark, which was in totally\\n\\nseparate classes. Lastly, the plaintiffs have not complied with the\\n\\nprovision contained in Order 39 Rule 3 (b) of the CPC.\\n\\n11.        On merits, the defendant has argued that a perusal of the\\n\\nplaintiffs‟ registered trademarks would show that the name „Anantam‟\\n\\nhas been granted in its simple form without any logo. The trade of the\\n\\ndefendant is covered under Classes 35 and 42 and that of the plaintiffs\\n\\nunder Classes 24 and 25, which itself reveals the difference between the\\n\\ntwo. The defendant has contended that the partnership Anantam has been\\n\\ncarrying on its work without any legal consent from the concerned\\n\\n\\n\\nCS (OS) No. 602/2009                                               Page 5 of 15\\n authority and hence, the same is illegal. Further, the goods being traded\\n\\nunder the name „Anantam‟ are the goods of other manufacturers and\\n\\ntherefore, their receptivity with the clients does not establish the\\n\\nplaintiffs‟ reputation at all.\\n12.         As per the defendant, its use of the word „Anantam‟ is\\n\\ncompletely different from the plaintiffs. Further, the defendant has\\n\\npointed out the long gap between the plaintiffs‟ second legal notice and\\n\\nthe defendant‟s reply to its earlier notice i.e. from 6 th August, 2007 to\\n\\n19th December, 2008. While highlighting this gap, the defendant has\\n\\ncontended that the plaintiffs‟ disinclination to proceed with the matter\\n\\nshow that the marks used by the parties were not similar and were not\\n\\ncausing any deception.\\n13.         The defendant has referred to Section 28 (3) and Section 30\\n\\n(2) (e) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 and submitted that the defendant is\\n\\nentitled to use the registered trade mark of the plaintiff even if the same\\n\\nis similar to the plaintiffs‟ trade mark. Further, the plaintiffs‟ place of\\n\\nwork is in Gurgaon, Haryana and the defendant‟s place of work is in\\n\\nJaipur, Rajasthan therefore the situation of confusion would not arise and\\n\\nconsumers would not wrongly presume the defendant‟s products to be\\n\\nthose of the plaintiffs‟ and due to this reason, this court also has no\\n\\njurisdiction to entertain the present suit.\\n14.         I have perused the contentions of both parties. Before\\n\\nproceeding to look into the arguments on merit, I shall look into the\\n\\nquestion of jurisdiction of this court. As per the plaintiffs, this court has\\n\\n\\n\\nCS (OS) No. 602/2009                                               Page 6 of 15\\n jurisdiction to entertain the present suit under Section 134 of the Trade\\n\\nMarks Act, 1999 while the defendant‟s contention is that since it has no\\n\\nplace of work in Delhi nor does it reside in Delhi, this court cannot try\\n\\nthis suit for want of jurisdiction. Section 134 provides as under :\\n\\n\\n15.        The defendant‟s argument that its trade mark is also\\n\\nregistered under Trade Mark No. 1506086 in Class 35 and therefore, as\\n\\nper Section(s) 28(3) and 30 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 since both\\n\\nparties are registered users of the name and mark in question, both will\\n\\nbe treated as equal and no case of infringement will lie in the present\\n\\ncase.\\nCS (OS) No. 602/2009                                              Page 7 of 15\\n 16.        In my considered opinion, the present issue requires an\\n\\nexamination of the Trade Marks Rules, 2002 (hereinafter referred to as\\n\\n„the Rules‟). As per the defendant‟s contention, its trade mark is\\n\\nregistered under Class 35 of Schedule IV of the Rules. Schedule IV\\n\\nprovides the classes wherein classification of goods and services has\\n\\nbeen classified. A bare perusal of this Schedule reveals that Class 35\\n\\nrelates to services i.e. to advertising, business management, business\\n\\nadministration, office functions. The defendant got the mark „Anantam‟\\n\\nregistered in class 35 in respect of complete family store dealing in\\n\\nreadymade garments, hosiery, sarees, suits, cosmetics, perfumes, ladies\\n\\npurses, watches, jewellery and all type of accessories and merchandise\\n\\ngoods as well as part of its trading name. Admittedly, the defendant is\\n\\nusing the name/ mark and logo of „Anantam‟ on packages, invoices and\\n\\nother printed material etc., as fact which has been admitted by the\\n\\ncounsel for defendant during the course of hearing of the interim\\n\\ninjunction. After examination of classification of goods it is clear that\\n\\nthe goods in which the defendant‟s mark/ name is registered fall in\\n\\nclasses 14, 18, 24 and 25 and not in class 35. I do not agree with the\\n\\nlearned counsel for the defendant that the defendant has only one shop\\n\\nfrom where these goods are being sold because of the reason that while\\n\\nselling the merchandise items, the defendant is admittedly using packing\\n\\nmaterial, advertisement products, plastic bags, invoices, sign board and\\n\\ngift packs where the name „Anantam‟ is mentioned, whether as a mark\\n\\nor a name and this has to be considered as a user if the mark/name\\n\\n\\n\\nCS (OS) No. 602/2009                                           Page 8 of 15\\n „Anantam‟.\\n17.        It is well settled law that the use of a mark can be by various\\n\\nmeans and one of them is by way of advertisement or intention to use the\\n\\nmark in question. It is relevant to refer Section 2(2)(c)(i) of the Trade\\n\\nMarks Act, 1999 which provides as follows :\\n20.           In addition to this, in the recent case of Clinique\\n\\nLaboratories LLC & Anr. v. Gufic Ltd. & Anr., 2009 (41) PTC 41\\n\\n(Del) wherein the defendant had a similar/identical trade mark registered\\n\\nin the same class, a learned single judge of this court observed the\\n\\nfollowing :\\n21.        Following the above-quoted observation, the learned single\\n\\njudge, as far as this issue was concerned, held as under :\\n\\n22.        In view of the finding given in the earlier paras above and the\\n\\ncase law referred, I hereby hold that a suit for infringement is\\n\\nmaintainable in the present case and that this court has got jurisdiction as\\n\\nper the averment made in the plaint.\\n23.        Coming to the arguments on merit, the plaintiffs have a bona\\n\\nfide registered trade mark for their products. The contention of the\\n\\nCS (OS) No. 602/2009                                             Page 11 of 15\\n defendant that it is also a bona fide registered trade mark holder is\\n\\nwithout any substance as the said trade mark has been registered under\\n\\nthe wrong class in Schedule IV. I am of the considered view that even\\n\\notherwise, in an action of passing off, the well settled law in Century\\n\\nTraders v. Roshan Lal Duggar Co., AIR 1978 (Del) 250 will be\\n\\napplicable. In this case it was held that for the purpose of claiming\\n\\nproprietorship of a mark, it is not necessary that the mark should have\\n\\nbeen used for considerable length of time. A single actual use with intent\\n\\nto continue such use eo instanti confers a right to such mark as a trade\\n\\nmark. Further, in order to succeed in an application for temporary\\n\\ninjunction the applicant has to establish user of the aforesaid mark prior\\n\\nin point of time than the impugned user by the non-applicant. Further\\n\\nstill, actual damage or fraud is unnecessary in a passing off action\\n\\nwhether the relief asked for is injunction alone or injunction, accounts\\n\\nand damages. If there is a likelihood of the offending trade mark\\n\\ninvading the proprietary right, a case for injunction is made out.\\n\\n24.        The plaintiffs have been using the duly registered trade mark\\n\\n„Anantam‟ since September 2003. By the defendant‟s own admission, it\\n\\nstarted using the said mark in 2005. The requisite factum that the\\n\\nplaintiffs have been using the mark prior in time than the defendant has\\n\\nbeen successfully established. In my opinion, nothing further needs to be\\n\\nsaid. The plaintiffs have established a prima facie case. Further, balance\\n\\nof convenience is in their favour as they are prior users of the said mark\\n\\nand irreparable injury would be caused to them if the defendant is\\n\\n\\n\\nCS (OS) No. 602/2009                                            Page 12 of 15\\n allowed to carry on its infringing activity. Delay, if any, is not fatal in\\n\\ncase of infringement of trade mark. In the present case, it is an\\n\\nundisputed fact that the trade mark and name used by the defendant is\\n\\nidentical to the plaintiffs‟ and in relation to the same goods, therefore,\\n\\nthe question of delay in filing the suit, if any, does not arise. In this\\n\\nreference, in Tata Oil Mills Co. Ltd. Vs.

The case of the plaintiff is that plaintiff i.e. Mex Switchgears Private\\nLimited through its predecessor is the first adopter and user of the trade\\nmark MEX since the year 1960 for electric switchgears, switches, ignition\\nswitches, electric capacitators, electric meters, starting devices for electric\\nmotors etc. and various other electric goods. The plaintiff is also stated to be\\nusing the trade mark MEX on CFL bulbs, kitkats, fuses, distribution boxes,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI.A.

It has been stated by the plaintiff that the word MEX is an integral\\npart of the corporate name of the Plaintiff Company since its incorporation\\nin the year 1979 and that earlier to this, the Managing Director of the\\nplaintiff i.e. Mr. Jai Krishan Saini had a partnership firm consisting of the\\nname Mex Electro Corporation and the firm had adopted the trademark\\nMEX in 1960. The plaintiff claims that it has an exclusive right over the\\nword MEX both by virtue of trademark registration and presence of the\\nword MEX in its corporate name.\\n4.     The plaintiff has stated that it is a registered proprietor of various\\ntrademarks relating MEX under classes 7, 9 and 11 for various goods, details\\nof which are given in Para 5 of the plaint and some of which are: trademark\\nMEX (label) registered for electric switchgears and switches under class 9 as\\non 31st August 1962 bearing registration no. 211055; trademark MEX\\nregistered for ignition switches, electric capacitators, electric plugs, electric\\ndistribution boards, electric meters and electric circuit breakers included in\\nclass 9 as on 28th July 1979 bearing registration no. 351897; trademark MEX\\nregistered for electric motor (not for land vehicles) and parts thereof\\nincluded in class 7 as on 4th August 1988, used since 1st April 1960, bearing\\nregistration no. 495452; trademark MEX registered for gas stoves and parts\\nthereof under class 11 as on 20th June 1983 bearing registration no. 406916.\\n5.     The plaintiff is also stated to have obtained registrations of its trade\\nmark MEX in Nepal under classes 7 and 11. The plaintiff also holds a\\ncopyright registration of the artistic work titled MEX. The plaintiff has a\\nhuge sales turnover details of which are given in Para 12 of the plaint and\\nthe sales turnover for the year 2011-12 is stated to be ` 20,81,50,303/-. The\\n\\n\\nI.A. No.10442/2013 in CS(OS) No.1299/2013                        Page 2 of 37\\n plaintiff has widely advertised the trade mark MEX and the details of the\\nadvertisement and publicity expenses have been given in Para 13 of the\\nplaint and the said expenses for the year 2011-2012 have been stated to be\\n`42,46,105/-.\\n6.     It has been stated that the plaintiff has attained enviable reputation and\\ngoodwill for its trademark MEX and has successfully contested several\\noppositions in the trade mark registry from time to time on the basis of its\\nprior adoption and use. Also in a suit preferred by the plaintiff against one\\nMr.Gopal Krishan using the trademark MAX standard as well as the\\ncorporate name MAX STANDARD SWITCHGEARS PVT. LTD., the\\nplaintiff vide an order dated 22nd February, 1992 had got an injunction\\nagainst the said defendant. The plaintiff states to have been always vigilant\\nabout protection of its trademark MEX.\\n7.     It is the case of the plaintiff that its attention was drawn to the\\ndefendant company which has been incorporated only in the year 2011. The\\ndefendant had, according to the plaintiff, adopted an identical trade mark and\\nalso an identical corporate name. On the receipt of the said information the\\nplaintiff addressed two notices dated 31st October, 2012 and 27th November,\\n2012 to the defendant, out of which though the first notice dated 31 st\\nOctober, 2012 was served on the defendant, second returned as unserved.\\n8.     It is the case of the plaintiff that the use of expression MAX, which is\\nidentical/deceptively similar to the registered trademark MEX of the\\nplaintiff, either as a trademark or trade name by the defendant is bound to\\ncause confusion and deception amongst the purchasing public and trade\\nwhich leading to think that the defendant\\'s goods bearing the trademark\\nMAX originate from the same source i.e. the Plaintiff. The presence of the\\nword MAX in the corporate name of the defendant would also create\\n\\n\\nI.A. No.10442/2013 in CS(OS) No.1299/2013                        Page 3 of 37\\n deception and confusion and create an impression as if the defendant has\\nsome connection with the plaintiff.\\n9.     The plaintiff contends that the trade mark MAX is visually,\\nphonetically as well as structurally similar to the well known trade mark\\nMEX of the plaintiff. The adoption of the trademark/trade name MAX by\\nthe defendant is with a dishonest motive to create mischief and to deceive\\nthe purchasing public by seeking to create an impression that its products are\\nsomehow connected with the plaintiff.\\n10.    On the other hand, it is the case of the defendant that its directors are\\nin the business of Heavy Electrical for the last many years and in the year\\n2011 the defendant took over the running business of its predecessor M/s\\nMAX ELECTRICKS which was one of the proprietary concerns of one of\\nits directors who conceived the idea of starting the present business in the\\nyear 2000.\\n11.    It has been stated that the product sold by the defendant bears only a\\ndevice mark/logo which has been conceived and adopted by the defendant\\nitself and that the aforesaid device mark/logo of the defendant is entirely\\ndifferent and has no visual or any kind of other similarity with any\\ntrademark(s) of the plaintiff.\\n12.    It has also been stated that the defendant is a seller of well known\\nprestigious heavy electrical goods and is the business of electrical and\\nconsulting engineers, electrical contractors, manufactures and supplier of\\nelectrical items used in medium to high transmission lines like vacuum\\ncircuit breaker (VCBs), load break switches and panels, unitised sub-stations\\nand equipments etc. the said electrical products are heavy engineering\\nproducts which are customised as per the requirements of the client which\\nvaries in each and every case depending upon industry to industry. So as\\n\\n\\nI.A. No.10442/2013 in CS(OS) No.1299/2013                       Page 4 of 37\\n per the defendant, the question of trademark infringement does not arise.\\nFurther, the products of the defendant are purely manufactured and sold on\\nprior quotations and verifications and then orders are placed. It was stated\\nthat the products of petitioner do not bear any trademark identical or similar\\nto MEX or any other similar or identical mark of the plaintiff.\\n13.    It has been submitted that the defendant is in the business of\\nswitchgear items and the word \\'swtichgears\\' is common to the entire\\nindustry dealing in such items and that the word MAX has been adopted\\nfrom the common dictionary word MAXIMUM and there are number of\\nbusiness houses in the electrical line in the country that use the trade name\\n\"MAX\" as a part of their business name. So the plaintiff could not be\\npermitted to claim exclusive rights over such common names which are\\ncommon in the industry. It is also stated that the defendant started the\\nbusiness in the year 2000 through its predecessor and later in the year 2011\\nthe defendant was renamed and that since 2007, the website of the\\npredecessor of the defendant is available. The plaintiff never raised an\\nobjection on the trade name of the defendant and thus by conduct allowed\\nthe defendant to continue with the name MAX.\\n14.    It has been averred that the defendant has a reputation of its own and\\nhas nothing to do with the business reputation/goodwill of the plaintiff. The\\ndetails of the sales turnover of the defendant has been given in Para 23 of the\\nwritten statement filed by the defendant and the sales turnover for the period\\n2012-13 is stated to be ` 6,40,99,240/-. It has been stated that the defendant\\nhas never adopted the trademark MAX for any of its goods and the product\\nof the defendant are known for their quality and identified by its unique\\nlogo/device mark which has been invented by the defendant.\\n15.    The following defences are raised by the defendant:\\n16.    However arguments were addressed by the learned counsel for the\\ndefendant on points No. (i) to (iii) and (vii) only.\\n17.    Before dealing with the defences raised by the defendant, it appears\\nfrom the record that the plaintiff company through its predecessor has been\\nusing the trade mark MEX since the year 1960 in respect of electrical\\nswitchgears of various kinds, electrical meters, starting devices for electric\\nmotors and various other electrical goods. The plaintiff is also using the\\n\\n\\nI.A. No.10442/2013 in CS(OS) No.1299/2013                        Page 6 of 37\\n trade mark MEX in respect of CFL bulbs, fuses, distribution boxes, circuit\\nbreakers wires and cables miniature circuit breaker etc.\\n18.       The plaintiff is a registered proprietor of trade mark MEX in various\\ntrade marks, the details of which are mentioned in para 5 of the plaint in\\nclasses 7, 9 and 11 in respect of the registered goods mentioned above as\\nwell as other large number of specification of goods mentioned in the said\\npara. The plaintiff has also given the details of expenses on advertisement\\nand sale figures of the goods under the trade mark MEX in pars 12 and 13 of\\nthe plaint from the year 1960 to 2011-2012.\\n19.       The trade mark of the plaintiff has been protected from time to by\\nvarious courts including the Bombay High Court as well as District Court,\\nDelhi. The details of the said protections are given in paras 15 and 16 of the\\nplaint.\\n20.       Before filing of the suit, the plaintiff also issued notices to the\\ndefendant not to use the trade mark MAX as well as part of corporate name,\\notherwise it would amount to infringement and passing off of the trade mark\\nof the plaintiff. The case of the plaintiff is that the present case is a triple\\nidentity whereby two set of trade marks i.e. MEX and MAX are almost\\nidentical. The goods are also same goods and trade channel is also the same.\\n21.       The goods of the plaintiff are admittedly sold in every nook and\\ncorner of India. The said fact has not been denied by the defendant during\\nthe course of hearing. The plaintiff states that the defendant\\'s predecessor or\\nthe defendant ought not to have used the trade mark MAX in relation to\\nsame goods as well as part of their corporate name as on the date of adoption\\nthey were fully aware about the goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff.\\n22.       It is also argued by the plaintiff that the defendant has never used the\\ntrade mark MAX from the year 2000 as alleged by the defendant. They have\\n\\n\\nI.A. No.10442/2013 in CS(OS) No.1299/2013                         Page 7 of 37\\n been using the trade mark and corporate name Max Switchgears Pvt. Ltd. In\\nany case, since the plaintiff is holding the registration of the trade mark\\nMEX and corporate name Mex Switchgears Pvt. Ltd., the delay, if any, is\\nnot fatal to the case of the infringement of trade mark. Therefore, the\\nplaintiff is pressing for injunction against the defendant.\\n23.    The rival submissions of the defendant have been dealt with by the\\nlearned counsel for the plaintiff during the course of the arguments denying\\nall the statements made in the written statement. It is argued by the learned\\ncounsel for the plaintiff that all the pleas raised by the defendant are false\\nand frivolous and the same are not sustainable in law. The present case is a\\ncase of infringement also where the plaintiff has been able to establish a\\nstrong prima facie case against the defendant for using the identical trade\\nmark and trade name in relation to the same goods and they are selling their\\ngoods in the same market. Counsel further states that it is immaterial if the\\ngoods of the defendant are heavy engineering products.\\nInfringement of Trade Mark\\n24.    It is the admitted position that the plaintiff is a registered proprietor of\\nthe trade MEX in respect of large number of goods i.e. electric switchgears,\\nswitches, ignition switches, electric capacitators, electric meters, starting\\ndevices for electric motors etc. and various other electric goods. The trade\\nmark MEX is registered in various classifications of goods falling in classes\\n7, 9 and 11 including electric distribution boards, electric meters and electric\\ncircuit breakers. The registration of the plaintiff is not denied by the\\ndefendant. The defendant has not stated that the defendant has challenged\\nthe validity of the trade mark of the plaintiff. It is also the admitted position\\nthat the plaintiff and its predecessor have been using the trade mark MEX\\nsince 1960. The mark MEX is also dominant part of their corporate name.\\n Under Section 31 of the Act, the registration is a prima facie evidence of its\\nvalidity.\\n25.    The law relating to infringement of a registered trademark has been\\nenvisaged under Section 29 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 and exclusive\\nrights granted by virtue of registration under Section 28 which reads as\\nunder:-\\n26.    By mere reading of these provisions, it is clear that a registered\\ntrademark is infringed by a person who not being a registered proprietor,\\nuses in the course of trade a mark which is identical or deceptively similar in\\n\\n\\nI.A. No.10442/2013 in CS(OS) No.1299/2013                        Page 11 of 37\\n relation to the goods or services which are identical or similar to that in\\nrespect of which the trademark is registered without the permission of the\\ntrademark owner.\\n27.    So far as infringement qua different goods is concerned, separate\\nenactment of Section 29(4) makes it clear that the strict rigors are prescribed\\nas against the ordinary case of similar goods wherein a registered proprietor\\nhas to establish that the registered trademark has reputation in India and is of\\nsuch a nature wherein the use of the mark by the other side without due\\ncause would tantamount to taking unfair advantage or detrimental to the\\ndistinctive character or repute of a trademark.\\n28.    A reading of Section 29(4) of the Act would reveal that the said\\nprotection qua different goods is earmarked by the Legislature for the\\ntrademarks which are either highly reputed or well known or famous\\ntrademarks and enjoy either high level of distinctiveness or the marks which\\nare inherently distinctive in nature or has become distinctive due to their\\nrepute; the use of which will cause detrimental to the distinctive character\\nand repute of the trademark only when the ingredients of Section 29(4) are\\nsatisfied conjunctively which is sub sections (a), (b) and (c) the infringement\\nqua Section 29(4) in relation to different goods is attracted. In the present\\ncase, no doubt, in view of the goodwill, reputation, huge sale and\\nadvertisement, prime facie, it establishes that the trade mark \"MEX\" has\\nacquired a unique name in the market and by virtue of that it is satisfied that\\nit comes within the meanings of Section 29 (4) of the Act.\\n29.    Section 29(5) of the Act, it is seen that it relates to a situation where\\n(i) the infringer uses the registered trademark \"as his trade name or part of\\nhis trade name, or name of his business concern or part of the name, of his\\nbusiness concern\" and (ii) the business concern or trade is in the same goods\\n\\n\\nI.A. No.10442/2013 in CS(OS) No.1299/2013                       Page 12 of 37\\n or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered. If the\\nowner/proprietor of the registered trade mark is able to show that both the\\nabove requirements exist then an injunction restraining order the infringer\\nshould be passed.\\n30.    Recently in the case of Bloomberg Finance LP vs. Prafull Saklecha\\n& Ors. 2013 (56) PTC 243 (Del), in para 51, after a long discussion on\\nSection 29 of the Act, it was held as under:\\n31.     It is settled law that in order to prove the case for infringement of\\ntrade mark, the plaintiff has to show that the essential features of the\\nregistered trade mark which has been adopted by the defendant has been\\ntaken out from the plaintiff\\'s registration.       Only the marks are to be\\ncompared by the Court and in case the registration is granted in favour of the\\nplaintiff, he acquires valuable right by reason of the said registration.\\n32.    The test of comparison of the marks side by side is not a sound one\\nsince a purchaser will seldom have the two marks actually before him when\\nhe makes his purchase. The eye is not an accurate recorder of visual detail\\nand that marks are remembered rather by general impression or by some\\nsignificant detail than by any photographic recollection of the whole. While\\njudging the question as to whether the defendant has infringed the trade\\nmark by colourable imitation of the mark or not, the Court has to consider\\nthe overall impression of the mark in the minds of general public and not by\\nmerely comparing the dissimilarities in the two marks.\\n33.    In K.R. Chinna Krishna Chettiar v. Sri Ambal & Co., AIR 1970 SC\\n146, the Supreme Court held that ocular comparison is not always the\\ndecisive test. Resemblance between the two marks must be considered with\\nreference to the ear as well as to the eye. In this case, the Registrar held that\\n\\n\\n\\nI.A. No.10442/2013 in CS(OS) No.1299/2013                        Page 14 of 37\\n the sound of \"AMBAL\" does not so nearly resemble the sound of\\n\"ANDAL\" in spite of certain letters being common to both the marks, as to\\nbe likely to cause confusion or deception. The Registrar thus found that the\\nmarks were not deceptively similar. But on appeal both the Single Judge\\nand Division Bench found deceptive similarity.           The Supreme Court,\\ndismissed the appeal, and held that there was a striking similarity and\\naffinity of sound between the word \"Andal\" and \"Ambal\" and held that there\\nwas a real danger of confusion between the two marks.\\n34.    The following are the judgments are relevant to be referred to for the\\npurpose of grant of relief in the cases of infringement of the trade marks:\\n       In view of the above said facts and circumstances, it is held that two\\nmarks MEX and MAX visually, phonetically and structurally are\\ndeceptively similar. The use of the trade mark MAX by the defendant in\\nrelation to same/similar goods as well as dominant part of its corporate name\\namounts to infringement of trade mark of the plaintiff. In case the defendant\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI.A. No.10442/2013 in CS(OS) No.1299/2013                      Page 18 of 37\\n is allowed to use the deceptively similar trade mark, there would be\\nconfusion and deception.\\nPASSING OFF\\n35.     The following are the essential characteristics of an action of passing\\noff:-\\n37.    In the case of Essel Packaging Ltd. v. Essel Tea Exports Ltd., 1999\\nPTC (19) 521, the High Court of Bombay after considering Kirloskar Diesel\\nRecon Pvt. Ltd. vs. Kirlosker Proprietary Ltd. and Bajaj Electricals Pvt.\\nLtd. vs. Metals and Allied Projects, held, that common field of activity is\\nnot conclusive for deciding whether there can be passing off action, although\\nat one point of time the said test was treated as conclusive. It was held that\\nwith the passage of time the law of requirement of common field of activity\\nin a passing off action has undergone a radical change and as such there was\\nno requirement for a common field of activity to found a claim on passing\\noff action, because the real question in each of such cases is, whether there\\n\\n\\nI.A. No.10442/2013 in CS(OS) No.1299/2013                      Page 21 of 37\\n is, as a result of mis-representation, a real likelihood of confusion or\\ndeception of the public and consequent damage to the plaintiff is likely to be\\ncaused and if that is taken to be the test then the focus is shifted from the\\nexternal objective test of making comparison of activities of the parties, to\\nthe state of mind of public, in deciding whether it will be confused.\\nApplying these principles the injunction in favour of the plaintiff was\\ngranted.\\n38.    As already held that the defendant is guilty of infringement of trade\\nmark, it is also clear that the defendant is passing its goods as that of the\\nplaintiff who has been able to make out a strong prima facie case for passing\\noff against the defendant. The fact remains that the descriptions of goods of\\nboth the parties are almost same. Therefore, even the defendants are using\\nthe deceptively similar trade mark MAX. Being heavy engineering products\\nis also immaterial as there would be confusion and deception if the\\ndefendant is allowed to use the trade mark in relation to electrical\\ncontractors, circuit breaker (VCBs), load break switches, panels and unitised\\nsub-stations. The justification given by the defendant that it has bonafide\\nadopted the trade mark MAX from the common word MAXIMUM is also\\nwithout any substance because of the reason that the defendant has been\\nusing the trade mark MAX in relation to similar goods and not the mark\\nMAXIMUM. The defendant is also using the trade mark MAX as dominant\\npart of its corporate name which amounts to infringement under Section\\n29(5) of the Act. Therefore, the adoption and use of the name MAX is not\\nbonafide. It is also pertinent to mention that on the date of adoption of the\\ntrade mark MAX either by the defendant\\'s predecessor or by the defendant\\nin the year 2011, they were fully aware about the trade mark and trading\\nstyle of the plaintiff as the said name was extensively advertised in the area\\n\\n\\nI.A. No.10442/2013 in CS(OS) No.1299/2013                      Page 22 of 37\\n of Tamil Nadu. Thus, prima facie the plaintiff has been able to establish\\nstrong case for passing off.\\nTrade Name\\n39.    The defendant\\'s contention has no force that since the name was\\nregistered under the Companies Act and under various provisions the\\ndefendant is entitled to use the name of the company, therefore, this Court\\nshould not pass the injunction order in view of settled law laid down by\\nvarious High Courts in India. It is not denied by the defendant that the mark\\nMAX is used by the defendant as dominant and essential part of its corporate\\nname. Few judgments in this regard are as under:-\\n40.    Section 20 of the Companies Act, 1956 reads as under:\\n       Sub-section (2) (ii) of the said provision was incorporated with effect\\nfrom September 15, 2003 when the Trade Mark Act, 1999 came also into\\noperation from the said date.               The said provision mandates that the\\ncompanies not to be registered if a name is identical with or too nearly\\nresembles the name which has been previously registered or a registered\\ntrade mark or a trade mark which is a subject of an application for\\nregistration under the Trade Marks Act, 1999.\\n41.    It appears that the said provision of sub-section (2) of Section 20 was\\nincorporated in order to avoid the civil litigation before the Court and duty\\nwas cast upon the Registrar of Companies to apply its mind at the time of\\ngranting the registration of the name of the company. In the present case, it\\n\\n\\n\\nI.A. No.10442/2013 in CS(OS) No.1299/2013                         Page 24 of 37\\n is undisputed fact that when the defendant company was incorporated in the\\nyear 2007, the plaintiff was registered proprietor of two trade marks. The\\ntrade marks and trade names used by both the parties are almost identical,\\nthus, it is evident that the Registrar of Companies granted the registration\\ncontrary to Section 20 of the Indian Companies Act. The Registrar of\\nCompany by complying the provisions of Section 20(2) (ii) obtained the\\nsearch report from the office was Trade Marks Registration, the registration\\nof the name of the company of defendant No.1 would not have been issued\\nunder the mandatory provision and litigation could have been avoided\\nhowever, it did not happened despite of direction issued by the Apex\\nCourt and in various other cases and mandatory provisions of various Acts.\\nThus it appears to the Court that use of corporate name which formed part of\\na similar registered trademark of the plaintiff amounts to infringement and\\npassing off of the registered trademark of the plaintiff.\\nTerritorial Jurisdiction\\n42.    Sub-section (2) of Section 134 enacts that for the purposes of clauses\\n(a) and (b), the term \"District Court having jurisdiction\" would include a\\nDistrict Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction, the person or one\\nof the persons instituting the suit or proceeding actually and voluntarily\\nresides or carries on business or personally works for gain. The law in this\\nrespect, which is similar to Section 62 of the Copyright Act, makes a\\ndeparture from the general law contained in the Code of Civil Procedure\\n1908 regarding jurisdiction. See Gharkul Utadane v. Kharpe Gruh Udyog,\\n(1997) IPLR 13, where the Bombay High Court held that it had no\\njurisdiction under Section 62 of the Copyright Act, revoking the leave\\ngranted.\\n 43.    In terms of Section 134, it would appear that the plaintiff has an\\noption of the forum for institution of suit.        In respect of the suit for\\ninfringement of a registered trade mark or relating to any right in a registered\\ntrade mark, at the option of the plaintiff, the suit may be filed in any court\\nnot inferior to the district court having jurisdiction, within the local limits of\\nwhose jurisdiction, the plaintiff resides or carries on business. On the other\\nhand, in respect of matters specified in clause (c) of sub-section (1) namely a\\npassing of action based on a registered or unregistered trade mark, the suit\\nwill have to be filed only in the appropriate district court having jurisdiction\\nin terms of the CPC. Under Section 20 of CPC, the suit is to be instituted in\\nthe court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the defendant at the\\ntime of the commencement of the suit actually or voluntarily resides or\\ncarries on business.\\n44.    In Exphar SA v. Eupharma Laboratories Ltd., (2004) 3 SCC 688, the\\nSupreme Court has held that when an objection to jurisdiction is raised, the\\nCourt can proceed on the basis that the facts as pleaded by the initiator of the\\nimpugned proceedings are correct.\\n45.    In Shri Rajmoti Industries v. Rajmoti Oil Mill Pvt. Ltd., 2005 (3)\\nPTC 38 (Del.), where the plaintiff had averred in its plaint that it carried on\\nbusiness in Delhi and had referred to its two distributors for the purpose, it\\nwas taken as a sufficient compliance of the provisions of Section 134(2) of\\nthe Trade Marks Act, 1999.\\n46.    Sub-section (2) of Section 134 has thus been construed to be much\\nwider than normal grounds as laid down under Section 20 the CPC. The\\npermissive provision allowing the person to file the suit or other proceedings\\nwhere he carries on business or works for gain would not be limited to the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI.A. No.10442/2013 in CS(OS) No.1299/2013                         Page 26 of 37\\n carrying on of business in respect of the goods involved. After all, no such\\nlimitation is attached to these words.\\n47.    It is not denied by the defendant during the course of hearing that the\\nplaintiff\\'s goods are available in every nook and corner of India including in\\nthe State of Tamil Nadu from where the defendant is carrying on its\\nbusiness. Thus, the plaintiff is entitled to invoke the territorial jurisdiction\\nof this Court under Sub-Section (2) of Section 134 of the Act. The plaintiff\\nhas invoked the jurisdiction of this Court by alleging that the plaintiff has its\\nbranch office in Delhi and its goods are also being sold in Delhi. The\\nplaintiff has also many dealers in Delhi. The defendant is selling its goods\\nin clandestine manner in Delhi. It is further stated that the name of the\\ndefendant company is available on the internet site of Registry of companies\\nwhich accessible in Delhi. Though the issue of territorial jurisdiction is not\\nargued by the counsel for the defendant, however since it was one of the\\npleas was taken in the written statement, thus the same is dealt with. In view\\nof the settled law, prima facie this Court finds that this Court has got the\\nterritorial jurisdiction. However, issue of jurisdiction has to be decided after\\nframing of issues when the matter is taken for final disposal of the suit. The\\nsaid issue as raised by the defendant is thus kept open.\\nCommon to the Trade\\n48.    The case of the defendant in the written statement is that the mark\\nMAX is common to the trade and there are many companies who have been\\nusing the mark MAX as part of their corporate names or the firm names.\\nThe defendant has also filed list of companies taken from the internet in\\norder to show that there are many companies who have been using their\\ntrading style/trade name/corporate name in which MAX forms part of it.\\nHowever, during the course of arguments, no document was pointed out by\\n\\n\\nI.A. No.10442/2013 in CS(OS) No.1299/2013                        Page 27 of 37\\n the learned counsel for the defendant as to whether the said firm/trading\\nstyle/corporate name are still carrying on their business or not.                No\\ndocumentary proof about their user has been produced by the defendant\\nalong with list of documents.\\n49.      Learned counsel for the plaintiff states that the plaintiff is very much\\nvigilant about their trade mark/trade name MEX and plaintiff has been\\ntaking actions from time to time as and when the plaintiff comes to know\\nabout the offending activities of any trader who is either using the trade\\nmark MEX or deceptively similar mark.\\n50.      Law of publici juris has been discussed in various cases and the\\nCourts have given their respective findings to the effect that a party who has\\ntaken the defence of publici juris has to prove his case. The same has been\\ndealt with by the Supreme Court and various High Courts in the following\\ncases:\\n       Similar view was taken by this court in various cases reported in 2009\\n(41) PTC 57, Novartis AG v. Crest Pharma Pvt. Ltd. and Anr., 93 (2001)\\nDLT 406, Bhagwan Dass Gupta v. Shri Shiv Shankar Tirath Yatra\\nCompany Pvt. Ltd., 1998 PTC 18, Indian Shaving Products Ltd. & Anr. v.\\nGift Pack & Anr., and 2008 (38) PTC 49 (Del.) (DB) Pankaj Goel v. Dabur\\nIndia Ltd.\\n51.    As the defendant has failed to produce any evidence of the actual use\\nof the mark MAX by third parties, the mark MAX is common to the trade in\\nan action for passing off is not available. Further the present suit is also for\\ninfringement of trade mark which is filed on the basis of exclusive and\\nstatutory rights granted in favour of the plaintiff under Section 28 of the Act.\\nThus, there is no force in the submission of the defendant that the mark\\nMAX is common to the trade and the defendant is entitled to use the same.\\nDelay and Acquiescence\\n52.    In the written statement, the defendant has made the statement that the\\ndefendant started business in 2000 through its predecessor and later in the\\n\\n\\n\\nI.A. No.10442/2013 in CS(OS) No.1299/2013                            Page 31 of 37\\n year 2011 the defendant was renamed as Max Switchgears Pvt. Ltd. It is also\\nalleged that since 2007 the website of the predecessor is available bearing\\nthe name MAX. In support of his submissions, the defendant has filed\\ncertain documents by list of dates dated 23 rd September, 2013.           First\\ndocument is certificate dated 21st May, 2013 issued by the Chartered\\nAccountant in which the statement of sales turnover and net profit is shown\\nfrom the year 2007-2008. The defendant has also filed few invoices from\\nthe pear 2007 to 2013 with regard to the sale of Transformer Switch Board\\nand other related material.        No other document has been filed by the\\ndefendant to show the user of the predecessor earlier to the year 2007. Even\\nthe defendant has also not filed the advertisement figures or any newspaper\\nor cogent and clear evidence in order to show that the defendant and its\\npredecessor have been using the trade mark/trade name MAX since the year\\n2000 as alleged by the defendant in the written statement. Even if the face\\nvalue of the documents is taken as correct, the said documents about the use\\nof the mark MAX by the predecessor are from the year 2007 to 2010 and\\nabout the use of mark MAX by the defendant are from the year 2011 to\\n2013.\\n53.     On the other hand, the plaintiff has filed large number of newspapers\\nand evidence in order to show that the plaintiff\\'s mark MEX was being\\nadvertised in the same are from where the defendant is carrying on its\\nbusiness.     The said advertisements are advertised in the well-known\\nnewspaper bearing the mark MEX and in its corporate name Mex\\nSwitchgears Pvt. Ltd.\\n54.     From the said evidence filed by the defendant, one can easily get the\\nimpression that on the date of adoption of the trade mark by the defendant\\'s\\npredecessor or the defendant from the year 2011, they must be aware about\\n\\n\\nI.A. No.10442/2013 in CS(OS) No.1299/2013                     Page 32 of 37\\n the user of trade mark MEX by the plaintiff. Even otherwise, the delay, if\\nany, as per settled law in a case of infringement is not fatal because of the\\nreason that in trade mark cases, the cause of action is a recurring cause of\\naction. Few decisions on this aspect of delay and acquiescence are referred\\nto as under:\\n 55.    In the absence of any cogent and clear evidence for the user claimed\\nby the defendant since 2000 by its predecessor, the benefit of the same\\ncannot be granted to the defendant. It appears from the record that the some\\ninvoices and sale figures certified by the chartered accountant are available\\nfrom the year 2007 only. The said user even taken as correct from the 2007\\nis not fatal in an action for infringement in view of the above mentioned\\nsettled law. It is also pertinent to mention that no evidence is placed on\\nrecord by the defendant to show that the plaintiff was aware about the\\ndefendant\\'s user from the year 2007.         Thus, the plea of delay and\\nacquiescence is also rejected.\\n56.    In an action for infringement, the plaintiff must no doubt make out\\nthat the use of the defendant\\'s mark is likely to deceive, but where the\\nsimilarity between the plaintiff\\'s and the defendant\\'s mark is so close either\\nvisually, phonetically or otherwise that the court reaches the conclusion that\\nthere is an imitation, no further evidence is required to establish that the\\nplaintiff\\'s rights are violated. Expressed in another way, if the essential\\nfeatures of the trade mark of the plaintiff have been adopted by the\\ndefendant, the fact that the get up, packing and other writing or marks on the\\ngoods or on the packets, in which he offers his goods for sale show marked\\ndifferences, or indicate clearly a trade origin, different from that on the\\nregistered proprietor of the mark, would be immaterial.\\n57.    In view of the above said facts and circumstances of the matter, it\\nappears that the plaintiff has been able to make a strong prima facie case in\\nits favour and against the defendant being the registered proprietor of the\\ntrade mark MEX in relation to same goods as well as allied and cognate\\ngoods falling in class 7, 9 and 11. The balance of convenience also lies in\\nfavour of the plaintiff and against the defendant. If the interim order is not\\n\\n\\nI.A. No.10442/2013 in CS(OS) No.1299/2013                      Page 35 of 37\\n passed, the plaintiff will suffer irreparable loss and injury. On the other\\nhand, the defendant will continue to use the said trade mark/trade name\\nMAX in relation to the same goods as well as a dominant part of its\\ncorporate name. Therefore, prima facie a strong case for passing an ad-\\ninterim order has been made out by the plaintiff. Accordingly, till the\\ndisposal of the suit, the defendant, its servants, agents, dealers, distributors\\nand all others persons acting for and on its behalf from manufacturing,\\nselling, offering for sale and directly or indirectly dealing with electrical\\ngoods i.e. switchgear, switches and other allied and cognate goods under the\\ntrade mark MAX as well as from using the same as dominant part of its\\ncorporate name. The defendant is also restrained from using any deceptively\\nsimilar trade mark which may amount to infringement of plaintiff\\'s\\nregistered trade mark No.211055 in class 9 as well as passing of its goods as\\nthat of the plaintiff and from doing any other thing which is likely to create\\nconfusion and deception.\\n58.    In the interest of justice, six months time is granted to the defendant to\\ndispose of the existing stock and to change the trade mark and trade name of\\nthe defendant.\\n59.    The application is disposed of.

Pleadings are complete in all the aforestated applications.\\n\\nBy this common order the aforenoted applications are being\\n\\ndisposed of.\\n6.        The cause of action in this suit is two-fold. Plaintiff has\\n\\nfirstly     sought        a    permanent     injunction    on       an    action   of\\n\\ninfringement         of       his   registered   trademark;         the   registered\\n\\ntrademarks being „TOYOTA‟                   „toyota device‟ and „INNOVA‟.\\n\\nSecond relief is a relief of permanent injunction in a case of\\n\\npassing off. Plaintiff is stated to be the prior user of the mark\\n\\n„PRIUS‟, he admittedly has no registration in India of the mark\\n\\n„PRIUS‟.\\n7.        Case of plaintiff:\\n          To substantiate his plea of passing off on the use of the\\n\\nmark „PRIUS‟ plaintiff has submitted as follows:\\n\\n8.    The observations of the Apex Court in N.R. Dongre v.\\n\\nWhirlpool Corporation (1996) 5 SCC 714 have been relied upon\\n\\nwhich had inter-alia had held: -\\n9.    It is submitted that the ratio of the decision clearly\\n\\nestablishes that the registration of the trademark \"PRIUS‟ in\\n\\nfavour of the defendant is no defence in his favour; by using the\\n\\nidentical mark „PRIUS‟, the defendant is selling his goods which\\n\\nare auto part accessories as the goods of the plaintiff; the\\n\\nunwary and layman purchaser is bound to be confused and\\n\\ndeceived into believing that what he is purchasing i.e. the auto\\n\\nparts or the auto part accessories are those of the plaintiff.\\n\\n10.   In Jolen Inc. v. Doctor and Company (2002)2 C.T.M.R. 6 it\\nwas observed as under:-\\n11.   Reliance        has   been   placed    upon           Pfizer   Ireland\\n\\nPharmaceuticals v. Intas Pharmaceuticals and Anr., 2004(28)\\n\\nPTC 456(Del) to support the submission that the worldwide\\n\\nreputation of the trademark of the plaintiff „PRIUS‟ has been\\n\\nestablished by his sale turnover.\\n12.    An advertisement of the trademark by itself without the\\n\\nexistence of goods in the market is also to be considered as a use\\n\\nof the trademark even if the plaintiff is not using or marketing\\n\\nthe goods under the same trademark.               This fact would be\\n\\nirrelevant as admittedly the trademark „PRIUS‟ has been used by\\n\\nthe plaintiff in the world market much prior in time to the\\n\\ndefendant.    For this proposition, reliance has been placed on\\n\\nMilmet Oftho Industries and Ors. v. Allergan Inc. 2004(28)\\n\\nPTC585(SC).\\n13.   In Ford Motor Company of Canada Limited & Anr. v. Ford\\n\\nServices Centre       MANU/DE/1774/2008, rejecting the plea of the\\n\\ndefendant that the plaintiff had no presence/business in India\\n\\nwhen the defendant had adopted the mark/name, it was held that\\n\\nthe plaintiff was naturally affected when it spread its wings in\\nCS(OS) No.2490/2009                          Page 8 of 44\\n India and found the defendant to be trespassing. The plaintiff\\n\\nwas the registered owner of the trademark „Ford‟.          Defendant\\n\\nwho was engaged in the business of service of all vehicles also\\n\\nhad a filling station/petrol pump including allied services of\\n\\ncleaning/policing of cars, wind screen, sale of lubricants, grease\\n\\nand other automobile components at the filling station. Plaintiff\\n\\nwas found entitled to the interim relief.\\n14.   On the defence of delay as set up by the defendant reliance\\n\\nhas been placed upon Daimler Benz Aktiegesellschaft and Anr. v\\n\\nHybo Hindustan, AIR 1994 Delhi 239. In this case the use of the\\n\\nname „BENZ‟ by the defendant was under consideration;\\n\\ndefendant was using the trademark „BENZ‟ for undergarments;\\n\\nplaintiff sought an injunction in passing off action alleging that\\n\\nthe term „BENZ‟ was associated with the finest engineered cars\\n\\nin the world and there was a clear evidence for grant of an\\n\\ninjunction in favour of the plaintiff; the delay in approaching the\\n\\nCourt could not justify the use of the trademark which was a\\n\\nworldwide famous name. It was inter-alia held as follows: -\\n\\n 15.   On the plea of infringement of the trade marks TOYOTA,\\n\\ntoyota device and INNOVA plaintiff has submitted as follows:\\n\\n16.   Case of defendant:\\n17.    Rejoinder submissions by plaintiff:\\n       In rejoinder, these arguments have been refuted by the\\n\\nlearned counsel for the plaintiff. It is submitted that the heavy\\n\\nreliance placed by the defendant on the advertisement in the\\n\\n„Auto Car‟ journal does not in any manner establish that the\\n\\nplaintiff was aware of the existence of the defendant.                  A\\n\\ndistinction has to be drawn between constructive knowledge and\\n\\nactual knowledge; extracts from the Black‟s Law Dictionary has\\n\\nbeen    placed   on   record    to    substantiate     this    submission.\\n\\nCS(OS) No.2490/2009                           Page 17 of 44\\n Defendant has also not pleaded that the plaintiff had any actual\\n\\nknowledge of the presence of the defendant; it is humanly\\n\\nimpossible to imagine that while going through a magazine a\\n\\nreader would examine each and every page in meticulous detail.\\n\\nAt best, he would see his own advertisement on the relevant\\n\\npage.    The submission of the defendant that the plaintiff had\\n\\nacquired knowledge of the presence of the defendant in terms of\\n\\nadvertisements effected by him in the same magazine are mere\\n\\ninferences and surmises; it is a wild imagination.\\n\\n18.     In Automatic Electric Limited v. R.K.Dhawan & Anr. 1999\\n\\nPTC     (19) 81     this court while dealing with a             magazine\\n\\nadvertisement of the defendants published on its cover page had\\n\\nheld that this by itself could not be deduced as a knowledge on\\n\\nthe part of the plaintiff; such a presumption could not be made.\\n\\nIt is relevant to state that in this case the plaintiff was the\\n\\nregistered owner of the trade mark „DIMERSTAT‟. Plaintiff in\\n\\nthe instant case admittedly does not have any registration of\\n\\n„PRIUS‟.\\n19.     For the same proposition reliance has been placed on M/s\\n\\nHidesign v. M/s Hidesign Creations AIR 1991 Delhi 243. In this\\n\\ncase,    it   had   been   held   that   a   single     insertion   of   an\\n\\nadvertisement, and participation in an exhibition cannot be\\n\\nCS(OS) No.2490/2009                           Page 18 of 44\\n considered to be such an activity which could lead to the\\n\\nconclusion that the defendant had built up a reputation in the\\n\\nfield of goods sold by him. Plea of acquiescence raised by the\\n\\ndefendant had been rejected.\\n20.   Plaintiff has   also   placed on record        an affidavit of\\n\\nMr.B.K.Anand, a Chartered Accountant who after analyzing the\\n\\nsale figures of the defendant has calculated that the cumulative\\n\\nsale of the defendant for the period of 2002-2009 was Rs.3.54\\n\\ncrores only; cumulatively, the net profit, partner‟s salary and\\n\\ninterest on capital added up to be Rs.28.36 lakhs per annum. It\\n\\nis stated that this is a miniscule figure and cannot by any stretch\\n\\nof imagination be said to be a well-established business.       The\\n\\npublicity campaign of the defendant shows that he has spent\\n\\nRs.1.22 lakhs in this entire period.   In these circumstances it\\n\\ncannot be said that the business of the defendant is either well\\n\\nestablished    or has earned a distinct reputation; he is man of\\n\\nlittle worth; in such a case where infringement is negligible the\\n\\nproprietor of the mark is even not bound to commence legal\\n\\nproceedings immediately after he becomes aware of the\\n\\ninfringement.\\n21.    It is further submitted that the defendant has all along\\n\\nbeen dishonest and such a dishonest user by the defendant calls\\n\\nCS(OS) No.2490/2009                       Page 19 of 44\\n for the case to be thrown out at the first instance.                    The\\n\\nexplanation furnished by the defendant as to how he came\\n\\nacross the word „PRIUS‟ is blatantly false and borders on a level\\n\\nof falsehood which has reached the heights of malice. It would\\n\\nbe an understatement to state that it is merely dishonest.\\n\\n22.   In Ciba Ltd. Basle Switzerland v. M.Ramalingam and\\n\\nS.Subramaniam         Trading   in   the   name    of        Sought   Indian\\n\\nManufacturing Co., Madura and Another AIR 1958 Bombay 56\\n\\n(V 25 C 21 ) on the use of word „Cibol‟; the explanation\\n\\nfurnished by the defendant that „C‟ stands for cuts, „I‟ for itches,\\n\\n„B‟ for boils and \"OL‟ for oil, the court rejected this explanation\\n\\nas patently untrue and dishonest; it was held that at the time\\n\\nwhen the application for registration had been made by the\\n\\nrespondent they were not thinking of curing humanity of cuts,\\n\\nitches and boils, but only of ring worms.\\n23.   In Altiebolaget Volvo v. Volvo Steels Limited 1998 PTC\\n\\n(18) (DB) the court on the use of word „Volvo‟ had held that\\n\\nalthough this latin word means „re-rolling‟, „to roll up‟, „to roll\\n\\ntogether‟ and „form by rolling‟. Yet it required to be appreciated\\n\\nthat hardly anyone in India knows Latin and it is extremely\\n\\nimprobable that anybody would translate the word „volvo‟ when\\n\\none hears or reads the same. Latin being almost a dead and\\n\\nCS(OS) No.2490/2009                          Page 20 of 44\\n obscure language in India; the word „Volvo‟ for an average\\n\\nIndian would not mean anything and as such the submission of\\n\\nthe plaintiff that the word „Volvo‟ is invented and a fancy word\\n\\nwas accepted.\\n24.   In Satyam Infoway Ltd. v. Siffynet Solutions (P) Ltd. (2004)\\n\\n6 SCC 145 the doubtful explanation given by the respondent for\\n\\nthe choice of the word „Siffy‟ coupled with the reputation of the\\n\\nappellant had led the court to conclude that the respondent was\\n\\nseeking to cash in on the appellant‟s reputation as a provider of\\n\\nservice on the internet. It was held to be a dishonest adoption of\\n\\nthe appellant‟s trade name by the respondent.\\n\\n25.   In L.D.Malhotra Industries v. Ropi Industries ILR 1976\\n\\nDelhi 278, the court had held that if the origin or the adoption of\\n\\nthe mark is tainted it cannot be said that its adoption by the\\n\\ntrader is honest and bona fide.\\n26.   In Beiersdorf A.G. v. Ajay Sukhwani and Another 2009 (39)\\n\\nPTC 38 (Del.) the court had inter alia held:\\n27.   Safety measures adopted by the company also have to be\\n\\nCS(OS) No.2490/2009                            Page 21 of 44\\n borne in mind and the purchaser cannot be put to a risk\\n\\nespecially keeping in view the nature of the goods i.e. auto\\n\\nparts. A copy of a purchase agreement evidencing the various\\n\\nsafety clauses, the quality assurances, the safety measures at\\n\\ntime of packing, marketing and documentation of the goods has\\n\\nbeen highlighted by the plaintiff.\\n28.    Heavy reliance placed upon by the plaintiff on the\\n\\njudgment in the Hawkins Cookers Limited‟s            case (supra) is\\n\\nmisplaced as the said judgment has been stayed by the Division\\n\\nBench in its order dated 13.5.2008.\\n29.   In    Newton Chambers & Co. vs. Neptune Waterproof\\n\\nPaper Co.Ltd., Volume LII Reports of PDTM Cases No.12, while\\n\\nconsidering the medicated preparation „IZAL‟ the court on\\n\\nexamining the manner in which the plaintiff and the defendant\\n\\nhad used the mark and the defendant‟s claim on the use of\\n\\n„IZAL‟ not as a trade mark but only as right to inform the public\\n\\nwas disallowed.\\n30.   In Cadila Healthcare Ltd. vs. Gujarat Cooperative Milk\\n\\nMarketing Federation Ltd. & Ors. 2008 36 PTC 168 ( Del) on\\n\\nthe use of words „Sugar Free‟ by the defendant which was the\\n\\nregistered trade mark of the plaintiff, his free use of the same\\n\\nwas curtailed and the defendant was restrained from expression\\n\\nCS(OS) No.2490/2009                      Page 22 of 44\\n of „sugar free‟ in the same font size which was conspicuously\\n\\nbigger than its trade mark „Amul‟. He had been permitted to use\\n\\nit only as catchy legend or a part of sentence to describe the\\n\\ncharacteristic feature of its product.\\n31.   Findings:\\n      Trade name under challenge is „PRIUS‟. Plaintiff is\\n\\nregistered with the said mark in more than 40 countries. This is\\n\\nwith effect from the year 1990. Plaintiff has no registration of\\n\\nthe mark „PRIUS‟ in India. The defendant on the other hand is\\n\\nthe registered proprietor of the trademark „PRIUS‟ with effect\\n\\nfrom March 2002.      He had commenced his business in April\\n\\n2001 under the firm name M/s Prius Auto Industries and he was\\n\\nusing the mark „PRIUS- the name you can trust‟ since then.\\n\\nDefendant has been registered with this mark under class-12 for\\n\\nauto parts and accessories but he is using it for auto accessories\\n\\nonly. He is making „Add-On Chrome Plated Accessories‟. There\\n\\nare four accessories which are common to both the plaintiff and\\n\\nthe defendant i.e. the front grill chrome, back door garnish, the\\n\\nfog lamp kit and the door handle.\\n32.   Claim of the plaintiff on the mark „PRIUS‟ is a claim based\\n\\non the common law remedy of passing off. Foreign magazines\\n\\ni.e. the \"Business Week\" and the \"New York Times\" have\\n\\nCS(OS) No.2490/2009                      Page 23 of 44\\n advertised the products of the plaintiff i.e. the hybrid car\\n\\n„PRIUS‟ from December 1997. These are, however, stray\\n\\npublications only. The \"New York Times\" is priced at more than\\n\\nRs.300/-; \"Business Week\" has since been discontinued; these\\n\\nmagazines are not available off the rack as a reading material\\n\\nfor an average Indian.     Publications of „PRIUS that shook the\\n\\nworld‟ and „The Toyota Way 14 Management Principles from the\\n\\nWorlds Greatest Manufacturer‟ also fall in the same category;\\n\\nthey do not fall in the hands of an average Indian reader.              In\\n\\nIndian dailies the \"Economic Times\" in March 1997 had first\\n\\npublished an article on the features of this car i.e. the „PRIUS‟.\\n\\nThereafter another random publication in December 1997\\n\\nfollowed by advertisements in the „Times of India‟ and „Indian\\n\\nExpress‟ dated 23.9.2002, 4.8.2004 and 19.2.2006 have been\\n\\nrelied upon.     Only in 2009 the Auto Indian Magazines i.e. the\\n\\n„Auto Car‟ and the „Zigwheel‟ had published information on this\\n\\nvehicle.\\n33.     In Gillette Company    vs. A.K.Stationery           2001 PTC 573\\n\\n(Del)    while   recognizing   the   principle    of    a     trans-border\\n\\nreputation and the spill over of its international reputation from\\n\\nforeign lands to the Indian boundaries, it had been held that its\\n\\napplication would depend upon the facts and circumstances of\\n\\nCS(OS) No.2490/2009                         Page 24 of 44\\n each case.     In the instant case, apart from these stray and\\n\\nsparse advertisements effected in the foreign magazines which\\n\\neven otherwise is doubtful if they were available to the common\\n\\nman, there appears to be little material on record to hold that an\\n\\nIndian purchaser of chrome plated auto accessories had become\\n\\naware that „PRIUS‟      is a manufactured hybrid vehicle of the\\n\\nToyota group. Plaintiff in the said case was challenging the use\\n\\nof the word „FLEXGRIP‟ by the defendant.                   Plaintiff was\\n\\nadmittedly not a registered owner of the said trademark in\\n\\nIndia; an action by the plaintiff had been filed in German court\\n\\nbut no action assailing the use of the trademark by the\\n\\ndefendant in India had been filed prior to the filing of the suit.\\n\\nPlaintiff alleging in the plaint that it was only in the last week of\\n\\nApril, 1999 he learnt about this use of trademark by the\\n\\ndefendant was clearly falsified by his own acts as he had way\\n\\nback in 1997 filed a case in the German Court; this false\\n\\nconcealment by the plaintiff had worked against him.\\n\\n34.   In Sakalain Meghjee v. B.M.House (India) Ltd. 2002 (24)\\n\\nPTC 207 (Del) the subject matter of the suit were two magazines\\n\\none published by the plaintiff and other by the defendant both\\n\\ntitled „Wedding Affair‟. Negativing the arguments of a trans-\\n\\nboarder reputation in favour of the plaintiff as the foreign\\n\\nCS(OS) No.2490/2009                        Page 25 of 44\\n magazine relied upon by the plaintiff was a publication of\\n\\nLondon whereas the defendant was using the same in India\\n\\nsince 1999 and although the plaintiff was prior user of the\\n\\ntrademark since 1994 but being a foreign magazine the plaintiff\\n\\nwas to show that the said magazine was sold and known in India\\n\\nfor which there was no such document. Plaintiff was held not\\n\\nentitled to the relief of an interim injunction.\\n\\n35.    In the instant case defendant on the other hand has\\n\\nplaced on record his registration certificate evidencing the\\n\\nregistration of this trademark „PRIUS‟ in his name with effect\\n\\nfrom March 2002. This is prima facie proof of the exclusive use\\n\\nof the said mark with effect from the said date in terms of\\n\\nSection 28(2) of the said Act. The bills and invoices filed by him\\n\\nfurther show that the defendant company is actively conducting\\n\\nits business under the name PRIUS Auto Industries and using its\\n\\ntrade name „PRIUS‟ since then.         The purchase orders from\\n\\nreputed     companies    which   include    the      General   Motors,\\n\\nMahendra & Mahendra and Hyundai show that auto accessories\\n\\nin bulk are being supplied to the manufacturers of the said\\n\\nvehicles.   Sale figures of the defendant have also risen and\\n\\nswelled from a turnover of 1,34,799 in the year 2002 to\\n\\n53,63,869 in the year 2009.        Net profits have grown from\\n\\nCS(OS) No.2490/2009                         Page 26 of 44\\n 1,04,182 to 8,51,281 in the corresponding years.          Business of\\n\\nthe defendant company may not be matching the turnover of the\\n\\nplaintiff company but that is not a consideration for dealing with\\n\\nthe contentions raised in the present application.\\n\\n36.     The fact that the defendant had commenced its business\\n\\nas early as 2002 became known to the defendant if not earlier\\n\\nbut definitely in April 2003. Publications in the \"Auto Car\" and\\n\\nthe \"Over Drive\" which are pioneer publications of automobiles\\n\\ncontain advertisements of the defendant under its trade name\\n\\n„PRIUS‟. Argument of the plaintiff that this was only a\\n\\nconstructive knowledge and based on an inference is misplaced.\\n\\nPlaintiff has relied upon the same auto magazine i.e. the \"Auto\\n\\nCar\". Both parties are admittedly aware of this publication and\\n\\nare advertising their products in the said journal. This is evident\\n\\nfrom the publications for the months of December and January\\n\\n2004.\\n37.     In the Amrit Dhara Pharmacy case (supra) where the\\n\\nplaintiff had stood as a silent spectator and allowed the\\n\\ndefendant to expand his business; the plea of acquiescence\\n\\nraised by the defendant had been upheld. The Supreme Court\\n\\nhad quoted with approval a passage from the Halsbury‟s Laws of\\n\\n\\n\\nCS(OS) No.2490/2009                       Page 27 of 44\\n England, Vol.32 (second edition) pages 659-675, paragraph 966\\n\\nwhich inter alia reads as follows:\\n38.   In Khoday Distilleries Limited‟s case (supra) the Supreme\\n\\nCourt had quoted with the approval a passage from the Power\\n\\nControl Appliances and Ors. v. Sumeet Research and Holdings\\n\\n(1994) 1 SCR 708 on the aspect of acquiescence and had held as\\n\\nfollows:\\n39.   In Ramdev Food Products(P) Ltd. v. Arvindbhai Rambhai\\n\\nPatel and Ors.2006 (33) PTC 281 Supreme Court had held:\\n\\n40.   In Halsbury‟s Laws of England, Fourth Edition, Vol. 16\\n\\npara 1505, it is stated: -\\n41.   In Mc Donald‟s Corporation and Anr. v. Sterling‟s Mac\\n\\nFood Represented by its Partner John Mathew ILR 2007 Kar\\n\\n3346 the plaintiff had adopted its registered trade mark          BIG\\n\\nMAC in 1968 in the USA. He had been registered in India in\\n\\n1993 but had started using the trademark in October, 1996.\\n\\nDefendant on the other hand had been carrying on its business\\n\\nsince 1983; it was held that the plaintiff having sowed the\\n\\nbusiness much later could not find fault with the defendant in\\n\\nusing its trademark in its business.\\n42.   Similar observations were made by a Coordinate Bench of\\n\\nthis court in Allied Blenders and Distillers P. Ltd. v. Paul P.John\\n\\nand Ors. 2008 (38) PTC 568 (Del). In this case also the sale\\n\\nfigures of the product of the defendant had shown the growth of\\nCS(OS) No.2490/2009                         Page 29 of 44\\n the defendant in the market; the plaintiff was aware that the\\n\\ndefendant had entered the market which was established from\\n\\nthe opposition made by the defendant before the Excise\\n\\nCommissioner. In these circumstances, the inordinate delay in\\n\\nbringing the action had held the plaintiff disentitled to the\\n\\ndiscretionary relief of an injunction.\\n43.     In Procter & Gamble Company v. Satish Patel and Ors.\\n\\n1997 (1) ARBLR 158 (Del) the trademark used by the plaintiff\\n\\nand thereafter by the defendants was „SAFEGUARD‟ for\\n\\nmanufacture of an Ayurvedic Antiseptic cream. Defendant s had\\n\\nbeen selling its products since 1984.         Suit had been filed in\\n\\n1995.    The unexplained delay of 11 years by the plaintiff was\\n\\nheld fatal to the case of the plaintiff; plaintiff was held not\\n\\nentitled     to   the   discretionary    relief    of     an   injunction.\\n\\nAcquiescence, waiver and delay had come in his way.\\n\\n44.     In Standard Electricals Limited v. Rocket Electricals and\\n\\nAnr. 2004 (72) DRJ 794 the delay of 10 years on the part of the\\n\\nplaintiff in filing his suit in an action of passing off on the use of\\n\\nthe trademark „Max Standard‟ used by the defendant; trademark\\n\\nof the plaintiff being „MS standard‟, had disentitled the plaintiff\\n\\nto relief.\\n\\nCS(OS) No.2490/2009                           Page 30 of 44\\n 45.   Plaintiff has come to the court in December 2009. He has\\n\\npleaded knowledge with effect from 2009; this is negatived by\\n\\ndocumentary evidence placed on record. It is impossible and\\n\\nunimaginable to believe that the plaintiff who is a reputed and\\n\\nworldwide established business name in automobiles and is\\n\\nadvertising and publishing its product in pioneer auto car\\n\\nmagazines including the „Auto Car‟ journal and the „Zigwheel‟\\n\\nhad no knowledge that the plaintiff was operating under the\\n\\ntrade name ‟PRIUS‟. Plaintiff has come to the court after a long\\n\\nand inordinate delay i.e. a delay of more than seven years for\\n\\nwhich there is no explanation.   His submission that he learnt\\n\\nabout the defendant only in 2009 on a stray web search is\\n\\npatently false.\\n46.   Plaintiff has also not come clean to the court. Although in\\n\\nhis plaint he has averred that the defendant is the registered\\n\\nowner of the trademark „PRIUS‟ yet he has failed to disclose the\\n\\ndate of the registration when the defendant was registered with\\n\\nthe said mark i.e. from March 2002. This would have been a\\n\\ncrucial factor weighing in the mind of the Court at the time\\n\\nwhen the ex parte injunction was granted in his favour. In Old\\n\\nNavy (ITM) Inc. and Ors., GAP (ITM) Inc. and Ors. and Banana\\n\\nRepublic (Itm) Inc. and Ors. 2007(99) DRJ 571 it was held that\\n\\nCS(OS) No.2490/2009                      Page 31 of 44\\n non-disclosure of material facts would work to the prejudice of\\n\\nsuch a non-disclosing party disentitling him to a relief in equity.\\n\\n47.     The word PRIUS also does not appear to be an invented\\n\\nword.    Apart from the fact that it finds mention in both the\\n\\nenglish dictionaries i.e. the Oxford and the Webster‟s, the word\\n\\nPRIUS itself is a suggestive of its meaning i.e. prior in time.\\n\\nExplanation of the defendant that this was a „Pehla Prayas‟ i.e.\\n\\nhis first effort which had led him to use this word which he had\\n\\nsearched from a web search is fair and plausible.          Defendant\\n\\ncannot be charged with any dishonesty. PRIUS is a latin word\\n\\nand although latin is not in great use or demand in India yet the\\n\\nfact that this word finds mention in the english dictionary as also\\n\\nthe word itself being suggestive of its meaning the explanation\\n\\nfurnished by the defendant is reasonable. His use of the mark\\n\\nPRIUS as an honest user is prima facie established. It is in fact\\n\\nthe plaintiff who had concealed the true picture from the Court;\\n\\nit was incumbent upon him to have disclosed to the Court that\\n\\nwhen he had come to the Court in the year 2009 defendant was\\n\\nalready registered with the said mark 7 years prior in time and\\n\\nwas carrying on business under the said name. Mere appending\\n\\nof a document with the plaint is not by itself sufficient, specific\\n\\nnotice of the said fact should have been brought to the Court\\n\\nCS(OS) No.2490/2009                        Page 32 of 44\\n which he did not do so. This was a dishonest concealment by\\n\\nthe plaintiff.\\n48.   Delay, acquiescence and waiver clearly come in the way of\\n\\nthe plaintiff to obtain the discretionary relief prayed for by him.\\n\\nHe has from 2003 remained a silent spectator to the growth of\\n\\nthe defendant who has in relative terms scaled heights and has\\n\\ngrown from a mini business to a maxi business. His sale units\\n\\nand net profits have climbed the rungs of the ladder of his\\n\\nsuccess.\\n49.   The trade dress of the defendant is also distinctly\\n\\ndissimilar.      The packaging of the plaintiff‟s product is a bache\\n\\ncoloured rectangular carton having red writings describing its\\n\\nproduct. Packaging of the defendant‟s carton is a blue coloured\\n\\nsquare box having the writings in red colour.           Not only is the\\n\\nshape of the          packaging   material different but all visual\\n\\nimpressions and their getup including its colour scheme,\\n\\ndescription of the words i.e. their font, size and alphabetical\\n\\narray are also distinctly dissimilar.    Prices of the articles are at\\n\\nenormous variation.       Whereas the articles of the plaintiff are\\n\\nwithin the price range of Rs.2,500/- to Rs.23,503/-, the same\\n\\narticles are priced by the defendant between a range of Rs.275/-\\n\\nto a maximum outer limit of Rs.1600/-. Rs.1,600/- is the most\\n\\nCS(OS) No.2490/2009                         Page 33 of 44\\n expensive auto accessory of the defendant for which the\\n\\ncorresponding price of the plaintiff is Rs.23,503/-. The class of\\n\\nthe purchaser of these auto accessories is not the low income\\n\\ngroup; it is definitely the strata of the middle class and moreso\\n\\nthe higher group who has the financial capacity to buy a vehicle\\n\\nin the segment of more than Rs.6 lacs.           They are purchasing\\n\\nauto accessories to decorate their vehicles which are already\\n\\nequipped     with     the   basic   amenities/essential       manufacturer\\n\\nnecessities. The purchaser is only adding accessories to his car.\\n\\nHe would most definitely be an educated and an intelligent\\n\\nliterate man who would be aware that the articles or the\\n\\naccessories which he is purchasing are the accessories of the\\n\\ndefendant.      Even applying the test of a man of average\\n\\nintelligence and of imperfect recollection such a purchaser is\\n\\nnot likely to be confused or deceived that he would or could be\\n\\npurchasing auto accessories manufactured by the plaintiff\\n\\ncompany i.e. Toyota Group.\\n50.   In Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma v. Navaratna\\n\\nPharmaceutical Laboratories, 1965 (1) SC 737 the Supreme\\n\\nCourt while considering the registration of the words „Navaratna\\n\\nPharmacy‟ while rejecting the prayer of the plaintiff had inter\\n\\nalia held as follows:\\nCS(OS) No.2490/2009                           Page 34 of 44\\n51.   In Khoday Distilleries Limited (supra) while dealing with\\n\\nthe nature of a purchaser of „Peter Scot‟ whisky the purchaser\\n\\nbeing discerning and aware of the brand that he is purchasing of\\n\\na rich and wealthy class; keeping in view the nature of the\\n\\npurchase i.e. scotch whisky, it was held that such a purchaser\\n\\nwas not likely to be easily confused or deceived merely by the\\n\\nwords „scot‟.\\n52.   The defendant on the use of the registered marks Toyota,\\n\\nthe toyota device      and the INNOVA is protected under the\\n\\nsaving clause of Section 30 which prevents user of a registered\\n\\ntrade mark for the purpose of identification of the goods; this of\\n\\ncourse must be qualified by his honest user.\\n53.   Section 30(1) (b) & 30(2)(d) of the said Act inter alia reads\\n\\nas follows :\\n\\nCS(OS) No.2490/2009                          Page 35 of 44\\n54.   The European Court in an appeal against the order of a\\n\\nCourt of Appeal by the Gillette Group of Companies in the case\\n\\nof Gillette Company vs. L.A.Laboratory 2005(37) FSR 808 had\\n\\ninter alia given its finding as follows:-\\n55.   The conditions of an honest use within the meaning of\\n\\nArticle 1(1)(c) of the Directive 89/104 was held to be in\\n\\nsubstance the expression of a duty to act fairly in relation to the\\n\\nlegitimate interests of the trade mark owner.               The use is\\n\\ndishonest only if:\\n56.   None of these have been established by the plaintiff. On\\n\\nthe other hand, it has been established by the defendant that the\\n\\nuse of the mark „PRIUS‟ by him is in accordance with the honest\\n\\npractices in industrial and commercial matters. This user is not\\n\\ntaking any unfair advantage; his use is not detrimental to the\\n\\ndistinctive character or the repute of such a trademark; it does\\n\\nnot amount to an infringement/passing off.         It is essentially for\\n\\ndescribing the kind, quality and quantity of the goods which he\\n\\nis proposing to sell and they are auto accessories for the various\\n\\nvehicles mentioned in his packing carton and also in the\\n\\nadvertisements hosted by him. Packaging, getup, writing/marks\\n\\non the goods of the defendant are only indicative of the fact that\\n\\nhe is selling auto accessories which are suitable to a wide range\\nCS(OS) No.2490/2009                         Page 37 of 44\\n of vehicles including the „INNOVA‟ as also the „Qualis‟ which is\\n\\nvehicle belonging to the Toyota Group. The mention of the word\\n\\n„TOYOTA‟, „toyota device‟ and „INNOVA‟ on the said packaging\\n\\nmaterial   are    not   the   only   vehicles     mentioned     in   these\\n\\ndocuments; they are in addition to the names of the other\\n\\nvehicles i.e. Zen, Alto, they are further qualified by the words\\n\\n\"vehicle name and logo for item identification only\" i.e. for the\\n\\ndescription of the goods and can in no manner be said to be an\\n\\ninfringement upon the trademarks of the plaintiff. It is an honest\\n\\nuser in the commercial course of his trade.\\n57. Under Section 29 (2) of the said Act \"a registered trademark\\nis infringed by a person who, not being a registered proprietor or a\\nperson using by way of permitted use, uses it in the course of trade\\n.............. is likely to cause confusion on the part of the public or which\\nis likely to have an association with the registered trademark.\"\\n\\nUnder sub-clause (4) (c) \"a registered trademark is infringed by a\\nperson who, not being a registered proprietor or a person using by\\nway of permitted use, uses in the course of trade, a mark\\nwhich............ the registered trade mark has reputation in India and\\nthe use of the mark without due cause takes unfair advantage of or is\\ndetrimental to, the distinctive character or repute of the registered\\ntrade mark.\"\\nThe onus to prove that the mark of the plaintiff has been\\n\\ninfringed lies upon the plaintiff.\\n58.   Section-30 lays down limitation on the provisions of\\n\\nSection 29. A trademark is not infringed where it‟s use by\\n\\nanother is not unfair and is used only to indicate the kind, quality\\n\\nand quantity of the goods. Further under Section 30(2)(d) the\\nCS(OS) No.2490/2009                             Page 38 of 44\\n use of the trade mark as in the instant case the use of „TOYOTA‟,\\n\\n„toyota device‟ and „INNOVA‟ by the defendant in relation to his\\n\\ngoods i.e. the auto accessories is reasonably necessary to\\n\\nindicate that the goods are adaptable and suited to the vehicles\\n\\nmentioned therein i.e. the „TOYOTA‟ and „INNOVA‟; „the toyota\\n\\ndevice‟ is also indicative of this purpose only. Protection under\\n\\nthe aforestated exception carved out is available to the\\n\\ndefendant. This is an indication by the defendant to show that\\n\\nhis product is compatible for use as an auto accessory in the\\n\\nvehicles manufactured by the plaintiff i.e. „TOYOTA‟ and the\\n\\n„INNOVA‟. Even otherwise the use of the word „INNOVA‟ is not\\n\\non all the packaging materials which has been produced in the\\n\\nCourt. It is only on the small rectangular carton where on either\\n\\nside there is a sticker of „INNOVA‟. In some of the other cartons\\n\\nwhich have been filed by the plaintiff a visual picture of the\\n\\n„INNOVA‟ vehicle has been shown and the catch cover of\\n\\n„PRIUS‟ has been described to be an accessory for the Toyota\\n\\nINNOVA; this is qualified by the use of the words \"vehicle name\\n\\nand logo are used for items identification only\".            This is\\n\\nsufficiently indicative of the fact that this catch cover is suitable\\n\\nfor the „INNOVA‟ vehicle. It is definitely not likely to deceive the\\n\\npurchaser that he is purchasing an auto accessory manufactured\\n\\nCS(OS) No.2490/2009                        Page 39 of 44\\n by the plaintiff group. Apart from the low pricing of the product\\n\\nof the defendant in comparison with the price of the product of\\n\\nthe plaintiff the clarification given by the defendant that this\\n\\nproduct is for an item identification only and the vehicle name\\n\\nand the logo are used for this purpose only squarely covers the\\n\\ncase of the defendant in the exception carved out in Section 30\\n\\n(2) (d) of the Act.\\n59.      The judgments relied upon by the plaintiff are all\\n\\ndistinguishable on their own facts. In the Jolen Inc. case and\\n\\nFord Motors company case (supra), plaintiff had established its\\n\\nreputation and goodwill in the country of its origin as also in\\n\\nIndia.    In the Milmet Oftho Industries case (supra) the Court\\n\\nhad in fact observed that multinational corporation who had no\\n\\nintention of coming to India and introducing their products in\\n\\nIndia should not be allowed to throttle an Indian company. In\\n\\nthe Daimler Benz case (supra) „BENZ‟ was registered in India\\n\\nsince 1951. In the N.R.Dongre case (supra) the plaintiff no.1 a\\n\\nmultinational incorporated in USA of whom plaintiff no.2 was its\\n\\nlicensee in India. The trade mark and trade name \"Whirlpool\"\\n\\nhad been registered in India in 1956; in 1978 the registration\\n\\nlapsed on account of failure to apply for renewal; thereafter an\\n\\napplication for registration was filed in 1988.          Defendant in\\n\\nCS(OS) No.2490/2009                      Page 40 of 44\\n 1986 applied for the registration of the trademark „Whirlpool‟.\\n\\nThe prior user of the mark „Whirlpool‟ claimed by the plaintiff\\n\\nwas upheld as he had a continuous registration in his name\\n\\nright from 1956-1977 which had held him entitled to the interim\\n\\nrelief.     It was only in the light of these facts that the plea of\\n\\ntrans-border reputation had been considered by the courts.\\n\\nWord „PRIUS‟ finds its place in the english dictionary; not being\\n\\nan invented word, it is clear that the judgments of Ciba Ltd., A.\\n\\nVolvo & Satyam Infoway (supra) are also distinguishable.\\n\\n60.       Plaintiff is not entitled to the discretionary relief as prayed\\n\\nfor by him. He has not been able to make any prima facie case\\n\\nin his favour for injuncting the defendant from using the\\n\\ntrademark „PRIUS‟ on which the defendant is admittedly               the\\n\\nregistered proprietor and owner since the year 2002. Principles\\n\\nof equity and fair play also do not find favour with the plaintiff.\\n\\nThe balance of convenience in fact lies in favour of the\\n\\ndefendant.       If at this stage i.e. after business growth of more\\n\\nthan seven years the defendant is injuncted from using his trade\\n\\nname under which he is selling his auto accessory products he\\n\\nwould suffer huge business loss which would probably bring to a\\n\\nclose not only his business reputation but all his legitimate\\n\\nfinancial expectations. On the other hand no irreparable loss or\\n\\nCS(OS) No.2490/2009                            Page 41 of 44\\n injury will be suffered by the plaintiff as admittedly the plaintiff\\n\\nis not in the market; it has not launched the vehicle „PRIUS‟ on\\n\\nthe Indian roads.     Plaintiff has himself conceded that certain\\n\\ndefects had been noted in the vehicle which had led to the\\n\\nsuspension of the production of the said vehicle.\\n\\n61.   The defendant is neither guilty of infringing the registered\\n\\ntrademark „TOYOTA‟, „toyota device‟ or „INNOVA‟.            He is also\\n\\nnot guilty of the use of the word PRIUS in any manner which\\n\\nwould deceive a customer into believing that what he has\\n\\npurchased are auto accessory parts of „PRIUS‟ which is an\\n\\nassociate group of the Toyota Company.           Defendant is selling\\n\\nauto accessories under his registered trade name „PRIUS‟ since\\n\\n2002; his packaging material and trade dress are markedly\\n\\ndifferent as that of the plaintiff, his pricing is distinct, his colour\\n\\nscheme and the size of the font of the alphabets are dissimilar,\\n\\nshape of the packaging is different, class of purchasers is a\\n\\nhigher income group with a tested intelligence knowing and fully\\n\\nable to understand the nature of the goods which he is\\n\\npurchasing and thereby unlikely to be confused that he is\\n\\npurchasing a product of the plaintiff. Defendant has grown in\\n\\nbusiness from 2001 to 2009 i.e. from a small stature to a big\\n\\nbusiness company operating through defendants no. 1 and 4. He\\n\\nCS(OS) No.2490/2009                         Page 42 of 44\\n is advertising his products in leading car magazines and\\n\\nparticipating in exhibition and auto shows of repute where other\\n\\npioneer manufacturer of automobiles i.e. the Toyota Group,\\n\\nHyundai Group, General Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra are\\n\\nadvertising their products and participating in such shows.\\n\\nThese reputed car manufacturer General Motors, Hyundai\\n\\nGroup and Mahindra & Mahihdra had placed bulk purchase\\n\\norders   on   the     defendant   who   has    been       supplying   auto\\n\\naccessories to them to be fitted in their cars.               The gradual\\n\\ngrowth and reputation built up by the defendant cannot be\\n\\ndestroyed in a single stroke. Plaintiff has come to the court too\\n\\nlate in the day. He has not been able to explain that he gained\\n\\nknowledge about the presence of the defendant in the market\\n\\nonly in October, 2009. Why he slept over the matter and idled\\n\\nover it for such a long period? PRIUS is not the monopoly of the\\n\\nplaintiff in India. It is not an invented word; the meaning of the\\n\\nword can be deciphered from the word itself; meaning \"prior to\".\\n\\nIt finds mention in the english dictionary, how can it then be\\n\\ntermed as invented or coined? Association of this word and the\\n\\nsame having acquired a secondary meaning with the plaintiff\\n\\ncompany has not been established.         Plaintiff has given up all\\n\\nclaims if any on the use of the mark „PRIUS„ as he has knocked\\n\\nCS(OS) No.2490/2009                           Page 43 of 44\\n the doors of the Court after an unexplainable delay of more than\\n\\nsix and half years. Plaintiff has also no business in India. He is\\n\\nnot recognized in India. His product has not come on the Indian\\n\\nroad.    Production of his vehicle, due to technical reasons has\\n\\nnow been suspended. None of the ingredients for continuing of\\n\\nthe interim injunction in favour of the plaintiff arise.                If\\n\\ninjunction is allowed to continue, the loss to be suffered by the\\n\\ndefendant would become irreparable as his business would come\\n\\nto stand still. In these circumstances, balance of convenience is\\n\\nalso in favour of the defendant. The application of the defendant\\n\\nunder Order 39 Rule 4 CPC is accordingly allowed and the\\n\\ninterim ex parte injunction granted on 22.12.2009 is set aside.\\n\\n62.     I.A.No.16776/2009 and I.A.No.110/2010 are disposed off\\n\\naccordingly.\\n63.

The applicant filed this rectification application under Sections 46, 56 and 107 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) for the rectification of the entry relating to the registered trade mark No. 228867 in class 7 stands in the name of the first respondent. The case of the applicant is that the applicant company is one incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 since 1963 and the applicant company and/or its predecessors in title have been carrying on business of manufacturing, marketing and exporting of diesel oil engines, (not for land vehicles) and parts thereof, centrifugal pumps, agricultural pumps, electric motors, pumping sets and parts thereof etc. They and their predecessor in title have been using the trade \\'FIELD MARSHAL\\' for their aforesaid goods. The trade mark \\'FIELD MARSHAL\\' is duly registered under the provisions of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 in the name of the petitioner as follows:-\\nThe registrations were made in the year 1964 in respect of number 224879 and in the year 1965 in respect of other registration Nos. 252070 and 252071. The registration of the trade mark \\'FIELD MARSHAL\\' has been periodically renewed from time to time and the same is valid and effective. The applicant as well as their predecessor in title incurred huge expenses by way of advertisements to popularise the impugned trade mark \\'FIELD MARSHAL\\' and by the long and continuous use of the said trade mark, the same has acquired unique reputation and goodwill in the public. The said trade mark \\'FIELD MARSHAL\\' is always identified with the applicant and their goods.\\n2. The impugned trade mark 228867 was registered in the name of Puran Chand Jain and Kailash Chand Jain trading as M/s Jain Industries. The said trade mark was registered in class 7 in respect of flour mills, circulation and centrifugal pumps, couplings for machines, pulleys included in class 7 and valves being parts of machines. The impugned trade mark \\'FIELD MARSHAL\\' was never used by the proprietors in respect of centrifugal pumps and the registered proprietors used the mark only for flour mills. The first respondent herein M/s Thukral Mechanical Works infringed the registered trade mark of the applicant by using the same in respect of centrifugal pumps or agricultural pumps. On coming to know about the infringement by the respondent and misuse of the same, the applicant filed Suit No. 2408 of 1985 on the file of the High Court of Delhi against the first respondent herein. In the said suit the first respondent herein contended that they used the trade mark \\'FIELD MARSHAL\\' since the year 1973. The first respondent also claimed the use of the trade mark \\'FIELD MARSHAL\\' since the year 1973 before the Registrar of Trade Marks, New Delhi in the proceedings in opposition No. DEL-4109 filed by the first respondent. The applicant filed criminal miscellaneous petition No. 934 of 1986 before the High Court of Delhi to initiate criminal prosecution against the first respondent for fabricating the documents. Having contested the suit, which is still pending, the first respondent got the assignment of the impugned registered trade mark No. 228867 from M/s Jain Industries. The said assignment in favour of the first respondent is a mala fide one and with the dishonest intention of defeating the ends of law and to continue the trade upon the goodwill and reputation of the applicant.\\n3. The applicant filed C.O. No. 9 of 1989 for rectification of the impugned trade mark No. 228867 against M/s Jain Industries, the original registered proprietors. The said petition was withdrawn by the applicant with the permission of the High Court of Delhi to file the present rectification petition against the first respondent, since it was represented that the first respondent became the registered proprietor of the impugned trade mark by way of assignment. The said representation was made in January 1987. The grounds on which the present rectification petition filed are;\\n(i) The registration of the impugned trade mark under No. 228867 was made without sufficient cause and it is wrongly remaining on the Register of Trade Marks and the assignment of the impugned trade mark in favour of the first respondent also amounts to fraud and is not sustainable under law. (ii) The existence of the impugned trade mark on the Register of Trade Marks is an obstacle in the use and registration of the trade mark \\'FIELD MARSHAL\\' of the applicants.\\n(iii) The impugned registered trade mark is being misused by the first respondent who are  infringers and offenders.\\n(iv) The registered proprietors M/s Jain Industries never used the impugned trade mark till the date of filing of the petition either before grant of impugned registration or after in respect of circular or centrifugal pumps.\\n(v) The impugned trade mark was obtained without any bona fide intention on their part to use the same in relation to circulation/centrifugal pumps or parts thereof and there is no bonafide use of the impugned trade mark in relation to the said goods by the then registered proprietors for the time being up to a period of five years and one month before the date of the present petition within the meaning of Section 46 (1) of the said Act.\\n(vi) The entry relating to the impugned trade mark was wrongly made on the register on the date of registration there of, the said persons were not the proprietors of the impugned trade mark within the meaning of Section 18(1) of the Act. (vii) The assignment of the impugned trade mark and recordal there of by the second respondent in the name of the first respondent is illegal, invalid and contrary to the provisions of the Act.\\n(viii) The assignor was not the proprietor of the impugned trade mark at the time of its assignment in favour of the first respondent and as such the instrument through the assignment was made is illegal and void in the eye of law.\\n(ix) For the reasons stated above the applicant seeks rectification of the Register of Trade Marks by deletion or expunge of the impugned trade mark so far as it relates to the circulation or centrifugal pumps are concerned.\\n4. The first respondent filed the reply wherein they refuted all the averments of the applicant made in their application. Further the first respondent asserted that in the applicant\\'s trade mark application 389729 dated 10.05.82 which was advertised in the Trade Mark Journal No. 902 dated 1.1.87, the applicant has admitted that they are not using the trade mark \\'FIELD MARSHAL\\' in respect of centrifugal pumps. On the contrary they made a false\\' claim for having used the trade mark FIELD MARSHAL\\' in respect of centrifugal pumps since 1963. First respondent further asserted that they were using the trade mark \\'FIELD MARSHAL\\' continuously and widely since 1973. They further contended that there is no mala fide intention or any fraud in the assigned of the impugned trade mark in favour of the first respondent. The original registered proprietors of the impugned trade mark were using the said trade mark well within the knowledge of the applicant and as such the plea of non-user is without any basis and consequently prayed for dismissal of the application.\\n5. Before the High Court of Delhi the documents were filed and oral evidence was let in by both the parties. On behalf of the applicant four witnesses were examined. It may be pertinent to note that the applicant wanted to examine Mr. Kailash Chand Jain, one of the partners of M/s Jain Industries, the assignor of the first respondent and subsequently on 6.2.96 made a representation that they did not want to examine him. On behalf of the first respondent three witnesses were examined. C.O. No. 6/87 was transferred to this Board pursuant to Section 100 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999.\\n6. The learned counsel for the applicant contended that C.O. No. 9/86 was filed against M/s Jain Industries, the registered proprietor of the impugned trade mark \\'FIELD MARSHAL\\' on the ground that the registered owners did not use the trade mark for a period of five years and one month prior to the date of filing of the petition, as contemplated under Section 46 (1) and consequently the remaining of the said trade mark in the trade mark register is wrong or invalid. When the said C.O. 9/86 was pending the impugned trade mark was assigned in favour of the first respondent on 30.5.86. The assignment in favour of the first respondent was brought to the notice of the Court and also to the applicant in January 1987 and immediately the applicant withdrew the rectification petition C.O. 9/86 filed against M/s Jain Industries with liberty to file fresh rectification petition against the first respondent on the same cause of action. This rectification petition was filed mainly on the ground that the original registered proprietors M/s Jain Industries as well as the first respondent never used the impugned trade mark for a period of five years and one month and consequently the same is liable to be removed from the Register of Trade Marks. He also contended that the assignment in favour of the first respondent is invalid since on the date of assignment the assignors were not the owners of M/s Jain Industries. There is absolutely no evidence on behalf of the first respondent for the use of the impugned trade mark from the date of assignment till the date of filing of this rectification petition. Hence, it is a clear case of non-user for the statutory period as contemplated under Section 46(1) of the Act and as such the petition is to be allowed.\\n7. The learned counsel for the first respondent contended that the applicant filed the Suit No. 2408/85 on the file of High Court of Delhi and obtained ex parte injunction on 19.12.85. The said ex parte injunction was vacated on 19.1.88. The first respondent got the assignment of the impugned trade mark on 30.5.86. C.O. No. 9/86 filed against M/s Jain Industries was withdrawn on 16.1.87 by the applicant. The present rectification petition was filed on 19.1.87. In the present rectification petition in para 8 the applicant made an averment that the first respondent imitated and infringed the registered trade mark \\'FIELD MARSHAL\\' of the applicant and started using the same in respect of centrifugal pumps and agricultural pumps and this statement of the applicant makes it clear that the first respondent was using the trade mark \\'FIELD MARSHAL\\'. Hence, the plea of non-user will not arise in view of the admission of the applicant about the use of \\'FIELD MARSHAL\\' Trade Mark by the respondent. Similarly in the legal notice issued by the first respondent in the year 1982 there is a specific mention about the use of the trade mark \\'FIELD MARSHAL\\' by the first respondent. Apart from this the first respondent had stated in the oral evidence about the use of the trade mark \\'FIELD MARSHAL\\' and the said statement in the chief examination was not challenged in his cross-examination and as such use of the trade mark \\'FIELD MARSHAL\\' by the first respondent has to be taken as established by the admissions of the applicant as well as by the oral evidence of the first respondent. In such circumstances there is no need for the first respondent to let any independent evidence to establish their case of user. Further, during the period in which the order of injunction passed by the Court was in force, the respondent was restrained from using the said trade mark and hence that period has to be deducted as per Section 46(3) of the Act while calculating the statutory period prescribed under Section 46(1) of the Act as the first respondent had been prevented from using the said trade mark by the order of the Court. If that period is excluded then the statutory period of five years and one month is not satisfied and as such the petition is liable to be dismissed. We considered the above contentions of the respective counsel.\\n8. The applicant firm adopted the trade mark \\'FIELD MARSHAL\\' in respect of diesel oil engines and parts thereof in the year 1963. The applicant firm was established in the year 1963. Originally Patel Manufacturers were the users of the trade mark. The firm Patel Manufacturers was taken over by the applicant in the year 1981. The trade mark \\'FIELD MARSHAL\\' was registered under 224879 claiming user since 1963. The trade mark stylish \\'FIELD MARSHAL\\' registered under 252070 and the trade mark logo \\'FIELD MARSHAL\\' registered under 252071. The first respondent since copied the trade mark of the applicant and infringed the same, the applicant filed the suit against the first respondent for passing-off in Suit No. 2408/85 and obtained an order of injunction on 19.12.85.\\n9. The applicant came to know that one M/s Jain Industries, Agra had obtained registration of the same trade mark \\'FIELD MARSHAL\\' in class 7. The applicant filed rectification petition C.O. 9/86 on 31.5.86 for the removal of the said Trade Mark 228867, the impugned one in the present proceedings. On 30.5.86 first respondent got the assignment of the impugned trade mark and filed the request in TM-24 on 17.6.86 before the Registrar of Trade Marks, Mumbai for transfer of the said trade mark in their name during the period when the injunction order in favour of the first respondent was in force. On 24.10.86 the Registrar of Trade Marks passed an order and allowed the assignment in favour of the first respondent and entered the same in the name of the first respondent. On 16.1.87 M/s Jain Industries, respondents in C.O. No. 9/86 brought to the notice of the High Court of Delhi about the fact of assignment and on the same day the High Court permitted the applicant to withdraw the said C.O. No. 9/86 with liberty to file fresh C.O. against the first respondent herein on the same cause of action. On 19.1.87 the present rectification application was filed against the first respondent.\\n10. It may be appropriate to make a mention here that the first respondent filed the application No. 363764 for registration of the trade mark \\'FIELD MARSHAL\\' in class 7 in the year 1978. The same was advertised in the Trade Marks Journal on 16.11.84. The first respondent withdrew the said application on 20.3.87 i.e., subsequent to the assignment of the impugned Trade Mark 228867 in their favour.\\n11. Though several contentions were raised by both the counsel, we are of the view that there is absolutely no necessity to discuss any of them as they are unnecessary. The only relevant question to be considered in this rectification petition is whether the impugned trade mark 228867 \\'FIELD MARSHAL\\' is liable to he removed from the Register of Trade Marks due to non-use for a period of five years and one month prior to the filing of this petition. This is the main ground on which the present rectification petition was filed. The averments made by the applicant in the petition is that the impugned trade mark though registered in the name of M/s Jain Industries long back still they have not used the trade mark for the purpose of manufacturing centrifugal pumps. Though the first respondent got assignment of the said impugned trade mark in their favour as early as 30.5.86 they also did not use the said trade mark for manufacture of the centrifugal pumps till the filing of the petition, and as such the said impugned trade mark is liable to be removed from the Register of Trade Marks or in alternate the registration be rectified with the expression \\'circulation or centrifugal pumps\\' are deleted or expunged from the specification of goods in respect of which the impugned trade mark is registered.\\n12. In order to consider this question we have to first see the provision under Section 46(1). Section 46(1) of the Act is as follows:-\\n\"46. Removal from register and imposition of limitations on ground of non-use.-\\n(1) Subject to the provisions of Section 47, a registered trade mark may he taken off the register in respect of any of the goods in respect of which it is registered on application made in the prescribe manner to a High Court or to the Registrar by any person aggrieved on the ground either-\\n(a) that the trade mark was registered without any bona fide intention on the part of the applicant for registration that it should be used in relation to those goods by him or, in a case to which the provisions of Section 45 apply, by the company concerned, and that there has, in fact been no bona fide use of the trade mark in relation to those goods by any proprietor thereof for the time being up to a date one month before the date of application; or\\n \\n\\n(b) that upto a date one month before the date of application, a continuous period of five years or longer had elapsed during which the trade mark was registered and during which there was no bona fide use thereof in relation to those goods by any proprietor thereof for the time being.\"\\nThe above provision empowers the High Court or the Registrar to remove from the Register of Trade Marks or impose any limitation on the ground of non-use. Sub-clause (b) of Sub-section (1) prescribes a period of five years and one month or longer for the non-use of the said trade mark to suffer the removal. Hence, what we have to consider is whether the applicant had established the non-use of the impugned trade mark by the first respondent within the period of five years and one month prior to the filing of the present rectification petition.\\n13. The learned counsel for the respondent contended that the averments in para 8 in the rectification petition that the first respondent had been using the trade mark \\'FIELD MARSHAL\\' in respect of centrifugal pumps must be construed that the applicant has admitted use of the impugned registered trade mark by the 1st respondent. The learned counsel for the first respondent also relied upon a legal notice dated 22.6.82 issued by the applicant for the use of the impugned trade mark. In the notice the applicant has called upon the first respondent to stop the use of the infringed trade mark \\'FIELD MARSHAL\\'. Hence, the request of the applicant to stop the use of trade mark makes clear about the use of the trade mark \\'FIELD MARSHAL\\' by the first respondent.\\n14. So far as the use of the trade mark \\'FIELD MARSHAL\\' by the first respondent is concerned, there is slight intrinsic difference which has to be clearly made out, as the first respondent was using the trade mark \\'FIELD MARSHALL\\' in respect of their goods as infringe which in quite different from the use of the registered mark \\'FIELD MARSHALL\\' in No. 228867 as assigned proprietor. Both are distinct and cannot he clubbed together. The registered Trade Mark \\'FIELD MARSHAL\\' in No. 228867 is totally a different one from the unregistered Trade Mark \\'FIELD MARSHAL\\' used by the first respondent by way of infringing the applicant\\'s registered Trade Mark.\\n15. There is no doubt that the first respondent had been using the trade mark \\'FIELD MARSHAL\\' by infringing the registered trade mark of the applicant. It is an admitted fact that the first respondent filed applicant No. 363764 for registration of the same trade mark in their name and ultimately the said application was withdrawn on 20.3.87. In the meanwhile on 30.5.86 the first respondent got the assignment of the impugned registered Trade Mark No. 228867 \\'FIELD MARSHAL\\' from M/s Jain Industries. M/s Jain Industries were registered proprietor of the said trade mark and they were using the trade mark for flour mills. The case of the applicant is that M/s Jain Industries got the registration of the impugned trade mark in respect of centrifugal pumps, and they never used the same till they assigned it in favour of the first respondent. C.O. No. 9/86 was filed by the applicant for rectification of the Registered Mark No. 228867 only on that ground. Since during the pendency of the said rectification petition the assignment was made in favour of the first respondent, the said rectification petition was withdrawn and the present petition was filed against the respondent. Here again the averment is to the effect that M/s Jain Industries never used the said impugned registered trade mark in respect of centrifugal pumps till they assigned the same in favour of the 1st respondent and the respondents also never used the impugned registered mark in respect of centrifugal pumps after assignment.\\n16. Sub-clause (b) of Sub-section (i) of Section 46 prescribes a period of five years and one month or longer for the non-use of a trade mark in relation to those goods by any proprietor thereof for the time being, for the removal of the said trade mark. To be precise, in terms of the provisions it runs as follows:-\\n \"That upto a date one month before the date of application, a continuous period of five years or longer had elapsed during which the trade mark was registered and during which there was no bona fide use thereof in relation to those goods by any proprietor thereof for the time being.\"\\nThe object underlined in Section 46 is to prevent trafficking in trade marks. This is, in fact, the object underlying in all trade mark laws. A trade mark is meant to distinguish the goods of one person from those made by another. A trade mark, therefore, cannot exist in vacuum. It can only exist in connection with the goods in relation to which it is used or intended to be used. Its object is to indicate the connection in the course of trade between the goods and some person having right to use the mark either with or without any indication of the identity of that person. When a person gets his trade mark registered, he acquires valuable right by reason of such registration. The registration of his trade mark gives him exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in connection with the goods in respect of which it is registered and if there is any invasion of this right by another person using the mark which is the same or deceptively similar to his mark, he can protect his trade mark by an action for infringement in which he can obtain by way of damages or account of profits. So Sub-clause (b) contemplates bona fide non-use of the trade mark for the stipulated period in relation to those goods by any proprietor thereof for the time being. The phrase \"any proprietor thereof for the lime being\" has a relevance with the non-user.\\n17. The term \"for the time being\" means that the moment or existing position as explained by the Supreme Court in the case of Jivendranath Kaul v. Collector/District Magistrate, (1992) 3 SCC 576. In yet another case H.S. Maharajadhiraja Madhava Rao Jivaji Rao Scindia Bahadur and Ors. v. Union of India, AIR 1971 SC 530 at page 568 para 110 familiarly known as the Privy Purses case the Supreme Court had an occasion to consider the term \"for the time being\" in Clause 22 of Article 322 of the Constitution of India. The Supreme Court had interpreted the term as one at a given time. Hence, the phrase \"for the time being\" refer only to the proprietor of the trade mark at the time of filing the rectification petition. If we take the relevant dates in this case, the first respondent got the assignment of the disputed trade mark on 30.5.86. They also filed TM-24 to get themselves registered as subsequent proprietors on 17.6.86 and the first respondent was registered as the subsequent proprietor. When the Act prescribes a stipulated period of five years and one month to establish the fact that there was no bona fide use by the proprietor of the trade mark sought to be removed, it would naturally refer to the non-use of the impugned trade mark by the first respondent for the stipulated period.\\n18. The petition has been filed for rectification by the applicant on 19.1.87, that is, hardly within 7 1/2 months from the date of assignment of the trade mark in favour of the first respondent. The first respondent having become the proprietor of the disputed trade mark on 30.5.86, the disputed mark cannot be removed from the Register on the ground that there is no bona fide use of the same by the first respondent for a period of five years and one month prior to 19.1.87, that is, the date on which the present application was filed.\\n19. The contention of the learned counsel for the applicant is that the applicant filed C.O. 9/86 for rectification of the disputed trade mark against Jain Industries, the then proprietors of the disputed trade mark on the same ground of non-user for five years and one month. During the pendency of the said C.O. 9/86, the first respondent got the assignment of the said trade mark and consequently the applicant withdrew C.O. 9/86 with liberty to file a fresh petition for rectification on the same cause of action. In view of the permission granted by the Court, the present proceedings must be taken as continuation of the earlier proceedings C.O 9/86 and as such the stipulated period of five years and one month is satisfied. We are unable to agree with the said contention of the learned counsel for the applicant for the simple reason that the cause of action in respect of C.O. 9/86 is non-user by the then proprietor of the trade mark Jain Industries. Unless the cause of action and the relief claimed in this application are  the same as in C.O. 9/86, it cannot be said that the subject matter of this application is the same as in the first. The cause of action in C.O. 9/86 is non-use of the impugned mark by Jain Industries who were parties therein. In the present application the cause of action is non-use of the impugned mark by the first respondent. When the parties are different and the cause of action is also different, the present application cannot be considered to be a one in continuation of the earlier C.O. 9/86 on the same cause of action. Because of the phrase \"any proprietor thereof for the time being\" occurring in Sub-clause (b) of Section 46(1) of the Act, the cause of action totally differs. There cannot be any continuation of the cause of action especially when the proprietors have changed in respect of the said trade mark. In the absence of any provision in the Act to tag on the period of non-use by the previous proprietor with that of the period of non-use by the present proprietor of the trade mark, the tagging cannot be done. The stipulated period would refer to each proprietor and consequently we have to hold that the applicant has not established the fact that the first respondent has not used the disputed trade mark for a period of five years and one month especially when they are the proprietors for hardly 7 months on the date of filing of the application.\\n20. In para 10 of the petition the applicant has stated that the registration of the impugned mark under No. 228867 was made without sufficient cause and it is wrongly remaining on the Register of Trade Marks. In the grounds of petition in ground (f) the applicant has stated that Jain Industries neither manufactured nor supplied the pumps under the impugned trade mark \"FIELD MARSHAL\\'. As already stated once the assignment has been made and the first respondent having become to subsequent proprietor, the non-use of the impugned mark for the prescribed period must be against the first respondent. With regard to assignment also the petitioner has not challenged the same except vaguely stating that the assignment is a fraudulent one, illegal and contrary to the provisions of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. No details were furnished in respect of the above allegations and hence we have to hold that these allegations have not been established.\\n21. Consequently the petition fails and it is dismissed. However, there will be no order as to costs.\\n'}},\n",

Learned senior counsel for the plaintiff pointed out that as and when\\nthe plaintiff made changes to its PARACHUTE label, the defendants made\\nthe same changes immediately. He stated that the defendants had copied\\nthe earlier PARACHUTE label as well.\\n27.    Mr. Lall contended that in addition to the PARACHUTE label, the\\ndefendants had also infringed the label of the plaintiff\\'s PARACHUTE\\nADVANSED JASMINE Coconut oil.                 He showed the following\\nphotographs of the plaintiff‟s and the defendants‟ product:-\\n ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANTS\\n\\n28.    Per contra, Mr. Rajat Aneja learned counsel for the defendants\\nsubmitted that this Court did not possess the territorial jurisdiction to try\\nand entertain the present suit inasmuch as both the plaintiff and the\\ndefendants had their offices in Telangana and hence were admittedly\\ncarrying on business in Telangana. He pointed out that the defendants did\\nnot have any office in Delhi and were not carrying on business in Delhi\\nand no product of the defendants had ever been sold in Delhi. Therefore,\\naccording to him, no part of cause of action had arisen in Delhi as per\\nSection 20(c) of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.\\n29.    Learned counsel for the defendants stated the plaintiff had invoked\\njurisdiction of this Court on the basis of para 51 of the plaint wherein it\\nhad been averred that the defendants were selling their products through\\ndepartmental store BIG BIZAAR- stores which were operating in Delhi.\\nHe contended that this was clever drafting by the plaintiff in order to\\ninvoke jurisdiction of this Court inasmuch as the said fact was not\\nsupported by any document.\\n 30.    Learned counsel for the defendants contended that the website\\nwww.indiamart.com/kedia-industries/ did not belong to the defendants and\\nthe defendants had neither posted any information on the said website nor\\nhad www.indiamart.com taken any authorization or permission from them\\nbefore posting such information. He contended that from the information\\navailable on the said third party website, it could not be assumed that the\\ndefendants were carrying on business in Delhi or that any part of cause of\\naction had arisen in Delhi.\\n31.    Learned counsel for the defendants stated that the plaintiffs cannot\\nrely upon the defendants‟ affidavit filed in 2008, before the Trademarks\\nRegistry stating that defendants‟ products were being sold throughout the\\nlength and breadth of the country. He pointed out that the plaintiff in para\\n39 of the plaint had in fact admitted that as of 2013, sales of the impugned\\nproduct were restricted to the State of Andhra Pradesh/Telangana and\\nnearby markets, from which it was clear that no part of cause of action had\\narisen in Delhi.\\n32.    Mr. Rajat Aneja further submitted that the present suit was barred\\nby delay, laches and acquiescence. He stated that the plaintiff had been\\naware of the defendants‟ use of the mark/label SHRI LAXMI BRAND\\nsince 2001, which included all the features such as dark blue and green\\ncolour combination; SHRI LAXMI BRAND written in white font within a\\nflag with green border, picture of coconut tree etc. He emphasised that the\\ndefendants had been using various elements of SHRI LAXMI BRAND\\nlabel/packaging/trade dress continuously and uninterruptedly since 1999,\\nas shown below:-\\n 33.    Mr. Aneja pointed out that in response to the plaintiff‟s cease and\\ndesist notice dated 21st January, 2002, alleging copyright infringement and\\npassing off, the defendants had sent a reply on 05th February, 2002 and\\nhad also filed a suit against the plaintiff before the Court of PRL, Junior\\nCivil Judge, Hyderabad being Suit No.221 of 2002. He stated that no\\naction was taken by the plaintiff and the defendants continued to use all\\nthe elements of SHRI LAXMI BRAND trademark/label uninterruptedly.\\nHe stated that subsequently, the defendants adopted the EVEREST\\ntrademark/label in 2006 and had spent a huge amount of money in its\\nmarketing and promotion.\\n34.    He pointed that in 2013, the plaintiff again initiated a criminal\\nproceeding against the defendants on account of use of the EVEREST\\nLABEL; however, the same was unsuccessful as it was found that the\\ndefendants had a copyright registration in the said label.\\n35.    Consequently, according to him, the plaintiff had waited for\\nfourteen years to file the present suit against the defendants after being\\nfully aware about the aforesaid mark/label of the defendants. He\\ncontended that the plaintiff had knowingly allowed the defendants to\\nproceed and to expend money on their mark/label which was inconsistent\\nwith the plaintiff‟s claim of exclusivity and as such, the plaintiff had\\n\\nCS (COMM) 1569/2016                                          Page 17 of 38\\n acquiesced to the defendants‟ use of the aforesaid marks/labels including\\nits various elements.\\n36.    Mr. Rajat Aneja also stated that the defendants were honest and\\nconcurrent users inasmuch as the defendants had been using SHRI\\nLAXMI BRAND label with its various elements i.e. blue colour bottles,\\ndark blue colour inside the green border window, with the green coconut\\ntree and white alphabets for its trademark since 1999. He stated that the\\ndefendants had also applied for trademark registration of the said label,\\nvide Application No.1018670 dated 20th June, 2001, claiming user since\\n01st January, 1999.\\n37.    He stated that though the plaintiff claimed to have filed applications\\nfor trademark registrations in the year 1997, yet its earliest applications\\nbeing Application Nos. 737894 and 737893 for PARACHUTE label had\\nbeen filed on \"proposed to be used\" basis. He pointed out that the\\nplaintiff had not filed any documents on record to show that they had been\\nusing the mark/label PARACHUTE in the course of trade since the year\\n1997. He stated that the invoices filed by the plaintiff were from 2001\\nonwards and they also did not show that the plaintiff was using the\\nPARACHUTE label, which was the subject matter of the present suit. The\\nadvertisement material filed by the plaintiff did not relate to the\\nPARACHUTE label. He contended the plaintiff‟s claim of use or having\\nacquired distinctiveness for its trademark/label or any element thereof\\nfrom the year 1997 was doubtful. He submitted that the plaintiff was\\nrequired to establish its case first, by supporting documents.\\n 38.    Mr. Rajat Aneja submitted that there was no monopoly over single\\ncolour trademarks. He pointed out that Section 2(1)(m) of the Trade Marks\\nAct, 1999 defines a „mark‟ as including a device, brand, heading, label,\\nticket, name, signature, word, letter, numeral, shape of goods, packaging\\nor „combination of colours‟ or any combination thereof. He stated that\\nSection 2(1)(zb) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 defines a trademark as \"a\\nmark capable of being represented graphically and which is capable of\\ndistinguishing the goods or services of one person from those of others\\nand may include shape of goods, their packaging and combination of\\ncolours...\" Therefore according to him under the Trade Marks Act, 1999,\\na single colour trademark had not been recognized as a source identifier.\\nHe pointed out that the Bombay High Court, in the plaintiff\\'s case itself\\nbeing Marico Industries Ltd. & Anr. Vs. Sarfraj Trading Co. & Ors.,\\n2002 (25) PTC 348, had held, \"... in so far as colour of the bottle, coconut\\ntree, there can be no monopoly and have been dealt with in earlier\\nproceedings filed by the Plaintiff against some others.\"\\n39.    He submitted that the plaintiff cannot claim exclusivity over a\\ncolour combination unless it prima facie established that the said colour\\ncombination had become distinctive of the plaintiff‟s product. In support\\nof his submission, he relied upon a judgment of the Division Bench of this\\nCourt in Britannia Industries Ltd. Vs. ITC Limited, 240(2017) DLT 156.\\n40.    Mr. Aneja, pointed out that blue colour was common to the trade\\nand coconut oil was being sold by a number of suppliers in similar blue\\ncolour bottles. He emphasised that no legal action had been initiated by\\nthe plaintiff against such third party manufacturer/suppliers.\\n 41.    Learned counsel for defendants submitted that in view of Section 17\\nof the Trade Marks Act, 1999, the plaintiff being the registered owner of\\nthe whole of its PARACHUTE label, could not file a suit for infringement\\nof trade mark against the defendants for using a part of the plaintiff\\'s\\nregistered label. In support of his submission, he relied upon the judgment\\nof this Court in Godfrey Phillips India Limited v. P.T.I Private Limited &\\nOrs., 2018 SCCOnLine Del 8278.\\n42.    Mr. Rajat Aneja, lastly stated that during the course of several\\nhearings in the present matter, the defendants had given various proposals\\nto the plaintiff in order to amicably settle the dispute between the parties.\\nHe stated that the defendants were still willing to carry out some minor\\nmodifications.\\n                         COURT\\'S REASONING\\n\\nELEMENTS OF PASSING OFF ACTION ARE PRIMA FACIE\\nESTABLISHED IN THE PRESENT CASE. THIS COURT IS FURTHER\\nOF THE PRIMA FACIE VIEW THAT THE ADOPTION BY THE\\nDEFENDANTS WAS IN BAD FAITH. ACCORDINGLY, THE\\nCONTENTION OF THE DEFENDANTS THAT THEY WERE HONEST\\nCONCURRENT USERS IS CONTRARY TO FACTS.\\n43.    This Court is of the view that it is first essential to compare the\\nproducts of the plaintiff and the defendants. A comparative photograph of\\nboth the plaintiff and the defendants‟ product is reproduced hereinbelow:-\\n 44.    Upon comparison of the aforesaid two bottles, it is evident that the\\nbackground colour (same shade of blue Pantone 285C), bottle size, cap\\nshape, nozzle, flag device, coconut tree, broken coconut device,\\nindentation, print as well as description in white font, are very similar if\\nnot identical. This Court is of the prima facie opinion that if the two\\nproducts are placed next to each other, it would be apparent that each and\\nevery important feature of the plaintiff‟s PARACHUTE Coconut Oil\\nproduct had been copied by the defendants for their EVEREST Coconut\\nOil product. In the present case, the resemblance in get up and trade dress\\nbetween the two products is so close that it can hardly occur except by\\ndeliberate imitation. In fact, this Court is of the prima facie view that if\\nthe two rival products were kept on a display shelf, it may be well-nigh\\nimpossible for a reasonable consumer to tell which product belongs to\\nwhom. Consequently, this Court is of the prima facie opinion that the\\ndefendants have copied the most relevant, material and essential features\\n\\nCS (COMM) 1569/2016                                       Page 21 of 38\\n of the plaintiff‟s product in an attempt to pass off its products as that of the\\nplaintiff\\'s.\\n45.       Moreover, as and when the plaintiff made changes in its trade dress,\\nthe defendants followed suit. The same is apparent from the following\\ntable:-\\n 46.    The plaintiff has also placed on record relevant print outs of its\\nannual reports for PARACHUTE Coconut oil, flag device and broken\\ncoconut device.       The said reports indicate the market share of the\\nplaintiff‟s product on the date it carried out the changes in its trade dress.\\nThe relevant portion of the said reports are reproduced hereunder:-\\n47.    In fact, in the 1997-98 annual report, the plaintiff had not only\\nmentioned its total revenue, post tax profit, but also the special features of\\n\\n\\nCS (COMM) 1569/2016                                         Page 23 of 38\\n its new logo and the name of its designer. In the said annual report, it was\\nspecifically stated that the \"consumers had responded to the new look with\\nenthusiasm, assured of the eternal goodness of the product.\"\\n48.    Keeping in view the aforesaid contemporaneous documents, this\\nCourt is prima facie of the opinion that on the dates the defendants carried\\nout changes in their trade dress and label, the plaintiff was the market\\nleader in the category of edible oil and the plaintiff\\'s mark and trade dress\\nhad become distinctive of its goods. Consequently, it made sense for\\ncompetitors such as the defendants to copy the plaintiff.\\n49.    In fact, this Court is of the prima facie view that not only are the\\nthree elements of a passing off action namely, the reputation of goods,\\npossibility of deception and likelihood of damages established in the\\npresent case, but that the adoption by the defendants of the said trade mark\\nand trade dress was in bad faith. Accordingly, the contention of the\\ndefendants that they were honest concurrent users is contrary to facts.\\nA PRIMA FACIE CASE OF INFRINGEMENT IS MADE OUT\\nINASMUCH AS THE DEFENDANTS HAVE COPIED THE PLAINTIFF‟S\\nREGISTRATIONS. IN FACT, NOT ONLY HAS THE BOTTLE SHAPE,\\nCOLOUR AND LABELING BEEN COPIED BY THE DEFENDANTS,\\nBUT ALSO THE INDIVIDUAL ELEMENTS WHICH ARE SUBJECT\\nMATTER OF INDEPENDENT REGISTRATION. SECTION 17 OF THE\\nTRADE MARKS ACT, 1999, APPLIES TO THE PRESENT CASE AND\\nGODFREY PHILLIPS INDIA LIMITED (SUPRA) JUDGMENT, IS\\nINAPPLICABLE TO THE FACTS OF THE PRESENT CASE.\\n50.    This Court is of the view that a prima facie case of infringement is\\nmade out inasmuch as the defendants have copied the plaintiff‟s\\nregistrations. In fact, not only has the bottle shape, colour and labeling\\n\\n\\nCS (COMM) 1569/2016                                         Page 24 of 38\\n been copied by the defendants, but also the individual elements which are\\nsubject matter of independent registrations.   The said fact would be\\napparent from the following chart:-\\n51.    Consequently, Section 17 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, is satisfied\\nin the present case and Godfrey Phillips India Limited (supra) judgment,\\nis inapplicable.\\nTHE PLAINTIFF IS NOT CLAIMING EXCLUSIVITY IN BLUE COLOUR\\nAS A STAND ALONE FACTOR, BUT IN A COMBINATION OF PARTS,\\nWHICH INCLUDES THE BLUE COLOUR. IN ANY EVENT, THE BLUE\\nCOLOUR HAS BEEN HELD TO BE A SOURCE IDENTIFIER IN\\nANNAMALAYAR AGENCIES VS. VVS & SONS PVT. LTD. & ORS., 2008\\n(38) PTC 37 (MAD.)\\n\\n52.    With regard to the issue of infringement and passing off in colour\\ncombination, this Court is of the view that the plaintiff is not claiming\\nmonopoly over a single colour inasmuch as the plaintiff‟s bottle is not\\nonly blue in colour but it also contains amongst others a coconut tree, a\\nbroken coconut device, a flag which has a dark blue background and\\ncertain descriptions written in white font. Consequently, the plaintiff is\\nnot claiming exclusivity in blue colour as a stand alone factor, but in a\\ncombination of factors, which includes the blue colour.\\n53.    In the present case, the get-up is not only novel, but distinctive and\\nacts as a source identifier, even though it consists of a combination of\\ncommonly used parts. From the huge turnover certified by the Chartered\\nAccountant in Annual Accounts as well as due to continuous use over a\\n\\nCS (COMM) 1569/2016                                        Page 27 of 38\\n long period of time, it seems prima facie that plaintiff‟s packaging is\\nexclusively associated with the plaintiff and the products bearing the\\nplaintiff‟s trade dress are recognized by the public as being sourced from\\nthe plaintiff and from no one else.\\n54.    As far as the defendants‟ argument that the colour blue is common\\nto the trade and/or the plaintiff has not taken legal action against such\\nsimilar infringers, this Court is of the view that the defendants have not\\nbeen able to prima facie prove that the said „infringers‟ had significant\\nbusiness turnover or they posed a threat to plaintiff‟s distinctiveness. No\\nsale figures of third parties using the blue colour bottles have been placed\\non record by the defendant. Consequently, this Court at this stage cannot\\npresume extensive use of the blue colour by third parties.\\n55.    This Court is of the view that the plaintiff is not expected to sue all\\nsmall type infringers who may not be affecting the plaintiff‟s business.\\nThe Supreme Court in National Bell Vs. Metal Goods reported in AIR\\n1971 SC 898 has held that a proprietor of a trademark need not take action\\nagainst an infringer who does not cause prejudice to its distinctiveness. In\\nExpress Bottlers Services Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Pepsi Inc. & Others reported in\\n1989 (7) PTC 14 it has been held as under:-\\n56.    In Dr. Reddy Laboratories Vs. Reddy Pharmaceuticals reported in\\n2004 (29) PTC 435 a coordinate Bench of this Court has held as under :-\\n57.    In any event, in Colgate Palmolive Company and Anr. Vs. Anchor\\nHealth and Beauty Care Pvt. Ltd., 2003 SCC OnLine Del 1005 another\\nCoordinate Bench of this Court has held that colour in a trade dress can be\\nso significant that in some cases even single colour can be taken to be a\\ntrademark to be protected in passing off action. The relevant portion of\\nthe said judgment reads as under:-\\n58.    In fact, the blue bottle has been held to be a source identifier of\\nplaintiff‟s product in Annamalayar Agencies Vs. VVS & Sons Pvt. Ltd. &\\nOrs., 2008 (38) PTC 37 (Mad.). In the said case, it was held that the\\nshowing of the blue coloured bottle in an advertisement disparaged the\\nplaintiff‟s product PARACHUTE coconut oil. The relevant portion of the\\nsaid judgment is reproduced hereinbelow:-\\n59.    Consequently, the judgment of the Bombay High Court in Marico\\nIndustries Ltd. & Anr. (Supra) offers no assistance to the defendants.\\nFOR ACQUIESCENCE, THERE SHOULD NOT ONLY BE A TACIT OR\\nAN EXPRESS ASSENT BY THE PLAINTIFF TO THE DEFENDANT‟S\\nUSE OF THE MARK, BUT ALSO ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE\\nDEFENDANT    TO    CONTINUE    WITH    THE   BUSINESS.\\nACQUIESCENCE CANNOT BE INFERRED MERELY ON ACCOUNT\\n\\nCS (COMM) 1569/2016                                           Page 31 of 38\\n OF THE FACT THAT THE PLAINTIFF HAD NOT TAKEN ANY ACTION\\nFOR INFRINGEMENT OF ITS RIGHTS.\\n60.     Acquiescence means an encouragement by the plaintiff to the\\ndefendant to use the infringing mark. It implies positive acts; not merely\\nsilence or inaction. For acquiescence, there should not only be a tacit or an\\nexpress assent by the plaintiff to the defendant‟s use of the mark, but also\\nencouragement of the defendant to continue with the business.\\nAcquiescence may be a good defence even to the grant of a permanent\\ninjunction because the defendant may legitimately contend that the\\nencouragement of the plaintiff to the defendant‟s use of the mark in effect\\namounted to the abandonment by the plaintiff of his right in favour of the\\ndefendant and, over a period of time, the general public had accepted the\\ngoods of the defendant. However, acquiescence cannot be inferred merely\\non account of the fact that the plaintiff had not taken any action for\\ninfringement of its rights. [See: Messrs Hindustan Pencils Pvt. Ltd. Vs.\\nMessrs India Stationery Product Co. & Anr., (1989 SCCOnLine Del\\n34)].\\n61.     In the present case, at no point of time did the plaintiff permit the\\ndefendant to use the impugned mark or trade dress and/or promote the\\ndefendants\\' mark or trade dress.\\n62.     In 2002, the plaintiff objected to the use of the earlier packaging of\\ndefendants under the brand SHRI LAXMI. Further, in 2013 plaintiff filed\\na criminal complaint against defendants for the use of the impugned trade\\ndress. In 2016, the plaintiff sent a cease and desist notice against the use\\nof the impugned trade dress and in November, 2016, the plaintiff initiated\\n\\n\\n\\nCS (COMM) 1569/2016                                         Page 32 of 38\\n the present proceedings against the defendants for use of the impugned\\ntrade dress.\\n63.    Consequently, in the present case, the defence of delay and\\nacquiescence is contrary to facts and untenable in law.\\nIN CASES OF INFRINGEMENT EITHER OF TRADE MARK OR OF\\nCOPYRIGHT NORMALLY AN INJUNCTION MUST FOLLOW. MERE\\nDELAY IN BRINGING ACTION IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO DEFEAT\\nGRANT OF INJUNCTION IN SUCH CASES.\\n64.    The defence of laches or inordinate delay is a defence in equity.\\nSuch a defence cannot be put up by a party who has acted unfairly and\\ndishonestly. Further, if the Court is of the view that prejudice is likely to\\nbe caused to the general public who may be misled into buying the goods\\nmanufactured by the defendants thinking them to be the goods of the\\nplaintiff, then an injunction must be issued.\\n65.    In any event, it is settled law that in cases of infringement either of\\nTrade Mark or of Copyright normally an injunction must follow. Mere\\ndelay in bringing action is not sufficient to defeat grant of injunction in\\nsuch cases. [See: Midas Hygiene Industries Pvt. Ltd Vs. Sudhir Bhatia,\\n2004 (28) PTC (121) SC].\\nPRIMA FACIE THIS COURT HAS THE TERRITORIAL JURISDICTION\\nTO ENTERTAIN AND DECIDE THE PRESENT SUIT.\\n66.    This Court finds that the plaintiff has positively asserted in its plaint\\nthat the defendants are selling their products within the jurisdiction of this\\nCourt through the departmental store „Big Bazar‟. The plaintiff has also\\nplaced on record a printout of the defendants‟ website, which specifically\\nstates that the defendants‟ products are available on various e-commerce\\n\\nCS (COMM) 1569/2016                                          Page 33 of 38\\n websites including „Big Bazar‟. It is an admitted position that „Big Bazar‟\\nhas outlets in Delhi. The Supreme Court in Saleem Bhai and Others Vs.\\nState of Maharashtra and Others, AIR 2003 SC 759 and Kamala and\\nOthers Vs. K.T. Eshwara SA and Others, (2008) 12 SCC 661 has held\\nthat averments in the plaint have to be believed at this stage.\\n67.    The plaintiff has further asserted in its plaint that the defendants are\\nindulging in online sale of the impugned product in Delhi through another\\nwebsite „Indiamart‟. Printouts of the „Indiamart‟ website showing the\\ndefendants products range have been filed. A perusal of the „Indiamart‟\\nwebsite prima facie shows that it is an interactive website inasmuch as it\\npermits the viewers to ask for price and specifically states \"before\\ndispatching the product, they are firmly tested and checked by the team of\\nquality controllers\". Accordingly, in the present case the \"purposeful\\navailment\" as well as \"sliding scale\" and \"effects\" tests as stipulated in\\nBanyan Tree Holding (P) Limited Vs. A. Murali Krishna Reddy and\\nAnr., 2010 (42) PTC 361 (Del) are satisfied.\\n68.    Even defendant no.2 in its own affidavit dated August, 2008 filed\\nbefore the Trademark Registry, has admitted that it is selling its goods\\n\"through the entire length and breadth of the country\".\\n69.    A perusal of the order sheets reveals that on 29 th November, 2016,\\nthe counsel for the defendants had even admitted before the learned\\npredecessor of this Court that they were previously selling their goods in\\nDelhi. Though subsequently on 08th December, 2016, the counsel for the\\ndefendants had tried to withdraw the said statement by stating that he had\\nnever told the Court on 29th November, 2016 that the defendants had ever\\nsold the impugned products in Delhi, yet the learned predecessor of this\\n\\n\\nCS (COMM) 1569/2016                                          Page 34 of 38\\n Court had reiterated that what was recorded in the order sheet on 29 th\\nNovember, 2016 was correct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that\\nthe superior Courts in India are the Courts of Record and what is recorded\\nin the Court‟s order is correct and cannot be contradicted by the counsel\\nfor the parties (See: State of Maharashtra Vs. Ramdas Shrinivas Nayak\\nand Another, (1982) 2 SCC463 and Apar (P) Ltd. and Another Vs.\\nUnion of India and Others, 1992 Suppl. (1) SCC 1). In view of the\\naforesaid, this Court is of the prima facie opinion that it has the territorial\\njurisdiction to entertain and decide the present suit.\\nDEFENDANTS\\' OFFER TO MAKE CHANGES WHILE RETAINING THE\\nKEY ELEMENTS OF THE TRADE DRESS IS NOTHING BUT \\'AN\\nATTEMPT TO SAIL NEAR THE WIND\\'.\\n70.    As far as the defendants\\' contention that it has made some changes\\nin its packaging/trade dress and is willing to modify its get up/trade dress,\\nthis Court is of the prima facie view that the defendants have time and\\nagain made minor changes in their packaging in an attempt to continue to\\nmislead the purchasers and make it more difficult for the plaintiff to\\nprotect its mark/trade dress. It is pertinent to mention that throughout\\nthese proceedings the defendants persisted in retaining the following\\nelements:-\\n       identical to the plaintiff‟s PARACHUTE. In most suggestions, the\\n       Flag Device has a green outline and a dark blue interior, though in\\n\\n\\n\\nCS (COMM) 1569/2016                                         Page 35 of 38\\n        two of the proposals the defendant did agree to change to the colour\\n       Orange/Red.\\nd)     Almost identical device of broken coconut with a splash of coconut\\n       water.\\n71.    In a similar situation, the Bombay High Court in R.R. Oomerbhoy\\nPrivate Limited Vs. Court Receiver, High Court, Bombay and Anr., 2003\\n(27) PTC 580 had aptly referred to the following observations of the\\nMaster of the Rolls, Lord Greene in Wright, Layman & Umney Ltd. Vs.\\nWright, 1949 (46) RPC 149:-\\nDEFENDANTS HAVE NOT EVEN DEFENDED THE USE OF\\nSIMILAR MARK FOR THEIR EVERSTAR JASMINE HAIR OIL\\n\\n72.    It is pertinent to mention that the defendants have not defended the\\nuse of similar mark for their EVERSTAR JASMINE Hair Oil. The said\\nact prima facie shows that the intent of the defendants has always been to\\ndeceive the public and to pass of its goods as that of the plaintiff. It has\\nbeen wisely said that „what is worth copying is worth protecting‟.\\n TRADING BY THE DEFENDANTS IN THE PRESENT CASE IS\\nNEITHER HONEST NOR FAIR.\\n73.    To conclude, this Court refers to the statement of law laid down by\\nthe Division Bench in B.K. Engineering Co. Vs. UBHI Enterprises\\n(Regd.) & Anr., AIR 1985 Delhi 210 that \"it is essential that trading must\\nnot only be honest but must not even unintentionally be unfair. If it is\\nshown that a product or a business of a trade has acquired a distinctive\\ncharacter the law will restrain a competitor from using that other\\'s name.\\nA line must be drawn somewhere between honest and dishonest trading,\\nbetween fair and unfair competition.\"\\n74.    In this case there can be no doubt that the defendants intend to trade\\nupon the plaintiff\\'s reputation as well as goodwill and wants to bring its\\nbottles, trade dress, label and shape as close to the plaintiff as possible.\\n                                   RELIEF\\n\\n75.    Consequently, the defendants, their partners, principals, directors,\\nofficers, employees, agents, distributors, suppliers, affiliates, subsidiaries,\\nfranchisees, licensees, representatives, group companies and assigns are\\nrestrained from manufacturing, distributing, exporting, selling, offering\\nfor sale, advertising, promoting, displaying and/or using, in any manner\\nwhatsoever, the impugned products namely EVEREST COCONUT OIL\\nand/or EVEREST JASMINE HAIR OIL and/or any other product bearing\\nany other label/trade dress/packaging/mark/bottle shapes/shape of jars\\ndeceptively    and/or   confusingly     similar   to   the   plaintiff‟s      trade\\nmarks/labels/packaging/bottle shapes for the PARACHUTE (labels),\\nFLAG DEVICE, BROKEN COCONUT DEVICE, PARACHUTE\\n\\nCS (COMM) 1569/2016                                           Page 37 of 38\\n BOTTLE, PARACHUTE JAR and/or PARACHUTE ADVANSED\\nJASMINE (labels) and/or variants and the unique/distinctive trade\\ndress/bottle shapes/shape of jars relating thereto as a trade mark/label or\\npart of a trade mark/label, trade name or a part of trade name, domain\\nname or a part of domain name or in any other manner whatsoever.\\n76.

It is also registered as a Copyright Society under Section 33 of the Copyright Act, 1957. On allegations that the defendants have committed flagrant violation of the rights of the plaintiff in the works assigned to him by numerous members, the plaintiff has sought the following relief in the present suit:\\na) An order for permanent injunction restraining the defendants, its agents, employees and all others acting on its behalf from playing of music by live or any other means, or by way of mechanical devices at the hotel operated by the Defendants and /or channeling musical and or literary works of the plaintiff or those of its sister copyright societies, by way of mechanical devices such as Radio, Cable TV and /or RA. systems within the Defendants\\' premises without obtaining a license from the plaintiff Society and without paying the requisite royalties, thereby amounting to infringement of the plaintiff Society\\'s performing Rights in the same.\\nb) An order for damages to the tune of Rs. 20,01,000/- and a decree for the same be passed in favor of the Plaintiff\\'s Society and against the defendant.\\nc) An order for costs of the proceedings.\\nPage 0679\\n \\n\\n2. The case set out in the plaint has been established in the affidavit by way of evidence in this behalf. It is stated that the plaintiff is a non-profit making body established on 23rd August, 1969 to monitor, protect and enforce the rights, interest and privileges of its members which consists of authors, composers and publishers of literary and musical works, as well as on behalf of members of other sister societies who are owners of copyright in their literary and musical works. The plaintiff has contended that it is, in fact, the sole representative body as also the sole national copyright society of authors, composers and publishers of literary and musical works. Its members consist not only of persons from this country but also other nationalities.\\n3. After the amendment of the Copyright Act in 1994, the plaintiff-society was re-registered as a copyright society under Section 33(3) of the amended Act. The plaintiff-society is thus a registered copyright society under Section 33(3) of the Copyright Act, 1957 and has received a certificate of registration from the Registrar of Copyrights, Government of India in Form No. IID dated 27th March, 1996 authorising it to carry on copyright business in literary and musical works and/or in any words or any action intended to be sung, spoken or performed with the music.\\n4. The primary task of the plaintiff society is to collect royalties from users of music and thereafter disburse the same to the owners of the copyright in the music who inter alia it represents. The rates of royalties are decided collectively by members of the plaintiff society.\\n5. The plaintiff has stated that it is affiliated to around 194 world societies which are included within the Federation known as CISAC, Paris (established under the aegis of UNESCO and the WIPO Charter). By virtue of the assignment deeds executed in its favor by its members, the plaintiff has exclusive ownership of the public performance rights in respect of the literary and musical work of its members which have been assigned to it. A list of 32 such assignment deeds have been proved before this Court as Exhibits P-4 to P-35. The plaintiff has fixed a tariff structure in respect of communication by third parties to the public of the literary and musical work of the members of the plaintiff-society in which copyright has been assigned to the plaintiff. Such tariff fixation is effected in the annual general meeting of the plaintiff-society, which is guided by the importance or the value addition of music to the user organizations.\\nThe plaintiff has proved before this Court the tariff card of The Indian Performing Right Society Ltd. as Exhibit P-36 wherein the rates at which license is given to different persons and authorities to perform or play music have been set out. It has been stated that invoices are raised by the plaintiff strictly in terms of the tariff which is applicable for the period for which invoice has been raised.\\n6. In the plaint, it has been pointed out that the defendant No. 1 Mr. Debashis Patnaik is the Director of a hotel, \\'The Crown\\' located at Bhubaneswar in the State of Orissa. The defendant No. 2 is the hotel in question which is a 57 room hotel and is stated to be a unit of defendant No. 3 namely Hotel Sukhamaya Pvt. Ltd. The plaintiff upon learning of the defendant\\'s communication to the public of literary and musical works without due Page 0680 authorizations addressed a reminder cum invoice dated 3rd January, 2003 to the defendant No. 2 calling upon the defendants to pay a sum of Rs. 22,886/- towards the license fee, for having communicated such work to the public for the period 1st December, 2002 to 30th November, 2003. This reminder cum invoice has been proved on record as Exhibit P-37. Instead of honouring the statutory rights of the plaintiff, the defendant No. 2 instituted a suit seeking a decree for declaration and permanent injunction against the plaintiff before the court of the District Judge at Khurda, Bhubaneswar in the State of Orissa seeking following prayer:\\n(i) An order declaring that the invoice issued by the Defendant(i.e, the plaintiff herein) is null and void;\\n(ii) A perpetual injunction restraining the Defendant)i.e the plaintiff herein) from claiming license fees;\\n7. A copy of the plaint has been placed before this Court and marked as Mark A. In this suit, Hotel The Crown as plaintiff had arrayed M/s Phonographic Performance Ltd. as defendant No. 1; The Indian Performing Right Society Ltd. as defendant No. 2; and the Registrar of Copyrights as the defendant No. 3. The defendant has admitted receipt of the afore-noticed invoice Exhibit P-37 from the plaintiff in its plaint and alleged that it was not aware as to whom the license fee is to be paid and hence the afore-noticed prayer.\\n8. The present plaintiff contested the interim injunction application filed by the defendant No. 2 in these proceedings which consequently came to be dismissed by a judgment of the District Judge dated 4th February, 2006. It was held by the court that the defendant herein has no prima facie case and balance of convenience was in favor of the present plaintiff. The court also held that if the plaintiff succeeded in the suit ultimately, he could claim refund of the amount, if paid by him towards the license fee. The court in its order had noticed that it was not the case of the plaintiff that he is not playing music by way of mechanical devices such as radio, cable T.V. etc. and that the defendant nos. 1 and 2 were authorized under the provisions of the Copyright Act, 1957 to collect the license fee.\\n9. The plaintiff has also proved before this Court a letter dated 15th December, 2003 received from the defendant herein whereby the defendant No. 2 requested the plaintiff to supply the copy of a license agreement to explore the possibility of an out of court settlement in C.S No. 14/2003 pending before the District Judge, Khurda, Bhubaneswar. As the defendants were not desisting from their illegal action, the plaintiff was constrained to file the present suit on or about the 19th August, 2005. The plaint was signed and verified by Mr. Hasan Kamal in his capacity as Chairman of the plaintiff. He has deposed an affidavit proving before this Court, the resolution dated 21st October, 2004 whereby he was authorized inter alia to sign and verify pleadings and to institute the legal proceedings. The resolution has been marked as Exhibit P-1.\\n10. Summons were issued by this Court to the defendants on 29th August, 2005. However, the defendants despite service by ordinary process as well as by registered post opted not to appear or contest the present case before Page 0681 this Court. In these circumstances, by an order passed on 23rd January, 2006 the defendants were directed to be proceeded against ex parte and the plaintiff was directed to lead ex parte evidence. Accordingly, the plaintiff has filed affidavits by way of evidence of its witnesses in support of the averments in the plaint.\\n11. When the suit was taken up on 29th August, 2005, the court had also granted an ad interim injunction in I.A. 6501/2005 which was in the following terms:\\n ...Accordingly, till the next date of hearing, the defendants, its agents, employees and all others acting on its behalf are restrained from playing of music by live of any other means, or by way of mechanical devices at the hotel operated by the defendants and/or channeling musical and or literary works of the plaintiff or those of its sister copyright societies, by way of mechanical devices such as Radio, Cable TV and / or P.A systems within the defendants\\' premises without paying a sum of Rs. 22,800/- and without obtaining a license from the plaintiff society and without paying the requisite royalties to the plaintiff in respect of the work.\\n12. Upon the failure of the defendants to appear and contest the application, the above injunction order was also confirmed by the court on the 23rd January, 2006.\\n13. The plaintiff has established that the defendant No. 2 continued with its illegal activities of playing music at its hotel premises in violation of the copyright possessed by the plaintiff therein without a license from the plaintiff and without making payment of the license fee. Consequently, the plaintiff raised a second invoice dated 17th of November, 2005 bearing invoice No. 2005-2006/3320 purporting to be on account of the license fee which would be due from the defendants for the period 1st of December, 2002 to 30th November, 2006. By this invoice, the plaintiff demanded a sum of Rs. 1,41,788.57/- from the defendant which demand has been exhibited as Exhibit P-40 before this Court. The plaintiff has contended that this amount is inclusive of the amount of Rs. 22,886/- demanded earlier by Exhibit P-37.\\n14. The further contention of the plaintiff is that the defendants have chosen to ignore the court process despite issuance of the injunction order and they continued to persist with their illegal activities. For this reason, the plaintiff is entitled to recover the amount of Rs. 1,41,788.57/- as actual compensatory damages from the defendants. On account of their continued illegal action, the plaintiff has claimed that it is further entitled to the sum of Rs. 18,58,211.42/- as punitive damages apart from the relief of permanent prohibitory injunction which has been noticed hereinabove. The statements made in the plaint and in the evidence on behalf of the plaintiff stand uncontroverter.\\n15. I find that there is no dispute to the averments in the plaint and the plaintiff has conclusively established its copyright in the musical and literary works which have been assigned in its favor by its members. Thus, it would appear that no person would have any right to undertake a public performance or communication to the public of such literary and musical work, exclusive rights in respect of which vest with the plaintiff as established from the assignment deeds proved as Exhibit P-4 to P-35 before this Court.\\nPage 0682\\n \\n\\n16. The defendant No. 2 had filed C.S No. 14/2003 in the court of the district Judge, Khurda at Bhubaneswar wherein he has admitted that such musical works are being played at the hotel and that it was unaware as to who was the real licensee to collect the fees under the statutory provisions. This fact was even noticed by the District Judge in the judgment dated 4th February, 2006 dismissing the injunction application filed by the defendant No. 2.\\n17. In the instant case, a further submission has been made that the defendants knowingly have opted not to appear before this Court. By this refusal, the defendants have adequately established their defiance and have refused to accede to the summons issued by the court. Placing reliance on the pronouncement of the Division Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court reported at  Bhagwandas Ramji Lal v. Watkins Mayer and Co., Jalandhar and Ors., it has been urged by Mr. Praveen Anand, learned Counsel for the plaintiff that such refusal amounts to a refusal to divulge details relating to the wrongful acts of the defendants before this Court and that in the face of such defiance and absence of details relating to the defendants\\' acts, this Court would be justified in raising all presumptions against the defendants.\\n18. Perusal of this judgment shows that it related to passing of an action wherein the court held that the plaintiffs were entitled to recoup the loss that they incurred as a direct and natural consequence of the defendants\\' wrongful action. In such a case, if the defendants refuse to produce their books of account showing the quantity of goods manufactured or sold by them during the period of infringement and profits earned thereon, the court would be justified in raising every presumption against them. It is their duty to produce their account books as the issue is within their special and exclusive knowledge.\\n19. The plaintiff has established before this Court that the defendants have knowledge of the illegality in their action. The plaintiff has also asserted that the defendants\\' illegal activities would have a cascading effect. The assignment of the copyright is effected in the favor of the plaintiff for the reason that the original owners of the copyrights who are lyricists, producers of music recording companies etc. are unable to enforce their rights or to effect recoveries. There can be no manner of doubt that the action of the defendants is blatant, deliberate and mala fide. Despite dismissal of the injunction application and the observations made by the District Judge, the defendants are persisting with their illegal action and have not made payment of the license fee demanded by the plaintiff. The plaintiff has consequently prayed for injunction and damages.\\n20. Apart from the factual matrix noticed above, I find that the plaintiff has laid a claim of compensatory and punitive damages. Several pronouncements have been cited at the Bar in support of the suit prayers. It therefore becomes necessary to examine the principles which govern award of such damages.\\n21. Damages have been traditionally defined as \\'pecuniary compensation, obtainable by success in an action, for a wrong which is either a tort or a Page 0683 breach of contract\\' (Re: Broome v. Cassel & Co. 1972 AC 1027). Thus the traditional concept of damages is to compensate a claimant for loss and damage and can also be referred to as compensatory damages which are awarded to compensate a plaintiff for damages which he has suffered or is expected to suffer and to replace something that the plaintiff has lost or is expected to lose because of the wrongful act of the defendant. The primary purpose of the damages is to restore those losses to the plaintiff. However as tort litigation has evolved, we find that the concept of damages is not limited to compensation for loss and damages alone. Three kinds of damages are being awarded by courts which include nominal damages, exemplary damages and compensatory damages.\\n22. Nominal damages are usually awarded where a legal right of the plaintiff is found to be infringed and there is, however, no proof of actual loss. There may be another situation where nominal damages may be awarded which is a case where loss is shown, but there is no evidence as to its exact quantum.\\nThe purpose of the award of nominal damages thus is vindicatory i.e. to mark the existence of the right in question as well as the fact of violation of such right of the plaintiff by the wrong doer who is the defendant.\\nThus a notional amount may be awarded as such damages so as to vindicate the stand of the plaintiff and the claim lodged by him.\\n23. The next kind of damages are in the nature of compensatory damages which are awarded to compensate a plaintiff for the loss suffered by him and to put him in the same position as if the tort has not been committed. Such a loss may be a pecuniary loss or an intangible loss which would be non-pecuniary. The intangible loss would include mental and emotional distress apart from other incidents where the award of damages is intended to compensate for such distress.\\n24. So far as damages due to infringement of trademark are concerned, the traditional English approach has been to assess the same according to the extent of the plaintiff\\'s or the claimant\\'s loss. The established rule was that in the event of no loss being shown or no evidence with regard to the damages being led, no damages could be awarded or recovered.\\n25. In the United States the approach has been to assess damages for trademark infringement according to the extent of the plaintiff\\'s loss and thereby, compensatory damages must be equal to the loss suffered by the individual victim. [Ref: Simon Greenleaf, A Treatise On The Law of Evidence see 253 at 242-43 (2d ed.1972)].\\n26. In India in a case reported at 481 IC 450 at p. 465 Lakpat Rai v. Sri Krishna Das, the Court held that where there is no evidence to calculate actual damages, it is not worthwhile to give damages other than nominal damages.\\nIn AIR 1932 Rangoon 56 entitled Sally Mahomed Sulaiman v. Neogi & Co., the Court has held that the best evidence of such loss and damage is the loss of trade that the plaintiff has suffered during the period in which the defendant is importing the offending goods.\\nPage 0684\\n \\n\\nThus so far as awarding compensatory damages is concerned, there has to be evidence of the plaintiff\\'s loss.\\nIt is also necessary to bear in mind that the basis of calculation of damages is entirely different from an account of profits of the defendant and the two remedies stand on the alternative footings.\\n27. The third kind of damages which are being considered more and more while considering cases of trademark infringement and passing of actions relates to award of exemplary damages, which are commonly known as punitive damages. Such damages can commonly be given in addition to compensatory damages. The expression \\'punitive\\' masks a variety of specific purposes that such damages are intended to actually serve apart from the punishing element and the deterrent cause of award of such damages. Such damages have various other useful purposes which include, inter alia, retribution, deterrence, compensation, education and law enforcement. Some authors have suggested that such damages have the effect of deterring not only the defendant from repeating the offence, but also deter others from committing the same; preserving peace; inducing private law enforcement; compensating victims for otherwise uncompensable loss and the payments of the plaintiff\\'s attorney\\'s fees.\\n28. It would be topical and instructive to examine the principles laid down by the Supreme Court of the United States of America in a decision rendered on May 20, 1996 in BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore reported in 517 US 559. In this case the following guide posts were given as to the method of calculation of punitive damages:\\n(i) Reprehensibility: The Supreme Court held that \\'perhaps the most important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitive damage award is a degree of reprehensibility of the defendant\\'s conduct.\\' In the case in hand, the Court noted that reprehensibility included economic torts which were present in the BMW case. It is also noted that conduct involving a substantial risk of bodily injury would be deemed more serious and more deserving of a sanction than pure economic torts.\\n(ii) Rationality in the award of damages: While emphasising that the primary goal in awarding punitive damages is to punish present conduct with the further objective of deterring future egregious conduct, the court, however, drew a note of caution emphasising that the punitive damages must rationally relate to the award of compensatory damages.\\n(iii) Imperative Criminal Penalty - the third guide post as indicated in the BMW case requires the Court to compare \\'the punitive damages award\\' and the civil or criminal penalties that could be imposed for comparable misconduct.\\n29. In a later case decided on 7th April, 2003 entitled State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Campbell Et. Al reported at 538 U.S. 408, 2003, the Supreme Court provided a further useful guideline while considering rationality of the punitive damages award, where it stated that single digit multipliers are more likely to comport with due process, while still achieving the state goals of deterrence and detribution, than awards in the range of 500:1 or in this case 145:1.\\nPage 0685\\n \\n\\nIn the State Farm case, the Supreme Court further emphasised that the application of punitive damages must be limited to harm related to the plaintiff.\\n30. In the United Kingdom, three common law categories have been identified where exemplary damages can be imposed.\\nOne of such categories is where the defendant\\'s conduct is calculated to make profits for himself which may exceed compensation payable to the plaintiff. Thus exemplary damages are imposed to prevent unjust enrichment (Reference - 1964 AC 1129 at 1226). The criterion which are utilised for calculation of punitive damages include conduct of the defendant, relevance of the compensation amount, relevance of criminal liability, means of the parties and moderation of the award. (Mc Gregor on Damages, 16th Edition at page nos. 461-470 ).\\n31. From the consideration of the foregoing, it would appear that law as applied and as has been evolved in the United States of America and United Kingdom, suggest that punitive damages would not be possible in isolation of compensatory damages. Where no compensatory damages are awarded, the implication would appear to be that the plaintiff has suffered no compensable injury. Receipt of exemplary damages, therefore, would be in the nature of a \\'windfall award\\', which is imposed to serve a public law function.\\n32. In Toler v. Cassinelli 129 W.Va 591 : 41 S.E. 2d 672 (1946), it was held that \\'finding of compensatory damages by a jury is an indispensable predicate to a finding of exemplary or punitive damages, and damages awarded by way of punishment must bear a reasonable proportion to compensatory damages so found.\\'\\n \\n\\n33. A case in which the question as to whether exemplary damages can be given without award of any compensatory damages, fell for consideration before the Supreme Court in  Common Cause v. UOI. Though the question was not directly answered, however, the Court held that in public law, it can be done. The Court also stated that in the case of punitive damages, it should be moderate and also keep in mind the means of the parties.\\n34. There have been several cases where the Court had awarded punitive damages in addition to compensatory damages. In this behalf, in 2005 (30) PTC 3 (Del), Time Incorporated v. Lokesh Srivastava and Anr., apart from compensatory damages of Rs. 5 lakhs, the Court also awarded punitive damages, emphasising that the award of compensatory damages to a plaintiff is aimed at compensating the plaintiff for the loss suffered by him, whereas the punitive damages are aimed at deterring a wrong doer and the like minded from indulging in such unlawful activities. Whenever an action has criminal propensity also, the punitive damages are clearly called for so that the tendency to violate the laws and infringe the rights of others with a view to make money is curbed. The punitive damages are founded on the philosophy of corrective justice and as such, in appropriate cases, these must be awarded to give a signal to the wrong doers that law does not take a breach merely as a matter between rival parties but feels concerned about those also who are not a party to the lis but suffered on account of the breach. The Court Page 0686 emphasised the distinction between compensatory damages and punitive damages which are noticed above and held thus:\\n7. ...Whenever an action has criminal propensity also the punitive damages are clearly called for so that the tendency to violate the laws and infringe the rights of others with a view to make money is curbed. The punitive damages are founded on the philosophy of corrective justice and, as such, in appropriate cases these must be awarded to give a signal to the wrong-doers that law does not take a breach merely as a matter between rival parties but feels concerned about those also who are not party to the lis but suffer on account of the breach. In the case in hand itself, it is not only the plaintiff, who has suffered on account of the infringement of its trademark and Magazine design but a large number of readers of the defendants\\' Magazine \\'TIME ASIA SANSKARAN\\' also have suffered by purchasing the defendants\\' Magazines under an impression that the same are from the reputed publishing house of the plaintiff company.\\n8. This Court has no hesitation in saying that the time has come when the Courts dealing actions for infringement of trademarks, copyrights, patents etc. should not only grant compensatory damages but award punitive damages also with a view to discourage and dishearten law breakers who indulge in violations with impunity out of lust for money so that they realize that in case they are caught, they would be liable not only to reimburse the aggrieved party but would be liable to pay punitive damages also, which may spell financial disaster for them. In Mathias v. Accor Economi Lodging, Inc. 347 F.3d 672 (7th Cir. 2003) the factors underlying the grant of punitive damages were discussed and it was observed that one function of punitive damages is to relieve the pressure on an overloaded system of criminal justice by providing a civil alternative to criminal prosecution of minor crimes. It was further observed that the award of punitive damages serves the additional purpose of limiting the defendant\\'s ability to profit from its fraud by escaping detection and prosecution. If a tortfeasor is caught only half the time he commits torts, then when he is caught he should be punished twice as heavily in order to make up for the reason that it is very difficult for a plaintiff to give proof of actual damages suffered by him as the defendants who indulge in such activities never maintain proper accounts of their transactions who they know that the same are objectionable and unlawful. In the present case, the claim of punitive damages is of Rs. 5 lacs only which can be safely awarded. Had it been higher even this Court would not have hesitated in awarding the same. The Court is of the view that the punitive damages should be really punitive and not flee bite and quantum thereof should depend upon the flagrancy of infringement.\\nIn this case, the Court thus emphasised the intent of exemplary damages to punish the wrong doer and also emphasised the deterrent effect of the damages.\\n35. Another aspect of damages in cases relating to infringement of trademark and passing off action arose for consideration before this Court in the judgment Page 0687 reported at  Hero Honda Motors Ltd. v. Shree Assuramjit Scooters, wherein Court noticed that the plaintiff had claimed token damages and compensation of Rs. 5 lacs as it was not possible to determine the exact nature of damages at the time of filing of the suit. The punitive damages were not specifically claimed. Defendant had further opted to not appear before the Court and had stayed away from the proceedings. Consequently, it was successfully able to prevent the Court from having before it any evidence which would have been available, had its accounts been produced before the Court. In this case, the Court held that the plaintiff could not be prejudiced by the act of the defendant in staying away from the court proceedings. In this background the Court held that such defendant must suffer the consequences of damages, which would be awarded as stated and set out by the plaintiff. However, the Court issued a note of caution that the plaintiff could not be granted any irrational figure which may be claimed but while making the award of damages, it would be necessary to keep in mind the nature of deception alleged by the plaintiff which not only causes direct loss to the plaintiff, but also effects the reputation of the plaintiff by selling sub-standard goods and services in the market where the public may be deceived in buying the goods thinking the same to be that of the plaintiff. There is a larger public interest and purpose involved to discourage such parties from indulging in such acts of infringement and deception and , thus, even if the same has a punitive element, it must be granted. Placing reliance on the principles laid down in the Time Incorporated case (supra), it was further stated that punitive damages should be really punitive and should not merely flee bite. The quantum thereof should depend upon the flagrancy of the infringement. The courts also recognize the effort which the plaintiff has to put in contesting the offending traders in the market who continue with their illegal conduct with impunity and without any remorse. Thereby the plaintiff is compelled to utilize energy, funds and resources for contesting such litigation which could have been otherwise utilized in business promotion and expansion activities.\\n36. In CS (OS) No. 1385/2005 entitled The Heels v. V.K. Abrol and Anr., the plaintiff had claimed damages for a sum of Rs. 21 lacs on grounds of infringement of trade mark by the defendant. The defendant opted to stay away from the proceedings. In these circumstances, the Court noticed thus:\\n11. This court has taken a view that where a defendant deliberately stays away from the proceedings with the result that an enquiry into the accounts of the defendant for determination of damages cannot take place, the plaintiff cannot be deprived of the claim for damages as that would amount to a premium on the conduct of such defendant. The result would be that parties who appear before the court and contest the matter would be liable to damages while the parties who choose to stay away from the court after having infringed the right of the plaintiff, would go scotfree. This position cannot be acceptable.\\n12. No doubt it is not possible to give an exact figure of damages on the basis of actual loss, but certain token amounts on the basis of the sales Page 0688 of the plaintiff can certainly be made. The plaintiff is unnecessarily dragged into litigation and the defendants must bear consequences thereof. In fact in such a case both compensatory and punitive damages ought to be granted apart from the costs incurred by the plaintiff on such litigation. In view of the given sales figure of the plaintiff, I consider it appropriate to grant a decree of damages in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants for a sum of Rs 3 lakh apart from costs of the suit.\\nThus the Court has awarded damages in favor of the plaintiff based on the sales of the plaintiff.\\n37. In a judgment of this Court dated 24th April, 2006, rendered in CS(OS) 1333/2005 entitled Intel Corporation v. Dina Karan Nayar, again the defendant had failed to appear. The Court decreed the suit for permanent injunction and delivery up of the offending material placing reliance on the pronouncements on the Hero Honda Case and Time Incorporated case (supra), the Court awarded damages of Rs. 3 lacs as opposed to the amount of Rs. 20 lacs which had been prayed for by the plaintiff. In this case, the Court had noticed yet another reason for awarding punitive damages in this behalf in the Time Incorporated case (supra) the Court held thus:\\n6. The plaintiff has claimed a decree of Rs. 12.5 lacs on account of damages suffered by the plaintiff or an order of rendition of accounts of the profits illegally earned by the defendants by use of the impugned trademark. In view of the fact that the defendants have not chosen to turn up and face these proceedings, this Court is of the considered view that an order of rendition of accounts is fully warranted and called for. Damages in the sum of Rs. 12.5 lacs as claimed cannot be awarded on account of the fact that the plaintiff has not succeeded in proving on record as to how and on what basis these damages have been calculated. Damages of Rs. 5 lacs are claimed on account of loss of reputation of the plaintiff. These can be awarded inasmuch as the readers who might have read the defendants\\' \\'TIME ASIA SANSKARAN\\' must have formed a very poor opinion about the plaintiff\\'s Magazine and, as such, the reputation and goodwill of the plaintiff has suffered.\\n7. Coming to the claim of Rs. 5 lakh as punitive and exemplary damages for the flagrant infringement of the plaintiff\\'s trademark, this Court is of the considered view that a distinction has to be drawn between compensatory damages and punitive damages. The award of compensatory damages to a plaintiff is aimed at compensating him for the loss suffered by him whereas punitive damages are aimed at deterring a wrong doer and the like minded from indulging in such unlawful activities. Whenever an action has criminal propensity also the punitive damages are clearly called for so that the tendency to violate the laws and infringe the rights of others with a view to make money is curbed. The punitive damages are founded on the philosophy of corrective justice and, as such, in appropriate cases these must be awarded to give a signal to the wrong-doers that law does not take a breach merely as a matter between rival parties but feels concerned about those also who are not party to the lis but suffer on account of the breach. In the case Page 0689 in hand itself, it is not only the plaintiff, who has suffered on account of the infringement of its trademark and Magazine design but a large number of readers of the defendants\\' Magazine \\'TIME ASIA SANSKARAN\\' also have suffered by purchasing the defendants\\' Magazines under an impression that the same are from the reputed publishing house of the plaintiff company.\\n8. This Court has no hesitation in saying that the time has come when the Courts dealing actions for infringement of trademarks, copyrights, patents etc. should not only grant compensatory damages but award punitive damages also with a view to discourage and dishearten law breakers who indulge in violations with impunity out of lust for money so that they realize that in case they are caught, they would be liable not only to reimburse the aggrieved party but would be liable to pay punitive damages also, which may spell financial disaster for them. In Mathias v. Accor Economi Lodging, Inc. 347 F.3d 672 (7th Cir. 2003) the factors underlying the grant of punitive damages were discussed and it was observed that one function of punitive damages is to relieve the pressure on an overloaded system of criminal justice by providing a civil alternative to criminal prosecution of minor crimes. It was further observed that the award of punitive damages serves the additional purpose of limiting the defendant\\'s ability to profit from its fraud by escaping detection and prosecution. If a tortfeasor is caught only half the time he commits torts, then when he is caught he should be punished twice as heavily in order to make up for the reason that it is very difficult for a plaintiff to give proof of actual damages suffered by him as the defendants who indulge in such activities never maintain proper accounts of their transactions who they know that the same are objectionable and unlawful. In the present case, the claim of punitive damages is of Rs. 5 lacs only which can be safely awarded. Had it been higher even this Court would not have hesitated in awarding the same. The Court is of the view that the punitive damages should be really punitive and not flee bite and quantum thereof should depend upon the flagrancy of infringement.\\n38. It would be also instructive to consider the principles on which damages was awarded in the judgment dated 8th May, 2006 rendered in CS(OS) 1528/2003 entitled Hindustan Pencils Ltd. v. Aparna Enamel Industries reported at 2006 (131) DLT 65. In this case, the plaintiff had filed a suit for permanent injunction as well as damages against the defendant on allegations of infringement of its trade mark and copyright as well as deceptive passing off by the defendant in respect of the plaintiff\\'s trademarks `Nataraj\\' and `Apsara\\'. Defendants were only seeking to make a difference by spelling `Nataraj\\' as spelt by the plaintiff, as `Natraj\\'. The Court on consideration of the matter passed a decree of permanent injunction offending the trademarks `Natraj\\' and `Apsara\\'.\\nSo far as damages are concerned, the defendant had stayed away from the judicial proceedings and consequently enquiry into the accounts of the Page 0690 defendant for determination of damages could not take place. The Court held that if this was to flow as a result of the defendants remaining ex-parte, it would amount to \"a premium on the conduct of such defendant\". The observation of the Court on the aspect of damages is pertinent and reads thus:\\n 11. The last aspect to be considered is the question of damages. This Court has already taken a view in Hero Honda Motors Ltd. v. Shree Assuramji Scooters, , that even if the defendant stays away from the judicial proceedings, the plaintiff cannot be deprived of the claim for damages. This is so since the result of the defendant staying away from the judicial proceedings is that any inquiry into the accounts of the defendant for determination of damages cannot take place and a view to the contrary would amount to a premium on the conduct of such defendant. The result would be that parties who appear before the Court and contest the matter would be liable to damages while parties who choose to stay away from the Court after having infringed the right of the plaintiff would go scot-free. This position cannot be acceptable. No doubt it is not possible to give an exact figure of damages on the basis of actual loss, but certain token amounts on the basis of sales of the plaintiff can certainly be assessed. The plaintiff has unnecessarily been dragged into litigation and the defendant must bear the consequences thereof. I am of the considered view that taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case, the plaintiff is also entitled for a decree of damages against the defendants for a sum of Rs. 1 lakh apart from the cots of the suit. Decree sheet be drawn up accordingly.\\nIn this case, the plaintiff had proved sales for the year 2000-01 as Rs. 95 crores and its expenses on advertisement to be in the range of Rs. 3 crores.\\nThe defendants had herein also failed to enter into appearance in this case.\\nThe Court granted a decree of permanent injunction and also awarded damages of Rs. 1 lakh. In this case also the Court had stated that it was not possible to give an exact figure of damages on the basis of actual loss but certain token amounts on the basis of sales of the plaintiff could be assessed.\\n39. Again in CS (OS) No. 2039/2003 entitled Mahendra & Mahendra Ltd. v. Ashwani Kumar, the plaintiff sought a permanent injunction restraining infringement of the plaintiff\\'s copyright and trademark \"Mahindra\" including Mahendra and Mahendra coloured Wheel logo. The plaintiff had indicated that it had suffered tremendous losses which were well over Rs. 20 lacs. However, no evidence had been led by the plaintiff to indicate the amount of the loss or the extent of actual damages resulting to it. The Court was of the view that it would be sufficient if damages to the extent of Rs. 1 lakh were awarded in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant.\\n40. From the above discussion, it is evident that undoubtedly, assessment of damages has to be based on cogent evidence which is placed on record. The burden of proving damages as well as the facts which caused the damages is upon the plaintiff who has to adduce the best evidence in support of his case. The onus on the plaintiff to prove damages is not rendered lighter because the defendant does not appear and is ex parte or does not contest Page 0691 the case. So far as facts which are relevant are concerned, Section 12 of the Indian Evidence Act set out that any fact which enables the court to determine the amount of damages which ought to be awarded is relevant.\\nThe most material evidence which would enable a court to arrive at a fair assessment of the gains which have accrued to a defendant by the acts complained of, would be a true and fair rendition of accounts by a defendant who is engaged in the acts of infringement. However, a defendant who is indulging in such illegal activity would obviously not maintain correct accounts and in any case would not place the material in respect thereof before the court. Therefore, it is left to the court to ascertain the probable level of sales of the defendant by other modes.\\n41. In an action for infringement of trademark, the profits made by the defendant also cannot always be the true criterion of the damages awardable to the plaintiff as the defendant\\'s gain may not always be proportionate to the plaintiff\\'s loss. However, it is trite that the plaintiff\\'s loss or the defendant\\'s gain will not be assumed in the absence of proof. The plaintiff is required to prove some distinct damage from the infringement of his trademark by defendant. The effect of the infringing acts of the defendant may be evidenced by the diminishing quantum of goods sold by the plaintiff for the reason that the defendant took away the plaintiff\\'s customers. The defendant may also impact the plaintiff\\'s customers. The defendant may also impact the plaintiff\\'s business by causing him to sell its products at a lower price. In either event, there would be a reduction in either the total volume of the plaintiff\\'s business or lowering in the percentage increase of business as compared to the previous years. Thus the measure of damage suffered by the plaintiff is to be found by an assessment of the profits the plaintiff would have made if the offending article had not been introduced by the defendant in the market or if the defendant had not undertaken the illegal activities complained of by the plaintiff. These facts have to be proved by the evidence on record either relating to the business of the defendants or which could be assessed from a decline in the business of the plaintiff on account of the activities of the defendant which could be gathered from the figures of sales over the period of time during which the defendant has continued with the activities complained of and an assertion of such loss by the plaintiff in its evidence.\\n42. Reference can usefully be made to the method for computation and award of damages in another pronouncement of this Court in  entitled Microsoft Corporation v. Yogesh Popat and Anr. In a suit by the plaintiff praying for a decree of prohibitory injunction, an order for delivery up to the plaintiff of the counterfeit/unlicensed copies of the plaintiff\\'s software and other infringing material and for an order for rendition of accounts of profits illegally earned by the defendant by reasons of infringement of plaintiff\\'s copyright including compensatory damages and a decree in the sum of the amount so ascertained, the Court has to consider the evidence led by the plaintiff. The defendant had opted to remain ex-parte and did not contest the suit. The Court noticed that the evidence on record established hard disc piracy by the defendants who were pirating software of the plaintiff and Page 0692 loading the same on the hard disc of computers sold by them without permission from the plaintiffs. Based on the popularity of the computer software of the plaintiff, the Court adopted an assumptive process whereby it based financial loss to the plaintiff on assumption of sale of 100 computers each year, which were loaded with pirated software. On such assumption, the Court arrived at a computation of loss of profits in the sum of Rs. 19.75 lacs. In this background, the Court decreed the suit in terms of the prayers in the plaint and awarded compensation/damages against the defendants in the sum of Rs. 19.75 lacs with interest @ 9% per annum from the date of decree till payment.\\n43. From the principles laid down in the afore-noticed judicial pronouncements, it is apparent that the punitive damages would necessarily follow an award of compensatory damages in favor of the plaintiff. The punitive damages also have to bear a fair ratio to the compensatory damages awarded to the plaintiff.\\n44. In the light of the foregoing discussion, I have no manner of doubt that the defendants have no right whatsoever of playing such music by any means within their premises, copyright whereof stands assigned to the plaintiff without obtaining the license from the plaintiff and without paying the requisite royalties thereby. The defendants have not been licensed by the plaintiff to do so.\\n45. The defendants have deliberately, knowingly and mala fide have admittedly played such music and thereby breached the copyrights of the plaintiff. They have persisted with their illegal actions despite objections of the plaintiff, and have effected public performances of the music which they could not do so without obtaining the license from the plaintiff and without paying the requisite royalties. The defendants deserve to be discouraged from their illegal actions by imposition of most stringent terms from playing music by any means at their premises in which the copyright vests with the plaintiff. Undoubtedly, the plaintiff is entitled to the amount of license fee for such action from the defendants.\\n46. The plaintiff has pointed out that the license fee due to it for the period from 1st December, 2002 to 30th November, 2006 is Rs. 1,41,788.57/-. There is no contest to the assertions of the plaintiff. The defendant has no right whatsoever for playing the music without obtaining the license from the plaintiff and without paying the royalties to the plaintiff.\\n47. The matter however does not rest here. As the defendants are persisting in their illegal and mala fide conduct and the plaintiff would be entitled to the injunction prayed for and the license fee for the period it continues to so act without license from the plaintiff and without payment of royalties. Apart from that, the defendant has with malafide intent caused the plaintiff to persist with the present suit.\\n48. The claim of the plaintiff that it is entitled to a sum of Rs. 18,58,211.42/- as punitive damages has gone unrebutted. However, in the light of the legal principles which guide award of punitive damages noticed above, award of the claimed amount would be grossly disproportionate to the claim of Page 0693 compensatory damages and highly excessive. An award of Rs. 3,00,000.00/- as punitive damages to the plaintiff would be fair and justified. The same is in the proximity of double the amount of compensatory damages and is being awarded having regard to the mandate in several judicial pronouncements that damages should not merely flee bite the defendant.\\nIn these circumstances, I have no hesitation in decreeing the claim of the plaintiff and hereby pass a decree in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants for the sum of Rs. 1,41,788.57/- towards the actual and compensatory damages suffered by the plaintiff and the sum of Rs. 3,00,000.00/- as punitive damages. The plaintiff shall be entitled to interest at the rate of 10% per annum on these amounts from the date of decree till payment.\\n49. I hereby also pass decree of permanent prohibitory injunction restraining the defendants, its agents, employees and all others acting on its behalf from playing of music by live or any other means, or by way of mechanical devices at the hotel operated by the Defendants and /or channeling musical and/or literary works of the plaintiff or those of its sister copyright societies, by way of mechanical devices such as Radio, Cable TV and /or RA. systems within the defendants\\' premises without obtaining a license from the plaintiff Society and without paying the requisite royalties, thereby amounting to infringement of the plaintiff society\\'s copyrights in the same.\\n50. The plaintiff would be entitled to cost of proceedings which are quantified at Rs. 50,000/-.\\n51. The suit is accordingly decreed in the above terms.\\n'}},\n",

       "     'content': 'JUDGMENT\\n \\n\\nJ.D. Kapoor, J.\\n1. Through this application under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC the plaintiff seeks ad interim injunction against the use of trade dress and colour combination of one third red and two third white, in that order, on the container of its product viz. Tooth Powder as by adopting the similar trade-dress particularly the colour combination of \"red and white\"the defendant has committed offence of \"passing off\" goods of plaintiff as its own. There is no dispute as to the trade names as these are distinct and have no kind of similarity whatsoever. Plaintiff\\'s trade name is \"Colgate\" and that of defendant is \"Anchor\". Relevant facts need to be capitulated in brief. \\n2. Plaintiff No. 1 is a company incorporated under the laws of United States of America having its principal office at Newyork. Plaintiff No. 2 is a public limited company having its registered office at Mumbai. Plaintiff No. 1 is the proprietor of the trademark \"Colgate\" whereas plaintiff No. 2 is the registered or licensed user and has been manufacturing and marketing dental products in India under the trademark \"Colgate\".\\n3. The defendant, Anchor Health, is a company incorporated under the Indian companies Act, 1956 and carries on the business as manufacturers and marketeers of dental products under the trademark \"Anchor\". The defendant is in the said business since 1996. The plaintiffs have been chasing the defendant since then as according to them the defendants have been trespassing the plaintiff\\'s intellectual property right and have filed as many as three suits against the defendants pertaining to different products. \\n4. The product which is subject matter of the instant proceedings is a \"Tooth Powder\" under the trademark \"Colgate\" sold in Cans bearing the distinctive get up and colour scheme or combination of colour comprising pre-dominantly of red and white background. They have been selling this product in India since 1951. Distinct feature of this combination is that around 1/3rd of the background of the upper part of the Can Along with cap is in red colour and 2/3rd is in white colour and in that order. The trademark \\'Colgate\\' appears in white against red. \\n5. Some time in August, 2002 the plaintiffs improved the get up by introducing swoir and a yellow representation in the red coloured portion of the Can. It is claimed that it is because of the distinctive shape of the container and the red and white colour scheme and the overall get up that has helped the plaintiffs in attaining immense reputation and goodwill verging on acquisition of a secondary significance as indicative of the trade of the plaintiff\\'s dental products. It is further claimed that it has become so familiar with the customers at large that they identify the article with the plaintiffs merely by the get up and the red and white colour scheme and for the purpose of the instant product i.e the \\'tooth powder\\' from the shape of the container also.\\n6. In order to demonstrate the dishonest intention of the defendants in appropriating or adopting prominently similar trade dress in terms of layout, get up and colour combination with obvious intention to encash upon the reputation and goodwill of the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs have referred to the past history of the defendants in keeping track of the plaintiffs products in the market by way of illustrative instances of comparative charts of various products having substantial reproduction of the colour combination of the colour red and white not only in respect of packaging but also otherwise. It all began some time in the year 1996 and the first action taken by the plaintiffs in this regard was in a suit filed in 1996 before the Bombay High Court. However the plaintiff did not succeed in getting ad interim injunction from adopting the same colour scheme and layout mainly for the reason that the trademarks used by the parties were not the same. This action arose from the cartons of dental cream. Though the Appeal against the said order of learned Single Judge of the Bombay High Court has been admitted and pending disposal but no interim relief has been granted. \\n7. The second suit was instituted against the defendants in Delhi High Court in relation to the copying of the line drawings, layout drawings and artistic work comprising the red and white colour scheme adopted by the defendants in relation to the plaintiffs tooth brush hanger display tray. The instant action is third in the row.\\n8. The plaintiffs seek ad interim protection to the limited extent of restraining the defendants from using the red and white colour scheme as well as the shape of the container of the tooth powder as according to the plaintiffs they have originated, developed, promoted, protected and also nurtured the distinctive red and white trade dress for all these products which has acquired the meaning as a trademark and, therefore, has earned exclusive ownership of the said trade dress because of its distinctiveness as well as use over a long period of time across wide geographical area. \\n9. The comparative charts of various products of the plaintiffs and that of the defendants as well as of few others in the trade like Pepsodent and Dabur have also been placed for the purpose of comparative study as none of the other rivals in the trade has adopted the same colour scheme, combination or get up and the shape of the container and, therefore, the act of the defendants is against the norms of fair and accepted trade practices which act will inevitably lead to dilution and erosion of the uniqueness and distinctiveness of the trade dress of the plaintiff\\'s goods. Statement has also been filed to show the rise in the sale of the products of the defendants after the colour combination, the trade dress as well as the shape of the container was copied by the defendants in selling the same goods. Thus according to the plaintiffs this amounts to infringement of trade mark and passing off its products. It is pertinent to mention here that the colour scheme red and white has been registered in respect of tooth paste.\\n10. The defendants have resisted the ad interim injunction mainly and briefly on the following premises:-\\n(i) That the shape of the container cannot be monopolized by the plaintiff unless and until it is registered under the Designs Act.\\n(ii) That the shape of packaging or any combination thereof do not fall within the ambit of mark or trademark as envisaged in the TMM Act, 1958.\\n(iii) That the use of red and white colour combination is neither distinctive nor capable of identifying the goods with the plaintiff nor business of the plaintiff nor capable of secondary significance.\\n(iv) That the plaintiffs have abandoned the colour combination of red and white and have used various other colour combinations in respect of different ranges of products and, therefore, the claim of the distinctiveness or uniqueness of the colour combination is unfounded.\\n(v) That the essential features of the label marks is the word mark and not the colour combination or overall get up and since the two trade marks are entirely different the plaintiffs cannot seek protection under the garb of colour combination of the label.\\n(vi) That the colour combination red and white in respect of dental care products is descriptive in nature and has a direct reference to the character or quality of the goods, gum and teeth. This combination is common to the trade and is being used by large number of manufactureRs. \\n(vii) That the plaintiff No. 2 is falsely claiming to be the registered user or a licensed user of the marks of plaintiff No. 1 in India and the plaintiff No. 2 has no right to use the said marks or to restrain otheRs. \\n(viii) That the use of trademark \"Colgate\" by plaintiff No. 2 in India is itself illegal and fraudulent and is in violation of bye-laws.\\n(ix) The claim of the plaintiff with regard to the colour combination and get up of the label being original artistic work or to the ownership thereof is absolutely false as the plaintiffs claim the ownership of the copyright on the basis of certain averments and in the present suit they have taken a different stand inasmuch as that they have not pleaded the basic requisites for the subsistence of the copy right or for acquiring ownership therein.\\n(x) That similar pleas were raised by the plaintiff in the earlier suits, one filed in Mumbai High Court and another in this court and claimed that colour combination of red and while is distinctive qua the plaintiff and the use of red and white colour combination by the defendant constitutes an act of passing off. The said plea of the plaintiff has been rejected by the Mumbai High Court as well as in Appeal by the Division Bench of Mumbai High Court and the court has specifically held that because of difference between the trademarks COLGAGE and ANCHOR of respective parties, there is no likelihood of confusion and deception.\\n(xi) The plaintiffs are not entitled to any order of interim injunction because of delay, laches and acquiescence inasmuch as notice was served upon the defendants in July, 1998 and the action was brought in 2003.\\n(xii) Plaintiffs have suppressed and concealed the material documents and facts from this court as have been detailed in para 9 of reply namely:-\\n(a) They are using various colour combinations in respect of their products and not Red and White alone;\\n(b) Plaintiff is the registered user which is a false claim.\\n(c.) Plaintiffs have falsely claimed colour combination of Red and White as an essential feature of their label mark. The essential feature is the word `COLGATE\\' which has been admitted in the rejoinder by the plaintiff.  \\n11. The main gravamen of contention of Mr. R.K.Anand, learned senior counsel for the defendant is that in order to avail protection by way of ad interim injunction the plaintiff has to prima facie establish the following ingredients:-\\n(a) That he has been in prior, long and continuous use of the mark.\\n(b) That the defendant has entered the market much later than him.\\n(c) That there has been no delay in filing of the suit for grant of the ex parte injunction.\\n(d) That the trademark of the plaintiff has become so distinctive and identical with the goods of the plaintiff that it has imprinted upon the minds of the public at large that the goods belong to the plaintiff.\\n(e) That there is an element of dishonesty on the part of the defendant to pass off his goods as that of the plaintiff on the premise of deceptive similarities. \\n12. In support of aforesaid principles Mr. Anand has relied upon the following judgments:-\\n(i) A.V. Rajadurai Nadar v. Ayya Nadar and another  wherein it was held that the expression \\'deceptively similar\\' as defined in S.2(d) means that the similarity or resemblance must be such as it would be likely to deceive or cause confusion. Any conclusion reasonable and proper can be arrived at by a meticulous examination of each detail and then making a comparison. At the same time what mainly strikes the eye must also be conducive. But, when one looks at it, especially from the standpoint of a person who is most likely to use a particular brand of matches, if it appears that the distinction is prominent and it cannot lead to any similarity or a deceptive similarity or confusion then there could be no objection to the two different trade marks.\\n(ii) J. and P. Coats Ltd. v. Chadha & Company(India) PTC Supp(1) 295 Del(DB), where colour of rival boxes was similar, the following view was taken:-\\n \"Marks, it must never be forgotten, are remembered rather by general impression or by some significant details than by any photographic recollection of the whole. Keeping in view the main idea, the essential feature or the leading characteristic represented by each one of the two rival marks, we feel that those who use the thread may well be expected to distinguish between the two figures of \\'dog\\' and \"anchor\" and if they happen to be literate, they can easily distinguish one from the other. It is no doubt true that the colour of the boxes is very much similar, but then that is not conclusive nor is that the domination or the leading characteristic.\" \\n13. It was further contended by Mr. Anand that even if the colour combination is same on the packing or the container the offence of passing off is not made out once there is an added material showing permanently the source and in the instant case the added material when taken into account would show that on the label of the goods of the defendant there is sufficient indication as to the manufacture of the source or origin of the material besides many other qualities of the goods of the defendant and on account of other ingredients of added material the sting of passing off on account of colour combination vanishes.\\n14. The packaging of large number of manufacturers of tooth paste and tooth brush has been produced on the record by the defendant. All these packagings are on the red colour background with the trade name written in white colour having little stripes of blue and yellow colour printed thereon. In order to show that the plaintiff has no monopoly over the colour red or white, Mr. Anand has produced few packagings of Colgate tooth paste with different colours having the base of red colour interspersed with blue or yellow colour and, therefore, to say the colour combination of red and white is its exclusive right is to bely its own claim.\\n15. While canvassing the aforesaid proposition of law, Mr. Anand has placed reliance upon a decision of Division Bench of this Court in Kellogg Company v. Pravin Kumar Bhadabhai 1996 PTC (16). In this case the appellant was selling Corn Flakes with carton which described the cartons as Kellogg\\'s CORN FLAKES(the original and the best). The respondent was also selling corn flakes using a carton more or less similar in size but with the title \"AIMS ARISTO CORN FLAKES\" written just at the place where appellant displayed the words \\'Kellogg\\'s CORN FLAKES. The grievance of the appellant was that carton of the respondent was having substantial deceptive similarities and that these goods are bound to cause confusion amongst the customeRs. Some of the similarities pointed out by the appellant as well as dis-similarities pointed out by the court were as under:-\\n(i)That the size and shape of the carton was similar being rectangular.\\n(ii)In the word \\'FLAKES\\' in the appellan\\'s carton the letters L and A were joined together closely or rather touch each other.\\n(iii)That both contain a picture of the corn flakes and that there was a small square on the left hand top where the words \"Kellogg\\'s CORN FLAKES\\' were written inside the square and that the respondent had also put a square on the left hand top with the words \"AIMS ARISTO CORN FLAKES\\'.\\n(iv)There was a red band at the top which took off from the square on the left top and ran horizontally across on the front top into the right and to the other sides and respondent also used a similar red band taking off horizontally from the square on the left top.\\n(v)That even in regard to the square on the left side top, Kellogg\\'s used an inner red border then a white gap and then an outer green border running all along the sides of the square while respondent was also using the same red and green borders for the square on the left top. \\nDissimilarities observed by the court were:-\\ni)The word Kellogg\\'s is displayed very prominently in fairly big letters above the words \\'CORN FLAKES\\' in the square on the left hand top and then to the right of the words `Kellogg\\'s CORNFLAKES there is the picture of the face of a hen, up to its neck.\\nii) There is a bowl containing corn flakes and a cherry therein with a big spoon. Pouring of milk is shown into the plate. On the right side of the carton, it is stated prominently that the flakes are 99% fat free whereas in the respondent\\'s carton in the left hand top rectangle the words `AIMS ARISTO\\' corn flakes prominently written. There is an ISI in a smaller rectangular bricket but shown quite prominently below the rectangle on the left top, a plate blue in colour with corn flakes and cashew etc. There is no picture of milk pouring into the plate. In other words while in the rectangle on the left hand top the words Kellog\\'s corn flakes are prominent for the appellant, the words `AIMS ARISTO\\' corn flakes appear very prominently for the respondent at the same place. \\nThe view taken by the court was as under:-\\n \"It is true that the appellant has referred to certain similarities in the size and shape of the carton, there being a square on the left top with word \\'KELLOGG\\'S CORNFLAKE\\'s, the words L&A being joined, border being red and green and a red band running round in the top horizontally. It is true that these similarities were not set out in the order. But in our prima facie view, the prominent display of the words \\'Kellogg\\'s\\' in bold red letters in white background inside the square on the left-top appellant\\'s carton cannot go unnoticed by any buyer. We have to understand the learned Judge\\'s words \"trade dress of the plaintiff is entirely different\\', in that light, prima facie.\\nThe law relating to \\'trade dress\\' is very clear. Kerly in \\'Law of Trade Marks\\' (12th Ed, 1986, para 16.67) says that it is usually true in some degree that a trader\\'s goods are recognised by their general appearance, or \"get-up\". Accordingly, resemblance or \\'get-up\\' is not uncommonly an ingredient in passing off. Such cases are rare, since few traders rely on get-up alone to distinguish their goods, so that trade names and word trade marks are ordinarily present too\" and the author says:\\n \"and in these days, in this country, a difference in names is enough to warn the public that they are getting one trader\\'s goods and not the others\"(Sapers v. Specters(1953) 70 RPC 173).\" \\n16. Mr. Anand also tried to draw support from Kuber Khaini Pvt. Ltd. v. Prabhoolal Ramratan Das Pvt. Ltd and another 2002 (24) PTC 135(Cal) wherein the product manufactured by both the parties were purchased by ordinary class of people mostly illiterate. The petitioner\\'s case was that the petitioner has a distinctive design, colour scheme and get up which is an artistic work under the meaning of Copyright Act 1957 and his design was duly registered. Its grievance was that respondent No. 2 was distributing khaini and gutkhas of various manufacturers all in pouches and/or sachets having design, get up, colour scheme and dimension similar to the petitioner\\'s distinctive pouch design. However, the trade name of the petitioner was KUBER whereas trade name adopted by the respondent was CHAKOR. It was averred that the purchaser would not be able to read the name \"CHAKOR\" in the pouch and will be guided by the get up of the same. The adoption and use of packaging design apart from the passing off and infringement of the trade mark is also an intention of the respondents and trading upon the reputation of the petitioner\\'s kuber khaini. The emphasis was laid on the difference and dis-simalirities in respect of the mark used by the respondent. It was submitted that there is no question of being deceived inasmuch as the photograph on the pouch is different. The other dissimilarity is the name. It was held that except the colour combination the name and the get-up are different altogether and further that there are dissimilarities appearing on the face of those pouches/wrappers and, therefore, there is no scope for purchaser being misled. If a purchaser wants to purchase his goods, he must know the goods he is purchasing. The different name is a piece of evidence that the buyer will go by the name as well and therefore, there is no question of being deceived.\\n17. Another judgment relied upon by Mr. Anand is M/s. Amrit Banaspati Co. Ltd v. M/s Suraj Industries Ltd 1996 PTC (16) wherein following view was taken:-\\n \"Normally in an action for passing off the relief of injunction is not to be granted at the interim stage because still there has to be a trial but again in exceptional cases such an interim relief can definitely be made available to the aggrieved party in case prima facie it is established on record that the two products are so similar in appearance that there was absolutely no way of avoiding the grant of interim injunction.\"\\n18. It is contended by Mr. Anand that if the trade name of the product is prominently mentioned on the container and the trade name happens to be altogether different, the colour combination, get up, colour scheme have no relevance and similarities in the colour combination and get up are no ground for injunction as difference in the trade name is sufficient to distinguish the goods of the plaintiff from those of the defendants.\\n19. On other ancillary points, Mr. Anand has also argued at great length. Attempt needs to be made to precise them. At first instance, Mr. Anand has relied heavily upon the judgment of Bombay High Court. Relevant extracts need to be reproduced. These are:-\\n \"Leave under Rules 147 and 148 of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay(Original Side) Rules, 1980 granted to the plaintiffs to take out notice of motion in terms of the draft notice of motion handed in. Notice of motion is made returnable on 23rd December, 1996. Mr. Dwarkadas waives service for the defendants.\\nI have heard the learned counsel for the parties at considerable length and having compared the two marks on the two sets of cartons. One of the plaintiffs and the other of the defendants, I do not think any case for ad-interim relief is made out. Ordered accordingly.\" \\n20. Aforesaid order was passed when ex parte ad interim injunction was sought. However the application for interim injunction was decided on merits with the following observations:-\\n \"The plaintiffs filed a suit for infringement of trade mark. By the instant Notice of Motion, plaintiffs is seeking injunction against the defendants from using label mark. Learned counsel for the plaintiffs urged that the colour scheme(colour combination) red and white, is a part of registered trade mark. The defendants for their product of dental cream using the similar colour combination to mis-guide the customers and thus it has caused prejudice to the marketing of the Colgate dental cream.\\nWith the assistance of the learned counsel, I perused both the label marks. No doubt, the colour combination, to some extent, is identical. However, the defendant has prominently exposed the brand name \"Anchor\" on the label mark. As a result, according to me, even for a ordinary customer, though the colour combination is similar, could not get idea that they are otherwise purchasing Anchor in place of Colgate. The trade mark being so prominent, as pointed out, has a definite distinctive mark of the consumer product. As such, I do not find a fit case for grant of injunction in favor of the plaintiff.\\nWith this direction Notice of Motion is disposed of.\" \\n21. According to Mr. Anand, the judgment of the Bombay High Court is binding upon both the parties for following reasons:-\\ni)That the ground for seeking injunction propounded by the plaintiff in respect of label mark as well as container of tooth paste is under the trade name of COLGATE.\\nii)The plea of the plaintiff was that colour combination or colour scheme of red and white is the part of registered trademark and the defendants by using the same colour combination in respect of dental cream is with an intention to misguide the customeRs. \\niii)That the court though observed that the colour combination to some extent is identical yet found that the brand name ANCHOR on the label mark was so prominent than the brand name COLGATE that even an ordinary customer could get an idea in respect of similarity of colour combination that they are otherwise purchasing ANCHOR in place of COLGATE. \\n22. Mr. Anand contends that the trademark being prominently distinctive does not entitle the plaintiff to injunction merely on the ground of similarity of colour combination on the label.\\n23. Mr. Anand has relied upon Arjun Singh v. Mohindra Kumar and others  in support of his contention that once the decision has been given on the question of interim injunction in a suit between the same parties and in respect of same pleas which the plaintiff might have raised in the subsequent suits the principle of res judicata is invoked. On the concept of res judicata the Supreme Court made the following observations:-\\n \"Scope of the principle of res judicata is not confined to what is contained in S.11 but is of more general application. Again, res judicata could be as much applicable to different stages of the same suit as to findings on issues in different suits. If the court which rendered the first decision was competent to entertain the suit or other proceeding, and had therefore competency to decide the issue or matter, the circumstance that it is a tribunal of exclusive jurisdiction or one from whose decision no appeal lay would not by themselves negative the finding on the issue by it being res judicata in later proceedings. Where the principle of res judicata is invoked in the case of the different stages of proceedings in the same suit, the nature of the proceedings, the scope of the enquiry which the adjectival law provides for the decision being reached, as well as the specific provisions made on matters touching such decision are some of the material and relevant factors to be considered before the principle is held applicable.\"\\n24. Thus Mr. Anand has questioned the maintainability of the suit in view of the provisions of Section 10 of the CPC inasmuch as that direct and substantial question of the use of red and white colour by the defendant is pending before the Bombay High Court and Section 10 prohibits a subsequent suit involving the same dispute or issue or question. \\n25. Mr. Anand also tried to assail the maintainability of the suit by the provisions of Order 2 Rule 2 CPC as the kernel of the pleadings of the plaintiffs is the colour scheme of red and white on its container and before the Bombay High Court also identical plea was taken in respect of tooth paste and since the cause of action in respect of tooth powder was available to the plaintiff at the time of the filing of the suit against the defendant in the Bombay High Court and after having failed to obtain an injunction the instant suit is nothing but an attempt to indulge in hit and trial method and taking chances.\\n26. Order 2 Rule 2 CPC provides as under:-\\n \"decree\" means the formal expression of an adjudication which, so far as regards the Court expressing it, conclusively determines the rights of the parties with regard to all or any of the matters in controversy in the suit and may be either preliminary or final. It shall be deemed to include the rejection of a plaint and the determination of any question within section 144, but shall not include---\\n(a) any adjudication from which an appeal lies as an appeal from an order, or\\n \\n\\n(b) any order of dismissal for default.\"  \\n27. Next contention of Mr. Anand is that Plaintiff No. 2 cannot claim to be the registered or licensed user of the trademark Colgate and plaintiff No. 1, the proprietor unless and until it is registered as a registered user under Section 48(1) of the Trade Mark Act, 1995 and in the instant case plaintiff No. 2 is neither registered as a registered user nor as a licensed user as required under Section 48 and as such there is no user of any trademark of plaintiff No. 1 in India. Section 48 provides as under:-\\n \"48. Registered users-(1) Subject to the provisions of section 49, a person other than the registered proprietor of a trade mark may be registered as a registered user thereof in respect of any or all of the goods or services in respect of which the trademark is registered.\\n(2)The permitted use of a trade mark shall be deemed to be used by the proprietor thereof, and shall be deemed not to be used by a person other than the proprietor, for the purposes of section 47 or for any other purpose for which such use is material under this Act or any other law.\" \\n28. Mr. Anand further contended that plaintiff No. 1 has only applied for the registration of the trademark Colgate in respect of tooth powder Can and tooth powder and it neither manufactures such a product in India nor sells such a product in India. It only claims to hold trademark registrations for the plaintiff No. 2 who can derive its right as a registered user of the trademark of plaintiff No. 1 and, therefore, cannot be deemed as either a registered user or a licensed user of trademark of plaintiff No. 1 as envisaged in sub-section(2) of Section 48. In other words unless and until the proprietor under the Trade Mark Act is registered it can neither permit the use of trademark and if the proprietor of a trademark happens to be a registered proprietor there is also a requirement of law under Section 48(1) of the Act to seek protection as a permitted or licensed user.\\n29. The emphasis has been laid by Mr. Anand on the word \"registered user\" appearing in sub clause (1) which in his perception means that the registered user has to be necessarily registered as such in case it seeks the protection of the trademark of its registered owner or proprietor.\\n30. In support of this proposition of law Mr. Anand has relied upon K.R.Beri & Co. l v. The Metal Goods Mfg. Co. Pvt. Ltd.  wherein the Division Bench repelled the contention that even without the use by a registered user of the trademark use by any person can be equated as a use by the proprietor if it is with the latters consent. While arriving at this conclusion their Lordships observed as under:-\\n \" when the legislature is creating a fiction by means of Section 48(2) to equate the use by a registered user only as that of proprietor, the court cannot ignore this mandate of the legislature and hold that the use of trade mark by an unregistered user can be equated to the user by the proprietor.\"\\n31. Put briefly the ratio of the aforesaid authority is that use of the trademark by an unregistered user cannot be equated to the user by the proprietor.\\n32. To cap it all Mr. Anand also contended that neither plaintiff No. 1 nor plaintiff No. 2 has filed a single document showing the sale of tooth powder Can of the trademark Colgate with the get up and the red and white colour scheme in India and in the opinion of Mr. Anand the effect is that there is no evidence on the record to show that there is a user of either of get up or red and white colour scheme by any of the plaintiffs in India and, therefore, the question of passing off of the goods of the plaintiffs does not arise nor does the element of confusion or deception exist whereas on the contrary the defendant proved documents in support of its use of not only of user of its trademark but also of get up and red and white colour scheme of the container in respect of \"tooth powder\" showing the huge sales figures as well as the expenses spent upon the advertisements in the newspapers and in the electronic media. \\n33. Mr. Anand has relied upon the judgment in Cycle Corporation of India Limited v. T.I.Raleigh Industries Pvt. Ltd. And others  wherein the interpretation of provisions of Section 46(1)(b) read with Section 48 was involved and the following view was taken:-\\n \"The expression \"by an registered proprietor\" in Section 46(1)(b) should not be restricted to user by proprietor or registered user who should also include bona fide or authorised user. The legislature did not intend to register proprietor to be deprived of their property at the instance of user whose use is unregistered. The expression, therefore, should not be restricted to user by the proprietor himself or any registered user but should also take into account bona fide authorised user.\"\\n34. Mr. R.K.Anand has further contended that as the plaintiffs have relied upon two trademarks registered as 290361 and 434311 in respect of Colgate tooth powder and the documents placed on record by the plaintiff are the marks other than the said two marks and this shows that the plaintiffs are not the registered users of the aforesaid trademark and, therefore, the user by plaintiff No. 2 is not the user by plaintiff No. 1.\\n35. In nutshell unless and until the plaintiffs file the documents in respect of aforesaid two marks they cannot claim to be registered user of the trademarks of the plaintiff No. 1.\\n36. Last but not the least, Mr. Anand contended that on account of unexplained delay in taking action the plaintiff has dis-entitled itself to the relief of interim injunction. According to Mr. Anand the plaintiff sent notice to the defendant in the year 1998 calling upon the defendant to stop using the colour combination of red and white on the packaging of their goods and therefore according to the plaintiff, the cause of action arose in July, 1998 when the notice was sent but the averments made by the plaintiff are that the defendant keeps on changing the colour combination and pattern and whenever the plaintiff changes his pattern he always introduces an element of deceptive similarity. But on the contrary there is no evidence to that effect. May be that the plaintiff may be using the same from time to time as and when the defendant changes as the defendant has the registered copy right in respect of his colour combination and the packing style as the registered copy right is not in respect of tooth powder and is in respect of logo.\\n37. Mr. Anand stated that first notice in respect of tooth powder was given on 13.7.1998 whereby the plaintiff called upon the defendant to restrain from manufacturing, distributing or selling the goods packed in cans having the similar get up and colour scheme of red and white but for five years they did not take any action till the suit was filed. Such an inordinate delay is not only fatal but sufficient to oust the plaintiff. In support of this contention Mr. Anand has drawn strength from the following:-\\nIn Sudhir Bhatia and others v. Midas Hygiene Industries(P) Ltd. 2992(24) PTC 94 Delhi (DB) observations of Eve, J in Codes v. Addis & Sons 1923(40)RPC 130 were cited. The observations of Eve, J. are as under:-\\n \"For the purpose of determining this issue I must assume that the plaintiffs are traders who have started in this more or less small way in this country, and have been continuously carrying on this business. But I must assume also that they have not, during that period, been adopting a sort of Rip Winkle Policy of going to sleep and not watching what their rivals and competitors in the same line of business were doing. I accept the evidence of any gentleman who comes into the box and gives his evidence in a way which satisfies me that he is speaking the truth when he says that he individually did not know of the existence of a particular element or a particular factor in the goods marketing by his opponents. But the question is a wider question than that : ought not he to have known is he entitled to shut his eyes to everything that is going on around him, and then when his rivals have perhaps built a very important trade by the user of indicia which he might have prevented their using had he moved in time, come to the court and say : \"Now stop them from doing it further, because a moment of time has arrived when I have awakened to the fact that this is calculated to infringe my rights.\" Certainly not. He is bound, like everybody else who wishes to stop that which he says is an invasion of his rights, to adopt a position of aggression at once, and insist, as soon as the matter is brought to court, it ought to have come to his attention, to take steps to prevent its continuance; it would be an insufferable injustice were the court to allow a man to lie by while his competitors are building up an important industry and then to come forward, so soon as the importance of the industry has been brought home to his mind, and endeavor to take from them that of which they had legitimately made use every day when they used it satisfying them more and more that there was no one who either could or would complain of their so doing. The position might be altogether altered had the user of the factor or the element in question been of a secretive or surreptitious nature; but when a man is openly using, as part of his business, names and phrases, or other elements, which persons in the same trade would be entitled, if they took steps, to stop him from using, he gets in time a right to sue them which prevents those who could have stopped him at one time from asserting at a later stage their right to an injunction.\" \\n38. Pitted against such a long strip of pleas against injuncting the defendant which according to Mr. Anand is difficult to cross, Mr. Kapil Sibal has the following to offer.\\n39. Mr. Sibal has contended that the definition of the mark under Section 2-J takes the colour combination within its fold and has placed reliance upon Anglo-Dutch P C & V Works Pvt. Ltd. v. India Trading House  wherein the container of the plaintiff had following distinctive features:-\\n \"(i) a large circle with the numeral 1001 appearing in gray on white background, \\n \\n\\n(ii)this large circle is super-imposed on voilet background, \\n \\n\\n(iii)the top and bottom figures in gray on white portions and\\n \\n\\n(iv) on the back-side the trading style in the white circle with gray lettering and a small monogram in the centre.\" \\n40. The container of the defendant, to the eye, was practically identical to that of the plaintiff except for the difference that instead of numeral 1001 the defendant had changed the numeral 9001. There were other imperceptible differences also. It was held that the confusion of voilet background and grey lettering was distinguished combination of colour and, therefore, could be acquired as a trademark for plaintiff\\'s container.\\n41. Mr. Sibal went to the extent that even a single colour can achieve the status of a trademark and has taken support from an American decision Qualitex v. Jacobson 514 US 159 wherein the following view was taken:-\\n \"We cannot find in the basic objectives of trademark law any obvious theoretical objection to the use of colour alone as a trademark, where that colour has attained \"secondary meaning\" and therefore identifies and distinguishes a particular brand (and thus indicates its \"source\"). In principle, trademark law, by preventing others from copying a source-identifying mark, \"reduce(s) the customer\\'s costs of shopping and making purchasing decisions\". \\n42. In the same vein Mr. Sibal also contended that the containers or goods of particular get up with distinctiveness also acquire the protection like that of a trade mark and in support of this relied upon Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. v. DDSA Pharmaceuticals Limited 1972 RPC 1. Views of Lord Justice Harman are as under:-\\n \"Goods of a particular get-up just as much proclaim their origin as if they had a particular name attached to them, and it is well known that when goods are sold with a particular get-up for long enough to be recognized by the public as goods of a particular manufacturer it does not matter whether you know who the manufacturer is.\"\\n43. On the concept that if there is an overall confusing similarity in the design, colour scheme between the conflicting labels inspite of there being no conflict with the trademark it is a case of passing off Mr. Sibal equipped himself with foreign decisions besides two Indian decisions (i) Camlin Pvt. Ltd. v. National Pencil Industries 1989 IPLR 215; and (ii) Vicco Laboratories Bombay v. Hindustan Rimmer, Delhi . In Camlin\\'s case a prima facie view of passing off was taken where the get up, colour combination and overall arrangement of the pencils of the plaintiff had become associated exclusively with their goods as understood by the trade and public as well as the reputation of the plaintiff in respect of those pencils.\\n44. In Vicco Laboratories case also the plaintiffs were selling their goods with descriptive get up and colour scheme for long in 1995 while the defendants started selling their products in 1997 in the cartons which appeared to be copies of the entire get up and the colour scheme adopted by the plaintiff. It was held to be a case of passing off and fit for injuncting the defendants. The foreign decisions relied upon by Mr. Sibal on the concept of trade dress encompassing colour combination, get up and lay out inspite of there being no similarity in the trade name are as under:-\\n(i)White Hudson & Company Limited v. Asian Organization Limited 1965 RPC 144. In this case the plaintiffs sold their cough sweets in Singapore since 1953. The sweets were sold loose in orange colored cellophane wrappers on which was printed the word \"Hacks\" in Roman characters only. In March, 1958 the defendants entered the same market with cough sweets in a white cellophane wrapper. But in May of that year they went over to using an orange wrapper similar to the plaintiffs\\' but bearing the word \"Pecto\". The plaintiffs brought an action to restrain passing off. The trial judge found that no other wrapper cough sweets had been sold loose, that the sweets were called by the local population \"red paper cough sweets\", that the plaintiffs\\' get-up had become distinctive of their goods, that the get-up of the defendants\\' sweets resembled the plaintiffs\\' to such an extent as to lead to confusion, that the difference in the names printed on the wrappers was not sufficient to distinguish the goods in the eyes of a purchasing public largely unable to read English, and that passing-off had therefore been established.\\n(ii)Tavener Rutledge Ld. v. Specters Ld. 1959 RPC 83 \\n \\n\\nIt was also a case of Colgate tooth paste pertaining to its label. The defendant introduced and had taken to sale in the local market fluoride treated tooth paste. It was held that the act of the defendant constituted an infringement of their said trade marks as it was calculated to deceive and had in fact led to deception and the belief that his toothpaste was the goods of the appellants or either of them; and was calculated to cause and must have caused sale of toothpaste which was not manufactured or marketed by the appellants to be passed off as their goods.\\n45. While emphasizing the significance of trade dress Mr. Sibal vehemently contended that trade dress involves the total image of a product and includes features such as size, shape and graphics and needs to be protected like trade mark. Such a doctrine was enunciated in Vision Sports, Inc. v. Melville Corp. 12 USPQ 2d 1740 like this-\\n \"In contrast, trade dress involves the total image of a product and \"may include features such as size, shape, colour combinations, texture, or graphics. Trade dress protection is broader in scope than trademark protection, both because it protects aspects of packaging and product design that cannot be registered for trademark protection and because evaluation of trade dress infringement claims requires the court to focus on the plaintiff\\'s entire selling image, rather than the narrower single facet of trademark. \\n46. While meeting the challenge of the defendant that the plaintiff is ousted from instituting the suit on account of delay, laches and acquiescence Mr. Sibal has contended that the plaintiff had issued a notice in July, 1998 and, therefore, any use is at the defendants risk and peril. In support of this contention Mr. Sibal has placed reliance upon the following:-\\n(i)My-T Fine Corporation v. Gertrude Samuels & Others 21 USPQ 94 where delay of two years before beginning suit was held to be of no importance. It was held that were it not for the intent to trade unfairly, we might hesitate but advantages built upon a deliberately plagiarized make-up do not seem to us to give the borrower any standing to complain that his vested interests will be disturbed.\\n(ii)Hindustan Pencils Pvt. Ltd. v. India Stationery Products  where this court held that in defense of laches in equity both the parties must come to the court with clean hands and present who is guilty.\\n(iii) Alfred Dunhill Limited v. Kartar Singh Makkar 1999 PTC (19) 294 where there was a delay of 11 years and arguments were advanced that delay is fatal to the plaintiff\\'s application for temporary injunction as in that case plaintiff refrained from instituting common law suit presumably with the belief that the matter would be resolved in the proceedings initiated by it against the defendant company, it was held that it cannot be said that plaintiff company had been sleeping over on its rights while on the other hand, defendant company acted on its own peril by continuing to use the mark and in such eventuality delay of 11 years was excusable. \\n(iv) In Massdak Hossain v. State of West Bengal and others  it was held that where the respondents are put on notice no surprise can be caused by filing of the suit. In other words if the sales are insignificant or have not affected the plaintiff, to expect the plaintiff to institute a suit immediately after service of notices is not a valid expectation.  \\n47. Mr. Sibal referred to the conduct of the defendant in following the shape and the size of the containers of the plaintiffs whenever plaintiffs come out with new container also shows or demonstrates its intention to encash upon the reputation and goodwill of the plaintiff. Whenever the plaintiffs come out with the same product but in different sizes of containers, the defendant does not lag behind and immediately comes out with the same size of containers nevertheless to say with the same colour combination and get up. \\n48. While expounding the doctrine of confusion arising from the deceptive similarities as to the trade dress that may fail the unwary customer to distinguish between the rival goods Mr. Sibal placed strong reliance upon Harold F.Ritchie, Inc. v. Chesebrough-Pond\\'s Inc, 26 USPQ 310 wherein it was held that while entering a field of endeavor already occupied by another the second comer should, in the selection of a trade name or trade mark, keep far enough away to avoid all possible confusion and the leading case on this concept is Florence Mfg. Co. v. J.C.Dowd & CO., 2 Cir. 178 F.73, 75 which again was an American case. The law laid down in this respect is as under:-\\n \"It is so easy for the honest business man, who wishes to sell his goods upon their merits, to select from the entire material universe, which is before him, symbols, marks and covering which by no possibility can cause confusion between his goods and those of his competitors, that the courts look with suspicion upon one who, in dressing his goods for the market, approaches so near to his successful rival that the public may fail to distinguish between them\". \\n49. As regards the objection that the benefit of use claimed by plaintiff No. 1 in respect of the use alleged to have been made by the plaintiff No. 2 cannot accrue to plaintiff No. 1 unless and until the license used is duly registered under the provisions of Section 48 of the Act, Mr. Sibal contended that this may be relevant in context of a suit for infringement as the defendant can claim that the registration is invalid since the trademark to which it pertains has not been in use. \\n50. As regards the previous proceedings between the parties in Mumbai and the injunction refused by the Mumbai High Court Mr. Sibal has contended that the previous proceedings have no relevance as these related to \"tooth paste\" while the present proceedings relate to \"tooth powder\"which has not only a distinctive container but distinctive colour combination and get up on the container.\\n51. I have accorded my careful and cautious consideration to the rival contentions for the purpose of ad interim injunction and have come to the following conclusions:-\\n52. It is the overall impression that customer gets as to the source and origin of the goods from visual impression of colour combination, shape of the container, packaging etc. If illiterate, unwary and gullible customer gets confused as to the source and origin of the goods which he has been using for longer period by way of getting the goods in a container having particular shape, colour combination and getup, it amounts to passing off. In other words if the first glance of the article without going into the minute details of the colour combination, getup or lay out appearing on the container and packaging gives the impression as to deceptive or near similarities in respect of these ingredients, it is a case of confusion and amounts to passing off one\\'s own goods as those of the other with a view to encash upon the goodwill and reputation of the latter. \\n53. The plaintiffs have succeeded prima facie in showing from the look of trade dress of the two articles, one manufactured by the plaintiff and another by the defendant from the point of view of not only unwary, illiterate customer/servants of the household but semi-literate also as the trademarks \"Colgate\" and \"Anchor\" are written in English language cannot be distinguished by ordinary customer of a country where bare literacy level is abysmally low. There is every likelihood of confusion as to the source on account of the similarity of substantial portion of the container having particular colour combination and also shape of the container which alone helps in determining the allegations of passing off despite stripes in the same colour or in different colour. The criteria is the overall impression from the look of packaging/container containing the goods and articles that can legitimately injunct its rival. Such an action on the part of infringing party also has an element of unfair competition. \\n54. May be, no party can have monopoly over a particular colour but if there is substantial reproduction of the colour combination in the similar order either on the container or packing which over a period has been imprinted upon the minds of customers it certainly is liable to cause not only confusion but also dilution of distinctiveness of colour combination. Colour combination, get up, lay out and size of container is sort of trade dress which involves overall image of the product\\'s features. There is a wide protection against imitation or deceptive similarities of trade dress as trade dress is the soul for identification of the goods as to its source and origin and as such is liable to cause confusion in the minds of unwary customers particularly those who have been using the product over a long period. \\n55. The difference in the style of the words appearing on the container or packing identifying its manufacturers by way of style, colour combination or textures or graphics is certainly significant or relevant for determining the overall imitation of the container but if a product having distinctive colour combination, style, shape and texture has been in the market for decades as in this case it is in the market since 1951 it leads to ineluctable inference of having acquired secondary meaning on account of its reputation and goodwill earned at huge cost.\\n56. It is not the diligent or literate or conscious customer who always remain conscious to the quality of goods he has been purchasing which determines an offence of passing off. It is the unwary, illiterate and gullible persons who determine by arriving at a conclusion whether the infringed goods are confusingly similar in colour combination, get up, lay-out printed over the container or packing. If it is not so then the offence of passing off will cease to have its existence once the guilty party chooses a different trade name. \\n57. Words \"Colgate\" and \"Anchor\" are distinct and have not an iota of similarities either in look or in sound. That is why the ingredients of trade dress, get up, colour combination, lay out of the container or packing acquire significance and relevance for determining the offence of passing off. This criteria flows from the concept of action of passing off developed over the years that it is the similarities and not the dissimilarities which go to determine whether the action for passing off is required or not. That is why in trademark cases even the deceptive similarities are considered sufficient for infringement of trademark. If similarities of trade dress are substantial from the look of the two goods, it comes within the mischief of passing off.\\n58. As in Hudson\\'s case, for non-speaking English, purchasers get up was held to be all important. In the instant case for unwary, illiterate and gullible customer, who is as good as non-English knowing purchaser, trade dress in the form of colour combination of Red and White in that order and proportion is all pertinent and relevant and nothing else. Distinctive differences in name is of no significance. Reason is simple. If an illiterate servant or village folk goes to the shop with the instruction to bring Colgate Tooth Power having a container of particular shop with trade dress of colour combination of Red and White in 1/3 and 2/3 proportion he will not be in position to distinguish if he is handed over \"Anchor\" Tooth Powder contained in a container having the identical trade dress and colour combination of \"Red and White\"in that order and proportion. Confusion is writ large as to source and origin as the difference in name will not make any difference to such a customer and the goods of the defendant can easily be passed off as goods of the plaintiff.\\n59. Conscious imitation or substantial imitation of colour combination or get up or lay out of container again bares the design of the defendant in causing confusion in the minds of customeRs. The court is not required to find out whether there is confusion or deceptiveness. The test is whether there is likelihood of confusion or deceptiveness in the minds of unwary customers irrespective of dissimilarities in the trade name.\\n60. In the case of passing off and for that purpose infringement of trade mark which are already in existence, the second or for that purpose the subsequent comer has certain obligation to avoid unfair competition and become unjustly rich by encashing on the goodwill or reputation of the prior comer. They have to establish and bank upon on their own trade dress or distinctive features so as to establish their own merit and reputation and attract the attention of the purchasing public and if there are no substantial dissimilarities of marks, colour combination, get up or lay out on the container or packing or covering of the goods of the prior comer these are likely to create confusion in the minds of customers between his goods and the goods of the prior comer in the market as underlying and hidden intention of the second comer is to encash upon the successful rival. \\n61. Though in Harold F.Ritchie\\'s case observations emanate from the competitiveness of American economy and therefore the second comer in an already occupied field has always endeavor to capture as much of the first comer market as he can. \\n62. Significance of trade dress and colour combination is so immense that in some cases even single colour has been taken to be a trde mark to be protected from passing off action. Colour combination is a trade mark within the definition of the TMM Act as there is no exclusion in the definition. Even a single colour has been held to be a trade mark. There may be exception also. Exception is that where the colour cannot be protected as the blue colour is for the Ink and red colour is for the lipstick. Red and white has nothing to do with the pink. Teeth as white line and Gum as Pink colour alone at least sometimes can meet the basic requirements as a trade mark. Colour depletion theory is unpursuasive only in cases where a blanket prohibition is being sought.\\n63. As to the element of deceit and confusion it varies from product to product, customer to customer. As regards the objection that the court should not interfere that this case pertains to two separate products that namely tooth powder and tooth paste the facts are different, the containers are different and the packaging is different. As regards the defense that the red and white colour is common to the trade fact remains that no manufacturer is using colour combination of red and white in respect of tooth powder nor has any other manufacturer used colour combination of red and white colour in respect of tooth powder. \\n64. Even in changing competitive commercial complexion of Indian economy, the second comer is also required by giving his product a name and dress descriptive and fanciful in its own right and selling it on its own merit not by confusing the public into mistakenly purchasing his product for his competitor\\'s and the second comer must create a reputation of its own and not trade on the goodwill of another product already established at considerable cost and risks. \\n65. As regards the plea of the defendant that plaintiff are not entitled to interim injunction because of delay, laches and acquiescence inasmuch as notice was issued in July, 1998 and action was brought in 2003, such a defense is not available as it is well settled principle of law that if use is found to be dishonest, delay or acquiescence has no relevance. The very fact that notice was served upon the defendant, the bringing of the action after two or three years becomes insignificant and irrelevant. \\n66. Further, though notice was given to the defendant on 13/7/98 against the old product but when the defendant discontinued with the old product and brought out a new product in 2002 the instant action was taken within three months and therefore the question of delay does not arise. The notice was given against the use of red and white colour combination with blue line in between. Admittedly the plaintiff did not take any action as the sales were insignificant but when they modified the product with red and white colour combination alone in October, 2002 and the sales of the defendants goods have suddenly went up the instant action was taken. \\n67. As regards defense of delay, it is well settled that delay simplicitor is not a defense. Delay is relevant so far as damages are concerned. This cannot stand in the way of injunction. If the original use is dishonest where the notice has been issued inordinate delay or laches may at the most defeat the claim of rendition of accounts. Party is not supposed or expected to rush to the Court immediately.\\n68. As regards the objection that use made by plaintiff No. 2 cannot accrue to the plaintiff No. 1, there is no substance as this is not the scope of the instant suit as the present case is essentially a case of passing off and there is no registration of the plaintiff which has been put into attack on the ground of non-use.\\n69. Upshot of aforesaid discussion leads to the most ineluctable conclusion that the plaintiffs have successfully established a prima facie case for injuncting the defendant from using the colour combination of red and white in that order as trade dress on the container and packaging. As a consequence the application is allowed and defendants are, by way of ad interim injunction, restrained from using the colour combination of red and white in that order on the container/packaging of its goods viz. the \"Tooth Powder\".\\n'}},\n",

       "     'content': \"JUDGMENT\\n \\n\\nSanjay Kishan Kaul, J.\\n1. The plaintiff is an existing Public Limited Company within the meaning of Companies Act, 1956 and has instituted the present suit for permanent injunction restraining infringement of trademark, passing off, delivery up and rendition of accounts etc. against the sole defendant.\\n2. The plaintiff claims to be a reputed and established company inter alia engaged in the manufacture of pressure cookers and parts thereof under the trademark HAWKINS for the last 30 years. The name of the plaintiff company was changed from M/s Pressure Cookers and Appliances Limited to the present name of M/s Hawkins Cookers Limited in the year 1986. The plaintiff is the registered proprietor of the trademark HAWKINS from 06.05.1957 in Class 21 under the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 in respect of pressure cookers and parts thereof. The trademark registration No. 179714 is for HAWKINS UNIVERSAL but the mark registered is HAWKINS and the word UNIVERSAL is subject to disclaimer. The registrations are stated to be valid and subsisting. The plaintiff claims that the trademark HAWKINS forms a predominant feature of the corporate name and trading style of the plaintiff and the plaintiff is also referred in the abbreviated form of 'Hawkins'.\\n3. The trademark HAWKINS is inter alia used for parts of the pressure cookers known as gaskets. The gaskets of the pressure cookers are sold as independent items and are purchased as such by the housewives and servants whenever the old pieces are worn out or need replacement. The gaskets are one of the most crucial and intergral part of a pressure cooker which prevents the steam from leaking out of the cooker. It is the steam pressure inside the cooker which cooks the food quickly. Thus, gaskets of poor quality or defective gaskets can lead to bursting of cooker and consequential burn injuries. It is in view thereof that the plaintiff has a quality control department to ensure that its pressure cookers and various parts thereof are of the required quality and standard. The plaintiff claims that since these gaskets are sold all over the country including rural as well as urban areas, the uneducated intending purchasers of below average intelligence, being illiterate and having imperfect recollection, identify such gaskets by their features and get-up of their packing as well as the trademark HAWKINS. It is in order to promote the pressure cookers and parts thereof manufactured by the plaintiff that the plaintiff has spent a sum of Rs.  111 crore between October, 1986 and March, 2005 towards advertisements and promotions.\\n4. The plaintiff in January, 2000 came to know that the defendant was using the trademark HAWKINS/Hawkins in respect of parts of pressure cooker and thus served a Cease and Desist Notice on the defendant vide its letter dated 03.01.2000. The claim of the plaintiff was disputed by the defendant on the ground that the gaskets were being sold under their own trademark and the use of the word 'Hawkins' by the defendant on their products/gaskets was to inform the purchasers that the gaskets being manufactured by the defendant were suitable for Hawkins pressure cookers. The plaintiff claims that they did not see the product subsequently in the market till October, 2004 when the plaintiff again noticed the defendant's gaskets being sold in the market and thus again a Cease and Desist Notice dated 08.11.2004 was issued, which was disputed by the defendant vide its letter dated 17.11.2004\\n \\n\\n5. The principal defense of the defendant is that they have adopted the trademark MAYUR and only state on their product/gasket that the same is suitable was Hawkins Pressure Cookers. Thus there is no chance of deception or infringement of the trademark of the plaintiff since the trademark of the defendant MAYUR has been used prominently on the packing of their product/gasket.\\n6. On the other hand, the case of the plaintiff is that the unauthorized use of the trademark Hawkins by the defendant on the packaging of their product/gasket is likely to cause confusion or deception about a nexus, trade connection or association between the goods and business of the defendant with that of the plaintiff. This is more so since the purchasers of the plaintiff's products are not so wary customers. The plaintiff claims that the use of the trademark 'Hawkins' by the defendant is detrimental to the plaintiff's reputation since the plaintiff has no control or supervision over the quality of spare parts manufactured by the defendant. The use of the trademark 'Hawkins' by the defendant is alleged to be motivated only with the intent of the defendant to trade upon the goodwill and reputation enjoyed by the trademark HAWKINS of the plaintiff in the market and amongst the customers. The trademark HAWKINS of the plaintiff is also used in the price list of the defendant as MAYUR-HAWKINS. It is in view thereof that the present suit has been filed by the plaintiff.\\n7. The suit is resisted by the defendant. The defendant claims that the plaintiff wants to monopolize the sale of gaskets which are used in pressure cookers in the market. The defendant manufactures gaskets which can be used for different types of pressure cookers including the pressure cookers manufactured by the plaintiff. The defendant claims that it is a common knowledge that there is always a second line of manufacturers of spare parts, accessories and replacement items of machines, articles of everyday use, domestic appliances and even for automobiles for every description, which is known as ancillary industry. It is the well known custom of usage of the trade of the second line manufacturers to specifically indicate the compatibility of the various accessories, appliances and spares to the main item for which they supply the ancillary product. This is stated to be essential information to the customers so that they can select articles of a particular specification for the main items used by them. The defendant thus states that the use of a trademark of one person as a referral cannot be termed as infringement of trademark and such user is not prohibited by any law much less by the Trade and Merchandise Act, 1958 or the Trade Marks Act, 1999 ('the said Act' for short). The object is only to inform the public that MAYUR gaskets can be used for HAWKINS pressure cookers and it is only this much information which is set out on the packaging of the defendant. The defendant claims to be manufacturing MAYUR gaskets continuously and openly from the year 1994 onwards. The defendant claims to have adopted the trademark MAYUR and device of PEACOCK from 1994. The trademark of the defendant is stated to have been registered with the Registrar of Trademarks. It is thus claimed that the defendant's trademark as also the device of peacock have acquired good reputation in the market and the sales of the defendant's product/gasket is only in Tamil Nadu. The defendant has also raised a plea of acquiescence on account of the fact that after giving the initial Cease and Desist Notice as far back as January, 2000, the plaintiff kept silent for a period of four years thereafter. Even on merits, it is stated that there can be no question of passing off the goods by the defendant as the gaskets manufactured by the defendant come in different colours with a different packaging as compared to the gaskets supplied by the plaintiff which come in black colour.\\n8. The defendant naturally claims that the product manufactured by it is of high value and there is no question of the product of the defendant being inferior to that of the plaintiff.\\n9. The gasket is used in the pressure cooker more as a sealing mechanism to prevent leakage of steam, which seals the upper and lower portion of the cooker but it does not lock the metal portion of the cooker. Thus there is no question of the role of any defective gasket in bursting of a pressure cooker. The defendant claims that it commenced business from 1991 and the quality standards of the gaskets manufactured by the defendant are approved by the Bureau of Indian Standards. However, the trademark MAYUR and the device of PEACOCK were adopted in the year 1994.\\n10. On the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed:\\ni) Whether this Court has no territorial jurisdiction to try and adjudicate the present suit? OPD\\n \\n\\nii) Whether the defendant is using 'Hawkins' as a trademark? OPP\\n \\n\\niii) If issue No. 2 is answered in favor of the plaintiff : Whether the defendant is infringing the trademark 'Hawkins' of the plaintiff? OPP\\n \\n\\niv) If issue No. 2 is answered in favor of the plaintiff : Whether the defendant is passing of its goods as that of the plaintiff? OPP\\n \\n\\nv) Whether the plaintiff is entitled to damages/rendition of accounts? If so, the extent and period thereof? OPP\\n \\n\\nvi) Relief.\\n11. The parties subsequently agreed on 21.05.2007 that really there was no cross examination required and that the parties would file their affidavits of examination in chief. The parties have thereafter led their evidence.\\n12. The plaintiff has examined Sh. K.Sundararaghavan as PW1 being the Executive Director (Finance and Administration) of the plaintiff-company, who has proved the Power of Attorney executed in his favor as ExPW1/1. A certified copy of the Certificate of Incorporation pursuant to the change of name of the plaintiff has been proved as ExPW1/2. Certified copies of certificate of registration have been proved as ExPW1/3 and ExPW1/4. The booklet containing the information about the names and addresses of all the authorized dealers and service centres of the plaintiff has been proved as ExPW1/6. The notice dated 03.01.2000 has been proved as Ex P-1 and the reply of the defendant dated 10.01.2000 has been proved as ExP-2. The exchange of correspondence between the parties in November, 2004 has been proved as ExP-3 and ExP-4. The other communications have also been proved, but it is not necessary to go into details in that behalf. The packaging of the defendant has been proved as ExP-10. The witness has affirmed to what is stated in the plaint.\\n13. PW1 has also gone on to state that there are two types of pressure cookers with following particulars:\\n(1) Pressure Cookers with outside fitting lid; and\\n \\n\\n(2) Pressure Cookers with inside fitting lid.\\n14. The pressure cookers being manufactured by the plaintiff are stated to fall in the second category. The dimensions of all the pressure cookers with inside fitting lid and the size of the corresponding gasket are stated to be generally identical to the various pressure cookers of the same variety and thus the gaskets of all inside fitting lid pressure cookers are generally interchangeable. It is in view thereof that the plaintiff claims that the defendant cannot use the trademark HAWKINS or the endorsement i.e. the gasket manufactured by the defendant is suitable for Hawkins pressure cookers.\\n15. In order to prove that the product of the defendant was inferior, a report dated 18.01.2007 has been proved as ExPW1/10 given by Indian Rubber Manufacturers Research Association affiliated to Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India for the purpose of evaluation of quality of the gaskets on various parameters prescribed for the gaskets. The report shows that the defendant's gasket failed the test in vital parameters of i)Tensile Strength, ii) Change in hardness and iii) Compression.\\n16. Mr. Hansraj Karsan Satra has appeared as PW2 who runs a shop by the name of Mahavir at Naupada, Thane (W) since the year 1979 and claims to be selling HAWKINS pressure cookers and parts thereof. The witness has also stated that there are two kinds of pressure cookers as mentioned aforesaid and that the dimensions of all the lids which are inward opening are the same. Thus the gaskets for inward opening lid of various brands of pressure cookers can be interchangeably used. The importance of gasket in the performance of the pressure cookers has been emphasized by this witness and various gaskets being sold in the market under different trade names have been annexed to the affidavit.\\n17. The defendant has led evidence of Mr. V.K.Radhakrishnan, partner of the defendant-firm. This witness has proved the Certificate of Registration of the trademark MAYUR and the device of PEACOCK as ExDW1/1. The Certificate of Bureau of Indian Standards to the defendant-firm has been proved as ExDW1/2 and the Registration Certificate dated 07.05.2004 issued to the defendant-firm by the Director General of Quality Assurance, Ministry of defense has been proved as ExDW1/3 to show the distinction between the packaging of the plaintiff's product and the defendant's product. The witness stated that the indication as to the compatibility of the various accessories, appliances and spares to the main item for which they supply the ancillary product is essential to the customers so that they can select articles of a particular specification for the main items used by them.\\n18. Learned Counsel for the parties were heard at length and the findings on the issues are as under:\\nIssue No.1\\n \\n\\nWhether this Court has no territorial jurisdiction to try and adjudicate the present suit? OPD\\n \\n\\n19. Learned Counsel for the plaintiff drew the attention of this Court to para 32 of the plaint whereby jurisdiction is claimed of this Court under Section 134 of the said Act since the plaintiff carries on business at Delhi. It is further claimed that the goods of the defendant are being sold and are being offered for sale at Delhi. Section 134 of the said Act reads as under:\\n134. Suit for infringement, etc., to be instituted before district Court.-\\n(1) No suit -\\n(a) for the infringement of a registered trade mark, or\\n \\n\\n(b) relating to any right in a registered trade mark, or\\n \\n\\n(c) for passing off arising out of the use by the defendant of any trade mark which is identical with or deceptively similar to the plaintiff's trade mark, whether registered or unregistered. Shall be instituted in any court inferior to a District Court having jurisdiction to try the suit.\\n(2) For the purpose of Clauses (a) and (b) of Sub-section (1), a ``District Court having jurisdiction'` shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) or any other law for the time being in force, include a District Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction, at the time of the institution of the suit or other proceeding, the person instituting the suit or proceeding, or where there are more than one such person any of them, actually and voluntarily resides or carries on business or personally works for gain.\\nExplanation.- For the purpose of Sub-section (2), ``person'` includes the registered proprietor and the registered user.\\n20. The aforesaid provision is a digression from the general norm as contained in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 ('the said Code' for short) inasmuch as it gives the jurisdiction to a Court where the plaintiff resides or carries on business or works for gain.\\n21. It is the case of the plaintiff that it is carrying on business at Delhi. Learned Counsel for the plaintiff has drawn the attention of this Court in Intas Pharmaceuticals Limited v. Allergan Inc.; 2006 (32) PTC 272. A reference has also been made to two other judgments of the learned single Judge of this Court. In Pfizer Products Inc. v. Rajesh Chopra and Ors.  the learned single Judge of this Court has rejected the argument of the defendant since the defendant had not sold any goods in Delhi, no cause of action arose in Delhi. In LG Corporation and Anr. v. Intermarket Electroplasters (P) Ltd. and Anr. 2006 (32) PTC 429, it was held that the fact of sale of infringing goods in Delhi has the nexus and relevance with the lis that is involved in the case.\\n22. On the other hand, the plea of learned Counsel for the defendant is that the Cease and Desist notices were sent from Bombay and thus this Court would have no territorial jurisdiction to try and determine the present suit.\\n23. In my considered view such a plea on the part of the defendant cannot be accepted for the reason that it is the case of the plaintiff that it is carrying on business at Delhi and the same is confirmed in the affidavits of evidence to which there is really no denial on the part of the defendant. I am of the view that this Court would have the territorial jurisdiction to try and determine the present suit.\\n24. The issue is answered accordingly.\\nWhether the defendant is using 'Hawkins' as a trademark? OPP\\n \\n\\n25. The crucial issue which arises for consideration in the present case is the aforesaid issue which hinges on the aspect as to whether the defendant is at all using the trademark HAWKINS of the plaintiff.\\n26. In order to appreciate the said plea, it would be necessary to re-produce some of the provisions of the said Act.\\n2. Definitions and interpretation.-(1) In this Act , unless the context otherwise requires, -\\n...\\n(m) ``mark'` includes a device, brand, heading, lable, ticket, name, signature, word, letter, numeral, shape of goods, packaging or combination of colours or any combination thereof.\\n...\\n(zb) ``trade mark'` means a mark capable of being represented graphically and which is capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one person from choose of others and may include shape of goods, their packaging and combination of colours , and\\n \\n\\ni) in relation to Chapter XII (other than Section 107), a registered trade mark or mark used in relation to goods or services for the purpose of indicating or so as to indicate a connection in the course of trade between the goods or services, as the case may be, and some person having the right as proprietor to use the mark, and\\n \\n\\nii) in relation to other provisions of this Act, a mark used or proposed to be used in relation to goods or services for the purpose of indicating or so to indicate to a connection in the course of trade between the goods or services, as the case may be, and some person having the right, either as proprietor or by way of permitted user, to use the mark whether with or without any indication of the identity of that person, and includes a certification trade mark or collective mark.\\n29. Infringement of registered trade marks.-\\n...\\n(2) A registered trade mark is infringed by a person who, not being a registered proprietor or a person using by way of permitted use, uses in the course of trade, a mark which because of-\\n(a) its identify with the registered trade mark and the similarly of the goods or services covered by such registered trade mark or,\\n \\n\\n(b) its similarly to the registered trade mark and the identity or similarly of the goods or services covered by such registered trade mark, or\\n \\n\\n(c) its identity with the registered trade mark and the identity of the goods or services covered by such registered trade mark, is likely to cause confusion on the part of the public, or which is likely to have an association with the registered trade mark.\\n(3) In any case falling under Clause (c) of Sub-section (2), the court shall presume that it is likely to cause confusion on the part of the public.\\n27. The plea of the learned Counsel for the plaintiff is that in terms of Section 29(2) of the said Act, a registered trademark is infringed if during the course of trade, the mark has been used (even if it is not a trademark) because of its identity with the registered trademark resulting in possibility of confusion on the part of the public or having an association with the trademark. Thus it was pleaded that once there is an infringement which falls within the meaning of Section 29(2)(c) of the said Act, the presumption under Section 29(3) of the said Act would come into play that it is likely to cause confusion on the part of the public.\\n28. Learned Counsel for the plaintiff also drew the attention of this Court to the provisions of Section 9(1)(b) of the said Act which reads as under:\\n9. Absolute grounds for refusal of registration.-\\n(1) The trade marks -\\n...\\n(b) Which consist exclusively of marks or indications which may serve in trade to designate the kind, quality, quantity, intended purpose, values, geographical origin or the time of production f the goods or rendering of the service or other characteristics of the goods or service.\\n...\\nshall not be registered:\\nProvided that a trade mark shall not be refused registration if before the date of application for registration it has acquired a distinctive character as a result of the use made of it or is a well-known trade mark.\\n29. Learned Counsel for the plaintiff emphasized that the plaintiff did not dispute that the defendant can use the trade name to indicate that the spare part is fit for use in a particular machinery but for the same it should be accompanied with a disclaimer that the spare part is not manufactured by the original manufacturer. The object should be to ensure that the public knows whether the product purchased emanates from the plaintiff or somewhere else. This plea is based on the limits of effect of the registration of trademark as contained in Section 30(2)(d) of the said Act which is follows:\\n30. Limits of effect of registered trade mark.-\\n...\\n(2) A registered trade mark is not infringed where-\\n...\\n(d) the use of a trade mark by a person in relation to goods adapted to form part of, or to be accessory to, other goods or services in relation to which the trade mark has been used without infringement of the right given by registration under this Act or might for the time being be so used, if the goods or services are so adapted, and neither the purpose nor the effect of the use of the trade mark is to indicate, otherwise than in accordance with the fact, a connection in the course of trade between any person and the goods or services, as the case may be.\\n30. Learned Counsel for the plaintiff thus contended that the defendant's gasket may mention that it can be used for different brands of pressure cookers and specify the number of such brands including 'Hawkins' but the defendant cannot single out 'Hawkins' because that would amount to trying to take advantage of the reputation of the plaintiff's trademark.\\n31. The second limb of the argument of learned Counsel for the plaintiff is based on the reading of the provisions of Section 30(2)(d) of the said Act which provides for protection for the defendant : i) if the use of the trademark is reasonably necessary; and ii) neither the purpose nor the effect of the use of the trade mark is to indicate a connection. Thus it should be an honest practice which is necessary to describe the use.\\n32. The plaintiff pleaded that it has come in the testimony of PW2 that the dimensions of all pressure cookers are same and the annexures filed with the testimony of PW2 would also show that the trade practice is not to use the brand but to go by the nature of pressure cookers and thus it was not necessary to state that the gasket was meant for Hawkins pressure cooker. There was neither any necessity for the same nor it was an honest practice which was a pre-requisite under Section 30(2)(d) of the said Act. The reputation of a pressure cooker manufacturer could also be affected in case of lack of proper quality of gasket as stated in the affidavit of PW1. The plaintiff also drew strength from the manner of published price list. Learned Counsel for the plaintiff fairly conceded that there was apparently no judgment of any Indian Court on this aspect and sought to rely upon the case of Gillette Co. v. LA- Laboratories Ltd. 2005 FSR (Vol.37) 808 which is a judgment rendered by Court of Justice of the European Communities (Third Chamber). In order to appreciate the aforesaid judgment which has formed the basis of submission of both the learned Counsel for the parties, it would be necessary to examine the factual matrix in which the said judgment was delivered.\\n33. The Gillette Group of Companies being registered proprietor of GILLETTE and SENSOR were arrayed as the plaintiff No. 1 while the second plaintiff was their exclusive licensee. The defendant was selling similar razors and blades as being manufactured by the plaintiff under the mark PARASON FLEXOR in packaging which had affixed to it a sticker bearing the words: 'All Parason Flexor and Gillette Sensor handles are compatible with this blade'. The proceedings were brought for infringement of trademark on the ground that the defendant's packaging was such as to create a link in the mind of the consumers between the defendant's product and those of the plaintiffs or at least to give an impression that the defendant was authorised by virtue of a license or for some other reason to use the GILLETTE and SENSOR marks. It was held that using the plaintiff's marks in an eye-catching manner on its packaging by the defendant amounted to an infringement of trade mark of the plaintiff by the defendant. It was further held that both the blade and the handle were essential parts of the razor and not spare parts or accessories and thus the 'spare part' exception to infringement provided by Article 4 (2) of the Finnish Law on Trade Marks would not apply.\\n34. On an appeal, the Court of Appeal held that where a razor comprised a handle and a blade and the consumer could replace the blade by a new one sold separately, the blade could be regarded as a spare part. The information given about the compatibility of the blades with both the defendant's and the claimants handles was held to be useful to the consumers and thus the defendant was held entitled to be able to demonstrate the need to mention the GILLETTE and SENSOR marks in small standard lettering on the stickers of a relatively modest size and it was held that it could not in any way give the impression that there was a commercial connection between the claimants and the defendant. It is against the said judgment that a further appeal was preferred and various questions were referred to the European Court. In substance, the questions referred to were:\\n(1) What are the criteria for deciding whether a product is a spare part or accessory;\\n(2) The permissibility of the use of a third party's trade mark to be assessed differently, depending on whether the product is like a spare part or accessory;\\n(3) The parameters to determine the requirement that the use must be 'necessary' to indicate the intended purpose of a product and the difficulty for a consumer to understand if there is no express reference to the third party's trade mark.\\n(4) The factors to be taken into account while determining an honest commercial practice and whether the mention of a third party's trademark in connection with marketing of one's own product would constitute a reference to the fact that the own product corresponds in quality and technicality or as regards its other properties to the product designed by the third party's trade mark.\\n(5) Whether the permissibility of user of a third party's trademark would be affected on the ground that the economic operator who refers to the third party's trademark also markets in addition to a spare part or accessory a product of his own with which the spare part or accessory is intended to be used with.\\n35. The European Court gave its findings and some of the findings are material for the present case which are as under:\\n(1) Use of the trademark by a third party who was not its owner was necessary in order to indicate the intended purpose of a product marketed by that third party where such use in practice constituted the only means of providing the public with comprehensible and complete information on that intended purpose in order to preserve the undistorted system of competition in the market for that product. Thus the lawfulness or otherwise of the use of the trademark depended on the necessity of the use to indicate the intended purpose of a product.\\n(2) The condition of 'honest use' constituted in substance the expression of a duty to act fairly in relation to the legitimate interests of the trade mark owner. The use of the trademark would not be in accordance with honest practices in industrial and commercial matters if for example it was done in such a manner as to give the impression that there was a commercial connection between the third party and the trademark owner or it affected the value of the trade mark by taking unfair advantage of its distinctive character or repute.\\n(3) The mere fact that third party used a trade mark of which it was not the owner in order to indicate the intended purpose of the product which it marketed did not necessarily mean that it was presenting it as being of the same quality as or having equivalent properties to those of the product bearing the trade mark. The relevant Article 6 is as under:\\nLimitation of the effects of a trade mark:\\n1. The trademark shall not entitle the proprietor to prohibit a third party from using, in the course of trade,....\\nc) the trade mark where it is necessary to indicate the intended purpose of a product or service in particular as accessories or spare parts:\\nprovided he uses them in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial matters....\\n36. The condition of honest use within the meaning of the aforesaid Article 6 (1) (c) of the Directive 89/104 was held to be in substance the expression of a duty to act fairly in relation to the legitimate interests of the trade mark owner. The use of the trademark was held not to be in accordance with honest practices in industrial and commercial matters inter alia the following situations:\\ni) It is done in such a manner as to give the impression that there is a commercial connection between the third party and the trade mark owner;\\nii) It affects the value of the trade mark by taking unfair advantage of its distinctive character or repute;\\niii) It entails the discrediting or denigration of that mark.\\n37. Learned Counsel for the parties have also referred to another judgment of the Chancery Division in Aktiebolaget Volvo and Anr. v. Heritage (Leicester)Limited; Fleet Street Reports (2000). In the said case, the plaintiff owned various registered trademarks including the word VOLVO. The defendant-company had been an authorized Volvo dealer and thus licensed to use the Volvo mark. The authorised dealership was revoked, but the defendant continued to use the word Volvo in a similar (but not identical) style to the registered mark, accompanied by the words 'independent' and 'specialist' appearing in much smaller lettering so that the signs read 'Independent Volvo Specialist'. The defendant used this wording on signs outside its garage, on an entrance sign, and on its letterhead. The defendant was also alleged to have used the word Volvo on a loyalty card and in the text of various letters sent by the defendant to its customers. The defense was that by virtue of its use of the words 'independent' and 'specialist' in its mark, the trademark was not identical. Alternatively, the plea advanced by the defendant was that it was the using the plaintiff's mark to indicate the kind of vehicle dealt with or the intended purpose of its services and thus ought to be exempted.\\n38. The para materia provisions under which such protection was sought under the Indian Act would be Sections 30(1)(b) and 30(2)(d) of the said Act. It was held that association of the words 'independent' and 'specialist' with the word Volvo did not render the defendant's mark non identical to the registered mark.\\n39. The aforesaid judgment was relied by the learned Counsel for the plaintiff to advance the plea that the same principle would apply to indication given by the defendant on its product 'Suitable for: Hawkins pressure cookers' as in the present case while learned Counsel for the defendant emphasized the factual matrix of that case whereby the defendant had past association with the plaintiff being the authorized dealer and was using the two words in very small alphabets with the emphasis being on the trademark VOLVO. In the present case, it was emphasized that the trademark of the defendant was being used prominently and the indication given was for the benefit of the customer.\\n40. Learned Counsel for the defendant thus drew the attention of this Court including the use of the stationery in the business of the defendant in Aktiebolaget Volvo and Anr. v. Heritage (Leicester)Limited's case (supra). The new letterhead mentioned other brands of the car. The lettering was in such a manner that above the word 'Volvo' in very small capital letters, the word 'Independent' was used and below the word 'Volvo' in slightly larger capital letters, but still much smaller than the letters used for the word Volvo, the word 'specialist' was used.\\n41. It has been held that the well settled principle is that the test of honesty for the purposes of proviso is the one that has to be judged by an objective standard and the appropriate question to be asked in relation to that test in the present case is whether a reasonable motor service provider would think the use complained of in the present case to be honest, or, rather in accordance with honest practices in that business.\\n42. Learned Counsel for the plaintiff sought to derive strength from these observations to contend that the defendant had to establish that the use of the word 'Hawkins' in such a manner was part of the trade practice which the defendant had failed to so establish.\\n43. In the facts of the case Rattee, J found that in order to constitute infringement what is necessary is the use of identical word in the course of trade as a distinctive word, whether with or without other words or material added to it. The test is of honest use in the commercial activity in which such trader is involved and thus all circumstances surrounding the use complained of and the context in which the use was made would be material.\\n44. The important facts taken note of by the learned Judge are as under:\\nIn my judgment the relevant context in the present case includes the following. The defendant had been an authorized Volvo dealer for a long time. Customers knew it as such and dealt with it as such. On the signs and the letter head complained of by the claimants the word Volvo appears in a colour very similar to that used by Volvo for its own logo. The word appears in letters using a very similar font, though without the serifs, as I have mentioned. The word appears on the signs and the letter head complained of immediately alongside or underneath the names of other makes of cars for which the defendant is and holds itself out as, an authorized dealer. The word Volvo appears in lettering of similar size to that used in the name of both other makes of car concerned. The word 'independent' and 'specialist' are printed in much smaller and less obvious form than the word Volvo so that on looking at the sign or the letter head the immediate impression is of the word Volvo although if one looks more closely certainly one can see the words 'Independent' and 'Specialist' above and below it.\\nCertain letters have been written in the past to customers of the defendant by the defendant to which I should refer as forming part of the relevant context in which I have to consider the honesty of the use complained of. The first of those letters was written before the defendant ceased to be an authorized Volvo dealer. It was dated November 27, 1996 and apparently is a circular letter sent out widely by the defendant to its customers. It includes the following. It is headed 'Exciting News' and then says:\\nAs a valued customer I am writing to inform you of two exciting developments at Heritage Leicester (that is the name of the defendant).\\nFirst I am proud to announce that the Heritage Leicester team has recently achieved accreditation for ISO9002 (BS5750). This reflects our commitment always to offer you a level of service second to none by continually improving the standards by which we operate our business on a day to day basis.\\nSecondly, at the end of this year we will become an Independent Volvo Specialist, a member of the new 'Association of Independent Volvo Specialists', a national organization of more than 30 members all of whom have spent many years within the Volvo franchise.\\nAs an Independent Volvo Specialist we will be able to provide you with an unrivalled service by offering you the full range of Volvo services from our fully trained Volvo staff utilizing our Volvo specialist equipment.\\nFurthermore we will be free to purchase on more competitive terms a wider range of Volvo cars and original equipment parts therefore providing you with greater choice and more competitive prices, making Volvo motoring more affordable.\\nWe will continue to offer for sale a wide range of new and used vehicles; all our used vehicles will continue to have comprehensive Mechanical Breakdown Insurance. Our After Sales Department will continue to sell genuine Volvo parts and accessories and to service, repair and MOT your car to main dealer standards. Our comprehensively equipped Body and Paint Centre will also remain available enabling us to meet all of your Volvo motoring needs.\\nWithin the next few weeks you will be receiving your personal Heritage Leicester Loyalty Card which will entitle you to discounts on our full range of Volvo services. In addition we will be offering monthly 'Special Offers' to all Loyalty Card Holders.\\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your past custom and look forward to your continued support in the future.\\nBe assured that our commitment to you, our valued Volvo customer, will be even stronger than ever.\\n45. The learned Judge recorded his conclusion as under:\\nIn my judgment the defendant's use of the word Volvo, comprising the registered trade mark of the claimants, in the context of its having previously for so long been an authorized dealer of Volvos, was calculated to cause at least confusion in the minds of customers, and probably, indeed, also the belief that there was still, to put it at its lowest, some trading connection between the defendant and Volvo. As I have said, I entirely reject the submission that the letter which I have read, which was written to customers in November 1996 could properly be said to have been calculated to convey the impending change of status to the recipient. Using the word Volvo in the manner and in the context which I have described in my judgment was so obviously likely to cause at least confusion in the minds of the customers of the defendant that no reasonable motor trader would say that such use constituted honest use in the course of the motor trading and servicing business. I do not overlook the fact that there is evidence that Volvo itself took steps in December 1996 to notify such Volvo owning customers of the defendant as the plaintiffs had records of the change of the defendant's status, but, in my judgment, that is quite immaterial in considering the honesty from the objective point of view of the defendant's conduct, not least when the letter which I have described, which was written in November 1996, was written before the defendant had any reason to believe that its customers would be more frankly and clearly notified of the impending change of status of Volvo itself.\\nThe conclusion which I have just expressed in my judgment is in no way inconsistent with the judgment of the European Court on which the defendant placed reliance, that is to say the judgment of the case of BMW v. Deenik Case C-63/97 in which the judgment of the European Court of Justice was given on February 23 of this year. The reference which I have to it is as having been reported in (1999) All E.R. (D.) 183. The situation before the Court in that case was in some ways not dissimilar from that in the present case, although in other ways very dissimilar, but it also concerned the question of whether a trader, not being an authorized dealer, in that case, in BMW motor cars was entitled to use the name BMW being a registered trade mark of the BMW manufacturing company in the context of holding itself out as having specialist expertise in servicing BMW cars. In its conclusion, paragraph 3, the Court said this: 'Articles 5 to 7 of First Directive 89/104..., and those, as I understand it, are Articles which were incorporated into the English 1994 Act in Sections 6, 10 and 11,\\n \\n\\n... do not entitle the proprietor of a trade mark to prohibit a third party from using the mark for the purpose of informing the public that he carries out the repair and maintenance of goods covered by that trade mark and put on the market under that mark by the proprietor or with his consent, or that he has specialized or is a specialist in the sale or the repair and maintenance of such goods....\\nand then come the important words for present purposes:\\n...unless the mark is used in a way that may create the impression that there is a commercial connection between the other undertaking and the trade mark proprietor, and in particular that the reseller's business is affiliated to the trade mark proprietor's distribution network or that there is a special relationship between the two undertakings.\\nIn my judgment the proviso expressed in that paragraph of the European Court of Justice's judgment in the BMW case reflects the honest proviso as I may call it, to Section 11(2) of the Trade Marks Act, 1994, in the context of a case such as that which was before the European Court and that which is before me.\\n46. The learned Judge thus found that the use was not in accordance with the honest practices in industrial or commercial matters.\\n47. Learned Counsel for the plaintiff also referred to the judgment of the Supreme Court in Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma v. Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories 1965 SCR 737 where in para 28 it was observed as under:\\nIn an action for infringement, the plaintiff must, no doubt, make out that the use of the defendant's mark is likely to deceive, but where the similarity between the plaintiff's and the defendant's mark is so close either visually, phonetically or otherwise and the court reaches the conclusion that there is an imitation, no further evidence is required to establish that the plaintiff's rights are violated. Expressed in another way, if the essential features of the trademark of the plaintiff have been adopted by the defendant, the fact that the get-up, packing and other writing or marks on the goods or on the packets in which he offers his goods for sale show marked differences, or indicate clearly a trade origin different from that of the registered proprietor of the mark would be immaterial; whereas in the case of passing off, the defendant may escape liability if he can show that the added matter is sufficient to distinguish his goods form those of the plaintiff.\\nWhen once the use by the defendant of the mark which is claimed to infringe the plaintiff's mark is shown to be 'in the course of trade', the question whether there has been an infringement is to be decided by the comparison of the two mark.\\n48. A careful consideration of the aforesaid judgments and the pleas advanced by learned Counsel for the parties shows that the complete emphasis of the plaintiff is on the fact that it owns the registered trademark HAWKINS and thus has a statutory right to exclusive use in relation to its pressure cookers and spare parts including gaskets. Thus the use of any identical or deceptively similar trademark by any unauthorized person in relation to goods including gaskets amounts to an infringement under Section 29 of the said Act irrespective of any addition either preceding or succeeding it. Thus the added matter to the trademark by the defendant is pleaded to be irrelevant for the purposes of infringement. It is, however, not disputed that there is an exception to the same as envisaged under Section 30 of the said Act but the onus is on the defendant to prove that it falls within the exception so envisaged.\\n49. It is thus the plea of the plaintiff that in order for the defendant to seek protection under Section 30 of the said Act, it must be proved that a)Use of the trademark Hawkins by the defendant is reasonably necessary to indicate that the gaskets are so adapted; b) Neither the purpose nor the effect of such indication is to show a connection in the course of trade between the goods of the defendant and those of the plaintiff, c) Use of the trademark by the defendant is in accordance with an honest practice in industrial or commercial matters and d) it is not an endeavor on the part of the defendant to take unfair advantage of the mark of the plaintiff or is detrimental to the repute of the mark of the plaintiff.\\n50. Learned Counsel for the plaintiff thus contended that the only honest use of the trademark is in respect of distinction between pressure cookers with outside fitting lid and pressure cookers with inside fitting lid and a number of pressure cookers under different trademarks are sold which are all similar to the lid of Hawkins pressure cookers. Thus the user of only name of 'Hawkins' to show suitability of the product is stated to be not an honest business practice but an endeavor to encash on the goodwill and reputation of the brand of HAWKINS.\\n51. Learned Counsel for the defendant has, however, pleaded that the defendant is manufacturing the gasket under the registered trademark MAYUR with the device of PEACOCK and has large and extensive sale because of its product's good quality, good market and sales promotion. Thus there was no occasion for the defendant to infringe the trademark of the plaintiff. The defendant's line of business is one of ancillary nature and the indication given on the packaging is an essential information to the customers so that they can select an accessory of a particular specification which is suitable for the main article. The expression ' suitable for HAWKINS pressure cookers' is thus said to fall within the exception of Section 30(2)(d) of the said Act. The indication is stated to be only to show compatibility of the product of the defendant with that of the plaintiff. The filing of the suit is alleged to be motivated by the oblique object of the plaintiff to have monopoly in the market of spare parts/accessories for its pressure cookers including gaskets and the garb of infringement of its trademark is being used for the said purpose.\\n52. In order to further substantiate its plea, learned Counsel for the defendant has referred to the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, Second Circuit in the matter of The Electric Auto-Lite Company v. P and D Manufacturing Co. Inc. reported as (44 USPQ 377 (2nd Circuit 1940). The case related to alleged infringement of patent and it was held that replacement of new for worn out parts in devices sold by the plaintiff would not amount to infringement of the patent of the plaintiff although part replaced includes portion not worn out where it would cost more to replace the worn out part alone. The plaintiff with a third party and other manufacturers published a joint catalogue in which appeared side by side the service parts of both the companies. The sale of the parts by such third party jointly advertised in this way was held not to be infringement of the plaintiff's patent of machine and that the defendant could not be contributory infringer by sale of parts by such third parties to the users.\\n53. Further in Taylor Instrument Companies v. Fawley-Brost Company 59 USPQ 384 (7th Circuit 1943) it was held that having the right to make and sell chart designed to fit plaintiff's (Taylor)machine and the advertisement thereof does not support the conclusion of infringement of the trademark and the machine of the plaintiff. It was held that the defendant can advise public on price card ( carrying prominently defendant's name) bearing 'TAY', that it has for sale 'Chart to fit' such machine sold under the trademark 'Taylor'.\\n54. I have given deep thoughts to the submissions of learned Counsel for the parties conscious of the fact that insofar as the Indian Courts are concerned, it is an unchartered area. However, the observations and views expressed in Aktiebolaget Volvo and Anr. v. Heritage (Leicester)Limited's Case (supra) and Gillette Co. v. LA-Laboratories Ltd's Case (supra) have material bearing in view of the provisions of the said Act which are similar in nature and intent. (55)A reading of Section 29 of the said Act shows that the use of a registered trade mark by a third party in the course of trade or user of a deceptively or identical trademark is not permissible when it renders the use of the mark likely to be taken as being used as a trademark. The provision of the said Act would work in the following manner:\\n(1) The first party has to be owner of the registered trademark;\\n(2) The second party uses the mark in the course of trade which is identical with or deceptively similar to trademark in relation to goods and services in respect of which the trademark is registered;\\n(3) The use is in such a manner as to render the use of the trademark by the second party likely to be taken as being used as a trademark.\\n56. If the provision is read in the aforesaid manner, the interpretation put forth by the learned Counsel for the defendant has to be accepted that though the expression used is a mark insofar as the second party is concerned, in order to constitute an infringement the use of the said mark should be such as to lead to deception of it being taken to be used as a trademark.\\n57. The second aspect is the wording of Section 29 to the effect 'use of the mark likely to be taken as being used as a trade mark'. Thus the deception should be such that the purchasing public would assume that the mark is indicative of the same being a trademark of the first party.\\n58. The exception to the aforesaid is provided in Section 30 of the said Act. Section 30(1) of the said Act stipulates that use of a registered trade mark is not prevented if the purpose is of identifying goods or services as that of the proprietor and such use should be: a) in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial matters and is not such as to take unfair advantage of or be detrimental to the distinctive character or repute of the trade mark. Section 30(2)(a) of the said Act provides an exception where the user is in relation to goods or services inter alia for its intended purpose. Another exception is Section 30(2)(d) of the said Act which permits the use of a trade mark where it is accessory to other goods or services to which the trademark has been used without infringement of the right given by registration if such use is reasonably necessary in order to indicate that the goods or services are so adapted and the purpose and the effect of the use should not be to indicate a connection in the course of trade between any person and the goods or services.\\n59. It is the aforesaid principles which have been kept in mind by the Chancery Division in Aktiebolaget Volvo and Anr. v. Heritage (Leicester) Limited's case (supra) and the Court Justice of the European Communities (Third Chamber) in Gillette Co. v. LA-Laboratories Ltd's case (supra).\\n60. It is trite to say that a judgment is as good as its facts. The facts of the Aktiebolaget Volvo and Anr. v. Heritage (Leicester)Limited's case (supra) stare one in the face. There was a past association between the plaintiff and the defendant as the defendant was an authorized Volvo dealer. Such dealership was revoked. It is thereafter the defendant started to use the work VOLVO in a similar style to the registered trademark accompanied by the prefix 'independent' and the suffix 'specialist' but both in much smaller lettering. Not only that, past customers of Volvo were also said to be informed accordingly. The object and intent of the defendant was clear that it wanted to indicate a connection with VOLVO and such user could hardly be called as an honest practice in industrial and commercial use. It squarely fell within the parameters of the defendant trying to take unfair advantage of the distinctive character and repute of the trademark VOLVO. Thus the mere use of suffix or prefix would not make any difference. It is in view thereof that the learned Judge had observed that the test of honesty for the purposes of infringement has to be judged by an objective standard and in the given facts of the case, the test would be whether a reasonable motor service provider would think that the use complained of is honest or amounts to an honest practice.\\n61. If the aforesaid test is applied to the facts of the present case, it is found that the defendant has its own well established trademark MAYUR and the device of PEACOCK. The defendant has prominently displayed both the trademark and the device on the packaging. The trademark MAYUR has been put prominently in red on the green coloured packaging, both in the front and the back. At the back of the packaging of the defendant's product, there is a sticker prominently displaying that the product is manufactured and marketed by Murugan Enterprises.\\nIn the front of the packaging of the defendant's product, in a small print, it is written 'Suitable for: Hawkins Pressure Cookers'. The front and back of the packaging of the product of the defendant are being re-produced herein to fully appreciate the visual impact of the packaging.\\n62. The aforesaid in my considered view leaves no manner of doubt that no reasonable person or purchaser can ever assume a trade connection between MAYUR brand of gaskets and Hawkins. It is not a case where the defendant is seeking to take advantage of the trademark of the plaintiff or seeking to show any connection therewith. The approach which is apparent from the manner of use of this is only to show the suitability of the product as an ancillary one to be used in the Hawkins pressure cookers. Such a use thus would clearly fall within the exception carved out under Section 30 of the said Act. Further the evidence placed on record shows that the object of use of the trademark is reasonably necessary to indicate the fitness of gasket for the HAWKINS brand of pressure cookers.\\n63. The conclusion in Gillette Co. v. LA-Laboratories Ltd's case (supra) is predicated on a packaging, which would create a link in the mind of the consumers between the defendant's products and those of the plaintiff's or at least to give an impression that the defendant was authorised by virtue of a license or for some other reason to use GILLETTE and SENSOR marks. As discussed above, this was not so in the present case. In fact, the trademark of the defendant is what is prominently displayed. The present case is, thus, one where the condition of 'honest use' is satisfied, since one cannot decipher a commercial connection between the plaintiff and the defendant by use of the word HAWKINS by the defendant. It is, thus, not a case where there is dilution of the value of the trademark of the plaintiff by unfair advantage being taken of its distinctive character or repute by the defendant. The use is more in the nature of the intending purpose of the product marketed by the defendant.\\n64. There is also force in the contention of the learned Counsel for the defendant that the concept of pressure cookers with inside fitting lid and pressure cookers with outside fitting lid and there being two kinds of gaskets was not even forming part of the pleadings and the case set up is thus clearly an afterthought when the affidavits of evidence were being filed. The affidavits of evidence in this behalf, in fact, for the first time, set out this plea of pressure cookers with an outside fitting lid and inside fitting lid seeking to categorize them as such. The plaintiff has no objection if the defendant indicates the fitness of the gasket for the complete line of pressure cookers with inside fitting lid categories like Hawkins but objects to the use of Hawkins alone. The defendant in the affidavit has emphasized that the gaskets manufactured by them are specifically made for them to be fitted in the Hawkins pressure cookers. The plaintiff also manufactures all kinds of ancillary products including gaskets. The object of filing of the suit thus appears to be to create a monopoly over such ancillary items so that no third party is able to sell the same in the market. This course of action is not permissible as it is really not in dispute that the defendant can carry out an ancillary industry of manufacturing such gaskets.\\n65. I am thus of the considered view that the issue has to be answered against the plaintiff as the defendant is not using the trademark Hawkins.\\nIssue No. 3:\\nIf issue No. 2 is answered in favor of the plaintiff : Whether the defendant is infringing the trademark 'Hawkins' of the plaintiff? OPP (66)This issue is predicated on a finding to be arrived on the previous issue and only if the defendant is using the mark Hawkins as a trademark, the question would arise whether the defendant is infringing the trademark. Since the use of the defendant is only indicative of its purpose and is not being used as a trademark, there can be no question of the defendant infringing the trademark of the plaintiff. The issue is accordingly answered against the plaintiff.\\nIssue No. 4:\\nIf issue No. 2 is answered in favor of the plaintiff : Whether the defendant is passing of its goods as that of the plaintiff? OPP\\n \\n\\n67. Once again the defendant passing off its goods as that of the plaintiff would not arise in the present case in view of the fact that the defendant is not using the trademark of the plaintiff nor is it infringing the trademark. The mode and manner of use shows only the purpose of user and there is no indication of any business connections between the two. The prominent display of the own trademark of the defendant along with prominent display of the address of its manufacturers as against the same is indication of the suitability of the gaskets for Hawkins pressure cookers and leaves no manner of doubt that the present case is not one of passing off by the defendant of its goods as that of the plaintiff.\\n68. The issue is answered against the plaintiff.\\nIssue No. 5:\\nWhether the plaintiff is entitled to damages/rendition of accounts? If so, the extent and period thereof? OPP\\n \\n\\n69. Learned Counsel for the plaintiff sought damages and in that behalf had referred to the judgments of this Court in Times Incorporated v. Lokesh Srivastava and Anr. 2005 (30) PTC 3 (Delhi) and Hero Honda Motors Ltd. v. Shree Assuramji Scooters 2006 (32) PTC 117 (Delhi). However, the question of damages would arise if there is any infringement by the defendant and thus it is not necessary to go into the aspect of quantification of damages since there is no infringement by the defendant. The evidence filed by the plaintiff also does not establish any case for any damages other than the plea of general damages which may be awarded in case of infringement of trademark of copyright.\\n70. Issue is answered against the plaintiff.\\nIssue No. 6:\\nRelief.\\n71. In view of the findings arrived at, the suit of the plaintiff is without any merit and the same is dismissed with costs.\\n72. The decree sheet be drawn up accordingly.\\n73. Interim Orders stand vacated. \\n\"}}]}}"
