ACT:
Code  of Criminal Procedure (Act 5 of 1898),  s.  195(1)(b)-
Complaint  to  Magistrate of offence under  s.	211,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1">  Indian
Penal Code</a>-Cognizance, when barred.



HEADNOTE:
The  appellant lodged a report with the police charging	 the
respondent with certain cognizable offences on 10th December
1958.  While the police were investigating into the  'report
the respondent filed a complaint in the Magistrate Is Court,
on 11th April 1959 alleging that the appellant had committed
an  offence  under <a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_2"> s. 211</a>,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3"> Indian Penal  Code</a>,	 by  falsely
charging  the respondent with having committed	an  offence.
The Magistrate took cognizance of the respondent's complaint
under<a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_4"> s. 190</a> Criminal Procedure Code.  At that stage., there
were  no  proceedings  in any court nor	 any  order  by	 any
Magistrate  for arrest, remand or bail of the respondent  in
connection with the appellants report to the police.  Later,
on  18th  July 1959 the police arrested	 the  respondent  in
connection  with the appellant's report and filed  a  charge
sheet  against	him,  but  the case ended  in  an  order  of
discharge.    Thereafter,  the	appellant  applied  to	 the
Magistrate's  court  praying  that the court  may  not	take
cognizance  of	the  complaint to the  court  filed  by	 the
respondent  against  the  appellant,  on  the  ground  that,
cognizance  of an offence under<a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_5"> s. 211</a> I.P.C. could  not  be
taken  in view of the provisions contained in <a href="/doc/14134/" id="a_6"> s.  195(1)(b)</a>
Cr.P.C. The magistrate rejected the contention and the order
was confirmed by The session court and the high Court.
In appeal to this Court,
HELD:  The complaint filed by the respondent  was  competent
and the Magistrate was not barred from taking cognizance  of
it  by	the provisions of<a href="/doc/388888/" id="a_7"> s. 195</a> ( 1) (b) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_8">Cr.P.C</a>.;  and,  in
taking	cognizance  of	it he  only  exercised	jurisdiction
rightly vested in him. [542 A-B]
(i)  When  a Magistrate is taking cognizance  under <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_9"> s.	 190</a>
Cr.P.C.	 he must examine the facts of the  complaint  before
him  and  determine whether his power of  taking  cognizance
under  the section has or has not been taken away  under <a href="/doc/862299/" id="a_10"> S.
195(1)</a>	Cr.P.C.	 , In the case of an offence  under <a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_11"> s.	 211</a>
I.P.C.,<a href="/doc/14134/" id="a_12"> s. 195(1)(b)</a>, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_13">Cr.P.C</a>., provides that no court  shall
take  cognizance of it when such offence is alleged to	have
been committed in, or in relation to, any proceeding in	 any
court,	except on the complaint in writing of such court  or
of  some  other court to which such  court  is	subordinate.
That is,<a href="/doc/862299/" id="a_14"> s. 195(1)</a>(b ) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_15">Cr.P.C</a>. bars taking cognizance if all
the  following	circumstances exist, namely,  (i)  that	 the
offence in respect of which the case is brought falls  under
s.  211 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_16">I.P.C</a>. (ii) that there -should be a proceeding in  a
court,	and  (iii) that the allegation should  be  that	 the
offence under<a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_17"> s. 211</a> I.P.C. was committed in, or in relation
to  such a proceeding.	When examining the question  whether
there  is any proceeding in any court, three situations	 can
be envisaged:(a) There may be no proceeding in any court at
all;  (b)  a.proceeding in a court may actually	 be  pending
when  cognizance  is  taken of the  offence  under  S-.	 211
<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_18">I.P.C</a>., and (c) though there may be no proceeding pending in
a court, there may have been a proceeding which had  already
concluded and the offence under<a href="/doc/35598/" id="a_19"> s. 211</a> may
521
be  alleged  to have been committed in, or in  relation	 to,
that  proceeding.  In cases (b) and (c), the bar  to  taking
cognizance  under <a href="/doc/862299/" id="a_20"> s.  195(1)</a> (b) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_21">Cr.P.C</a>.  would  come	into
operation.  In case (a), when there is no proceeding pending
in any court at all at the time when the applicability of<a href="/doc/862299/" id="a_22"> S.
195(1)</a> (b), <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_23">Cr.P.C</a>. has to be determined, nor has there been
any  earlier proceeding which may have been concluded..	 the
sub-,section  would  not  apply, and in	 such  a  case,	 the
Magistrate  would  be competent to take	 cognizance  of	 the
offence under<a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_24"> s. 211</a> I.P.C., if his jurisdiction is  invoked
in  the	 manner laid down in<a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_25"> s. 190</a>  of	 Criminal  Procedure
Code. [526 F-G; 527 B, G-H, 528 E-F; 529 C-E, G-H]
Caselaw considered.
(ii)There  is nothing in the language of the sub-section  to
indicate that theLegislature also intended to lay down	this
bar if a proceeding in	 court was still under contemplation
and if and when the proceeding is taken it may be found that
the  offence  alleged to have been committed was,  in  fact,
committed in or in relation to, that proceeding.  The Magis-
trate  could not be expected to come to a  decision  whether
any  such proceeding in any court was  under  contemplation,
and   any  interpretation  of  law  which  will	  make	 its
applicability dependent on a future decision to be taken  by
some  person and thus introduce an element  of	uncertainty,
should be avoided. [530 B-F]
(iii)At	 the  stage  when the complaint	 was  filed  by	 the
respondent  against the appellant the police were  inquiring
into  the appellant's report.  In such a case, there may  be
no  justification for the police to bring a charge of  false
information  being  given  to them  until  investigation  is
,completed.  Similarly, a Magistrate has-no jurisdiction  to
order  a prosecution for making a false complaint, till	 the
complaint  was	dismissed.   But  there	 is  no	 requirement
anywhere in law that the person affected by the false charge
could  not file his complaint in court until the police	 had
decided that the charge is false. [534 F-H; 535 A-B]
Queen  v. Subanna Goundan, (1862-63) 1 M.H.C.R. 30 and	Gati
Mandal v. Emperor, 27 Cr.  L.J. 1105, referred to.
(iv)  The  mere	 fact that, on a report being  made  to	 the
police	of a cognizable offence, the proceeding must,  at  a
latter	stage., end in a judicial order by  the	 Magistrate,
cannot, stand in the way of a private complaint being  filed
and  of	 cognizance being taken by the court on	 its  basis.
The  scheme of the provisions relating to  investigation  in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_26">
the   Criminal	Procedure  Code</a>,  requires  that  upon	 the
completion  of investigation, the investigating officer	 has
to  submit  a report to the Magistrate under  s.173  <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_27">Cr.P.C</a>.
furnishing various details and stating whether it appears to
him  there  is or is not sufficient evidence  or  reasonable
ground	for placthe accused on trial.  At that	stage  there
may  be	 an intervention by ire Magistrate in  his  judicial
capacity.   But until some occasion arises for a  Magistrate
to  make  a judicial order in connection with  the  investi.
gation	of a cognizable offence by the police,	no  question
can  arise  of the Magistrate having the power of  filing  a
complaint under<a href="/doc/14134/" id="a_28"> s. 195(1)(b)</a> Cr.P.C. [540 DI.  G-H; 541 B-C]
(v)  It is not correct to say that<a href="/doc/621703/" id="a_29"> s. 195</a> Cr.P.C. lays	down
that the offence&amp; therein referred to shall not be deemed to
be  any	 offences  at all, except on the  complaint  of	 the
persons	 or  the courts therein specified.   An	 offence  is
constituted  as	 soon as it is found that  the	facts  which
constitute  the	 offence have been committed by	 the  person
-accused  of the offence, and it remains an offence  whether
it is triable by a court or not. [535 G-H]
Observations contra in <a href="/doc/639309/" id="a_30">Fakir Mohamed v. Emperor</a>, A.I.R. 1927
Sind 10 overruled.
522
(vi)  It was not necessary that the proceeding taken by	 the
police	should terminate before the court could	 competently
take  cognizance  of the complaint filed by  the  respondent
against the appellant. [537 H]
(vii) In the case of<a href="/doc/14134/" id="a_31"> s. 195(1)(b)</a> there is a limitation that
private	 prosecutions  are  barred  only  if  the   offences
mentioned  in  that sub-section were alleged  to  have	been
committed in, or in relation to any proceeding in any court.
If  the offence was not committed,, in, or in  relation	 to,
any  proceeding	 in  any  court,  a  private  complaint	  is
permissible. [537 D-E]
Ramaswami  Iyengar v. Panduranga Mudaliar, A.I.R. 1938	Mad.
173, referred to.
(viii)	It  is true that if a private person is	 allowed  to
file  a complaint that the report to the police against	 him
is  false before investigation is corn leted, and the  court
takes  cognizance of it, there may be two trials, in one  of
which person accused of an offence may be under trial, while
in  the other, the person who complained to the	 police	 may
appear as a person accused of an offence under<a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_32"> s. 211</a> I.P.C.
But, there is no difficulty in dealing with such a  possible
anomalous  situation, by trying both cases together  or	 one
after the other. [541 C-F]

</p><p id="p_6">The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
Bhargava, J. This appeal filed under certificate granted  by
the  High  Court at Allahabad is directed against  an  order
passed	by that Court dismissing a revision  application  by
which the appellant, M. L. Sethi, desired the vacation of an
order  passed by the Sessions Judge of Saharanpur  upholding
two orders of the Additional District Magistrate (Judicial),
Saharanpur,  dated 6th August, 1963 and 5th  October,  1963.
By  these orders, the Magistrate dismissed two	applications
presented  by  the  appellant  for  dismissing	a  complaint
pending before him for commission of offences under <a href="/doc/1052367/" id="a_33">sections
21</a>  <a href="/doc/1873250/" id="a_34">1</a>,	<a href="/doc/1905618/" id="a_35">204</a>  and <a href="/doc/752609/" id="a_36">385</a> of the Indian Penal  Code.	  A  further
prayer	was  made  for an order by this	 Court	qushing	 the
proceedings pending in the Court of that Magistrate.
The  facts necessary for deciding this appeal may be  stated
briefly. on December 10, 1958, the appellant lodged a report
with  the  Inspector-General of Police,	 Chandigarh  against
R.P. Kapur (hereinafter referred to as "the respondent") and
his mother-in-law charging them with commission of  offences
punishable under <a href="/doc/1099980/" id="a_37">sections 420</a>, <a href="/doc/11461/" id="a_38">109</a>, <a href="/doc/989759/" id="a_39">114</a> and <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_40">120-B</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_41">I.P.C</a>. It
does not appear to be necessary
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">523</span>
to give the details of the allegations made in that  report.
The charge in that First Information Report was based on the
allegation  that  the respondent and his  mother-in-law,  by
conspiring together, cheated the appellant and his wife of a
sum  of Rs. 20,000/- by persuading the appellant to  take  a
sale-deed of some land on certain false representations	 and
on suppression of facts indicating that on the date when the
sale-deed by the respondent's mother-in-law was executed  in
favour of the wife of the appellant, the title of the former
had already been extinguished, as the land had been acquired
by  the	 Government  under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_42">Land  Acquisition  Act</a>.	 The
offence	  was  registered  as  a  cognizable   offence	 and
investigation was started.
</p><p id="p_7">On  April 11, 1959, the respondent filed a complaint in	 the
Court  of  Judicial  Magistrate,'  1st	Class,	 Chandigarh,
against	 the  appellant	 for commission	 of  offences  under
<a href="/doc/1905618/" id="a_43">sections  204</a>,	<a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_44">211</a> and <a href="/doc/752609/" id="a_45">385</a> I.P.C. In  this  complaint,	 the
respondent alleged that the land was sold by his  mother-in-
law to the appellant's wife as a favour to the appellant and
that at that time, no misrepresentations at all were made in
respect of any facts. The complaint added that the appellant
was  fully  aware of the land acquisition  proceedings;	 but
because	 of  fixation  of low rate of  compensation  in	 the
acquisition  proceedings,the  appellant suffered a  loss  of
nearly	Rs. 13,000/-. The appellant,being a clever  criminal
lawyer,	  went	to  the	 respondent's  mother-in-law,	Smt.
Kaushaliya  Devi, and demanded the sum of  Rs.	13,000/-,and
when  she refused, he threatened her with dire	consequences
of   criminal  proceedings against her and  her	 son-in-law,
the respondent.A similar threat of criminal proceedings	 was
also later given to the respondent himself by the appellant;
and thereafter, the First Information Report was lodged with
the Inspector-General of Police by the appellant on December
10,  1958. The charge in the complaint further was that	 the
allegations  made  in the First Information  Report  by	 the
appellant  were false to his knowledge and were contradicted
by   the  appellant's  own  letters,  writings	 and   other
correspondence.It  was also stated that the false report  to
the  police  was made with the knowledge  and  intention  of
putting	 the respondent in fear of ,injury to his fair	name
and  reputation	 in service and otherwise and of  being	 put
under arrest and harassment in a criminal trial and  thereby
to   induce  him  to  deliver to the appellant Rs.  13,000/-
and  submit to other terms that the appellant may choose  to
impose.	 The  last  allegation was that	 the  appellant	 was
guilty	of the offence under<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_46"> s. 204</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_47">I.P.C</a>.,  for  secreting
five  documents which were enumerated in the complaint,	 and
this offence was alleged to have been committed, because  if
these documents had been presented in time, the Police would
not have entertained the complaint which led to a  harassing
investigation against the respondent.
</p><p id="p_8">This   complaint  filed	 by  the  respondent   against	 the
appellant,as  well  as	the proceedings	 instituted  by	 the
Police on the basis of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">524</span>
First  Information Report were transferred under the  orders
of  this  Court	 to the Court  of  the	Additional  District
Magistrate, Saharanpur.	 The case against the respondent and
his  mother-in-law  based on the  First	 Information  Report
ended  in an order of discharge passed by the High Court  of
Allahabad  on  December	 10, 1962, when	 the  charge  framed
against	 the respondent and his mother-in-law by the  trying
Magistrate was quashed.	 On the record, the material availa-
ble  relating to the proceedings based on the  F.I.R.  dated
December  10, 1958, is that it was on July 18, 1959 for	 the
first  time that the respondent was arrested  in  connection
with that report and the challan by the Police for trial  of
the respondent was presented to the Court on July 25,  1959.
There is no material to show that between December 10' 1958,
when  the First Information Report was lodged, and July	 18,
1959 when the respondent was arrested in connection with it,
there was, at any stage, any order passed by any  Magistrate
in connection with the investigation that was going on.
As  we	have  mentioned earlier, the  revisions	 before	 the
Sessions Judge, and the High Court, arose out of two  orders
made  by  the Additional District Magistrate  on  August  6,
1963,  and October 5, 1963.  The first order was made on  an
application  presented	by the appellant on May 6,  1963  in
which  he  contended that no offence was  disclosed  on	 the
allegations  made in the complaint and on the  statement  of
the  complainant recorded by the Magistrate  at	 Chandigarh,
and,  further,	that, in any case, the trial was  barred  on
account	 of want of requisite previous sanction as  provided
in <a href="/doc/621703/" id="a_48"> S. 195</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure.  It  was	also
alleged that the facts were so inter-mixed that the trial of
any  other offence separate from the offence under <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_49"> S.	211</a>,
<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_50">I.P.C</a>.,	 was  not  permissible	or  possible,  so  that	 the
Magistrate  was requested not to proceed with the trial	 and
to  withdraw the order summoning the appellant; and  in	 the
alternative,  the  prayer  was that  the  appellant  may  be
discharged  under<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_51"> S. 253</a>, Cr.  P.C., as the  charge  against
him was groundless.
</p><p id="p_9">The second order of the Magistrate dated 5th October,  1963,
was passed on the application of the appellant dated  August
12, 1963, in which it was prayed that the Court may not take
cognizance  ,of the complaint as instituted, and  the  trial
under <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_52"> S.  252</a>, Cr.  P.C. may not proceed.  The	 prayer	 was
again  based  on the ground that cognizance of	the  offence
under <a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_53"> S.  21</a> <a href="/doc/976663/" id="a_54">1</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_55">I.P.C</a>. could not be taken in  view  of	 the
provisions of<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_56"> S. 195(1)(a)</a> &amp; (b), Cr.  P.C., under which the
,Court	was empowered to proceed in respect of that  offence
only when there was a complaint, in writing by the authority
concerned.   The Additional District Magistrate by  his	 two
orders,	 rejected  the contention that<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_57"> s.  195</a>,	 Cr.   P.C.,
barred	this  particular  complaint  which  had	 been  filed
against the appellant.	The main ground for these orders was
that  no  proceedings  were pending in any  Court  when	 the
complaint against the appellant was filed in the Court of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">525</span>
the Magistrate at Chandigarh for the offences under <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_58">sections
204</a>,  <a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_59">21</a>  <a href="/doc/976663/" id="a_60">1</a>, and <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_61">385</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_62">I.P.C</a>. and consequently,<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_63"> s.  195</a>,	 Cr.
P.C.,  was  inapplicable.   That is the view  of  the  Addl.
District  Magistrate  which  has been  upheld  both  by	 the
Sessions  Judge	 and the High Court; and  consequently,	 the
appellant has now come up to this Court in this appeal.
On behalf of the appellant, the first submission made by his
counsel, Mr. Frank Anthony, Was that the making of a  report
of a cognizable offence with the police is both	 institution
of  a criminal proceeding as well as charging a person	with
having committed an offence, so that, in this case, when the
appellant  lodged his First Information Report	on  December
10,  1958, with the InspectorGeneral of Police, it  must  be
held  that he had instituted a criminal	 proceeding  against
the  respondent, as well as he had charged him	with  having
committed  the offences mentioned in that report within	 the
meaning	 of<a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_64"> s. 21</a> <a href="/doc/976663/" id="a_65">1</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_66">I.P.C</a>. In support of this	proposition,
learned	 counsel  relied  on a Full Bench  decision  of	 the
Calcutta High Court in <a href="/doc/5651/" id="a_67">Karim Buksh v. The  Queen-Empress</a>(1),
and a Full Bench decision of the Kerala High Court in Albert
v.  State  of Kerala and Another.(2) It was urged  that,  on
this  interpretation, when the respondent filed a  complaint
against	 the appellant under<a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_68"> s. 21</a> <a href="/doc/976663/" id="a_69">1</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_70">I.P.C</a>., together	with
other offences, the provisions of<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_71"> s. 195</a>, Cr.  P.C.,  became
attracted.  It appears to us that in this case it is not  at
all  necessary to go into the question whether,	 whenever  a
complaint of a cognizaable offence is filed, it must be held
that  the  complainant	is  instituting	 or  causing  to  be
instituted a criminal proceeding, or is merely charging	 the
person	named  in  the	report	with  having  committed	 the
offences  mentioned therein, because, during the  course  of
argument  in  the appeal before us, no	contention  was	 put
forward	 that no offence under<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_72"> s. 211</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_73">I.P.C</a>., was made	 out
and  that  the	complaint  of  the  respondent	against	 the
appellant  was	wrongly	 being treated as in  respect  of  a
charge under<a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_74"> s. 21</a> <a href="/doc/976663/" id="a_75">1</a>. Up to the stage of the revision before
the  High  Court,  some attempt was made on  behalf  of	 the
appellant to plead that the facts alleged by the  respondent
in his complaint to the Court did not constitute an  offence
under <a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_76"> s. 21</a> <a href="/doc/976663/" id="a_77">1</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_78">I.P.C</a>. committed by the appellant;  but,  in
this  Court,  Mr. Frank Anthony on behalf of  the  appellant
gave up this plea and, in fact, proceeded to urge before  us
that  the complaint of the respondent against the  appellant
did  specifically  include  in it a charge under <a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_79"> s.  21</a>  <a href="/doc/976663/" id="a_80">1</a>,
<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_81">I.P.C</a>. On behalf of the respondent and the State  Government
also there was no suggestion that the complaint against	 the
appellant  was not in respect of the offence under<a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_82"> s. 21</a>  <a href="/doc/976663/" id="a_83">1</a>,
I.P.  C. It is consequently unnecessary at this stage to  go
into the question whether the facts given in the  complaint,
or the facts which may ultimately be found proved after	 the
trial,	do  or do not constitute an offence under<a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_84"> s.  21</a>  <a href="/doc/976663/" id="a_85">1</a>,

<p id="p_11">appellant  had instituted a criminal proceeding against	 the
respondent or had only charged him with having committed the
offences mentioned in his report.  That is a point which may
have  to  be decided at the conclusion of the trial  of	 the
appellant; and consequently, we refrain from going into this
question at this stage.
</p><p id="p_12">The only point that falls for determination by this Court is
whether,  in this case, cognizance of the_ complaint,  which
included  an  offence under<a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_87"> s. 21</a> <a href="/doc/976663/" id="a_88">1</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_89">I.P.C</a>.,  filed  by	 the
respondent  against  the appellant, was rightly	 or  wrongly
taken  by the Courts.  The complaint, as we  have  mentioned
earlier,  was  filed by the respondent in the Court  of	 the
Judicial Magistrate at Chandigarh on April 11, 1959, and  on
the  same day, cognizance of the offence was taken  by	that
Magistrate  under <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_90"> s.  190</a>,  Cr.   P.C.,  where	 after	that
Magistrate   proceeded	to  record  the	 statement  of	 the
respondent  under<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_91"> s. 200</a>, Cr.  P.C. Before  this  cognizance
was  taken,  the  appellant had	 already  lodged  his  first
Information   Report   against	the  respondent	  with	 the
Inspector-General  of  Police  on  December  10,  1958.	  In
connection  with  that report, investigation by	 the  Police
must have been going on, though none of the judgments of the
lower Courts mentioned what particular steps had been  taken
in that investigation up to the 11th April, 1959, when	this
complaint was filed by the respondent against the appellant.
The facts found only mentioned that in connection with	that
First  Information Report of the appellant,  the  respondent
was arrested on July 18, 1959, and subsequently, the charge-
sheet  was  submitted  by the Police to	 the  Court  of	 the
Magistrate on July 25, 1959.  This arrest and submission  of
the  charge-sheet were both subsequent to the filing of	 the
complaint  by  the respondent.	In these  circumstances,  we
have  to  examine whether the Magistrate at  Chandigarh	 was
competent to take cognizance of this complaint on April	 11,
1959,  in  view of the provisions of<a href="/doc/621703/" id="a_92"> s. 195</a> of the  Code  of
Criminal Procedure.
</p><p id="p_13">In  dealing with this question of law, the important  aspect
that  has ,to be kept in view is that the point of  time  at
which the legality of the cognizance taken has to be  judged
is the time when cognizance is actually taken under<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_93"> S.	190</a>,
Cr.  P.C.<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_94"> Under the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure which applies
to  trials  of	such cases, the only  provision	 for  taking
cognizance  is	contained  in<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_95"> s. 190</a>.	<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_96">Section	 195</a>,  which
follows	 that  section,	 is, in fact, a	 limitation  on	 the
unfettered  power of a Magistrate to take  cognizance  under
s.190.	Under the latter section cognizance of	any  offence
can   be  taken	 by  any  Presidency  Magistrate,   District
Magistrate  or	Sub-Divisional	Magistrate,  and  any  other
Magistrate  specially  empowered  in this  behalf  (a)	upon
receiving  a  complaint	 of  facts  which  constitute	such
offence; (b) upon a report in writing of such facts made  by
any  police-officer; and (c) upon information received	from
any  person  other than a police-officer, or  upon  his	 own
knowledge or suspicion, that such
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">527</span>
offence	 has  been  committed.	In  the	 present  case,	 the
Judicial  Magistrate  at  Chandigarh  had  before  him	 the
complaint  filed by the respondent, and if<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_97"> s. 190</a>  stood  by
itself,	 he  was competent to take cognizance  of  it  under
clause	(a)  of sub-s. (1) of that section.  This  power  of
taking	cognizance was, however, subject to  the  subsequent
provisions  contained  in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_98">  the Code</a>  of	 Criminal  Procedure

</blockquote><p id="p_14">This sub-section thus bars any Court from taking  cognizance
of  the	 offences  mentioned in clauses (a),  (b)  and	(c),
except	when the conditions laid down in those	clauses	 are
satisfied.   In the case of an offence punishable  under <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_121"> S.
211</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_122">I.P.C</a>., the mandatory direction is that no Court  shall
take  cognizance  of  any  offence  punishable	under	this
section, when such offence is alleged to have been committed
in,  or in relation to, any proceeding in any Court,  except
on  the complaint in writing of such Court or of some  other
Court to which such Court is subordinate.  This provision in
clause	(b)  of	 sub-s.	 (1) of<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_123"> s. 195</a>	is  thus  clearly  a
limitation  on	the power of the Court	to  take  cognizance
under <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_124"> s.  190</a>.	  Consequently, it is at the  stage  when  a
Magistrate  is taking cognizance under<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_125"> s. 190</a> that  he	must
examine the facts of the complaint before him and  determine
whether	 his power of taking cognizance under<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_126"> s. 190</a> has  or
has not been taken away by cl. (b) of sub-s. (1) of<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_127"> s.	195</a>,
Cr.  P.C. In
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">528</span>
the present case, therefore, at the time when this complaint
was  filed 'by the respondent in the Court of  the  Judicial
Magistrate at Chandigarh, it was necessary and incumbent  on
that  Magistrate  to  examine whether his  power  of  taking
cognizance  of the offence was limited by the provisions  of
s.  195	 (1)(b).  He had, therefore,  to  determine  whether
cognizance  of	this complaint charging the  appellant	with
commission of an offence under<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_128"> s. 211</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_129">I.P.C</a>., could not  be
taken by him, because that offence was alleged to have	been
committed  in,	or  in relation to, any	 proceeding  in	 any
Court,	and if he found that it was so, whether a  complaint
in  writing by such Court or some other Court to which	such
Court  was  subordinate was necessary before he	 could	take
cognizance.   Consequently,  in deciding this  appeal,	this
Court has to examine whether on the date when cognizance was
taken	by  the	 Judicial  Magistrate  at  Chandigarh	such
cognizance was barred under<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_130"> s. 195(1)(b)</a>, Cr. P.C.,  because
the offence punishable under<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_131"> s. 211</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_132">I.P.C</a>., included in the
complaint  was	alleged	 to have been committed	 in,  or  in
relation to, any proceeding in any Court.
</p><p id="p_15">    In	the interpretation of this cl. (b) of sub-s. (1)  of
s. 195, considerable emphasis has been laid before us on the
expression  "in, or in relation to", and it has	 been  urged
that  the  use	of  the expression  "in	 relation  to"	very
considerably widens the scope of this -section and makes  it
applicable  to	cases where there can even in  future  be  a
proceeding  in	any Court in relation to which	the  offence
under<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_133"> s. 211</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_134">I.P.C</a>., may be alleged to have been committed.
A proper interpretation of this provision requires that each
ingredient in it be separately examined. This provision bars
taking	of  cognizance if all  the  following  circumstances
exist,	viz., (1) that the offence in respect of  which	 the
case  is brought falls under<a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_135"> s. 211</a> I.P.C.; (2)	 that  there
should	be  a  proceeding in any Court; and  .(3)  that	 the
allegation  should  be	that the offence under	s.  211	 was
committed in, or in relation to, such a proceeding.   Unless
all the three ingredients exist, the bar under<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_136"> s.  195(1)(b)</a>
against	 taking	 cognizance by the Magistrate, except  on  a
complaint  in  writing	of  a  Court,  will  not  come	into
operation.  In the present case also, therefore, we have  to
see whether all these three ingredients were in existence at
the   time  when  the  Judicial	 Magistrate  at	  Chandigarh
proceeded  to  take cognizance of the charge under <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_137"> s.	211</a>,
<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_138">I.P.C</a>., against the appellant.
</p><p id="p_16">    There  is,	of course, no doubt that  in  the  complaint
before the Magistrate a charge under s..211, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_139">I.P.C</a>., against
the  appellant	was included, so that the  first  ingredient
clearly	 existed. The question on which the decision in	 the
present	 case  hinges  is whether it can be  held  that	 any
proceeding  in any Court existed when that  Magistrate	took
cognizance.  If any proceeding in any Court existed and	 the
offence under<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_140"> s. 211</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_141">I.P.C</a>., in the complaint filed  before
him was alleged to have been committed in such a proceeding,
or in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">529</span>
relation  to any such proceeding, the Magistrate would	have
been  barred from taking cognizance of the offence.  On	 the
other  hand, if there was no proceeding in any Court at	 all
in which, or in relation to which, the offence under<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_142"> s.	 211</a>
could  have  been  alleged  to	have  been  committed,	this
provision barring cognizance would not be attracted at all.
In this case, as we have already indicated when	 enumerating
the  facts, the complaint of which cognizance was  taken  by
the  Judicial Magistrate at Chandigarh was filed on April  1
1,  1959,  and at that stage, the only proceeding  that	 was
going on was investigation by the Police on the basis of the
First Information Report lodged by the appellant before	 the
Inspector-General of Police on December 10, 1958.  There  is
no  mention  at	 all  that there was,  at  that	 stage,	 any
proceeding in any Court in respect of that F.I.R. When	exa-
mining	the question whether there is any proceeding in	 any
Court,	there  are three situations that can  be  envisaged.
One is that there ,may be no proceeding in any Court at all.
The  second is that a proceeding in a Court may actually  be
pending at the point of time when cognizance is sought to be
taken of the offence under<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_143"> s. 211</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_144">I.P.C</a>. The third is that,
though	there may be no proceeding pending in any  Court  in
which,	or in relation to which, the offence under <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_145"> s.	211</a>,
<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_146">I.P.C</a>.,	 could	have been committed, there may have  been  a
proceeding which had already concluded and the offence under
s.  211	 may  be alleged to have been committed	 in,  or  in
relation  to, that proceeding.	It seems to us that in	both
the  latter  two circumstances envisaged above, the  bar  to
taking	cognizance  under <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_147"> s.  195(1)(b)</a>  would	 come	into
operation.  If there be a proceeding actually pending in any
Court  and the offence under<a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_148"> s. 21</a> <a href="/doc/976663/" id="a_149">1</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_150">I.P.C</a>., is alleged  to
have been committed in, or in relation to, that	 proceeding,
s. 195(1)(b) would, clearly apply.  Even if there be a	case
where  there  was, at one stage, a proceeding in  any  Court
which  may  have  concluded  by the  time  the	question  of
applying  the  provisions of<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_151"> s. 195(1)(b)</a>  arises,  the	 bar
under  that provision would apply if it is alleged that	 the
offence	 under	s.  211, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_152">I.P.C</a>., was  committed	 in,  or  in
relation to, that proceeding.  The fact that\ the proceeding
had concluded would be immaterial, because<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_153"> s. 195(1)(b)</a> does
not  require that the proceeding in any Court must  actually
be  pending at the time when the question of  applying	this
bar arises.
</p><p id="p_17">In the first circumstance envisaged above, when there is no
proceeding pending in any court at all at the time when	 the
applicability  of <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_154"> S. 195(1)(b)</a> has to	be  determined,	 nor
earlier	 proceeding which may have been of this	 sub-section
would  not be attracted, has there been any  concluded,	 the
provisions  because  the language used in it  requires	that
there must be a proceeding in some Court in, or in  relation
to,  which the offence under<a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_155"> s. 21</a> <a href="/doc/976663/" id="a_156">1</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_157">I.P.C</a>. is	 alleged  to
have been committed.  In such a case, a Magistrate would  be
competent  to  take cognizance of the offence under <a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_158"> s.	 211</a>
I.P.C., if his
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">530</span>
jurisdiction is invoked in the manner laid down in<a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_159"> s. 190</a> of
the Code of Criminal Procedure.
</p><p id="p_18">Mr. Frank Anthony on behalf of the appellant urged before us
that  even  in	those cases where there may  be	 no  pending
proceeding  in	any  Court, nor	 any  proceeding  which	 has
already	 concluded  in any Court, the bar  of <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_160"> s.  195(1)(b)</a>
should	be  held  to be applicable if it  is  found  that  a
subsequent  proceeding in any Court is under  contemplation.
We  do not think that the language of cl. (b) of sub-s.	 (1)
of<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_161"> s. 195</a> can justify any such interpretation.	A proceeding
in  contemplation  cannot be said to be a  proceeding  in  a
Court.	 When  there  is mere contemplation  of	 starting  a
proceeding  in	future,	 there	is  no	certainty  that	 the
proceeding  will  come into existence.	It  will  always  be
dependent  on the decision to be taken by the person who  is
contemplating  that  the  proceeding  be  started;  and	 any
interpretation of the law, which will make the applicability
dependent  on  a  future decision to  be  taken	 by  another
person,	 would, in our opinion, be totally  incorrect.	 The
applicability  of  this provision at the sweet will  of	 the
person	contemplating  the  proceeding	will  introduce	  an
element of uncertainty in the applicability of the law;	 and
such an interpretation must be avoided.	 In this case, apart
from this circumstance, the language used clearly lends	 it-
self  to the interpretation that the bar has been placed  by
the  Legislature  only in those cases where the	 offence  is
alleged	 to have been committed in, or in relation  to,	 any
proceeding actually pending in any Court, or any  proceeding
which has already been taken in any Court.  There is nothing
in  the	 language  to indicate	that  the  Legislature	also
intended to lay down this bar if a proceeding in a Court was
still under contemplation and if and when that proceeding is
taken, it may be found that the offence alleged to have been
committed  was,	 in fact, committed in, or in  relation	 to,
that  proceeding.  In this connection, the question of	time
when   the  applicability  of  this  provision	has  to	  be
determined,  assumes importance.  It appears to us  that  at
the time when in the present case the Judicial Magistrate at
Chandigarh  had to determine the applicability of this	bar,
he  could not be expected to come to a decision whether	 any
proceeding  in any Court was under contemplation in,  or  in
relation  to,  which the offence under<a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_162"> s. 21</a> <a href="/doc/976663/" id="a_163">1</a>,	 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_164">I.P.C</a>.,  of
which  he was asked to take cognizance, was alleged to	have
been  committed.   In  fact,  it  would	 be  laying  on	 the
Magistrate  a  burden  which he could  not  be	expected  to
discharge  properly  and judicially as no  Magistrate  could
determine in advance of a proceeding in a Court whether	 the
offence	 under<a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_165"> s. 21</a> <a href="/doc/976663/" id="a_166">1</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_167">I.P.C</a>., of which he is	required  to
take  cognizance,  will be an offence which  will  be  found
subsequently  to  have	been committed in  relation  to	 the
contemplated  proceeding  to  be  taken	 thereafter.	This
interpretation,	 sought	 to be placed on this  provision  on
behalf of the appellant, cannot, therefore, be accepted.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">531</span>
<p id="p_19">In  this connection, reliance was placed by learned  counsel
for  the appellant on a series of cases decided	 by  various
High  Courts.  In Re Vasudeo Ramchandra Joshi(1),  the	High
Court  of  Bombay quashed proceedings for prosecution  of  a
lawyer	who  had  instigated some witnesses  to	 give  false
evidence.   It	appears	 that a	 pleader  was  defending  an
accused	 person in a proceeding pending before a  Magistrate
against	 his  client in respect of a charge  under <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_168"> s.	401</a>,
<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_169">I.P.C</a>. On April 1, 1922, an application made by the  pleader
on  behalf of the accused for bail was refused.	  Then,	 the
statements  of three witnesses were recorded under <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_170"> s.	164</a>,
Cr.   P.C., on April 18, 1922, and from these statements  it
appeared that on April 10, these witnesses had an  interview
with  the  pleader  who had instigated them  to	 give  false
evidence.   On April 15, another case against the  pleader's
client	in  respect of a dacoity was sent up  to  the  Magis
trate,	and the allegation against the pleader was  that  it
was  in connection with this case of dacoity which was	sent
up  to	the  Magistrate on April 15, that  the	pleader	 had
instigated the witnesses to give false evidence.  On June 2,
the  witnesses were actually examined before the  Magistrate
in this dacoity case which was sent up on April 15; and then
on  June  7,  a complaint was filed by	the  Police  Officer
against	 the  pleader charging him with having	abetted	 the
giving	of  false evidence.  It was in	these  circumstances
that  the High Court held that the provisions of <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_171"> s.  195(1)</a>
</p><p id="p_20">(b),  Cr.   P.C., were applicable and the case	against	 the
pleader	 on the charge filed by the Police Officer  was	 not
maintainable  when there was no sanction by  the  Magistrate
who was enquiring into the dacoity case in relation to which
the  witnesses were instigated to give false  evidence.	  On
the  facts,  it is clear that that case	 is  distinguishable
from  the case before us.  In that case, the charge  by	 the
Police	Officer	 was  filed on June 7, and on  that  date  a
proceeding  was	 already pending before	 the  Magistrate  in
relation to which the witnesses had been instigated to	give
false evidence.	 The provisions of<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_172"> s. 195(1)(b)</a> were, there-
fore, clearly applicable.  Dealing with this matter, one  of
the  learned Judges of the High Court held that	 "the  words
are  very  general, and are wide enough, in my	opinion,  to
cover a proceeding in contemplation before a Criminal Court,
though	it may not have begun at the date when	the  offence
was committed.	If that is so, it is plain that sanction was
necessary   in	the  present  case,  and,   therefore,	 the
proceedings  which  have been undertaken are  nun  and	void
without such sanction.". These views expressed by Crump, J.,
had  been relied upon by learned counsel in support  of	 his
proposition that even if an offence is committed in relation
to a proceeding which is in contemplation, the provisions of
s.  195(1) (b), Cr.  P.C., are attracted.  We do  not  think
that any such general proposition can be inferred from	that
decision.  It is to be noted that in that case though it was
held  that the offence of instigation of witnesses  to	give
false evidence was committed when proceedings

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">532</span>
<p id="p_21">before	a criminal Court were still under  contemplation  in
which the witnesses were to appear, the actual complaint f9r
that instigation was filed after the Magistrate was  already
seized	of  the	 proceeding  in	 which	the  witnesses	were
instigated to give false evidence.  On the date on which the
complaint  was	filed  by the Police  Officer  charging	 the
pleader with instigation of giving false evidence, there was
already a pending proceeding before the Court in relation to
which  that offence had been committed.	  Consequently,	 the
observations  in that case should be interpreted as  limited
to  laying  down that the provisions of	<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_173"> s.  195(1)(b)</a>,	 Cr.
P.C.,  will  be attracted even if the  offence	charged	 was
committed  while  the proceeding was in	 contemplation,	 and
that  there was no decision by the Court that  the  sanction
under <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_174"> s. 195(1)(b)</a> would be necessary even in	those  cases
where  the proceeding is still	under contemplation  on	 the

    <a href="/doc/318497/" id="a_176">In Ghulam Rasul v. Emperor</a>(1) the Police investigated  a
report	that a certain person had stolen  the  complainant's
watch  from  his car, and in the investigation,	 the  Police
came  to the conclusion that the report was false  and	that
the watch had been removed by the complainant himself.	 The
case   was  accordingly	 reported  to  the  Magistrate	 for
cancellation; and then the Police prosecuted the complainant
under <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_177"> ss.  193</a> and <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_178">211</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_179">I.P.C</a>.	 The learned  Judge  of	 the
Lahore High Court in dealing with the case held: "I am clear
that  the  words  in this sub-section 'in  relation  to	 any
proceeding  in	any  Court' apply to this case	of  a  false
report or a false statement made in an investigation by	 the
police with the intention that there shaH, in consequence of
this,  be a trial in the Criminal Court, and I find  support
for  this  view	 in  the case of  Chuhar  Mal-Nihal  Mal  v.
Emperor(2)." The decision in the words in which the  learned
Judge  expressed himself appears to support the argument  of
learned	 counsel for the appellant in the present case;	 but
we  think that very likely in that case, the  learned  Judge
was  influenced by the circumstance that the case  had	been
reported  by the Police to the Magistrate for  cancellation.
He appears to have held the view that the Magistrate  having
passed	an order of cancellation, it was necessary that	 the
complaint  should  be filed by the  Magistrate,	 because <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_180"> s.
195(1)(b)</a>  had	become	applicable.  If	 the  learned  Judge
intended  to say that without any proceeding being taken  by
the  Magistrate in the. case which was investigated  by	 the
Police	it  was still essential that a complaint  should  be
filed	by  the	 Magistrate  simply  because  a	  subsequent
proceeding   following	 the   police	investigation	 was
contemplated,  we  consider  that  his	decision  cannot  be
accepted as correct.

false information to him in a report lodged by an informant.
In that connection, the Court considered the scope of<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_192"> s. 195</a>
and held that an offence under<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_193"> s. 211</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_194">I.P.C</a>., in connection

where  a proceeding was actually pending in a Court  at	 the

a document which was prepared before the proceedings started

noticed	 that  all that the Court disregarded was  the	fact
that  the  substantive	offence	 mentioned  in	S.  195	 was
committed  for a proceeding which was  under  contemplation,
but  the  proceedings in Court for that	 offence  were	held
barred	by<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_210"> S. 195</a> only because subsequently, proceedings  in

<a href="/doc/976663/" id="a_216">1</a>,  <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_217">I.P.C</a>., it was not necessary that the charge  should  be
before a Magistrate.  In that connection, the Court  further
held that it is enough in a case like that one if it appears
that the charge was still not pending and that an indictment
for   falsely  charging	 could	not  be	 sustained  if	 the
accusation were entertained and still remained under  proper

an indictment for falsely charging, as in the present  case,
cannot	be  sustained  while the  accusation  made  in	that
alleged	 false charge is still under proper  legal  enquiry.
In  the	 present case, there is no doubt that at  the  stage

appellant  for	the  offences under<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_218"> ss. 204</a>,  <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_219">211</a>  and	<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_220">385</a>,

bringing  a  charge of false information being given  to  it
until  the investigation is completed.	But we do  not	find
any requirement anywhere in law that the person affected  by
the false charge could not file his complaint in Court until
the  Police  had  decided that the charge  was	false.	 The
discretion  of the person affected by the false	 charge	 was
not  to	 be fettered or tied down to the view taken  by	 the

<p id="p_29">The  case  of Gati Mandal v. The, Emperor() is again  of  no
help, because in that case also the only principle that	 was
laid down was that a Magistrate had no jurisdiction to order

complaint  was dismissed.  That case does not relate to	 the
right  of  a private person to file a complaint at  a  stage

consequently,  the  provisions of<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_226"> s. 537</a>, Cr.	P.C.  cannot
apply.	 In  such a case, the trial without a  complaint  as
required by<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_227"> s. 195</a> would be void.  These comments brought to
our  notice  do	 not  have any	particular  bearing  on	 the
question  that we are called upon to examine.  In  the	same
case,	the   Additional  Judicial  Commissioner   of	Sind
interpreted  the effect of<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_228"> s. 195</a>, Cr.	P.C. He was  of	 the
view  that "<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_229">section 195</a>, though it forms a part<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_230"> of the	Code</a>
of  Procedure, in reality contains a provision of  the	sub-
stantive  law of crimes.  For<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_231"> s. 195</a> does not deal with	 the
competency  of	the Courts, nor lays down which	 of  several
Courts shall, in any particular matter, have jurisdiction to
try the case; and yet the language of<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_232"> s. 195</a> is apt to these
matters,  and it forms part of the Chapter entitled 'of	 the
jurisdiction  of  the  Criminal	 Courts	 in  enquiries	 and
trials'.  <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_233">Section 195</a> in reality lays down that the offences
therein	 referred to (or rather the acts constituting  those
offences)  shall  not be deemed to be any offences  at	all,
except on the complaint of the persons or the Courts therein
specified; it enhances the connotation of those offences and
limits	the scope of their definition.	This  limitation  of
the  definition	 is brought about by saying  that  no  Court
shall take cognizance of the offences unless this condition,
requisite for initiation of proceedings, is satisfied".
Relying	 on  these  observations, learned  counsel  for	 the
appellant urged before us that in this case also, we  should
hold that no offence under<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_234"> s. 211</a> could come into  existence
and  no charge for that commission could be brought  against
the appellant, unless there was a complaint by a Court under
S.  195,  Cr.	P.C. We are unable to agree  with  the	view
expressed  by the learned Additional  Judicial	Commissioner
that <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_235"> S. 195</a>, Cr.  P.C., really lays down that the  offences
therein	 referred to shall not be deemed to be any  offences
at all, except on the complaint of the persons or the Courts
therein specified.  An offence is constituted as soon as  it
is  found that the acts which constitute that  offence	have
been  committed	 by the person accused of the  offence.	  It
remains an offence whether it is triable by a Court or	not.

the fact that the trial of that offence can only be taken up
by courts. after certain specified conditions are  fulfilled
does  not  make that offence any the less an  offence.	 The
limitation  laid down by<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_236"> s. 195</a>, Cr.  P.C., is, in  fact,  a
limitation  only on the power of Courts to  take  cognizance
of,  and  try,	offences and does not in any  way  have	 the
effect	of converting an act, which was an offence, into  an
innocent  act.	We cannot, therefore, subscribe to the	view
expressed  in that case.  There is the further	circumstance
that  in the case before us we have held that the  provision
contained  in <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_237"> s. 195(1)(b)</a> was not applicable at  the	time
when  the Judicial Magistrate at Chandigarh took  cognizance
of  the offence, and consequently, this principle sought  to
be laid down by the Additional Judicial Commissioner of Sind
has no application.
</p><p id="p_32">In  Gunamony  Sapui v. Queen Empress(), the  High  Court  of
Calcutta  dealt	 with a case in which a complaint  had	been
lodged	by  one Syambar, accompanied by	 Gunamony,  charging
certain persons with murder and other offences.	 The Police,
after  investigation, made a report to the effect  that	 the
information   was  false,  and	thereupon,  the	  Magistrate
directed  proceedings  to  be  taken  against  Syambar	 and
Gunamony  to show cause why they should not  be	 prosecuted.
Syambar,  who had made the report, then appeared before	 the
Magistrate,  and repeating the information contained in	 his
report	to  the Police he asked for an	enquiry,  which	 was
ordered by the Magistrate.  Once again, a report was made by
the  police  that the complaint was false.   Thereupon,	 the
Magistrate,  without  putting and end to that  complaint  of
Syambar by dismissing it under<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_238"> s. 203</a>, or passing any  other
order as he might think fit, instituted proceedings  against
Gunamony  under	<a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_239"> s. 21</a> <a href="/doc/976663/" id="a_240">1</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_241">I.P.C</a>. On these  facts,  the	High
Court  held  that the proceedings against Gunamony  must  be
quashed, because there was no final order by the  Magistrate
on  the complaint of Symabar dismissing his  complaint,	 and
that  complaint was still pending.  On the analogy  to	this
case,  it  was urged by learned counsel that  in  this	case
also,  the  proceedings	 against  the  appellant  should  be
quashed on the ground that, at the stage when the respondent
filed  his complaint against the appellant, the	 proceedings
being taken by Police on the report of the appellant had not
come  to an end.  We do not think that the two cases can  be
compared.   In that case, the proceedings were in Court	 and
the  Court  filed a complaint for bringing false  charge  or
institution of false criminal proceedings without putting an
end to those proceedings.  In the case before us, there were
no proceedings before any Court on the, basis of the  report
lodged	by  the appellant at the time  when  the  respondent
filed  his complaint.  It was not at all necessary that	 the
proceedings  being  taken  by the  Police  should  terminate
before	the Court could competently take cognizance of	this
complaint filed by the respondent against the appellant.

documents  actually used in a Court (s. 471  etc.),  private
prosecutions  are barred absolutely, and only the Court,  in
relation  to which the offence was committed,  may  initiate
proceedings.   This  salutary  rule of	law  is	 founded  on
commonsense.  The dignity and prestige of courts of law must
be upheld by their presiding officers, and it would never do
to  leave  it  to  parties  aggrieved  to  achieve  in	 one
prosecution   gratification   of   personal   revenge	 and
vindication of a Court's honour and prestige.  To allow this
would  be  to sacrifice deliberately the  dispassionate	 and
impartial calm of tribunals and to allow a Court's  prestige
to  be	the sport of personal passions." We  are  unable  to
interpret these views expressed by the Madras High Court  as
implying   that	 private  prosecutions	for   the   offences
mentioned in clauses (b) &amp; (c) of sub-s. (1) of<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_246"> s. 195</a>,	 Cr.

such  offences be brought before courts by private  persons.
In  the case of cl. (b), there is the clear limitation	that
private	  prosecutions	are  barred  only  if  the   offence
mentioned in that section was alleged to have been committed
in, or in relation to, any proceeding in any Court.  If	 the
offence	 was  not  committed  in, or  in  relation  to,	 any
proceeding  in	any Court, a private  complaint	 is  clearly
permissible.   The  question of upholding  the	dignity	 and
prestige  of  courts  of law only  arises  after  there	 are
proceedings in the Courts and not at the stage when no	such
proceedings have been instituted or have come into existence
in  any	 Court.	  In  the  present  case,  we  have  already
indicated that the cognizance of the complaint filed by	 the
respondent  against the appellant was taken at a stage	when
there	was  no	 proceeding  in	 any  Court  of	  law,	 and
consequently,  at that stage, there could be no question  of
dignity	 or prestige of a court of law being upheld or of  a
private complaint being barred.

The  Court  held that the complaint under <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_255"> s.  182</a>,  <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_256">I.P.C</a>.,
could not be proceeded with,

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">538</span>
<p id="p_36">because,  on  the  basis of the alleged	 false	report,	 the
Police	made an inquiry and sent up some accused for  trial,
and  the offence, which had been committed under  the  first
paragraph of<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_257"> s. 211</a> by falsely implicating an accused in the
report,	 was  one committed in relation to a  proceeding  in
court.	  It  was  held	 to  be	 obvious  that	 there	 was
considerable  relation	between	 the first  report  and	 the
proceeding  in Court, for the latter was the result  of	 the
former.	  The  report  led to the  police  inquiry  and	 the
inquiry	 to  the  proceeding in	 court.	  Consequently,	 the
offence	 committed  was one under<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_258"> s. 211</a> in  relation  to  a
proceeding in court and sanction of the Court was necessary.
This  case,  again, does not, therefore, indicate  that	 any
view was taken contrary to our opinion expressed above.
Two  other  cases brought to our notice are <a href="/doc/1044401/" id="a_259">A.	T.  Krishna-
machari	 v.  Emperor</a>,(1)  and <a href="/doc/1069919/" id="a_260">Badri v. State</a>  (2).   In	 the
former case a statement was recorded under<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_261"> s. 164</a>, Cr.	P.C.
by a Magistrate in relation to a case which was subsequently
tried  on that matter.	Even though the Court,	which  tried
the  case, had not recorded the statement under<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_262"> s.  164</a>,  it
was  held  that	 it  was competent for	that  Court,  on  an
application  under<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_263"> s. 476</a>, to make a complaint	against	 the
person	in  respect of a statement made by  him	 to  another
Magistrate  under <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_264"> s. 164</a>, Cr.	P.C. This was again  a	case
where  the statement under<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_265"> s. 164</a>, Cr.	P.C., was  found  to
relate to a proceeding that subsequently came into existence
in a Court, and the question of filing the complaint for the
offence	 of  making  that  false  statement  or	 of   taking
cognizance in respect of that offence only arose after	that
proceeding in Court had already come into existence.
In the case of <a href="/doc/1069919/" id="a_266">Badri v. State</a>(2), where an offence under <a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_267"> s.
21</a>  <a href="/doc/976663/" id="a_268">1</a>,	<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_269">I.P.C</a>., was alleged to have been  committed  by	 the
person	making	a false report against the  complainant	 and
others to the Police, it was held that it was an offence  in
relation  to the remand proceeding and the bail	 proceedings
which  were  subsequently  taken  before  a  Magistrate	  in
connection  with that report to the Police, and,  therefore,
the  case  was governed by<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_270"> s. 195(1)(b)</a>, Cr.  P.C.,  and  no
cognizance  of	the  offence  could be	taken  except  on  a
complaint  by  the Magistrate who held the remand  and	bail
proceedings.  We do not consider it necessary to express any
opinion	 whether the remand and bail proceedings before	 the
Magistrate  could be held to be proceedings in a Court,	 nor
need  we consider the question whether the charge of  making
of the false report could be rightly held to be in  relation
to  those  proceedings.	  That aspect need  not	 detain	 us,
because,  in  the case before us, the facts  are  different.
The  complaint	for the offence under<a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_271"> s. 21</a>  <a href="/doc/976663/" id="a_272">1</a>,	 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_273">I.P.C</a>.	 was
taken cognizance of by the Judicial Magistrate at Chandigarh
at  a stage when there had been no proceedings	for  arrest,
remand	or  bail of the respondent and the  case  was  still
entirely in the hands of the Police.

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">539</span>
<p id="p_39">There  was,  in	 fact, no order by  any	 Magistrate  in	 the
proceedings  being taken by the Police on the report  lodged
by  the	 appellant  up to the stage  when  the	question  of
applying the provisions of<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_274"> s. 195</a> (1)(b), Cr.  P.C.,  arose.
These two cases are also, therefore, of no assistance to the
appellant.   On the same ground, the decision of the  Bombay
High  Court in <a href="/doc/230090/" id="a_275">J. D. Boywalla v. Sorab Rustomji	 Engineer</a>(1)
is also inapplicable, because in that case also orders	were
passed	by  a  Magistrate on the final report  made  by	 the
Police	after  investigation of the facts in the  report  in
respect	 of which the complaint under<a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_276"> s. 21</a> <a href="/doc/976663/" id="a_277">1</a>,	<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_278">I.P.C</a>.,	 was
sought to be filed.
</p><p id="p_40">In  support  of his proposition that no	 criminal  complaint
under <a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_279"> s. 21</a> <a href="/doc/976663/" id="a_280">1</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_281">I.P.C</a>., can be filed by a private person  if
the  First  Information Report is  under  investigation	 and
relates	 to a cognizable offence, Mr. Anthony urged that  we
should examine the scheme<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_282"> of the Code</a> of Criminal  Procedure
relating  to  investigation contained in<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_283"> ss. 154</a> to  <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_284">173</a>  of
that Code and should hold that this scheme itself  envisages
that,  invariably,  the proceedings  of	 investigation	will
terminate  in  a judicial order by a Magistrate,  and  while
such  proceedings are pending, it should not be	 permissible
for  a	private person to file the complaint on	 the  ground
that the report under investigation was a false one.  It  is
perfectly correct that when a report of a cognizable offence
is  made, a duty is cast on the Police Officer in charge  of
the  station to investigate that case, and in certain  cases
of serious offences, immediate report has to be sent to	 the
Magistrate who has power to take cognizance of the offences.
There  is,  however, nothing in these sections	to  indicate
that  the  Magistrate  is  required  to	 intervene  in	 the
investigation  until the investigation is completed and	 the
investigating	officer	 arrives  at  some   conclusion	  in
accordance  with<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_285"> s. 169</a> or<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_286"> s. 170</a>, Cr.	P.C. After  arriving
at  this conclusion under either of those two  sections,  he
has  to submit a report to the Magistrate empowered to	take
cognizance  of the offence under<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_287"> s. 173</a>.  If his  conclusion
is  covered  by	 the provisions of<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_288"> s. 170</a>,  Cr.	  P.C.,	 the
report	 submitted   by	 the  investigating   officer	will
necessarily  show  that a cognizable offence has  been	com-
mitted and such a report will satisfy the requirements of<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_289"> s.
190(1)(b)</a>,   Cr.  P.C.	On  that  report,   therefore,	 the
Magistrate  concerned can take cognizance and  proceed	with
the trial of the case.	On the other hand, if the report  is
based  on  conclusions envisaged in<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_290"> s. 169</a>, Cr.	  P.C.,	 the
report	will contain facts found by the Police Officer,	 and
would  normally indicate that no such offence was  committed
of which he could recommend a trial by the Magistrate.	Even
on  the	 receipt  of such a report, the	 Magistrate  is,  of
course,	 competent to take cognizance under<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_291"> s. 190(1)(b)</a>  if
he is of the opinion that the facts stated in the report  of
the  Police  constitute an offence.  On the other  hand,  if
those  facts do not constitute an offence, no cognizance  of
the case can be taken by the Magistrate, though he can order
further
(1) A.I.R. (1941) Bom. 294.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">540</span>
<p id="p_41">investigation.	 If  he	 does not choose  to  order  further
investigation, all that the Magistrate has to do is to	make
an order under sub-s. (3) of<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_292"> s. 173</a>, Cr.  P.C.,	 discharging
the  bond if the accused has been released by the Police  on
his bond.
</p><p id="p_42">This  scheme of investigation and its termination  contained
in these sections<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_293"> of the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure came  up
for  consideration in several cases.  In Appa  Ragho  Bhogle
and  Others v. Emperor(1) it was held that a case which	 was
investigated  by the police under authority of a  Magistrate
under <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_294"> s. 155</a>, Cr.  P. C., could not be disposed of  without
the order of the Magistrate in some form or another after  a
report	was  submitted	to him.	 In State  v.  Vipra  Khimji
Gangaram(2), it was held that where information relating  to
the  commission	 of  a cognizable offence  is  given  to  an
officer in charge of a Police Station under<a href="/doc/1980578/" id="a_295"> s. 154</a> Cr. P. C.
, and is followed by investigation by him, he is bound under
s.  173(1)  to	forward his final  report  to  a  Magistrate
empowered  to  take cognizance of the offence  on  a  police
report.	 This Court also in <a href="/doc/1361495/" id="a_296">H. N. Rishbud and Inder Singh v.
The  State  of	Delhi</a>(3),  examined  the  scheme  of   these
provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_297">  of the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure and held	that
upon  the  completion of  investigation,  the  investigating
officer	 has to submit a report to the Magistrate  under <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_298"> s.
173</a>,  Cr. P. C., in the prescribed form, furnishing  various
details,  whether  it  appears	to  him	 that  there  is  no
sufficient  evidence  or reasonable ground,  or	 whether  he
finds that there is sufficient evidence or reasonable ground
to  place the accused on trial.	 Similar  observations	were
made  by  the  Bombay  High Court in  <a href="/doc/765998/" id="a_299">State  and  Others  v.
Murlidhar  Govardhan and Others</a>(4).  In two of these  cases,
viz.,  .State v. Vipra Khimji Gangaram(2), and <a href="/doc/765998/" id="a_300">State &amp;	Ors.
v.  Murlidhar  Govardhan &amp; Ors</a>.(4) the Courts  further	held
that  when a Magistrate passes an order on  the	 proceedings
under <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_301"> s.  173</a>, Cr.  P. C., that order is a  judicial  order
made  by  him.	For purposes of considering  the  effect  of
these  cases  in  the  case before us,	it  is	not  at	 all
necessary  to express any opinion on the correctness of	 the
view that the order passed under<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_302"> s. 173</a>, Cr.  P. C., by	 the
Magistrate is a judicial order when he either discharges the
bond under sub-s. (3) of<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_303"> s. 173</a> or takes cognizance under<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_304"> s.
190</a> (1) (b), Cr.  P.C. Even if it be accepted that the final
orders to be made by the Magistrate are judicial orders, the
only  conclusion that follows is that at the last stage,  on
receipt	 of the report under<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_305"> s. 173</a>, the Magistrate  has  to
act in his judicial capacity.  Until that stage is  reached,
there  is no intervention by the Magistrate in his  judicial
capacity  or as a Court.  Consequently, until some  occasion
arises	for  a	Magistrate  to	make  a	 judicial  order  in
connection with an investigation of a cognizable offence  by
the  police, no question can arise of the Magistrate  having
the power of filing a complaint under<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_306"> s. 195(1)(b)</a>,

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">541</span>
<p id="p_46">Cr.  P.	 C.  In such circumstances,  if	 a  private  person,
aggrieved  by the information given to the police,  files  a
complaint for commission of an offence under<a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_307"> s. 21</a> <a href="/doc/976663/" id="a_308">1</a>, <a href="/doc/976663/" id="a_309">1</a>.  P.
C., at any stage before a judicial order has been made by  a
Magistrate,  there can be no question, on the date on  which
cognizance  of that complaint is taken by the Court, of	 the
provisions  of	s. 195(1) (b) being attracted,	because,  on
that  date,  there would be no proceeding in  any  Court  in
existence in relation to which the offence under<a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_310"> s. 21</a> <a href="/doc/976663/" id="a_311">1</a>, <a href="/doc/976663/" id="a_312">1</a>.
P.  C., can be said to have been committed.  The  mere	fact
that  on a report being made to the police of  a  cognizable
offence, the proceedings must, at some later stage, end in a
judicial order by a Magistrate, cannot, therefore, stand  in
the way of a private complaint being filed and of cognizance
being taken by the Court on its basis.
</p><p id="p_47">The last submission made on behalf of the appellant was that
a  very anomalous position can arise if a private person  is
allowed	 to file a complaint that the report to	 the  police
against him is false before investigation is completed.	  It
was  urged  that there can be cases where a  report  may  be
lodged against a person for commission of a serious  offence
like murder, and while investigation is still going on,	 the
accused may file a complaint against the person, who  lodged
the  report,  under<a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_313"> s. 21</a> <a href="/doc/976663/" id="a_314">1</a>, <a href="/doc/976663/" id="a_315">1</a>. P. C., for  making  a  false
report.	  Subsequently,	 when  the  police  prosecute	that
accused,  there would, simultaneously, be two trials in	 one
of  which  the person accused of the murder would  be  under
trial,	while in the other case the person, who	 lodged	 the
First  Information Report, would appear as the accused.	  It
was  suggested	that  a person accused of  a  serious  crime
should not be given the advantage of putting his complainant
in  jeopardy  by  instituting a case  against  him  for	 the
offence	 under<a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_316"> s. 21</a> <a href="/doc/976663/" id="a_317">1</a>, <a href="/doc/976663/" id="a_318">1</a>. P. C. We are unable to hold	that
it  is	necessary to interpret the law in such a way  as  to
necessarily avoid such a situation.  There appears to be  no
difficulty  in both cases being tried together in  the	same
Court or one after the other by different Courts.  In  fact,
even  if we were to accept the submission made on behalf  of
the  appellant, a similar situation can still arise.   There
may   be  a  case  where  the  police  may  report  to	 the
Magistrate that the First Information Report was false,	 and
in such a case, according to the submissions made by learned
counsel	 for  the appellant, the  Magistrate  receiving	 the
report under<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_319"> s. 173</a>, Cr.  P. C., would be competent to	file
a  complaint against the informant for the offence under <a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_320"> s.
21</a> <a href="/doc/976663/" id="a_321">1</a>, <a href="/doc/976663/" id="a_322">1</a>. P. C., in exercise of his power -under s.195(1)(b),
Cr.   P. C. At the same time, there would be no bar to	that
informant  filing  a complaint direct in the  Court  of	 the
Magistrate  on	the basis of his F. 1. R., so  that,  again,
there  can  be two trials in the Court in one of  which	 the
informant would be the accused, and in the other, the person
charged	 in  the  First	 Information  Report  would  be	 the
accused.  The situation will not, therefore, differ  whether
we accept the submission made on behalf of the appellant, or
do not do so.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">542</span>
<p id="p_48">This   aspect	is,  therefore,	 not  at  all	helpful	  in
interpreting  the  scope  of<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_323"> s. 195(1)(b)</a>, Cr.	 P.  C.	 We,
consequently,  hold that in this case the  complaint,  which
was filed by the respondent, was competent and the  Judicial
Magistrate  at	Chandigarh,  in	 taking	 cognizance  of	 the
offence, only exercised jurisdiction rightly vested in	him.
He was not barred from taking cognizance of the complaint by
the provisions of<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_324"> s. 195(1)(b)</a>, Cr.  P. C.
</p><p id="p_49">In  this case, one more point that was canvassed  before  us
was that the two offences under <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_325">sections 204</a> and <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_326">385</a>, I.  P.
C., which were included in the complaint of the	 respondent,
were so inter-mixed with the offence under<a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_327"> s. 21</a> <a href="/doc/976663/" id="a_328">1</a>, I.P. C.,
that a trial for those two offences could not proceed if the
trial for the offence under<a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_329"> s. 21</a> <a href="/doc/976663/" id="a_330">1</a>, I. P. C. was barred  by
s.  195(1)(b),	Cr.  P. C. That question need not  be  dealt
with  by us in view of our decision that cognizance  of	 the
offence under s. 21 I,, 1. P. C., has been rightly taken and
the  trial  for that offence is not  vitiated.	 The  appeal
fails and is dismissed.
