CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 1685 OF 2007
(Arising out of Special Leave Petition (Criminal) No.6404/ 2007)

MARKANDEY KATJU, J.
</p>


<p id="p_2">1.	Leave granted.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.	This appeal is directed against the impugned judgment and order 
dated 13.7.2007 passed by the Allahabad High Court in Criminal Misc. Writ 
Petition No. 9308 of 2007.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.	Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.	The son of the appellant was a Major in the Indian Army.  His dead 
body was found on 23.8.2003 at Mathura Railway Station.  The G.R.P, 
Mathura investigated the matter and gave a detailed report on 29.8.2003 
stating that the death was due to an accident or suicide.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.	The Army officials at Mathura also held two Courts of Inquiry and 
both times submitted the report that the deceased Major S. Ravishankar had 
committed suicide at the railway track at Mathura junction.  The Court of 
Inquiry relied on the statement of the Sahayak (domestic servant) Pradeep 
Kumar who made a statement that deceased Major Ravishankar never 
looked cheerful; he used to sit on a chair in the verandah gazing at  the roof 
with blank eyes and deeply involved in some thoughts and used to remain 
oblivious of the surroundings.  The Court of Inquiry also relied on the 
deposition of the main eye-witness, gangman Roop Singh, who stated that 
Major Ravishankar was hit by a goods train that came from Delhi.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.	The appellant who is the father of Major Ravishankar alleged that in 
fact it was a case of murder and not suicide.  He alleged that in the Mathura 
unit of the Army there was rampant corruption about which Major 
Ravishankar came to know and he made oral complaints about it to his 
superiors and also to his father.  According to the appellant, it was for this 
reason that his son was murdered.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.	The first Court of Inquiry was held by the Army which gave its report 
in September, 2003 stating that it was a case of suicide.  The appellant was 
not satisfied with the findings of this Court of Inquiry and hence on 
22.4.2004 he made a representation to the then Chief of the Army Staff, 
General N.C. Vij, as a result of which another Court of Inquiry was held.  
However, the second Court of Inquiry came to the same conclusion as that 
of the first inquiry namely, that it was a case of suicide.
</p>
<p id="p_9">8.	Aggrieved, a writ petition was filed in the High Court which was 
dismissed by the impugned judgment.  Hence this appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_10">9.	The petitioner (appellant herein) prayed in the writ petition that the 
matter be ordered to be investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation 
(in short CBI).  Since his prayer was rejected by the High Court, hence this 
appeal by way of special leave.
</p>     
<p id="p_11">10.	It has been held by this Court in <a href="/doc/1574164/" id="a_1">CBI &amp; another vs. Rajesh Gandhi 
and another</a> 1997 Cr.L.J 63 (vide para 8) that no one can insist that an 
offence be investigated by a particular agency.  We fully agree with the view 
in the aforesaid decision.  An aggrieved person can only claim that the 
offence he alleges be investigated properly, but he has no right to claim that 
it be investigated by any particular agency of his choice. 
</p>
<p id="p_12">11.	In this connection we would like to state that if a person has a 
grievance that the police station is not registering his FIR under <a href="/doc/1980578/" id="a_2">Section 154</a> 
Cr.P.C., then he can approach the Superintendent of Police under <a href="/doc/1622626/" id="a_3">Section 
154(3)</a> Cr.P.C. by an application in writing.  Even if that does not yield any 
satisfactory result in the sense that either the FIR is still not registered, or 
that even after registering it no proper investigation is held, it is open to the 
aggrieved person to file an application under <a href="/doc/1291024/" id="a_4">Section 156</a> (3) <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_5">Cr.P.C</a>. before 
the learned Magistrate concerned.  If such an application under <a href="/doc/1291024/" id="a_6">Section 156</a> 
(3) is filed before the Magistrate, the Magistrate can direct the FIR to be 
registered and also can direct a proper investigation to be made, in a case 
where, according to the aggrieved person, no proper investigation was made.   
The Magistrate can also under the same provision monitor the investigation 
to ensure a proper investigation. 
</p><p id="p_13">12.	Thus in <a href="/doc/1938541/" id="a_7">Mohd. Yousuf vs. Smt. Afaq Jahan &amp; Anr. JT</a> 2006(1) SC 
10, this Court observed:
</p>		
<p id="p_14">The clear position therefore is that any judicial 
Magistrate, before taking cognizance of the offence, can 
order investigation under <a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_8">Section 156(3)</a> of the Code.  If 
he does so, he is not to examine the complainant on oath 
because he was not taking cognizance of any offence 
therein.  For the purpose of enabling the police to start 
investigation it is open to the Magistrate to direct the 
police to register an FIR.  There is nothing illegal in 
doing so. After all registration of an FIR involves only 
the process of entering the substance of the information 
relating to the commission of the cognizable offence in a 
book kept by the officer in charge of the police station as 
indicated in <a href="/doc/1980578/" id="a_9">Section 154</a> of the Code.  Even if a 
Magistrate does not say in so many words while directing 
investigating under <a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_10">Section 156(3)</a> of the Code that an 
FIR should be registered, it is the duty of the officer in 
charge of the police station to register the FIR regarding 
the cognizable offence disclosed by the complaint 
because that police officer could take further steps 
contemplated in Chapter XII of the Code only 
thereafter..
</p>

<p id="p_15">13.	The same view was taken by this Court in Dilawar Singh vs. State of 
Delhi JT 2007 (10) SC 585 (vide para 17).  We would further clarify that 
even if an FIR has been registered and even if the police has made the 
investigation, or is actually making the investigation, which the aggrieved 
person feels is not proper, such a person can approach the Magistrate under 
<a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_11">Section 156(3)</a> Cr.P.C., and if the Magistrate is satisfied he can order a 
proper investigation and take other suitable steps  and pass such order orders 
as he thinks necessary for ensuring a proper investigation.  All these powers 
a Magistrate enjoys under <a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_12">Section 156(3)</a> Cr.P.C. 
</p>
<p id="p_16">14.	<a href="/doc/1291024/" id="a_13">Section 156</a> (3) states:
</p>

<p id="p_17">Any Magistrate empowered under <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_14">Section 190</a> may 
order such an investigation as abovementioned.
      
The words `as abovementioned obviously refer to <a href="/doc/1291024/" id="a_15">Section 156</a> (1), which 
contemplates investigation by the officer in charge of the Police Station.
</p>
<p id="p_18">15.	<a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_16">Section 156(3)</a> provides for a check by the Magistrate on the police 
performing its duties under Chapter XII <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_17">Cr.P.C</a>.   In cases where the 
Magistrate finds that the police has not done its duty of investigating the 
case at all, or has not done it satisfactorily, he can issue a direction to the 
police to do the investigation properly, and can monitor the same.
</p>
<p id="p_19">16.	The power in the Magistrate to order further investigation under 
<a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_18">Section 156(3)</a> is an independent power, and does not affect the power of the 
investigating officer to further investigate the case even after submission of 
his report vide <a href="/doc/274924/" id="a_19">Section 173(8)</a>.  Hence the Magistrate can order re-opening 
of the investigation even after the police submits the final report, vide <a href="/doc/1727525/" id="a_20">State 
of Bihar vs. A.C. Saldanna</a> AIR 1980 SC 326 (para 19).   
</p>
<p id="p_20">17.	In our opinion <a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_21">Section 156(3)</a> Cr.P.C. is wide enough to include all 
such powers in a Magistrate which are necessary for ensuring a proper 
investigation, and it includes the power to order registration of an F.I.R. and 
of ordering a proper investigation if the Magistrate is satisfied that a proper 
investigation has not been done, or is not being done by the police.  <a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_22">Section 
156(3)</a> Cr.P.C., though briefly worded, in our opinion, is very wide  and it 
will include all such incidental powers as are necessary for ensuring a proper 
investigation.  
</p>
<p id="p_21">18.	It is well-settled that when a power is given to an authority to do 
something it includes such incidental or implied powers which would ensure 
the proper doing of that thing.  In other words, when any power is expressly 
granted by the statute, there is impliedly included in the grant, even without 
special mention, every power and every control the denial of which would 
render the grant itself ineffective.  Thus where an Act confers jurisdiction it 
impliedly also grants the power of doing all such acts or employ such means 
as are essentially necessary to its execution. 
</p>
<p id="p_22">19.	The reason for the rule (doctrine of implied power) is quite apparent.  
Many matters of minor details are omitted from legislation.  As Crawford 
observes in his Statutory Construction (3rd edn. page 267):-
</p>
<p id="p_23">If these details could not be inserted by implication, the 
drafting of legislation would be an indeterminable 
process and the legislative intent would likely be 
defeated by a most insignificant omission. 
</p>     
<p id="p_24">20.	In ascertaining a necessary implication, the Court simply determines 
the legislative will and makes it effective.  What is necessarily implied is as 
much part of the statute as if it were specifically written therein. 
</p>     					
<p id="p_25">21.	An express grant of statutory powers carries with it by necessary 
implication the authority to use all reasonable means to make such grant 
effective.  Thus in <a href="/doc/736105/" id="a_23">ITO, Cannanore vs. M.K. Mohammad Kunhi</a>, AIR 
1969 SC 430, this Court held that the income tax appellate tribunal has 
implied powers to grant stay, although no such power has been expressly 
granted to it by the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_24">Income Tax Act</a>. 
</p>     
<p id="p_26">22.	Similar examples where this Court has affirmed the doctrine of 
implied powers are <a href="/doc/1867676/" id="a_25">Union of India vs.  Paras Laminates</a> AIR 1991 SC 
696,  <a href="/doc/1149874/" id="a_26">Reserve Bank of India  vs. Peerless General Finance and 
Investment Company Ltd</a> AIR 1996 SC 646 (at p. 656), <a href="/doc/404069/" id="a_27">Chief Executive 
Officer &amp; Vice Chairman Gujarat Maritime Board vs. Haji Daud Haji 
Harun Abu</a> 1996 (11) SCC 23,  <a href="/doc/1092526/" id="a_28">J.K. Synthetics Ltd. vs. Collector of 
Central Excise</a>, AIR 1996 SC 3527, <a href="/doc/925018/" id="a_29">State of Karnataka vs. 
Vishwabharati House Building Co-op Society</a> 2003 (2) SCC 412 (at p. 
</p><p id="p_27">432) etc.

</p><p id="p_28">23.	<a href="/doc/1194071/" id="a_30">In Savitri vs. Govind Singh Rawat</a> AIR 1986 SC 984 this Court held 
that the power conferred on the Magistrate under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_31">Section 125Cr</a>.P.C. to 
grant maintenance to the wife implies the power to grant interim 
maintenance during the pendency of the  proceeding, otherwise she may 
starve during this period.
</p>
<p id="p_29">24.	In view of the abovementioned legal position, we are of the view that 
although <a href="/doc/1117531/" id="a_32">Section 156(3)</a> is verybriefly worded, there is an implied power in 
the Magistrate under <a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_33">Section 156(3)</a> Cr.P.C. to order registration of a 
criminal offence and /or to direct the officer in charge of the concerned 
police station to hold a proper investigation and take all such necessary steps 
that may be necessary for ensuring a proper investigation including 
monitoring the same.  Even though these powers have not been expressly 
mentioned in <a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_34">Section 156(3)</a> Cr.P.C., we are of the opinion that they are 
implied in the above provision. 
</p>
<p id="p_30">25.	We have elaborated on the above matter because we often find that 
when someone has a grievance that his FIR has not been registered at the 
police station and/or a proper investigation is not being done by the police, 
he rushes to the High Court to file a writ petition or a petition under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_35">Section 
482</a> Cr.P.C.  We are of the opinion that the High Court should not encourage 
this practice and should ordinarily refuse to interfere in such matters, and 
relegate the petitioner to his alternating remedy, firstly under <a href="/doc/1416658/" id="a_36">Section 154(3)</a> 
and <a href="/doc/1013783/" id="a_37">Section 36</a> Cr.P.C. before the concerned police officers, and if that is of 
no avail, by approaching the concerned Magistrate under <a href="/doc/1117531/" id="a_38">Section 156(3)</a>.  
</p>
<p id="p_31">26.	If a person has a grievance that his FIR has not been registered by the 
police station his first remedy is to approach the Superintendent of Police 
under <a href="/doc/1622626/" id="a_39">Section 154(3)</a> Cr.P.C. or other police officer referred to in <a href="/doc/1013783/" id="a_40">Section 36</a> 
Cr.P.C.  If despite approaching the Superintendent of Police or the officer 
referred to in <a href="/doc/1427856/" id="a_41">Section 36</a> his grievance still persists, then he can approach a 
Magistrate under <a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_42">Section 156(3)</a> Cr.P.C. instead of rushing to the High 
Court by way of a writ petition or a petition under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_43">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C.   
Moreover he has a further remedy of filing a criminal complaint under 
<a href="/doc/444619/" id="a_44">Section 200</a> Cr.P.C.  Why then should writ petitions or <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_45">Section 482</a> petitions 
be entertained when there are so many alternative remedies?
</p>
<p id="p_32">27.	As we have already observed above, the Magistrate has very wide 
powers to direct registration of an FIR  and to ensure a proper investigation, 
and for this purpose he can monitor the investigation to ensure that the 
investigation is done properly (though he cannot investigate himself). The 
High Court should discourage the practice of filing a writ petition or petition 
under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_46">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. simply because a person has a grievance that his 
FIR has not been registered by the police, or after being registered, proper 
investigation has not been done by the police.  For this grievance, the 
remedy lies under <a href="/doc/1427856/" id="a_47">Sections 36</a> and <a href="/doc/1416658/" id="a_48">154(3)</a> before the concerned police 
officers, and if that is of no avail, under <a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_49">Section 156(3)</a> Cr.P.C. before the 
Magistrate or by filing a criminal complaint under <a href="/doc/444619/" id="a_50">Section 200</a> Cr.P.C. and 
not by filing a writ petition or a petition under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_51">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. 
</p>
<p id="p_33">28.	It is true that alternative remedy is not an absolute bar to a writ 
petition, but it is equally well settled that if there is an alternative remedy the 
High Court should not ordinarily interfere.
</p>
<p id="p_34">29.	<a href="/doc/767596/" id="a_52">In Union of India vs. Prakash P. Hinduja and another</a> 2003 (6) 
SCC 195 (vide para 13), it has been observed by this Court that a Magistrate 
cannot interfere with the investigation by the police.  However, in our 
opinion, the ratio of this decision would only apply when a proper 
investigation is being done by the police.  If the Magistrate on an application 
under <a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_53">Section 156(3)</a> Cr.P.C. is satisfied that proper investigation has not 
been done, or is not being done by the officer-in-charge of the concerned 
police station, he can certainly direct the officer in charge of the police 
station to make a proper investigation and can further monitor the same 
(though he should not himself investigate). 
</p>
<p id="p_35">30.	It may be further mentioned that in view of <a href="/doc/1013783/" id="a_54">Section 36</a> Cr.P.C. if a 
person is aggrieved that a proper investigation has not been made by the 
officer-in-charge of the concerned police station, such aggrieved person can 
approach the Superintendent of Police or other police officer superior in rank 
to the officer-in-charge of the police station and such superior officer can, if 
he so wishes, do the investigation vide <a href="/doc/1787248/" id="a_55">CBI vs. State of Rajasthan and 
another</a> 2001 (3) SCC 333 (vide para 11), R.P. Kapur vs. S.P. Singh AIR 
1961  SC 1117 etc.   Also, the State Government is competent to direct the 
Inspector General, Vigilance to take over the investigation of a cognizable 
offence registered at a police station vide <a href="/doc/1727525/" id="a_56">State of Bihar vs. A.C. Saldanna</a> 
(supra).
</p>
<p id="p_36">31.	No doubt the Magistrate cannot order investigation by the CBI vide 
CBI vs. State of Rajasthan and another (Supra), but this Court or the High 
Court has power under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_57">Article 136</a> or <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_58">Article 226</a> to order investigation by 
the CBI.  That, however   should be done only in some rare and exceptional 
case, otherwise, the CBI would be flooded with a large number of cases and 
would find it impossible to properly investigate all of them. 
</p>
<p id="p_37">32.	In the present case, there was an investigation by the G.R.P., Mathura 
and also two Courts of Inquiry held by the Army authorities and they found 
that it was a case of suicide.  Hence, in our opinion, the High Court was 
justified in rejecting the prayer for a CBI inquiry. 
</p>
<p id="p_38">33.	<a href="/doc/91463868/" id="a_59">In Secretary, Minor Irrigation &amp; Rural Engineering Services U.P. 
and others vs. Sahngoo Ram Arya and another</a> 2002 (5) SCC 521 (vide 
para 6) , this Court observed that although the High Court has power to order 
a CBI inquiry, that power should only be exercised if the High Court after 
considering the material on record comes to a conclusion that such material 
discloses prima facie a case calling for investigation by the CBI or by any 
other similar agency.  A CBI inquiry cannot be ordered as a matter of routine 
or merely because the party makes some allegation.
</p>
<p id="p_39">34.	In the present case, we are of the opinion that the material on record 
does not disclose a prima facie case calling for an investigation by the CBI.  
The mere allegation of the appellant that his son was murdered because he 
had discovered some corruption cannot, in our opinion, justify a CBI 
inquiry, particularly when inquiries were held by the Army authorities as 
well as by the G.R.P. at Mathura, which revealed that it was a case of 
suicide.    
</p> 
<p id="p_40">35.	It has been stated in the impugned order of the High Court that the 
G.R.P. at Mathura had investigated the matter and gave a detailed report on 
29.8.2003.  It is not clear whether this report was accepted by the Magistrate 
or not. If the report has been accepted by the Magistrate and no 
appeal/revision was filed against the order of the learned Magistrate 
accepting the police report, then that is the end of the matter.  However, if 
the Magistrate has not yet passed any order on the police report, he may do 
so in accordance with law and in the light of the observations made above.
</p><p id="p_41">36.	With the above observations, this appeal stands dismissed. 
</p>
<p id="p_42">37.	Let a copy of this judgment be sent by the Secretary General of this 
Court to the Registrar Generals/Registrars of all the High Courts, who shall 
circulate a copy of this Judgment to all the Honble Judges of the High 
Courts.
