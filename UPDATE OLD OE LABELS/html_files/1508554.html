</p><p id="p_5">     Leave granted.
</p><p id="p_6">     This appeal and the companion appeal filed by the Union
of India arise from the order of the Administrative Tribunal
in O.A.	 No. 609  of 1986  dated March 14, 1989. Appellant's
integrity, while  he was  working as Income-tax officer, had
come under cloud. On an investigation made by the C.B.I., it
had stated  to	the  respondent	 that  though  the  evidence
collected during  investigation disclosed that the appellant
had assets  disproportionate to	 his known source of income,
as the	evidence was  not strong  enough to  lay prosecution
under Section 5 (1) (e) of the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_1">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>,
1947 [for  short, `the	Act'], the competent authority might
proceed against the appellant in a departmental inquiry.
</p><p id="p_7">     In furtherance  thereof on	 March 2, 1982 the appellant
was served  with the  charge-sheet containing  four specific
charges for violating different conduct rules and misconduct
of being  in possession	 of property disproportionate to his
known source  of income. After giving reasonable opportunity
and conducting	inquiry, the  Inquiry Officer  submitted his
report on  January 28, 1984 holding the charges to have been
proved. After  consultation with  the Union  Public  Service
Commission on  March 11,  1985, the  appellant was dismissed
from service  by order	dated October 29, 1986. The Tribunal
after appreciating  the	 evidence  upheld  all	the  charges
having been proved but converted the order of dismissal into
one of	compulsory retirement.	The appeal  was filed by the
delinquent officer  challenging the  findings on merits, and
the Union filed an appeal canvassing the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal to interfere with punishment imposed by it.
</p><p id="p_8">     Shri  Krishnamani,	  learned  senior  counsel  for	 the
appellant, raised three-fold contention. It is firstly urged
that   a    public   servant's	  possession	of    assets
disproportionate to  the known	source of  his income is not
defined	 to  be	 a  `misconduct'  under	 the  Civil  Service
(Classification &amp;  Control) Appeal  Rules. There is abnormal
delay  in  laying  the	charges.  Despite  the	pendency  of
inquiry, the  appellant was  promoted as Asstt. Commissioner
of Income-tax.	In consequence, no departmental action could
be taken  to dismiss  him from service. It is also submitted
that he	 was an	 intervener when all the cases including the
appeal filed  against <a href="/doc/727248/" id="a_2">Union  of India &amp; Ors. v. Mohd. Ramzan
Khan [JT</a>  (1990) 4  SCC 456]  were argued before three-judge
Bench. All  of them  had  been	given  the  benefit  of	 the
judgment. Misfortune  of the  appellant that  his appeal was
directed to  be posted	after the  decision in Ramzan Khan's
case. Since  the appellant  was admittedly not supplied with
the inquiry  report, the order of dismissal with the inquiry
report, the order of dismissal is invalid in law. This Court
in <a href="/doc/1919354/" id="a_3">Krishnanand	v. State of M.P</a>. [(1977) 1 SCC 816] had held
that 10%  of the disproportionate assets need to be deducted
in  arriving   at  the	 finding  that	 the  appellant	 had
disproportionate assets.  The appellant	 was found  to be in
possession of  Rs. 1,04,585/-.	The disproportionate  assets
were only to the tune of about Rs. 30,000/-. It would not be
axiomatic that	10% would  be a	 cut-off  deduction.  In  an
appropriate case deduction could be extended upto 15% and if
so extended,  the appellant  must  be  held  to	 be  not  in
possession of any disproportionate assets. The gifts made to
his wife  at the  time of their marriage and to his children
at the	time of their birthdays are not his assets. If these
amounts are  excluded, which  indeed must be excluded, he is
not in	possession of  disproportionate assets.	 The wife of
the appellant  is a  teacher. The income from her salary and
her gifts  of the  extent of  Rs.  21,000/-  require  to  be
excluded from  his assets.  Therefore, the  findings of	 the
Tribunal on merits were not valid in law.
</p><p id="p_9">     While resisting the contention, the learned counsel for
the Union  argued that	the Tribunal  was not  empowered  to
appreciate the	evidence nor  to consider  the	evidence  on
merits to  reach a  finding whether  the  appellant  was  in
possession of  disproportionate assets.	 The  Tribunal	went
wrong  in   appreciating  the	evidence.  The	disciplinary
authority  had	undoubted  power  and  authority  to  impose
punishment. On	the facts  found by  the inquiry Officer and
disciplinary authority	that the appellant was in possession
of the	assets disproportionate	 to the	 known source of his
income, the Tribunal was unjustified in interfering with the
punishment of  dismissal  from	service,  and  ordering	 for
compulsory retirement, instead.
</p><p id="p_10">     Having regard  to the respective contentions, the first
question that  arises for consideration is whether the order
dismissing the	appellant from service is invalid in law for
non-supply of  the inquiry  report. True,  in Ramzan  Khan's
case, a	 Bench of  three Judges	 to  which  one	 of  us	 (K.
Ramaswamy, J.) was a member, had held that the delinquent is
entitled to  the  supply  of  the  inquiry  report.  It	 was
contended from the appellant therein that after Amendment to
<a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_4">Article 311(2)</a>	of the	Constitution by	 Constitution  [42nd
Amendment] Act,	 1976, the need to supply the inquiry report
was obviated. Rejecting the contention, it was held that the
supply of  the copy  of the  inquiry report  is inconsistent
with fair  procedure and  non-supply  thereof  violates	 the
principles  of	natural	 justice.  Therefore,  copy  of	 the
inquiry report	is required to be supplied to the delinquent
officer. However,  it was  held	 that  the  said  ratio	 was
prospective in	operation. The judgment therein was rendered
on November 20, 1990.
</p><p id="p_11">     A question	 thereafter had	 arisen	 whether  the  ratio
would be  applicable to	 the order  passed  earlier  to	 the
judgment. On  reference to  the Constitution Bench, to which
two of	us (K.	Ramaswamy &amp;  B.P. Jeevan  Reddy,  JJ.)	were
members, it  was held  in <a href="/doc/1246653/" id="a_5">Managing Director, ECIL, Hyderabad
v. B.  Karunakar &amp;  Ors. [JT</a>  (1993) 6 SC 1] that the relief
granted in  Ramzan Khan's  case was  erroneous and  that the
ratio in  Ramzan Khan's	 case would  apply to the punishment
imposed by  the disciplinary authority after the date of the
judgment. Since	 the controversy  is no	 longer res integra,
the appellant  is not  entitled to  the	 benefit  of  Ramzan
Khan's ratio  as admittedly he was dismissed from service on
October 29,  1986 and the order of dismissal from service is
valid.
</p><p id="p_12">     It is  true that  pending disciplinary  proceeding, the
appellant was promoted as Asstt. Commissioner of Income-tax.
Two courses  in this behalf are open to competent authority,
viz., sealed  cover procedure  which is usually followed, or
promotion, subject  to the  result of  pending	disciplinary
action. Obviously,  the appropriate  authority	adopted	 the
latter course  and gave	 the benefit  of  promotion  to	 the
appellant. Such	 an action  would not stand as an impediment
to  take   pending  disciplinary   action  to	its  logical
conclusion.  The   advantage  of  promotion  gained  by	 the
delinquent  officer   would  be	  no  impediment   to	take
appropriate decision  and to  pass an  order consistent with
the finding of proved misconduct.
</p><p id="p_13">     The next  question is  whether the	 charge of  being in
possession of assets disproportionate to his known source of
income is  a misconduct.  <a href="/doc/1229833/" id="a_6">Section 5(1)</a> (e) of the Act (which
is equivalent  to <a href="/doc/669669/" id="a_7">Section  13(1)(e)</a>  of	 the  Prevention  of
Corruption  Act,  1988)	 defines  "criminal  misconduct".  A
public servant	is said	 to commit  the offences of criminal
misconduct  if	he  or	any  person  of	 his  behalf  is  in
possession or  has, at	any time  during the  period of	 his
office, been  in possession,  for which	 the public  servant
cannot satisfactorily account for. Thus, pecuniary resources
or property  disproportionate to  his known source of income
is a criminal misconduct. In the 1988 Act an explanation has
been added  to	<a href="/doc/669669/" id="a_8">Section	 13(1)(e)</a>  to  explain	that  "known
sources of  income" means  income received  from any  lawful
source and  such receipt  has been  intimated in  accordance
with the  provision of any law, rules or orders for the time
being applicable  to a	public servant.	 The charged officer
must be	 a public  servant.  He	 must  be  found  to  be  in
possession of,	by himself,  or through	 any person  on	 his
behalf, at  any	 time  during  the  period  of	his  office,
pecuniary resources  or	 property  disproportionate  to	 his
known source  of income. If he cannot satisfactorily account
thereof, he  is said  to have committed criminal misconduct.
No doubt  it s	a presumptive  finding but  that finding  is
based on  three facts.	Being a	 public servant,  if at	 any
time, during  the period of his office, he is proved to have
been in	 possession, by himself or through any person on his
behalf, of  pecuniary resources or property disproportionate
to  his	  known	 source	  of  income,	he  is	enjoined  to
satisfactorily account	for the same. If he fails to account
for, he	 commits misconduct.  Therefore, as in a prosecution
laid under <a href="/doc/1229833/" id="a_9">Section 5(1)(e)</a> of the Act (equivalent to <a href="/doc/669669/" id="a_10">Section
13(1)(e)</a> of  1988  Act),  a  public  servant  is  liable  to
punishment. The	 need to  make this  misconduct expressly  a
part of	 enumerated items  of misconduct under Central Civil
Services, CCA Rules is obviated.
</p><p id="p_14">     The ratio	in <a href="/doc/1606318/" id="a_11">A.L.	 Kalra v. Project &amp; Equipment Corpn</a>.
[(1984 (3)  SCC 316] has no application to the facts in this
case. Therein,	the misconduct	alleged was  failure of	 the
appellant to  refund the advance taken from the Corporation.
His omission  was charged  to be  a misconduct. The question
therein was  that when Rule 5 of the PEC Employees (Conduct,
Discipline  and	  Appeal)  Rules,  1975,  defined  "specific
misconduct", whether  in the  general norm  of behaviour the
omission  to   return  advance	 amount,   which   was	 not
specifically defined,  would constitute	 a misconduct.	This
Court held  that in  the gray  area it	is not	amenable  to
disciplinary action  unless the	 act is	 constituted  to  be
misconduct under  Rule 5  of the  said Rules. We, therefore,
hold  that   a	public	 servant  in  possession  of  assets
disproportionate to  his known source of income, when he had
not  satisfactorily  accounted	for,  commits  a  misconduct
amenable to  disciplinary action  under the  CSCCA Rules and
the Conduct Rules.
</p><p id="p_15">     The next  question is  whether the	 delay in initiating
disciplinary proceeding is an unfair procedure depriving the
livelihood of a public servant offending <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_12">Article 14</a> or 21 of
the Constitution. Each case depends upon its own facts. In a
case of	 the type  on hand, it is difficult to have evidence
of  disproportionate   pecuniary  resources   or  assets  or
property. The  public servant, during his tenure, may not be
known to  be in	 possession of	disproportionate  assets  or
pecuniary resources.  He may  hold either himself or through
somebody on  his behalf, property or pecuniary resources. To
connect the  officer with  the	resources  or  assets  is  a
tardious journey,  as the  Government has  to do  a  lot  to
collect	 necessary   material  in  this	 regard.  In  normal
circumstances, an  investigation would	be undertaken by the
police under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 to collect
and collate  the entire	 evidence establishing the essential
links  between	the  public  servant  and  the	property  or
pecuniary resources. Snap of any link may prove fatal to the
whole exercise.	 Care and  dexterity  are  necessary.  Delay
thereby necessarily  entails. Therefore,  delay by itself is
not fatal  in this type of cases. It is seen that the C.B.I.
had investigated  and recommended  that the evidence was not
strong enough  for successful  prosecution of  the appellant
under  <a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_13">Section	5</a>  (1)(e)  of  the  Act.  It  had,  however,
recommended to take disciplinary action. No doubt, much time
elapsed in  taking necessary  decisions at different levels.
So, the	 delay by itself cannot be regarded to have violated
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_14">Article 14</a> or 21 of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_16">     Judicial review  is not an appeal from a decision but a
review of the manner in which the decision is made. Power of
judicial review	 is meant  to  ensure  that  the  individual
receives  fair	 treatment  and	  not  to  ensure  that	 the
conclusion  which   the	 authority  reaches  is	 necessarily
correct in  the	 eye  of  the  court.  When  an	 inquiry  is
conducted on  charges of misconduct by a public servant, the
Court/Tribunal is concerned to determine whether the inquiry
was held  by a	competent officer or whether the inquiry was
held by	 a competent  officer or  whether rules	 of  natural
justice	 are   complied	 with.	 Whether  the	findings  or
conclusions  are  based	 on  some  evidence,  the  authority
entrusted with	the power  to hold inquiry has jurisdiction,
power  and   authority	to   reach  a  finding	of  fact  or
conclusion. But that finding must be based on some evidence.
Neither the  technical rules of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_15">Evidence Act</a> nor of proof of
fact or	 evidence as  defined therein, apply to disciplinary
proceeding. When  the authority	 accepts that  evidence	 and
conclusion  receives  support  therefrom,  the	disciplinary
authority is entitled to hold that the delinquent officer is
guilty of  the charge.	The Court/Tribunal  in its  power of
judicial review	 does not  act as appellate authority to re-
appreciate the evidence and to arrive at its own independent
findings on  the evidence.  The Court/Tribunal may interfere
where  the   authority	held  the  proceedings	against	 the
delinquent officer  in a  manner inconsistent with the rules
of natural  justice  or	 in  violation	of  statutory  rules
prescribing the	 mode of  inquiry or where the conclusion or
finding reached by the disciplinary authority is based on no
evidence. If  the  conclusion  or  finding  be	such  as  no
reasonable   person    would   have    ever   reached,	 the
Court/Tribunal may  interfere with  the	 conclusion  or	 the
finding, and  mould the	 relief so as to make it appropriate
to the facts of each case.
</p><p id="p_17">     The disciplinary  authority is the sole judge of facts.
Where appeal  is presented.  The appellate authority has co-
extensive power	 to reappreciate  the evidence or the nature
of punishment. In a disciplinary inquiry the strict proof of
legal  evidence	 and  findings	on  that  evidence  are	 not
relevant. Adequacy  of evidence	 or reliability	 of evidence
cannot	 be   permitted	  to   be   canvassed	before	 the
Court/Tribunal. <a href="/doc/1137632/" id="a_16">In Union of India v. H.C. Goel</a> [(1964) 4 SCR
781], this  Court held	at page	 728 that if the conclusion,
upon  consideration   of  the	evidence,  reached   by	 the
disciplinary authority,	 is perverse  or suffers from patent
error on  the face  of the record or based on no evidence at
all, a writ of certiorari could be issued.
</p><p id="p_18">     <a href="/doc/220487/" id="a_17">In Union  of India	 &amp; Ors.	 v. S.L. Abbas</a> [(1993) 4 SCC
357], when  the order  of transfer  was	 interfered  by	 the
Tribunal, this	Court held  that the  Tribunal	was  not  an
appellate authority  which could substitute its own judgment
to that bona fide order of transfer. The Tribunal could not,
in such	 circumstances, interfere with orders of transfer of
a Government  servant. <a href="/doc/235166/" id="a_18">In  Administrator of  Dadra  &amp;  Nagar
Haveli v.  H.P. Vora</a>  [(1993) Supp.  1 SCC 551], it was held
that  the  Administrative  Tribunal  was  not  an  appellate
authority  and	 it  could   not  substitute   the  role  of
authorities to clear the efficiency bar of a public servant.
Recently, in  State bank  of  <a href="/doc/704495/" id="a_19">India  &amp;	Ors.  v.  Samarendra
Kishore Endow  &amp; Anr.  [J</a>] (1994) 1 SC 217], a Bench of this
Court to which two of us (B.P. Jeevan Reddy &amp; B.L. Hansaria,
JJ.) were  members, considered	the order  of the  Tribunal,
which quashed  the charges  as based on no evidence, went in
detail into  the question  as to  whether the  Tribunal	 had
power to  appreciate the  evidence while exercising power of
judicial  review   and	held   that  a	Tribunal  could	 not
appreciate the evidence and substitute its own conclusion to
that of	 the disciplinary authority. It would, therefore, be
clear that  the Tribunal  cannot embark upon appreciation of
evidence to substitute its own findings of fact to that of a
disciplinary/appellate authority.
</p><p id="p_19">     It is,  therefore, difficult  to go  into the  question
whether	 the   appellant  was	in  possession	of  property
disproportionate to  the known	source of  his	income.	 The
findings of  the disciplinary  authority and that of Inquiry
Officer are  based on evidence collected during the inquiry,
They  reached	the  findings  that  the  appellant  was  in
possession of  Rs.30,000/- in  excess of  his satisfactorily
accounted for  assets from  his known  source of income. The
alleged gifts  to his  wife as stridhana and to his children
on their  birthdays  were  disbelieved.	 It  is	 within	 the
exclusive domain of the disciplinary authority to reach that
conclusion. There is evidence in that behalf.
</p><p id="p_20">     It is  true that  a three-judge  Bench of this Court in
Krishanand's case  (supra) held	 in para  33,  that  if	 the
excess was  comparatively small (it was less than 10% of the
total income  in that  case), it would be right to hold that
the assets  found in  the possession of the accused were not
disproportionate to  his known	source of income raising the
presumption under  sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/616856/" id="a_20">Section 5</a>. It is to be
remembered that the said principle was evolved by this Court
to give	 benefit of  doubt, due to inflationary trend in the
appreciation of the value of the assets. The benefit thereof
appears to  be the  maximum. The  reason being	that if	 the
percentage begins  to rise  in each  case, it  gets extended
till it reaches the level of incredulity to give the benefit
of doubt.  It would,  therefore,  be  inappropriate,  indeed
undesirable, to extend the principle of deduction beyond 10%
in  calculating	 disproportionate  assets  of  a  delinquent
officer. The  salary of	 his wife  was not  included in	 the
assets of  the appellant.  The alleged stridhana of his wife
and fixed deposits or gifts of his daughter, in appreciation
of evidence,  were held to be the property of the appellant.
It is  in  the	domain	of  appreciation  of  evidence.	 The
Court/Tribunal has  no power  to appreciate the evidence and
reach its own contra conclusions.
</p><p id="p_21">     The next question is whether the Tribunal was justified
in  interfering	  with	the   punishment  imposed   by	 the
disciplinary authority.	 A Constitution	 Bench of this Court
in <a href="/doc/1865363/" id="a_21">State  of Orissa Ors. v. Bidyabhushan Mohapatra</a> [AIR 1963
SC 779]	 held that  having regard  to  the  gravity  of	 the
established misconduct,	 the  punishing	 authority  had	 the
power and jurisdiction to impose punishment. The penalty was
not open  to review  by the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_22">Article 226.</a> If
the High  Court	 reached  a  finding  that  there  was	some
evidence to  reach the	conclusion, it	became unassessable.
The  order   of	 the   Governor	 who  had  jurisdiction	 and
unrestricted power  to determine  the appropriate punishment
was final.  The High Court had no jurisdiction to direct the
Governor to  review the penalty. It was further held that if
the order  was supported  on any  finding as  to substantial
misconduct for	which punishment  "can lawfully be imposed",
it was	not for	 the Court  to consider	 whether that ground
alone would  have weighed  with the  authority in dismissing
the public  servant. The  court had  no jurisdiction, if the
findings prima	facie made  out a  case	 of  misconduct,  to
direct the Governor to reconsider the order of penalty. This
view was  reiterated in	 <a href="/doc/680932/" id="a_23">Union of  India v.  Sardar  Bahadur</a>
[(1972) 2  SCR 218].  It is true that in <a href="/doc/198394/" id="a_24">Bhagat Ram v. State
of Himachal Pradesh &amp; Ors</a>. [AIR 1983 SC 454], a Bench of two
Judges of  this Court, while holding that the High Court did
not function  as a  court of appeal, concluded that when the
finding was  utterly perverse,	the High  Court could always
interfere with	the same. In that case, the finding was that
the appellant  was to  supervise felling  of the trees which
were not  hammer marked.  The Government  had recovered from
the contractor	the loss  caused to it by illicit felling of
trees. Under  those circumstances,  this Court held that the
finding of  guilt was  perverse and unsupported by evidence.
The ratio,  therefore, is  not an authority to conclude that
in every  case the  Court/Tribunal is empowered to interfere
with the  punishment imposed  by the disciplinary authority.
<a href="/doc/960749/" id="a_25">In Rangaswami  v. State	 of Tamil Nadu</a> [AIR 1989 SC 1137], a
Bench of  three Judges	of this Court, while considering the
power to  interfere with  the order of punishment, held that
this Court.  while exercising the jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_26">Article
136</a> of the Constitutions, is empowered to alter or interfere
with  the   penalty;  and  the	Tribunal  had  no  power  to
substitute its	own discretion for that of the authority. It
would be  seen that  this  Court  did  not  appear  to	have
intended  to   lay  down   that	 in   no  case,	  the	High
Court/Tribunal has the power to alter the penalty imposed by
the disciplinary or the appellate authority. The controversy
was again  canvassed in	 State Bank of India's case (supra),
where the  court elaborately  reviewed the  case law  on the
scope of  judicial review  and powers  of  the	Tribunal  in
disciplinary matters  and nature of punishment. On the facts
in that case, since the appellate authority had not adverted
to the	relevant facts,	 it was	 remitted to  the  appellate
authority to impose appropriate punishment.
</p><p id="p_22">     A review  of the  above legal  position would establish
that the disciplinary authority, and on appeal the appellate
authority, being  fact-finding	authorities  have  exclusive
power to  consider the	evidence with  a  view	to  maintain
discipline. They  are invested with the discretion to impose
appropriate punishment	keeping in  view  the  magnitude  or
gravity of  the misconduct.  The High  Court/Tribunal, while
exercising the	power of  judicial review,  cannot  normally
substitute its	own conclusion	on penalty  and impose	some
other penalty. It the punishment imposed by the disciplinary
authority or  the appellate  authority shocks the conscience
of the High Court/Tribunal, it would appropriately mould the
relief,	  either    directing	the   disciplinary/appellate
authority to  reconsider the  penalty imposed, or to shorten
the litigation,	 it may	 itself,  in  exceptional  and	rare
cases. impose  appropriate punishment with cogent reasons in
support thereof.
</p><p id="p_23">     The Tribunal  in this  case held that the appellant had
put in	30 years  of  service.	He  had	 brilliant  academic
record. He was successful in the competitive examination and
was selected as a Class I Officer. He earned promotion after
the disciplinary  proceeding  was  initiated.  It  would  be
difficult to get a new job or to take a new profession after
50 years  and he is "no longer fit to continue in government
service". Accordingly,	it  substituted	 the  punishment  of
dismissal from	service	 to  one  of  compulsory  retirement
imposed by  the disciplinary  authority. We  find  that	 the
reasoning is  wholly  unsupportable.  The  reasons  are	 not
relevant nor  germane to  modify the  punishment. In view of
the gravity  of the misconduct, namely, the appellant having
been found to be in possession of assets disproportionate to
the known  source of  his income,  the interference with the
imposition of  punishment was wholly unwarranted. We find no
merit in the main appeal which is accordingly dismissed with
no order as to costs.
</p><p id="p_24">C.A. No.3604 of 1988
     Consequently, the	appeal of  the	Union  of  India  is
allowed. The  order of the Tribunal modifying the punishment
is set	side and  that	of  the	 disciplinary  authority  is
maintained. In	the circumstances  parties to bear their own
costs.

HANSARIA, J.
</p><p id="p_28">     I am  in respepctful agreement with all the conclusions
reached by  learned brother  Ramaswamy, J.  This  concurring
note is to express my view on two facets the case. The first
of these  relates to  the power of the High Court. The to do
"complete justice",  which power  has been  invoked in	some
cases by  this Court  to alter	the punishment/penalty where
the one	 awarded has  been regarded  as dispropotionate, but
denied to  the High  Courts. No	 doubt, <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_27">Article	 142</a> of	 the
Constitution has  specifically conferred  the power of doing
complete justice  on this  Court, to achieve which result it
may pass  such decree or order as deemed necessary; it would
be wrong  to think  that other courts are not to do complete
justice between the parties. If the power of modification of
punishment/penalty were	 to be	available to this Court only
under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_28">Article  142</a>, a  very large  percentage  of  litigants
would be  denied this  small relief  merely because they are
not in	a position  to approach this Court, which may, inter
alia, be  because of the poverty of the concerned person. It
may be	remembered that	 the  framers  of  the	Constitution
permitted  the	 High  Courts	to  even   strike   down   a
parliamentary enactment,  on such a case being made out, and
we have	 hesitated to concede the power of even substituting
a punishment/penalty,  on such a case being made out. What a
difference? May	 it be	pointed out  that Service  Tribunals
too, set  up with the aid of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_29">Article 323-A</a> have the power of
striking down a legislative act.
</p><p id="p_29">2.   The aforesaid  has, therefore, to be avoided and I have
no doubt  that a High Court would be within its jurisdiction
to modify  the punishment/penalty  by moulding	the  relief,
which power  it undoubtedly  has, in  view of  long line  of
decisions of  this Court,  to which  reference is not deemed
necessary, as  the position  is well settled in law. It may,
however, be  stated that  this power  of moulding  relief in
cases of  the present  nature can be invoked by a High Court
only when the punishment/penalty awarded shocks the judicial
conscience.
</p><p id="p_30">3.   It deserves  to be	 pointed out that the mere fact that
there is  no provision	parallel to  <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_30">Article 142</a> relating to
the High  Courts, can  be no  ground to think that they have
not to	do complete  justice between  the parties,  the same
cannot be  ordered. Absence of provision like <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_31">Article 142</a> is
not material,  according to  me. This  may be illustrated by
pointing out  that despite  there being	 no provision in the
Constitution parallel  to <a href="/doc/249731/" id="a_32">Article  137</a> conferring  power  of
review on  the High  Court, this Court held as early as 1961
in Shivdeo  Singh's case,  AIR 1963  SC 1909,  that the High
Courts too  can exercise  power of  review, which inheres in
every court  of plenary jurisdiction. I would say that power
to do  complete justice	 also inheres in every court, not to
speak of  a court of plenary jurisdiction like a High Court.
of course,  this power	is not	as wide which this Court has
under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_33">Article 142.</a> That, however, is a different matter.
</p><p id="p_31">4.   What has been stated above may be buttressed by putting
the matter  a little differently. The same is that in a case
of dismissal, <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_34">Article 21</a> gets attracted. And, in view of the
inter-dependence of  fundamental rights,  which concept	 was
first  accepted	  in  the   case  commonly   known  as	Bank
Nationalisation case,  1970 (3)	 SCR 530, which thinking was
extended to cases attracting <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_35">Article 21</a> in <a href="/doc/1766147/" id="a_36">Maneka Gandhi vs.
Union of  India</a>. AIR  1978 SC  597,  the  punishment/penalty
awarded has  to be  reasonable; and  if it  be unreasonable,
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_37">Article 14</a> would be violated. That <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_38">Article 14</a> gets attracted
in a  case of  disproportionate punishment  was the  view of
this Court in <a href="/doc/198394/" id="a_39">Bhagat Ram vs. State of Himachal Pradesh</a>, 1983
(2) SCC	 442 also. Now if <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_40">Article 14</a> were to be violated, it
cannot be  doubted that	 a High	 Court can  take care of the
same by	 substituting, in  appropriate cases,  a  punishment
deemed reasonable by it.
</p><p id="p_32">5.   No doubt,	while exercising  power under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_41">Article 226</a> of
the Constitution,  the High  Courts have to bear in mind the
restraints inherent  in exercising power of judicial review.
It is because of this that substitution of High Court's view
regarding appropriate punishment is not permissible. But for
this constraint, I would have thought that the law makers do
desire application  of judicial mind to the question of even
proportionality	 of   punishment/penalty.  I  have  said  so
because the  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_42">Industrial Disputes  Act</a>, 1947  was amended  to
insert <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_43">section	11A</a> in	it to  confer this  power even	on a
Labour Court/Industrial	 Tribunal. It may be that this power
was conferred  on these	 adjudicating authorities because of
the prevalence of unfair labour practice or victimisation by
the management.	 Even so,  the power  under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_44">section  11A</a>  is
available to be exercised, even if there be no victimisation
or taking  recourse  to	 unfair	 labour	 practice.  In	this
background, I  do not  think if	 we would  be  justified  in
giving much  weight to	the decision  of the employer on the
question  of   appropriate  punishment	in  service  matters
relating to  Government employees or employees of the public
corporations. I have said so because if need for maintenance
of office  discipline be the reason of our adopting a strict
attitude qua  the public  servants,  discipline	 has  to  be
maintained in  the industrial  sector also. The availability
of appeal  etc. to  public servants  does not  make  a	real
difference, as	the appellate/revisional  authority is known
to have	 taken a  different view on the question of sentence
only rarely.  I would,	therefore, think  that but  for	 the
self-imposed limitation while exercising power under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_45">Article
226</a> of	the Constitution,  there is  no inherent  reason  to
disallow application  of judicial  mind to  the question  of
proportionately	 of   punishment/penalty.  But	then,  while
seized with  this question  as a  writ court interference is
permissible only  when the  punishment/penalty is shockingly
disproportionate.
</p><p id="p_33">6.   I had  expressed my  unhappiness qua the first facet of
the case, as Chief Justice of the Orissa High Court in paras
20 and	21 of  <a href="/doc/1590934/" id="a_46">Krishna Chandra	v. Union  of India</a>, AIR 1992
Orissa 261  (FB), by  asking why the power of doing complete
justice has  been denied  to the  High Courts ? I feel happy
that I	have been  able to  state, as  a Judge	of the	Apex
Court, that  the High Courts too are to do complete justice.
This is also the result of what has been held in the leading
judgment.
