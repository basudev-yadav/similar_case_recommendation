 CORAM: JUSTICE S. MURALIDHAR
       JUSTICE TALWANT SINGH

                                       JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">Dr. S. Muralidhar, J.:
</p>
<p id="p_2">Introduction
</p><p id="p_3">1. These are six appeals directed against the same impugned common
judgment dated 8th July, 2019 passed by the learned Single Judge in
interlocutory applications filed in the corresponding suits by the Respondents
in these appeals. By the said judgment, the learned Single Judge has injuncted
the Appellants from selling the goods of the Respondents, who claim to be
Direct Selling Entities (‗DSEs') in terms of the Model Framework for
Guidelines on Direct Selling dated 26th October, 2016 i.e. Direct Selling
Guidelines (‗DSGs'), on the Appellants' e-commerce platforms.
</p>

<p id="p_4">2. Three of the present appeals i.e. FAO (OS) 133/2019, 134/2019 and
135/2019 are by Amazon Seller Services Private Limited (‗Amazon') against
Amway India Enterprises Private Limited (‗Amway'), Oriflame India Private
Limited (‗Oriflame') and Modicare Limited (‗Modicare'), respectively. Two
of the appeals, FAO (OS) 141/2019 and 142/2019 are by Cloudtail India
Private Limited (‗Cloudtail') against Amway and Oriflame respectively. The
sixth appeal i.e. FAO (OS) 157/2019 is by Snapdeal Private Limited
(‗Snapdeal') against Amway.
</p>

<p id="p_5">3. Since common questions of law arise from the impugned judgment of the
learned Single Judge and the pleadings in the corresponding suits, they are

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                              Page 4 of 69</span>
 being disposed of by this judgment.
</p>

<p id="p_6">4. At the outset, it is required to be noticed that the parties before the Court
have categorically stated that the suits filed by the Respondents and the
corresponding appeals before this Court are not to be considered as arising out
of ―commercial disputes‖, falling within the purview of the Commercial
Courts Act, 2015 (‗CCA'). They have accordingly been heard by this Bench,
which is otherwise not authorised to hear appeals which are to be heard by the
Commercial Appellate Division of this Court in terms of the CCA.
</p>

<p id="p_7">Facts in Amazon's appeals
</p><p id="p_8">5. Amway is engaged in the manufacture and distribution business of its
healthcare, wellness, cosmetic, and home products through a business model
called the Direct Selling Business Model (‗DSBM'). The products offered for
sale by Amway include moisturizers, creams, lipsticks, detergents, surface
cleaners, shaving creams, deodorants etc. Amway claims that it has given an
undertaking to the Government of India (‗GoI') to abide by the DSGs in the
conduct of its business. Amway also sells its products on its own online
market place, www.amway.in.
</p>

<p id="p_9">6. Amway is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amway Corporation, now known
as Alticor Inc., headquartered at Ada, Michigan, USA. The parent company
which was founded in 1959 applied to the Ministry of Industry, GoI in June,
1994 for setting up a wholly owned subsidiary to replicate the ―Amway
Model‖, proposing to ―establish and develop a direct selling business of
products which shall be sourced from local independent Indian manufacturers

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                Page 5 of 69</span>
 particularly small scale units by providing technology support to products of
international standard‖.
</p>

<p id="p_10">7. After the GoI granted its approval to Amway Corporation by an order dated
26th August, 1994 to commence operations in India as a DSE in terms of its
proposal, Amway came to be incorporated on 3rd August, 1995. On 4th
August, 2004, GoI granted approval to Amway to set up its own
manufacturing facilities for manufacture of personal care and cosmetic
products and to also import fragrances, shampoos, lotions, body firming gels,
scrubs etc. This was made subject to the conditions which inter-alia were that
Amway would not undertake domestic retail trading in any form and that the
imports would be in accordance with the prevailing Export-Import (‗EXIM')
policy. Amway obtained a licence from the Food Safety and Standards
Authority of India (‗FSSAI') in terms of Food Safety and <a href="/doc/79442359/" id="a_1">Standards Act</a>, 2006
(‗FSS Act') and the Food Safety and Standards Regulation, 2011 (‗FSS
Regulation').
</p>

<p id="p_11">8. Amway Corporation is stated to be a member of the World Federation of
Direct Selling Associations (‗WFDSA') and is stated to operate in more than
100 countries and territories worldwide. Explaining the DSBM, Amway states
that such a model offers an ―unparalleled opportunity‖ to Indian customers
―to own and operate their own business by enrolling themselves as a Direct
Seller‖ with Amway and sell its ―high-quality consumer products on a
principal-to-principal basis under a Direct Seller Contract‖. In terms of the
said contract, the Direct Sellers undertake ―the sale, distribution and
marketing of ‗Amway Products' and services and to register as Preferred

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                              Page 6 of 69</span>
 Customers‖. Amway claims to have provided opportunities to about 5,00,000
active independent Amway Direct Sellers. It provides training to such Direct
Sellers and Distributors and also offers a digital learning portal for Amway
Business Owners (‗ABOs').
</p>

<p id="p_12">9. Amway claims that it has a ―Code of Ethics‖ for Amway Direct Sellers. All
products of Amway are stated to be marked with an express declaration that
they are ―sold only by Amway Business Owners‖.
</p>

<p id="p_13">10. According to Amway, its products bear a ―unique code‖. This is stated to
be located on the ―upper surface of the cap of the product packaging‖ which
allows Amway ―to track the distributor channel, selling the said product to an
end customer‖. The imprinting of these unique codes is stated to ensure
prevention of the circulation and sale of any counterfeit Amway products
through unauthorized trade channels. According to Amway, the trust of its
Direct Sellers and their customers receives the highest attention and it has a
―Customer Product Refund Policy‖, covering all Amway Products, which
allows a customer who is not completely satisfied, to return the product
within 30 days of the purchase of invoice/delivery. This refund policy is
applicable to ―products in saleable condition, and partially used products
(30%) accompanied with an invoice‖. According to Amway, it has a
nationwide presence with 130 sales offices, 4 regional warehouses, 3 regional
hubs and 34 city warehouses catering to over 8900 pin codes across the
country. It is the founder member of the Indian Direct Sellers Association
(‗IDSA') which is stated to be an ―autonomous self-regulatory body for the
direct selling industry in India‖.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                              Page 7 of 69</span>
<p id="p_14"> 11. According to Amway, the DSGs are stated to have been issued by the
notification dated 26th October, 2016 of the Department of Consumer Affairs
at the request of IDSA in order to prevent fraud and to protect the rights and
interests of consumers.
</p>

<p id="p_15">12. The central issue highlighted in Amway's Suit CS (OS) 480/2018 filed in
this Court against Pioneering Products, and Black Olive Enterprises
(Defendant Nos. 1 and 2 respectively) who are sellers on Amazon's online
platform, Cloudtail (Defendant No. 3) another seller on Amazon's platform
and stated to be an ―affiliate/associate company of Amazon‖, and Amazon
(Defendant No. 4), was that Amway cannot sell its products through channels
of e-commerce/online portals or mobile apps. According to Amway, sale of
its products through any e-commerce or online portal in the absence of a
written contract with Amway, is unauthorised both in terms of its ―Code of
Ethics‖ as well as clause 7 (6) of the DSGs. Amway claims that it has not
provided any written consent to any of its Direct Sellers to undertake or solicit
sale, or offer its products through third party e-commerce websites/ mobile
apps. Amway is unable to guarantee the authenticity and quality of such
products which are purchased from unauthorised sources and its product
refund policy does not apply to such unauthorised purchases.
</p>

<p id="p_16">13. Amway claims that it received complaints from its Direct Sellers that
Amway products were being sold on various e-commerce/online portals or
mobile apps and wholesale and retail shops illegally at unwarranted discounts
resulting in a decline in the sales of the Amway's Direct Sellers. The further
allegation was that such unauthorised sellers registered on the e-commerce

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                 Page 8 of 69</span>
 platforms/shops were removing the unique code imprinted on Amway
products to avoid the distributor channel from being identified or tracked.
</p>

<p id="p_17">14. According to Amway, it learnt sometime in September, 2017 that Amazon
is offering for sale Amway products on its e-commerce portal/website,
―www.amazon.in‖ and its mobile application ―Amazon Online Shopping‖
without its permission or knowledge. A snapshot of the website of Amazon
incorporated in the plaint revealed that Amway's ―Nutrilite Daily- 120N
tablets‖ were being offered for sale on the said website. It is stated that such a
sale on Amazon's online platform was unauthorised, since it was without the
leave, permission or licence of Amway, which has till date not authorised
anyone to sell or advertise its products on Amazon's Online Platform. It was
averred in the plaint that this was in direct violation of the Clause 7 (6) of the
DSGs, which states :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "Any person who sells or offers for sale, including on an e-commerce
      platform/ marketplace, any product or service of a Direct Selling
      Entity must have prior written consent from the respective Direct
      Selling Entity in order to undertake or solicit such sale or offer."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_18">15. It was further averred in the plaint that Amway's products were being sold
by the Defendants at much cheaper prices than the market price and that this
cast ―serious doubts‖ on the authenticity of Amway's products sold by the
Defendants. It was claimed that Amway ―has been facing huge financial
losses on account of the illegal activities of the Defendants.‖


</p><p id="p_19">16. On 22nd September, 2017, Amway sent a cease and desist notice to
Amazon, asking it ―to remove reference to any statement/advertising/display

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                  Page 9 of 69</span>
 of ‗Amway products' from its website.‖


</p><p id="p_20">17. Amazon is stated to have replied to Amway by a letter dated 11 th October,
2017, denying Amway's contentions and emphasizing that it merely provided
an online platform for sale of various consumer goods and products by
different registered sellers/vendors; that it did not monitor or control the
transactions occurring on its website or mobile application, and that Amway
could initiate action against its vendors/sellers, who were engaged in selling
Amway products online without its authority or consent or selling spurious
and counterfeit products under its name. According to Amway, Amazon's
stand was contrary to Amazon's ―exclusion policy‖ that did not allow on its
online portal the sale of products by a person in the following situations:
  ―who is not (a) the "authorized reseller" (as designated by the
  manufacturer or distributor; or (b) where the manufacturer's standard
  warranty is not being provided to the consumer; or (c) where the
  product is placed on the market without the consent of the relevant
  brand or trademark owner.‖

</p><p id="p_21">18. Amway sent another notice dated 6th November, 2017 to Amazon refuting
the averments made by Amazon in their reply dated 11th October, 2017.
Amway contended that Amazon was ―actively involved‖ in the sale of its
products and was ―providing services such as helping sellers manage their
accounts, increase visibility, discoverability and sale of products, listing of
products etc‖. According to Amway, Amazon was also publishing
advertisements in the print media offering Amway products on its online
portal.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                 Page 10 of 69</span>
<p id="p_22"> 19. Amway states that Amazon and its affiliates were not acting merely as
―intermediaries‖, but were actively involved in the sale of Amway products.
This averment is in the context of Amazon contending that it falls within the
definition of an ―intermediary‖ under <a href="/doc/117176/" id="a_2">Section 2</a> (1) (w) of the <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_3">Information
Technology Act</a>, 2000 (‗<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_4">IT Act</a>') and that subject to <a href="/doc/844026/" id="a_5">Section 79</a> (2) and (3)
thereof, it would under <a href="/doc/844026/" id="a_6">Section 79</a> (1) be exempt from any liability arising out
of content uploaded by third parties such as sellers on Amazon's online
platform ―www.amazon.in‖. Amazon also refers to the Information
Technology       (Intermediary         Guidelines)   Rules,   2011   (‗Intermediary
Guidelines') which requires due diligence to be undertaken by intermediaries,
which Amazon claims to have complied with.

<p id="p_23">20. In the plaint it is averred that on 21st September, 2018 Amway's
representative purchased the Amway products from Amazon's website.
</p>

<p id="p_24">21. Further, a reference was made to the fact that by an order dated 1st June,
2018 in CS (OS) 297/2018 filed by Amway against ―some identified and
unidentified medical shops/pharmacist in Bhagirath Palace, Delhi‖, this Court
had granted an ad interim injunction and John Doe order against all the
Defendants in the said suit. The Court also appointed four Local
Commissioners (‗LCs') and during raids it was found that Amway products
worth lakhs of rupees with or without unique codes had been seized in the
shops of such Defendants. Reference is also made to two other Civil Suits
being CS (OS) 410/2018 and 453/2018 filed by Amway against two online
aggregators/market places, in which an interim injunction restraining those
online market places from selling Amway's products, without its prior

 authorisation, was passed. The LCs appointed in those suits were also asked
to make an inventory of the Amway products being sold, to seal them and
return them on superdari.
</p>

<p id="p_25">22. The prayers in CS (OS) 480/2018, inter-alia were for a decree of
permanent injunction restraining the Defendants ―from in any manner
purchasing, possessing, selling, distributing, offering for sale, advertising/
displaying Plaintiff's 'Amway products' on the website of Defendant No. 4 i.e.
www.amazon.in and mobile application "Amazon Online Shopping" or any
other website/mobile application or any other portal without the prior written
consent of the Plaintiff.‖


</p><p id="p_26">23. The prayer against Amazon apart from the above reliefs, was for a
permanent injunction restraining Amazon, its ―Directors, vendors, sellers,
agents, affiliates, servants, licensees, franchisees, representatives and
employees or any one claiming under them, directly or indirectly, from in any
manner purchasing, possessing, selling, distributing, offering for sale,
advertising/ displaying Plaintiffs 'Amway products' from its website
www.amazon.in and mobile application "Amazon Online Shopping" or any
other platform, without the prior written consent of the Plaintiff.‖


</p><p id="p_27">24. The further incidental prayer was for a direction to the Defendants to
―disclose the details of the distributors/dealers/Direct-Sellers of the Plaintiff
from whom they are procuring the ‗Amway products' or any other person or
entity involved in such unauthorised transaction of ‗Amway products'‖. The
final prayer in the plaint was for a decree of damages in the sum of Rs.

<p id="p_28"> 2,00,01,000/- together with interest at 18% per annum thereon from the date
of filing of the suit till its realisation apart from unquantified punitive
damages.
</p>

<p id="p_29">25. At the first hearing of the suit i.e. CS (OS) 480/2018 on 26th September,
2018, the learned Single Judge passed an order granting an interim injunction
restraining the Defendant Nos. 1 to 3 not to offer for sale any of the products
in the Amway range either through the website ―www.amazon.in‖ or through
their mobile application. Further if the same were genuine products,
Defendant Nos. 1 to 3 were permitted to approach Amway to establish the
same, and if they were able to obtain Amway's written approval then ―they
may be permitted to sell the products.‖ As far as Amazon was concerned, it
was noted in the order that its counsel had agreed to take down Amway
listings from the online platform. It was accordingly directed that Amazon
shall within three days, pull down all Amway listings on both the e-commerce
platform and the mobile application and confirm the same to Amway through
the counsel. It was stated that ―the question as to whether the e-commerce
platform is liable in such situations and whether the doctrine of exhaustion
would apply, would be gone into on the next date of hearing‖.
</p>

<p id="p_30">26. By the same order, the learned Single Judge disposed of IA No. 13160/
2018 by appointing four LCs to visit the premises of Defendant Nos. 1 to 3
and directing them to ―make an inventory and take into custody all impugned
products, including packaging, labels, stationery, hoardings and other
materials bearing the mark ―AMWAY‖. The LCs were authorised to seal the
impugned products and return them on superdari after obtaining undertakings

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                               Page 13 of 69</span>
 of the respective Defendants.
</p>

<p id="p_31">27. The four LCs so appointed, submitted their respective reports to the Court
on 6th, 12th, 15th and 16th October, 2018 respectively. Amazon filed an
additional affidavit dated 31st May, 2019. The applications were heard along
with similar applications in the other connected suits.
</p>

<p id="p_32">28. The interim injunction applications in the suits were heard on 13 dates
between 10th January, 2019 and 30th May, 2019 on which date judgment was
reserved. The impugned judgment was thereafter pronounced on 8th July,
2019 granting the relief as noticed hereinbefore.
</p>

<p id="p_33">29. As far as the other two appeals of Amazon are concerned, FAO (OS) 134/
2019 arises out of the suit CS (OS) 91/2019 filed by Oriflame against six
Defendants of which Defendant Nos. 1 to 5 were registered sellers on
Amazon. This included Cloudtail as Defendant No. 1 and Defendant No. 6
was Amazon itself.
</p>

<p id="p_34">30. This suit was first listed on 14th February, 2019 when an order on similar
terms as the interim order dated 26th September, 2018 in the Amway Suit [CS
(OS) No. 480/2018] was passed. The suit of Oriflame was based entirely on
the DSGs, claiming that the said guidelines have the force of law.
</p>

<p id="p_35">31. At this stage of the case, Ms. Maninder Acharya, learned Additional
Solicitor General of India (‗ASG') appeared and submitted that the Direct
Selling Guidelines ―have to be followed though they are advisory in nature‖.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                 Page 14 of 69</span>
<p id="p_36"> According to the ASG, guidelines of such nature had been issued ―by various
Ministries and have binding effect under <a href="/doc/990669/" id="a_7">Article 77</a> of the Constitution.‖ It
was noted by the learned Single Judge in the order dated 14th February, 2019
that an affidavit would be filed in that regard. An interim injunction of similar
nature was issued. It may be noted here that Oriflame too claims that it is a
DSE which is bound by the DSGs and that the sale of its products on
Amazon's online platform without its consent, would be in violation of
Clause 7 (6) of the DSGs.
</p>

<p id="p_37">32. The third appeal by Amazon, i.e. FAO (OS) 135/2019, arises from CS
(OS) 75/2019 filed by Modicare which also claims to be a DSE governed by
the DSGs. This suit was filed against Amazon (Defendant No. 1) and two
other sellers on Amazon's platform i.e. Laxmi Enterprises (Defendant No. 2)
and Modicare DP Store (Defendant No. 3). On 5th February, 2019, an order
was passed in the said suit by the learned Single Judge granting interim
injunction on the same lines as the order dated 26 th September, 2018 in CS
(OS) 480/2018 filed by Amway.
</p>

<p id="p_38">Facts concerning appeals by Cloudtail and Snapdeal
</p><p id="p_39">33. The two Appeals by Cloudtail, FAO (OS) 141/2019 &amp; 142/2019 arise
from the aforementioned suits filed against Amazon and the sellers on its
platform which included Cloudtail, by Amway and Oriflame respectively. It is
Cloudtail's case that it too is an ―intermediary‖ in terms of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_8">IT Act</a> and the
Intermediary Guidelines. It too raises questions regarding the legal binding
effect of the DSGs.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                 Page 15 of 69</span>
<p id="p_40"> 34. The 6th Appeal is by Snapdeal. It arises out of CS (OS) 453/2018 filed by
Amway against nine Defendants with the ninth Defendant being Jasper
Infotech Private Limited (‗Jasper Infotech') which runs the e-commerce
website ―www.snapdeal.com‖. It may be noticed here that the name of Jasper
Infotech has been changed to Snapdeal on 20th March, 2019. Defendant Nos.
1 to 8 in the suit were sellers on the online platform of Defendant No. 9.
Snapdeal too claims that its operations on its online market place was limited
to facilitating the buying and selling of various goods and services between
independent sellers and independent buyers. In other words, it was acting
merely as an intermediary and did not directly engage in the sale or purchase
of the products.
</p>

<p id="p_41">35. As far as Snapdeal is concerned, the refrain in its appeal is that in the
impugned judgment, the learned Single Judge has completely omitted to refer
to the contentions of Snapdeal and has made observations vis-a-vis all the
Defendants before it, without referring to the particular facts of the suit
involving Snapdeal. As far as CS (OS) 453/2018 is concerned, it was first
listed for hearing on 14th September, 2018 when an interim injunction was
passed in I.A. No. 12419/2018. LCs were also appointed by the same order.
Snapdeal contended inter alia that the LC found no goods at its premises
which supports its contention that they were never involved in the handling of
Amway products and that further, there was no evidence of any tampered
goods of Amway being sold on Snapdeal's platform.
</p>

<p id="p_42">The Impugned Judgment
</p><p id="p_43">36. At this stage, it requires to be noticed that the impugned judgment of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                              Page 16 of 69</span>
 learned Single Judge was passed in seven suits, five of which, i.e. CS (OS)
410/2018, 453/2018, 480/2018, 531/2018 and 550/2018, were filed by
Amway and one each, CS (OS) 75/2019 and 91/2019, were filed by Modicare
and Oriflame respectively.
</p>

<p id="p_44">37. It also requires to be noted here that Union of India was not made a party
in any of the suits. However, when the Oriflame Suit CS (OS) 91/2019 was
first listed on 13th February, 2019, the learned Single Judge issued notice to
the learned ASG in order to elicit the stand of Union of India in respect of the
legality and validity of the DSGs, and listed the matter for the following day
i.e. 14th February, 2019 on which date an order was passed which has been
referred to hereinbefore. The impugned judgment reflects that apart from all
other counsel for the private parties, the learned ASG was also heard by the
learned Single Judge.
</p>

<p id="p_45">38. In para 142 of the impugned judgment the learned Single Judge
formulated the following four issues for determination:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">       ―i) Whether the Direct Selling Guidelines, 2016 are valid and
       binding on the Defendants and if so, to what extent?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">       ii) Whether the sale of the Plaintiffs' products on e-commerce
       platforms violates the Plaintiffs' trademark rights or constitutes
       misrepresentation, passing off and results in dilution and
       tarnishes the goodwill and reputation of the Plaintiffs' brands?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">       iii) Whether e-commerce platforms are "intermediaries" and are
       entitled to protection under the safe harbour provided in <a href="/doc/844026/" id="a_9">Section
       79</a> of the Information Technology Act and the Intermediary
       Guidelines of 2011?
</blockquote>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                Page 17 of 69</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">        iv) Whether e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, Snapdeal,
       Flipkart, 1MG, and Healthkart are guilty of tortious interference
       with the contractual relationship of the Plaintiffs with their
       distributors/direct sellers?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">       v) What is the relief to be granted?‖

</blockquote><p id="p_46">39. The conclusion of the learned Single Judge in the impugned judgment vis-
a-vis the above issues can be summarised thus:
</p><p id="p_47">(i) the Direct Selling Guidelines have been framed in terms of the legal
procedure, and are binding in law. They have been issued and notified in
terms of the <a href="/doc/990669/" id="a_10">Article 77</a> of the Constitution of India and it is the only document
that regulates the business of Direct Selling;
</p><p id="p_48">(ii) the present Appellant/Defendants were found guilty of infringing the
trademarks of the present Respondents/Plaintiffs, of dilution/tarnishment,
passing off, and misrepresentation;
</p><p id="p_49">(iii) the Defendants were not merely passive players but in fact, ―massive
facilitators‖ inasmuch as they were providing warehousing, logistical support,
packaging and delivery services; the bare minimum that the Defendants are
required to do to avail the exemption under <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_11">Section 79</a> (2) (c) of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_12">IT Act</a>,
would be to observe due diligence required under <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_13">Section 79</a> (2) (c);
</p><p id="p_50">(iv) the continued sale of the products of the Plaintiffs on the e-commerce
platforms without their consent, results in inducement of breach of contract,
and tortious interference with contractual relationships of the Plaintiffs with
their distributors;
</p><p id="p_51">(v) the balance of convenience lies in the favour of the Plaintiffs; the online
platforms were unable to establish that the products of the Plaintiffs sold
thereon were ―genuine and not tampered with or impaired‖.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                Page 18 of 69</span>
<p id="p_52"> 40. The learned Single Judge further concluded that the DSGs were binding in
nature since ―they do not impinge on any fundamental rights of either the
sellers or the platforms.‖ It was concluded that if the online platforms were
permitted to violate the DSGs, the DSEs would be left with no remedies to
enforce a binding law. The DSGs having been authenticated by a Gazette
notification were binding on e-commerce platforms and sellers on such
platforms. It was held that the online platforms were aware that they were
bound to enforce the said guidelines which reflected the current public policy
and that the online platforms had ―deliberately chosen to only set up the
alleged illegality and non-binding nature of these guidelines only by way of
defence.‖


</p><p id="p_53">41. In coming to the above conclusion the learned Single Judge referred to the
decisions in Bijoe Emmanuel v. State of Kerala (1986) 3 SCC 615 hereafter
('Bijoe Emmanuel'), Union of India v. Naveen Jindal (2004) 2 SCC 510,
Gulf Goans Hotels Company Limited v. Union of India (2014) 10 SCC 673,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                              Page 19 of 69</span>
</p><p id="p_55"> 42. The learned Single Judge also distinguished the decisions in <a href="/doc/1599714/" id="a_14">G.J.
Fernandez v. State of Mysore</a> AIR 1967 SC 1753, <a href="/doc/59183655/" id="a_15">Syndicate Bank v.
Ramachandran Pillai</a> (2011) 15 SCC 398 and the decision dated 23rd April,
2019 of the Bombay High Court in Commercial Suit IP No.114/2018 (Tips
Industries v. Wynk Music Limited) in their applicability to the case at hand.
</p>

<p id="p_56">43. On the second question of whether the sale of the Plaintiffs' products by
the Defendants violated the Plaintiffs' trademark rights, the learned Single
Judge opened the discussion by observing in para 175 of the impugned
judgment that the Plaintiffs in each of the suits i.e Amway, Modicare and
Oriflame ―are the owners of their respective trademarks.‖ The Defendants
were found guilty of infringing the above trademarks and diluting it and
passing off as their own misrepresenting their association with Amway,
Oriflame and Modicare. It was concluded that the principles of exhaustion in
terms of <a href="/doc/1881111/" id="a_16">Section 30</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 (‗TM Act') did not exempt
the Defendants from liability thereunder and the manner of sale on the e-
commerce platforms also constituted passing off, misrepresentation and
dilution/tarnishment of the products and business of the Plaintiffs.
</p>

<p id="p_57">44. It was held by learned Single Judge that the condition imposed by the
Plaintiffs on the buyers of their products restricting post-sale alienation on an
online market place without their consent, was an enforceable condition and
that the Defendants should be restrained in terms thereof from offering any of
their products including genuine and untampered ones on their online market
places. It was held that the services provided by the online platforms
amounted to infringement under <a href="/doc/176471/" id="a_17">Sections 29</a> (6) and 29 (8) of the TM Act;
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                   Page 20 of 69</span>
<p id="p_58"> that the manner of information provided for each listing on the websites of
Amazon and Snapdeal could cause confusion amongst the consumers thereby
misrepresenting an association of the online market place with the brand of
product. It was further held that the Plaintiffs had legitimate reasons to restrict
resale of the products under <a href="/doc/454306/" id="a_18">Section 30</a> (4) of the TM Act.
</p>

<p id="p_59">45. On the basis of the reports of the LCs, the learned Single Judge concluded
that there was large scale tampering of the products of the Plaintiffs; there
was a change of warranty of such products and that such products were re-
packaged and re-sealed by the online market places. Since the source of the
goods sold on the online market places were not easily determinable, they
were not lawfully acquired in terms of <a href="/doc/454306/" id="a_19">Section 30</a> (3) of the TM Act.
</p>

<p id="p_60">46. The learned Single Judge noted the contention of the Defendants that the
suits were not based on violation of trade mark rights and observed that
―While it may be true that the plaints are not structured like a traditional
trademark plaint would be, the same does not mean that the Plaintiffs do not
complain of violations of trademark rights.‖ It was further observed that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">       ―The allegations in the plaint are clearly based on provisions akin
       to misrepresentation in the context of passing off and dilution, as
       also violation of trademark rights as stipulated and protected
       under <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_20">Section 29</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999. Moreover, the
       defence of <a href="/doc/371543/" id="a_21">Section 30</a> has been set up by the Defendants only
       because they are aware that if the said defence fails, the use of
       the Plaintiffs' marks results in infringement.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_61">47. In arriving at the above conclusion the learned Single Judge discussed and
distinguished the decision of the Division Bench of this Court in Kapil

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                  Page 21 of 69</span>
 Wadhwa v. Samsung Electronics Company Limited MIPR 2012 (3) 0191.
</p>

<p id="p_62">48. The learned Single Judge distinguished the cases cited by the Defendants
and discussed their inapplicability. These included the decision dated 23rd
May, 2017 in Case No. 2016-1290 (Milo &amp; Gabby v. Amazon.com Inc.), Tre
Milano, LLC v. Amazon.com, the decision dated 24th July, 2018 in <a href="/doc/206650/" id="a_22">Civil
Act</a>ion No.17-2738 (FLW) (LHG) (Allstate New Jersey Insurance Company

280 (W.D. La. 1991), Matrix Essentials v. Emporium Drug Mart 988 F.2d
587 (5th Cir., 1993), Sebastian Intern v. Long Drug Stores 53 F.3d 1073 (9 th
Cir., 1995) and the decision of the Canadian Supreme Court in Consumers
Distributing Company Limited v. Seiko Time Canada Limited (1984) 1
S.C.R. 583.
</p>

<p id="p_63">49. The learned Single Judge also relied on the decision dated 3rd July, 2019
of the US Court of Appeals in Case No. 18-1041 (Heather R. Oberdorf v.
Amazon.com Inc), the decision of the European Court of Justice decided on
23rd April, 2009 in C-59/08 (Copad SA v. Christian Dior Couture SA), the
decision dated 18th December, 2018 of the Court in Milan in G.R. No.
44211/2018 (<a href="/doc/203491/" id="a_23">Landoll S.R.L v. MECS S.R.L</a>) and the decision dated 19th
November, 2018 in G.R. No. 38739/2018 (L'Oreal Italia SPA v. IDS
International Drugstore Italia SPA).
</p>

<p id="p_64">50. The learned Single Judge held that changes in warranty, refund/return
policies, changes in packaging, removal of codes of the products, and any
other conduct that causes damage to the reputation of the mark and is likely to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                               Page 22 of 69</span>
 undermine the quality of the mark, would constitute ‗impairment' inasmuch
as the online platforms use the trademarks of the Plaintiffs' products in their
advertising, promotion and sale offers and in the meta-tags, so that the
product listings on the platforms are thrown up on search results. Further,
since the Defendants also provided warehousing, transport and other logistical
facilities in the absence of consent from the Plaintiffs, it would result in a
―clear infringement of the Plaintiffs' trademarks and the doctrine of
exhaustion does not come to the aid of the Defendants.‖ It was held that the
use of the Plaintiffs' marks clearly constituted ‗use' under <a href="/doc/545792/" id="a_24">Section 2</a> (2) (c) of
the TM Act, 1999. It was concluded that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">       ―The use of the Plaintiffs' marks clearly constitutes 'use' under
       <a href="/doc/629401/" id="a_25">Section 2</a> (2)(c) of the TM Act, 1999 which is the reason why the
       platforms obtain licenses for the marks from the sellers and
       warranties that they are authorised and that the products are
       genuine. These licences are themselves FAKE because the so-
       called licensors are not the owners of the marks nor do they have
       any permission to licence the marks. What is not owned cannot
       be licensed. Sellers have no rights if owners have not given
       consent.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_65">51. The learned Single Judge further held that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">       "The platforms are also indulging in conduct falling under
       <a href="/doc/297137/" id="a_26">Section 29(6)</a> of the Trade Marks Act as they are affixing the
       marks on the products, packaging the same and putting the same
       in the market for sale. Amazon is specifically using the Plaintiffs'
       mark Amway in advertising, without actual knowledge that the
       said products being sold on its platform are genuine or not and
       whether they are tampered with or not.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_66">52. Reference was made by learned Single Judge to the decision of the
Division Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/503400/" id="a_27">Baker Hughes Limited v. Hiroo Khushalani</a>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                 Page 23 of 69</span>

       sellers and by the platforms is violative of the Plaintiffs'
       trademark rights and the Defendants' are not entitled to the
       defence under <a href="/doc/1881111/" id="a_29">Section 30</a>. The manner of sale on the e-commerce
       platforms also constitutes passing off, misrepresentation and
       dilution/tarnishment of the Plaintiffs' marks, products and
       businesses.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_67">53. Turning to Issue (iii), the learned Single Judge concluded that the e-
commerce platforms were not merely passive players but ―in fact are massive
facilitators‖ inasmuch as they were providing warehousing, logistical support,
packaging, delivery services, payment services, collection gateways etc.
Reference was made to the FDI Press Note No. 2 of 2018 issued by the GoI in
respect of FDI in e-commerce, and its para 5.2.15.2.2 which defines e-
commerce.

<p id="p_68">54. Reference was also made by learned Single Judge to the decisions in
<a href="/doc/99622088/" id="a_30">Christian Louboutin SAS v. Nakul Bajaj</a> 2018 (76) PTC 508 (Del) and
judgement of the Supreme Court of India in <a href="/doc/110813550/" id="a_31">Shreya Singhal v. Union of

 (<a href="/doc/91242023/" id="a_34">Kent RO Systems Private Limited v. eBay India Private Limited</a>).
</p>

<p id="p_69">55. In conclusion, on issue (iii), the learned Single Judge held as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">       ―304. The question as to how the platforms are providing the
       value-added services and whether they are performing an active
       role in the same, would have to be finally adjudicated at trial.
       However, the bare minimum that they would be required to do to
       avail the exemption under <a href="/doc/1306592/" id="a_35">Section 79(2)(c)</a>, would be to observe
       due diligence required under <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_36">Section 79(2)(c)</a> of the IT Act.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">       305. Thus, in order for the platforms to continue to enjoy the
       status of intermediaries, subject to adjudication at trial, the due
       diligence requirements would have to be met and complied with,
       as per the Platforms' own policies, and as per the Intermediary
       Guidelines. 2011. Non-compliance with the Platforms' own
       policies would take them out of the ambit of the safe harbour.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_70">56. On the last issue, i.e. issue (iv) regarding tortious interference with
contractual relations, the learned Single Judge observed interalia that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">       ―The companies and entities, which run e-commerce platforms,
       have a greater obligation to maintain the sanctity of contracts,
       owing to the sheer magnitude and size of their operations. When
       an e-commerce platform is notified of existing contracts and
       violation of the same on its platform, the least that the platform
       would have to do would be to ensure that it is not a party, which
       encourages or induces a breach. The manner, in which e-
       commerce platforms operate, makes it extremely convenient and
       easy for ABOs/distributors/direct sellers to merely procure the
       products from the Plaintiffs and defeat the purpose of the
       contractual obligations by selling in the grey market to
       unidentified persons, who may, thereafter, put them in the e-
       commerce stream, without any quality controls. In this manner,
       such ABOs/ distributors/ sellers may sell outdated products,
       expired products, damaged products and hide behind the cloak of
       the platforms themselves. Since none of the platforms, except

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                 Page 25 of 69</span>
        IMG, to an extent, are even disclosing the complete details of the
       sellers, they offer a comfortable refuge for parties breaching their
       contracts with the Plaintiffs. This refuge by itself constitutes
       inducement.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_71">57. It was concluded by learned Single Judge that ―the continued sale of the
Plaintiffs' products on the e-commerce platforms, without the consent of the
Plaintiffs, results in inducement of breach of contract, and tortious
interference with contractual relationships of the Plaintiffs with their
distributors.‖


</p><p id="p_72">58. In arriving at the above conclusions, the learned Single Judge referred
extensively to an Article by John Danforth titled ―Tortious Interference with
Contract: A Reassertion of Society's Interest in Commercial Stability and
Contractual Integrity‖ Columbia Law Rev. Vol. 81 No. 7, 1491 and the
Commentary titled ―Salmond &amp; Heuston on the Law of Torts‖, R. F. V.
Heuston and R. A. Buckley, 20th Edition Universal Book Traders at page 358,
as well as the decisions in <a href="/doc/1255547/" id="a_37">Aasia Industrial Technologies Limited v.
Ambience Space Sellers Limited</a> (1998) 18 PTC 316 (DB) and the judgment

and Company Private Limited v. Sea Traders Private Limited</a> (1990) SCC
Online Cal 55.
</p>

<p id="p_73">59. In the concluding portion of the impugned judgment under the title
―Conclusions and Relief‖, it was concluded that the Plaintiffs had established
a prima facie case, that the balance of convenience is in their favour and that
irreparable injury would be caused to the Plaintiffs, their businesses and all

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                 Page 26 of 69</span>
 those who depended on them and finally the consumers, if the interim relief as
prayed for was not granted. It was observed that none of the online platforms
were able to establish that the Plaintiffs' products sold thereon were ―genuine
and not tampered with or impaired.‖ They had also not been able to show how
the licences of the Plaintiffs' marks were granted to the e-commerce
platforms.
</p>

<p id="p_74">60. Some broad observations were made by the learned Single Judge
concerning all the products of the Plaintiffs, by relying on the report of the
LCs, in the following manner:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">       ―However, most of the Local Commissioners who have visited
       the various premises of the sellers and the platforms have seen
       that the products are being tampered with by removal of the
       codes, removal of the inner seal. Thinners and glues are being
       used to remove the codes and the products are being re-sealed,
       may be even under unhygienic conditions. In some cases, expired
       products are being given new manufacturing dates. Such
       tampering and impairment is, clearly, violative of the Plaintiffs'
       statutory and common law rights.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_75">61. On the policies of the online platforms, it was observed by learned Single
Judge as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">       ―All the platforms have their own policies, which broadly state
       that they respect the Intellectual Property Rights of trademark
       owners and that upon any grievance being raised, they are
       willing to take down. The Policies of all the platforms clearly are
       simply ‗Paper policies' which are clearly not being adhered to as
       the facts of these cases go to show. They are a mere lip-service to
       the Intermediary Guidelines of 2011. None of the platforms are
       insisting on any of the sellers obtaining consent of the Plaintiffs
       for sale of their products on the e-commerce platforms, where
       their own policies require them to do so. Unless and until, the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                Page 27 of 69</span>
        sellers are authorized by the Plaintiff, they cannot be allowed to
       sell the Plaintiffs products on Defendant's e-commerce
       platforms.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_76">62. It was further observed by learned Single Judge that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">       "The argument of exhaustion completely fails as there is large-
       scale impairment of the goods as also misrepresentations being
       made on the platforms. Conditions of the goods being sold on the
       e-commerce platforms has been changed. The MRPs are shown
       to be higher in some cases. Wrong attribution of product names
       is also happening on some of the platforms. The source of the
       products listed on the platforms are suspect. The listings are also
       misleading as they use the Plaintiffs' product images, marks,
       logos, names, etc. giving an impression that the products are sold
       by the Plaintiffs themselves. The consumer is not being told that
       the seller is not authorised by the Plaintiffs, to sell the said
       products. A consumer would, literally, require investigative
       capabilities to trace the actual seller.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_77">63. On whether the DSGs are considered binding law, and on how the
Plaintiffs' right to carry on business was being affected by the actions of the
Defendants, it was further reiterated by the learned Single Judge that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">       ―324. The Direct Selling Guidelines are law. While the
       Defendants' platforms and sellers insist on their <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_39">Article 19(l)(g)</a>
       rights being jeopardised, what is lost sight of is the fact that the
       Plaintiffs' right to carry on business is being affected. It is being
       jeopardized in view of the large-scale violations on the e-
       commerce platforms. Further, the rights of genuine consumers
       are being affected, as is evident from the various comments,
       which consumers have put up on these platforms, after
       purchasing the Plaintiffs' products from the said platforms.</blockquote>
<p id="p_78">       Insofar as the sellers themselves are concerned, many of them
       have given undertakings and have agreed for injunctions being
       passed. The other sellers who are themselves listed on the
       platforms have to assume responsibility for the products and
       establish that they are genuine. None of them have been able to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                  Page 28 of 69</span>
         establish that the products are genuine and not tampered with or
        impaired. They have also not been able to show as to how they
        granted licence of the Plaintiffs' marks to the e-commerce
        platforms.‖

The present appeals
</p><p id="p_79">64. It requires to be noticed that only some of the Defendants in the above
suits have come forward to file appeals. Amazon, which was Defendant No. 4
in CS (OS) 480/2018, Defendant No. 1 in CS (OS) 75/2019 and Defendant
No. 6 in CS (OS) 91/2019 has filed three appeals; Cloudtail, which was
Defendant No. 3 in CS (OS) 480/2018 and Defendant No. 2 in CS (OS) 91/
2019 has filed its two appeals, and Snapdeal, which was Defendant No. 9 in
CS (OS) 453/2018 has filed the 6th Appeal. The remaining Defendants in the
above seven suits have not challenged the impugned judgment of the learned
Single Judge. They have also not appeared in the present appeals wherever
they have been impleaded.
</p>

<p id="p_80">65. While admitting the appeals on 25th July, 2019 this Court permitted the
parties to file their respective written submissions and listed the interim
applications in the appeals for hearing on 17th February, 2020. Thereafter
applications for advancing of the date of hearing were filed. These
applications were allowed on 30th September, 2019 and the applications for
interim relief were listed for hearing on 9 th October, 2019. Thereafter these
appeals were heard finally on 9th and 15th October, 2019, 5th November and
14th November, 2019, 14th December, 20th December and 21st December,
2019.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                               Page 29 of 69</span>
<p id="p_81"> 66. This Court has heard the submissions of Mr. Gurukrishna Kumar, learned
Senior Counsel appearing for the Cloudtail, Mr. Saikrishna Rajgopal, learned
counsel appearing for Amazon; Mr. Rajshekar Rao learned counsel appearing
for Snapdeal; Mr. Parag Tripathi, learned Senior Counsel and Ms. Priya
Kumar, learned counsel appearing for Amway; Mr. Balbir Singh, learned
Senior Counsel appearing for the Oriflame and Mr. Jayant Bhushan, learned
Senior Counsel appearing for Modicare.
</p>

<p id="p_82">Prefatory observations
67.1 The Court would like to preface the discussion on the issues with brief
observations on the nature of the suits themselves. From the plaints and the
suits filed, four to be precise, it is plain that none of them was filed as a
commercial suit, since none of them was framed as a suit either for passing
off or for infringement in terms of the TM Act.
</p>

<p id="p_83">67.2 The second factor to be kept in mind is that in none of the suits was there
any prayer for a declaration that the DSGs are law that bind the Defendants
and that, as such, they are enforceable. Thirdly, there was again no prayer for
a declaration that Amazon and Snapdeal were not ―intermediaries‖ within the
meaning of <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_40">Section 79</a> of the IT Act. These factors attain significance in light
of the fact that the learned Single Judge has returned specific findings, which
clearly run contrary to the structure and frame of the suits themselves.
</p>

<p id="p_84">67.3. Another aspect that bears noting is that the impugned judgment runs into
225 pages and returns extensive findings, without expressing any caveat that
such findings may be prima facie or tentative findings, limited for the purpose

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                 Page 30 of 69</span>
 of granting interim relief. The said findings, even on a conservative basis, can
be characterized as expressing a final opinion at an interlocutory stage. The
many issues on which findings were returned are of a nature which necessitate
evidence to be led by the parties and the matter having to go for trial to test
the veracity of the cases of the respective parties. In fact, the issues that have
been framed in the impugned judgement for the purposes of relief appear to
travel far beyond the pleadings in the suits and, in fact, at a stage when the
issues in the suits themselves are yet to be framed.
</p>

<p id="p_85">67.4 Given the nature of the plaints and the prayers made therein, it is highly
unlikely that the issues that were framed by the learned Single Judge for the
purpose of considering the grant of interim reliefs would be the issues in the
suits themselves. For instance, corresponding to the first issue whether the
DSGs are in the nature of binding law there is no prayer in the suits
themselves. It is doubtful, therefore, whether such an issue could have been
framed in the suits . Likewise, in the absence of any prayer declaring that
online    platforms      like   Amazon,   Snapdeal     and   Cloudtail      are    not
―intermediaries‖ within the meaning of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_41">IT Act</a>, it is unlikely that such an
issue could be framed in the suits.
</p>

<p id="p_86">67.5 There was also no question raised in relation to the constitutional validity
of the DSGs either in the plaints or in the written statements and affidavits
filed by the Appellants/Defendants in their suits and applications under Order
XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2<a href="/doc/206650/" id="a_42"> of the Code</a> of Civil Procedure, 1908 (‗CPC'). It is,
therefore, surprising that the learned Single Judge has extensively examined
the question of the constitutional validity of the DSGs.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                     Page 31 of 69</span>
<p id="p_87"> 67.6 The learned Single Judge appears to have taken into account the
submissions of the Union of India, when it was not even a party to any of the
suits. These are suits governed by the CPC. The procedure adopted by the
learned Single Judge in requiring the learned ASG to address arguments on
behalf of the Union of India at an interlocutory stage, without it being party to
the suits themselves, was, therefore, untenable.
</p>

<p id="p_88">67.7 It would be a different matter if the plaints themselves supported the case
that the DSGs are indeed law and an officer of the Union of India was
summoned as a witness in the trial. The Court on its own requiring the Union
of India to address it on this aspect, in a civil suit, is indeed a deviation from
the CPC itself, which would strictly govern the adjudication of civil suits filed
on the original side of this Court. That this Court has original jurisdiction does
not mean under that jurisdiction the Court will assume to itself the powers of
a Writ Court. The flexibility of procedure that may be available to the Court
while dealing with a writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_43">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, is not,
and ought to not be adopted while dealing with civil suits filed on the original
side, which would be strictly governed by the provisions of the CPC read with
the corresponding provisions of the <a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_44">Delhi High Court Act</a> and the Original
Side Rules of the Delhi High Court.
</p>

<p id="p_89">67.8 In such circumstances, the question of what value the ASG's submission
would have in determining the preliminary issue of the nature of the DSGs is
a question that ought to have been addressed, but was not, by the learned
Single Judge. The view expressed by the ASG before the learned Single

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                  Page 32 of 69</span>
 Judge on the nature of the DSGs, can, at best, said to be ‗advisory' and not
‗evidence'.
</p>

<p id="p_90">68. With these preliminary observations, the Court proceeds to examine each
of the four issues, the conclusions pertaining to which, form the basis of the
impugned judgment of the learned Single Judge.
</p>

<p id="p_91">Are the DSGs law?
</p><p id="p_92">69. The first issue formulated by the learned Single Judge was whether the
DSGs ―are valid and binding on the Defendants, and if so, to what extent‖? It
must be noted at the outset that this issue itself has been erroneously framed.
Even going by the submissions made before the learned Single Judge, or for
that matter before this Court, the question to be addressed was whether the
DSGs were ‗law' and whether suits could have been filed by the Plaintiffs for
enforcing the DSGs?
</p>

<p id="p_93">70. It is clear from the first line of para 146 of the impugned judgment, that
the stand of the Appellants/Defendants, as noted by the learned Single Judge,
is that ―the DSGs are not law and they are merely advisory in nature‖. The
learned Single Judge notes the further submission that according to the
Defendants, the DSGs were ―merely a model framework for State
Governments and Union Territories to come out with an actual legal
mechanism to enforce the same‖ and that ―they are not binding in nature‖. It
is in the next sentence that the learned Single Judge appears to have
committed an error while noting that the Appellants/ Defendants had urged
that the DSGs ―are not law under <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_45">Article 13</a> of the Constitution as they

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                               Page 33 of 69</span>
 impinged upon the Fundamental Rights of the platforms and the sellers of the
platforms guaranteed under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_46">Article 19 (1) (g)</a> of the Constitution‖.
</p>

<p id="p_94">71. It has been repeatedly urged before this Court that this was not the
contention of the Defendants. In particular, it is the case of the Amazon that
they did not in fact challenge the constitutional validity of the DSGs. Their
submission was that these were mere guidelines which could not be
characterized as ‗law' and cannot, therefore, regulate the exercise of the
fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution.
</p>

<p id="p_95">72. The learned Single Judge appears to have committed an error in re-
phrasing the ―the first and foremost question‖, as ―whether any right under
<a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_47">Article 19 (1) (g)</a> of the Constitution is impinged by the issuance of these
guidelines‖. What was required to be addressed first was the issue whether the
DSGs were indeed ‗law' and were the suits seeking enforcement of such law
be maintainable?
</p>

<p id="p_96">73. At this stage, it is important to examine the DSGs. A perusal of the
notification dated 26th October, 2016 issued by the Department of Consumer
Affairs reveals that an Inter-Ministerial Committee (‗IMC') was constituted
by the Government of India with representatives of the Ministry of Finance,
Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, the Department of Legal
Affairs, the Department of Information and Technology and the Ministry of
Corporate Affairs. Besides these five ministries and departments, the
representatives of the Government of NCT of Delhi, the States of Andhra
Pradesh and Kerala were also part of the said IMC. They were to look into

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                  Page 34 of 69</span>
 ―the matters concerning the direct selling industries‖. This IMC is stated to
have held consultations with ―stakeholders‖ before formulating the ―model
guidelines for the States and the Union Territories‖ for protecting the
―legitimate rights and interests of industry and consumers‖. What was
envisaged was that ―the State Governments will set up a mechanism to
monitor/supervise the activities of direct sellers, DSEs regarding compliance
for guidelines for direct sellers‖.    In other words, even in terms of this
notification, what was being notified were only ―model guidelines‖.
</p>

<p id="p_97">74. The model guidelines envisaged a DSE to submit an undertaking to the
Department of Consumer Affairs (‗DoCA) by 9th December, 2016, stating
therein that it was in compliance thereof and was to also provide the details of
its incorporation. The notification urged the State Governments and Union
Territories to take ―necessary action to implement the guidelines‖. Enclosed
with the said notification were ―model guidelines on direct selling English
and Hindi‖ and ―the Performa (sic) for declaration and undertaking‖.
</p>

<p id="p_98">75. The title of the enclosed document explains its nature: ―Advisory to State
Governments/Union Territories: Model Framework for Guidelines on Direct
Selling‖. Consequently, it is clear that the DSGs were not meant to be treated
as law themselves, much less binding law. It was only to be a model
framework and ―advisory‖ in nature. It was for the State Governments to
adopt it into law. Therefore, Clause 7 (6) of these ‗model guidelines' is also
purely advisory.
</p>

<p id="p_99">76. The learned Single Judge in the impugned judgment has noticed the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                Page 35 of 69</span>
 background to the formulation of the guidelines, but crucially overlooked the
fact that these were not in the form of ―executive instructions‖ at all. A
careful reading of the notification reveals that the guidelines have been issued
by the DoCA. Its power to frame such guidelines can be traced back to the
<a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_48">Consumer Protection Act</a>, 1986 (‗CPA'). The mere fact that the FSSAI may
have written to e-commerce platforms to comply with the guidelines would
not make them law.
</p>

<p id="p_100">77. Any doubt in this regard now stands dispelled by the communication
dated 11th November, 2019 issued by the DoCA in the Ministry of Consumer
Affairs under the subject ―Rules to be notified under the <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_49">Consumer Protection
Act</a>, 2019 - Comments from the stakeholders on draft rules - Reg‖. This has
come as a result of the CPA, 2019, which was published in the official gazette
on 9th August, 2019. The CPA, 2019, itself is yet to become operational, as it
is awaiting the formulation of Rules thereunder.
</p>

<p id="p_101">78. This communication dated 11th November, 2019 notes that Rules under
various topics are required to be notified under the new Act. Eight such topics
have been notified and in Sl. No. 6 are the ―Consumer Protection (Direct
Selling) Rules, 2019‖. Stakeholders were invited to offer their views and
suggestions on the draft Rules till 2nd December, 2019. A comparison of the
text of draft Consumer Protection (Direct Selling) Rules, 2019 with the DSGs
shows that the former almost entirely replicates the latter. Rule 8 (6) of the
draft Rules, for instance, is a verbatim reproduction of Clause 7 (6) of the
DSGs. Interestingly, even the definition of the ―Act‖ under Rule 2 (1) (a) is
identical to Clause 1 (1) of the Model Direct Selling Guidelines, 2016 and is

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                Page 36 of 69</span>
 defined to mean ―CPA‖, with only the year being different; in the DSGs it is
CPA, 1986, whereas in the draft Rules it is CPA, 2019.
</p>

<p id="p_102">79. Clearly, therefore, what was being invoked was the mechanism of
formulating Rules under an existing statute that governs the subject, viz., the
CPA. There was no occasion, therefore, to treat these draft DSGs, traceable as
they were to the CPA, as ―executive instructions‖. The learned Single Judge
appears to have missed this significant aspect of the matter. A large portion of
the impugned judgment has been devoted to discussing the case law around
―executive instructions‖ which filled up the lacuna of the statutory law on the
topic, when there was no occasion to adopt that route to find the DSGs to be
binding.
</p>

<p id="p_103">80. The learned Single Judge started off by accepting the plea of the ASG that
the DSGs were issued in exercise of the powers conferred under Articles 73
and 77 of the Constitution. Clearly, that is not what the notification stated. It
clearly mentioned these as only ‗guidelines' which were ‗advisory'. The
distinction between rules, which are made under a statute, regulations, which
also ought to be traced to a statute, and mere ‗guidelines', was lost sight of by
the learned Single Judge.
</p>

<p id="p_104">81. The Plaintiffs appear to have jumped the gun in not waiting for the law to
be formally made and enforced. It is possible that once the CPA Rules are
notified, questions would further arise as to whether such rules, and in
particular Rule 8 (6) thereof violated, as contended by the Appellants/
Defendants, Section 30 of the TM Act or <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_50">Section 79</a> of the IT Act. At the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                 Page 37 of 69</span>
 stage at which it was before the learned Single Judge, these questions were
moot and purely hypothetical.
</p>

<p id="p_105">82. Significantly, had the learned Single Judge addressed the issue whether
the DSGs did in fact have the character of law, there would have been no need
to go into the further issue of whether they violated any fundamental rights.
The route adopted by the learned Single Judge was to first examine the
second question, viz., whether the DSGs violated any fundamental right, and
having answered that in the negative, to conclude that they are accordingly
valid and binding ‗law'.
</p>

<p id="p_106">83. The learned Single Judge relied on the decision in Ram Jawaya Kapoor
(supra) to conclude that instances of exercise of executive power, where there
was no violation of fundamental rights, ―even if not traceable to a statute‖,
cannot be questioned. The facts that the Supreme Court was confronted with
in that case were that publishers of the text books raised a challenge to certain
executive instructions issued by the State Government. The State Government
took upon itself the task of publishing and printing text books published by
different publishers by giving a mere 5% royalty to the publishers. The action
of the State Government was not, however, traceable to any statute as such.
</p>

<p id="p_107">84. In the present case, it is not the government, but private entities like
Amway, Oriflame and Modicare, which are trying to seek enforcement of the
DSGs. In fact, they are seeking to enforce guidelines against third parties and
not against those who might be bound by the DSGs, as and when it becomes
law. Merely because the DSGs are notified in the Gazette, they do not attain

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                 Page 38 of 69</span>
 the status of ―law‖ within the meaning of <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_51">Article 13</a> of the Constitution. The
source of the power to frame such guidelines is traceable only to the CPA.
With the CPA, 2019 itself not having been notified, these draft guidelines
could not have attained the character of ―binding Rules‖ under the CPA,
2019, or for that matter, even under the CPA, 1986. When clearly even the
draft guidelines mentioned the Act to be the CPA, there was no occasion for
the learned Single Judge to accept the plea that they could be sourced to
Articles 73 or 77 of the Constitution of India. Therefore, there was no
occasion to apply the decision in Ram Jawaya Kapoor (supra).
</p>

<p id="p_108">85. The fact that the DSGs may not have been challenged in a Court of law is
neither here nor there. If they were not law in the first place, there was no
occasion for the Defendants/Appellants to challenge it. They would be right in
proceeding on the basis that as they were not law in the first place and any
challenge to such draft guidelines would have been premature.

       copyright in the text-books vested -absolutely in the State and the
       authors and others received royalty on the sale of those text-</blockquote>
<p id="p_110">       books. The petitioners a firm carrying on the business of
       preparing, printing, publishing and selling text books then moved
       this Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_53">Art. 32</a> of the Constitution praying for writs of
       mandamus directing the Punjab Government to withdraw the
       notifications of 1950 and 1952 on the ground that they
       contravened the fundamental rights of the petitioners guarantee
       under the Constitution. It was held by this Court that the action
       of the Government did not amount to infraction of the guarantee
       under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_54">Art. 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution, since no fundamental
       rights of the petitioners were violated by the notifications and the
       acts of the executive Government done in furtherance of their
       policy of nationalisation of text-books for students. It is true that
       the dispute arose before the Constitution (seventh <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_55">Amendment)
       Act</a>, 1956, amending, inter alia, <a href="/doc/1174818/" id="a_56">Art. 298</a>, was enacted, and there
       was no legislation authorising the State Government to enter the
       field of business of printing, publishing and selling text-books. It
       was contended in support of the petition in Rai Sahib Ram
       Jawaya's case that without legislative authority the Government
       of the State could not enter the business of printing, publishing
       and selling text-books. The Court held that by the action of the
       Government no rights of the petitioners were infringed, since a
       mere chance or prospect of having particular customers cannot be
       said to a be right to property or to any interest or undertaking. It
       is clear that the State of Punjab had done no act which infringed a
       right of any citizen: the State had merely. entered upon a trading
       venture. By entering into competition with the citizens, it did not
       infringe their rights. Viewed in the light of these facts the
       observations relied upon do not support the contention that the
       State or its officers may in exercise of executive authority

        infringe the rights of the citizens merely because the Legislature
       of the State has the power to legislate in regard to the subject on
       which the executive order is. issued.‖

86.2 Accordingly, in <a href="/doc/766560/" id="a_57">State of Madhya Pradesh v. Thakur Bharat Singh</a>
(supra), it was held that the order issued by the State Government of Madhya
Pradesh under <a href="/doc/694023/" id="a_58">Section 3</a> (1) (b) of the Madhya Pradesh Public Security Act,
1959, not only restricted the movements of the Respondents, but actually
required them to move to another place apart from the place of their ordinary
residence, which was beyond the purview of the statute. This was held to be
prejudicial to the Respondents and accordingly invalid. Therefore, even the
extent of executive power could be curtailed by what the statute permitted
expressly.

<p id="p_111">87. <a href="/doc/1131008/" id="a_59">In Poonam Verma v. Delhi Development Authority</a> (2007) 13 SCC 154,
the question was whether the action of the Central Government to confine the
scheme formulated by the Delhi Development Authority (‗DDA') for out of
turn allotment of flats only for widows of government servants who died in
harness and those who were killed by terrorists could have been validly
issued. The Supreme Court held that the Central Government could not have,
in the absence of any statutory provision directed creation of any quota and
that too after closure of the scheme. In that process, the Supreme Court held
that ―guidelines per se do not partake the character of a statute‖ and that ―such
guidelines in absence of statutory backdrop are advisory in nature‖. The Court
referred to its earlier decision in Narender Kumar Maheshwari v Union of
India (1979) 3 SCC 489, where it was held as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_19">       ―107. This is because guidelines, by their very nature, do not fall

       They have only an advisory role to play and non-adherence to or
       deviation from them is necessarily and implicitly permissible if
       the circumstances of any particular fact or law situation warrants
       the same. Judicial control takes over only where the deviation
       either involves arbitrariness or discrimination or is so
       fundamental as to undermine a basic public purpose which the
       guidelines and the statute under which they are issued are
       intended to achieve.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_112">88. <a href="/doc/1599714/" id="a_60">In G.J. Fernandez v. State of Mysore</a> AIR 1967 SC 1753 the Supreme
Court held that the rules in the Mysore Public Works Department Code did
not partake the character of ‗law' and that <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_61">Article 162</a> could not be invoked to
recognize the power of the State Government to frame rules. The provision
only indicated ―the scope of executive power of the State‖. It was further
explained as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_20">       ―Of course, under such executive power, the State can give
       administrative instructions to its servants how to act in certain
       circumstances; but that will not make such instructions statutory
       rules which-are justiciable in certain circumstances. In order that
       such executive instructions have the force of statutory rules it
       must be shown that they have been issued either under the
       authority conferred on the State Government by some statute or
       under some provision of the Constitution providing therefore. It
       is not in dispute that there is no statute which confers any
       authority on the State Government to issue rules in matters with
       which the Code is concerned; nor has any provision of the
       Constitution been pointed' out to us under which these
       instructions can be issued as statutory rules except <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_62">Art. 162.</a> But
       as we have already indicated, <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_63">Art. 162</a> does not confer any
       authority on the State Government to issue statutory rules. It only
       provides, for the extent and scope of the executive power of the
       State Government, and that coincides with the legislative, power
       of the State legislature. Thus under <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_64">Art. 162</a>, the State
       Government can take executive action in all matters in which the

        legislature of the State can pass laws. But <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_65">Art. 162</a> itself does not
       confer any rule making power on the State Government in that
       behalf. We are therefore of opinion that instructions contained in
       the Code are mere administrative instructions and are not
       statutory rules.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_113">89. The learned Single Judge distinguished the above decision in G.J.
Fernandez (supra) on the ground that<a href="/doc/206650/" id="a_66"> the Code</a> in question there was ―in the
nature of government regulations to regulate conduct of employees‖ and that
the said Code was ―not duly notified and gazetted‖ like the DSGs were. The
Court is of the view that the mere fact that the DSGs were notified in the
gazette would not set it apart from<a href="/doc/206650/" id="a_67"> the Code</a> that was being considered by the
Supreme Court in G.J. Fernandez.
</p>

<p id="p_114">90. In Syndicate Bank v. Ramchandran Pillai (2011) 15 SCC 398, the
question that arose was whether the Central Government's ―guidelines to
prevent arbitrary use of powers to evict genuine tenants from public premises
under the control of the public sector undertakings/financial institutions‖ by a
gazetted resolution dated 30th May, 2002, had the force of ―statutory rules‖.
Answering the question in negative, the Supreme Court held as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">       ―6. If any executive instructions are to have the force of statutory
       rules, it must be shown that they were issued either under the
       authority conferred on the Central Government or a State
       Government or other authority by some Statute or the
       Constitution. Guidelines or executive instructions which are not
       statutory in character, are not 'laws', and compliance thereof
       cannot be enforced through courts. Even if there has been any
       violation or breach of such non-statutory guidelines, it will not
       confer any right on any member of the public, to seek a direction
       in a court of law, for compliance with such guidelines. An order
       validly made in accordance with a statute (as in this case, the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                 Page 43 of 69</span>
        Public Premises Act), cannot be interfered with, even if there has
       been any transgression of any guidelines, except where it is
       arbitrary or malafide or in violation of any statutory provision.
       These are well settled principles (See: <a href="/doc/220487/" id="a_68">Union of India v. S.L.
       Abbas</a>: 1993 (4) SCC 357, <a href="/doc/1745931/" id="a_69">Chief Commercial Manager, South
       Central Railway, Secundrabad v. G. Ratnam</a>: 2007 (8) SCC
       212, and <a href="/doc/146531721/" id="a_70">State of U.P. v. Gobardhan Lal</a>)

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_22">       7. As the guidelines relied upon in this case were not issued in
       exercise of any statutory power under the Public Premises Act or
       any other statute, even if there was violation or non-compliance
       with the aforesaid guidelines by the Appellant, relief to the
       Appellant could not be denied by relying upon the guidelines. To
       do so would amount to reading the guidelines into the statute,
       which is impermissible? The only 'remedy' of any person
       complaining of noncompliance with such guidelines, is to bring
       such violation, to the notice of a higher authority. We therefore
       hold that the enforcement of any right or exercise of any power
       by the Appellant, under the Public Premises Act cannot be set at
       naught by relying upon or referring to the guidelines issued by
       the Central Government.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_115">91. Since this Court is of the view that the learned Single Judge was in error
in overlooking the aforementioned legal position, and in holding the DSGs to
be law, the Court does not consider it necessary to examine the further
question whether the DSGs are violative of any fundamental right under
<a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_71">Article 19 (1) (g)</a> of the Constitution and whether the restriction placed on the
said right by them are beyond the purview of <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_72">Article 19 (6)</a> of the
Constitution.
</p>

<p id="p_116">92. The Court, therefore, leaves it open to the Appellants/Defendants to
challenge the Direct Selling Rules under the CPA, once they are notified, as
being violative of Section 30 of the TM Act and Sections 419 and 420 of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                Page 44 of 69</span>
 <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_73">Sale of Goods Act</a>, 1930 (‗SOGA'), <a href="/doc/1625889/" id="a_74">Sections 23</a> and <a href="/doc/1431516/" id="a_75">27</a> of the Indian Contract
Act, 1872 (‗ICA') and the <a href="/doc/1113485/" id="a_76">Competition Act</a>, 2002. There is no occasion for
the Court in the present case to further examine these issues.
</p>

<p id="p_117">93. For all the aforementioned reasons, the Court sets aside the findings of the
learned Single Judge on the first issue that the DSGs are ‗law' and that, as
such, they are enforceable.
</p>

<p id="p_118">Trademark issues
</p><p id="p_119">94. The Court now turns to the second issue, and the findings thereon, that the
sale of Amway, Oriflame and Modicare products on e-commerce platforms
amounted to infringement of trademark, passing off and misrepresentation,
etc.
</p>

<p id="p_120">95. The Court accepts the plea of the Appellants/ Defendants that a
fundamental error has been committed by the learned Single Judge in noting
in the opening line of para 175 that ―the Plaintiffs are owners of their
respective trademarks and there is no dispute regarding the ownership‖. It
must be observed at the outset, that in none of the plaints, have the Plaintiffs
asserted or even mentioned anything about trademark registration. There was
no occasion for the Plaintiffs to assert ownership of such trademarks. In fact,
there is no such pleading to that effect at all. How the learned Single Judge
could have come to such a conclusion and, that too, in a categorical manner,
in the absence of any pleadings, is a mystery.
</p>

<p id="p_121">96. As the learned Single Judge rightly notes, the suits were not suits for

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                Page 45 of 69</span>
 infringement of trademarks, or even for that matter, passing off. Even as this
has been acknowledged in the impugned judgment, the learned Single Judge
proceeds to examine whether there has been an infringement of the
trademarks. This is entirely outside the purview of the pleadings in the suits
and such a venture in this regard ought not to have been undertaken by the
learned Single Judge.
</p>

<p id="p_122">97. In any event, according to the Appellants/Defendants, the Plaintiffs were
not the proprietors of the trademarks ‗Amway' and ‗Oriflame' respectively.
Amway has been registered in the name of Amway Corporation and Alticore
Inc., and Oriflame in the name of Oriflame Cosmetics AG, neither of which
entities are parties to the suits. The case of the Appellants/Defendants is that
once the goods have been lawfully acquired by a person by sale of the goods
in the market, the further sale of such goods in the market by that person
would not amount to infringement of the proprietor's trademark. The
contention is that Section 30 of the TM Act limits the monopoly rights of the
trademark owner and confers a benefit on traders to trade lawfully and acquire
goods. Conscious of this position, according to the Appellants/Defendants, the
Plaintiffs did not argue that the Appellants were infringing any registered
trademark.
</p>

<p id="p_123">98. As already noticed, the action brought by the Respondents/Plaintiffs in the
shape of the suits in question, was not one of trademark infringement or
passing off.
</p>

<p id="p_124">99. Under Section 19 of the SOGA, upon a contract for sale for a specific

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                Page 46 of 69</span>
 property, the property and the goods are transferred to the buyer. The ―Code
of Ethics‖ framed by Amway itself states that once the sale takes place, the
title in the products is transferred to the buyer i.e. the ABOs, on its first sale.
Once the title passes to the ABO, no condition could be further imposed upon
the buyer. Clause 7 (6) of the DSGs imposes one such condition on the buyer
that the buyer cannot resell the product online. With such a condition not
being an enforceable law vis-a-vis the third party, even if it were to be
considered binding as such, by means of the contract between Amway and the
ABO, Amway can at best seek to proceed against the ABO for breach of such
condition. This is because there is no privity of contract between Amway, or
for that matter between Oriflame and Modicare, with the online platforms.
</p>



<p id="p_125">Lifting the corporate veil
</p><p id="p_126">100. Arguments at some length were advanced by the Respondents herein
regarding the relationship between the Amazon, on the one hand, and
Cloudtail, on the other. The assertion by Cloudtail is that it is a wholly owned
subsidiary of M/s Prione Business Services Pvt. Ltd. (‗Prione'), which has no
relation with Amazon and that Amazon and Cloudtail are independent legal
entities. Prione is a joint venture between M/s Catamaran Ventures and
Amazon Asia Pacific and Amazon Eurasia. Cloudtail states that it does not
have any shareholding, interest or directors from Amazon or Amazon Asia
Pacific or Amazon Eurasia, controlling and managing its affairs. The board of
Cloudtail is said to comprise of three directors, two of which are nominees of
M/s Catamaran Ventures and one is the MD-CEO i.e. an employee of
Cloudtail.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                  Page 47 of 69</span>
<p id="p_127"> 101. In any event, these are matters of evidence. There could not have been a
presumption that Cloudtail and Amazon are one and the same entity and that
the obligations of the Cloudtail would bind Amazon and vice versa. There is
merit in the contention of Amazon that by permitting private entities like
Amway to restrict downstream distribution of genuine goods, by enforcing
contractual stipulations against third parties, the judgment of the learned
Single Judge recognizes a monopoly that can be exercised in perpetuity.
There is also force in the contention that this runs contrary to the legal
position explained in <a href="/doc/86466712/" id="a_77">Kapil Wadhwa v. Samsung Electronics</a> (supra). At this
stage, the Court would like to discuss at some length the said decision, as it
has a direct bearing on the case at hand.
</p>

<p id="p_128">The decision in Kapil Wadhwa
102.1 The facts in Kapil Wadhwa (supra) are that Samsung Electronics
Company Limited (‗SECL') and Samsung India Electronics Private Limited
(‗SIEPL') were companies incorporated in Korea and India respectively.
SIEPL was the subsidiary of SECL. They were part of the Samsung group of
companies, which had 14 listed companies and 285 worldwide operations.
They were in the business of manufacturing and trading electronic goods,
including colour televisions, home appliances, washing machines, air
conditioners, computers, printers and cartridges, etc. The business was done
under the brand/corporate name, using the trademark ‗Samsung'.
</p>

<p id="p_129">102.2 In India, SECL had licensed the use of its trademark ‗Samsung' to
SIEPL under a Trademark Agreement dated 8th July, 2003, which had been
filed with the Trademark Registry for registration. The grievance of both

 SECL and SIEPL was that Kapil Wadhwa and others i.e. the Appellants in
that case, were purchasing from the foreign market printers manufactured and
sold by SECL under the trademark ‗Samsung', and after importing them into
India and selling the products in the Indian market under the same trademark,
thereby infringing the registered trademark of the Respondents in India. It was
alleged that the Appellants were operating their website by meta-tagging the
same to the website of SECL and SIEPL.
</p>

<p id="p_130">102.3 The Respondents alleged that injury was being caused to the customers
in India, who were paying less for the printers in question but were misled
into believing that they were purchasing authorized Samsung products in
India sold with the permission of the Respondents, when in fact the printers
imported and sold were materially different from the ones sold in the Indian
market. Appellants highlighted that their import and sale was beneficial to the
Indian public since their aim was to sell the products at the prices less than 30
to 50% of the compatible products sold by SECL and SIEPL.
</p>

<p id="p_131">102.4 The Appellants further contended that the Respondents did not
manufacture the products in India and that they also import the products.
According to the Appellants, their act of importing the products was
authorized and the sale in the Indian market was legal inasmuch as the
Appellants sold the products ―as it is‖.
</p>

<p id="p_132">102.5 The learned Single Judge held in favour of SECL and SIEPL by
holding that the TM Act involved the national exhaustion principle. The
action brought by SECL and SIEPL before the Court was one of infringement

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                 Page 49 of 69</span>
 of trademark and not for passing off.
</p>

<p id="p_133">102.6 The Division Bench identified the issue as one of ―parallel imports/grey
market goods‖. It was held that <a href="/doc/454306/" id="a_78">Section 30</a> operated as an exception to Section
</p><p id="p_134">29. Under <a href="/doc/454306/" id="a_79">Section 30</a> (2) (b) of the TM Act, if a trademark was registered,
subject to any conditions of limitations, the use of that trademark in relation to
the goods to be sold or traded in any place and in relation to the goods to be
exported to any market, would not constitute an infringement. It was held that
once the goods have been lawfully acquired, if they are put into market and
further sold, there would be no infringement of the trademark irrespective of
the fact that whether such a market is an international market or a domestic
market.
</p>

<p id="p_135">102.7 The Division Bench disagreed with the conclusion reached by the
learned Single Judge, in the context of <a href="/doc/176471/" id="a_80">Section 29</a> (6) of the TM Act, that if a
trademark is registered in one country, then the goods bearing the said
registered trademark, can be lawfully acquired in that country alone. It,
therefore, further disagreed with the conclusion in para 68 (d) of the judgment
of the learned Single Judge that Section 30 of the TM Act implied that the
goods lawfully acquired must originate from ―the domestic market‖.
</p>

<p id="p_136">102.8 The Division Bench then concluded as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_23">       ―42. There is a patent fallacy in paragraph 68(c). There is no law
       which stipulates that goods sold under a trade mark can be
       lawfully acquired only in the country where the trade mark is
       registered. In fact, the legal position is to the contrary. Lawful
       acquisition of goods would mean the lawful acquisition thereof

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                  Page 50 of 69</span>
        as per the laws of that country pertaining to sale and purchase of
       goods. Trade Mark Law is not to regulate the sale and purchase
       of goods. It is to control the use of registered trademarks. Say for
       example, there is food scarcity in a country and the sale of wheat
       is banned except through a canalizing agency. Lawful acquisition
       of wheat in that country can only be through the canalizing
       agency. The learned Single Judge has himself recognized that the
       law of trademarks recognizes the principle of international
       exhaustion of rights to control further trade of the goods put on
       the market under the trade mark. The task of the learned Single
       Judge thus was to resolve the impasse in the Indian Law, and
       thus the presumption/assumption in paragraph 68(c) could not be
       the point to resolve the textual context in which the learned
       Single Judge has discussed in paragraph 68(d).‖

102.9 In other words, the Division Bench interpreted the word ―market‖ in
<a href="/doc/1881111/" id="a_81">Section 30</a> (3) of the TM Act to include the international market.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_137">102.10 The Division Bench then went on to interpret <a href="/doc/454306/" id="a_82">Section 30</a> (4) of the TM
Act, which states that the further dealings in the goods placed in the market
under a trademark, can be opposed where legitimate reasons exist to cause
further dealings, and in particular whether condition of goods has been
changed or impaired. The Division Bench then went on to explain as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_24">       ―With respect to physical condition being changed or impaired,
       even in the absence of a statutory provision, the registered
       proprietor of a trade mark would have the right to oppose further
       dealing in those goods inasmuch as they would be the same
       goods improperly so called, or to put it differently, if a physical
       condition of goods is changed, it would no longer be the same
       goods. But, sub-section 4 of Section 30 is not restricted to only
       when the conditions of the goods has been changed or impaired
       after they have been put on the market. The section embraces all
       legitimate reasons to oppose further dealings in the goods. Thus,
       changing condition or impairment is only a specie of the genus

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                 Page 51 of 69</span>

102.11 Finally, the Division Bench examined whether SECL and SIEPL were
entitled to oppose further dealings by the importer of the printers to India
under <a href="/doc/454306/" id="a_86">Section 30</a> (4) of the TM Act. It was held as under:
</p>
<p id="p_139">  ―71...Now, the Principle of International Exhaustion of Rights itself
  takes away the right of the respondents to control the further sale and
  further distribution of the goods. With respect to after sales services,
  since the respondents do not warranty anything regarding their goods
  sold abroad, but imported into India and further sold, they not being
  responsible for the warranty of those goods, nothing turns thereon, as
  regards said plea. There may be some merit that the ordinary consumer,
  who is provided with warranties and after sales by the appellants, on not
  receiving satisfactory after sales service, may form a bad impression of
  the product of the respondents and thus to said extent one may recognize
  a possible damage to the reputation of the respondents pertaining to
  Samsung/SAMSUNG printers and Samsung/SAMSUNG products sold
  in India after importation. But, this can be taken care of by passing
  suitable directions requiring the appellants to prominently display in
  their shop that the Samsung/SAMSUNG printers sold by them are
  imported by the appellants and that after sales services and warranties
  are not guaranteed nor are they provided under the authority and control
  of the respondents and that the appellants do so at their own end and
  with their own efforts. This would obviate any consumer dissatisfaction
  adversely affecting the reputation of the respondents, and thus if this is
  done, the respondents can claim no legitimate reasons to oppose further
  dealing in Samsung/SAMSUNG products in India.
</p>
<p id="p_140">  74. As regards the appellants meta-tagging their websites with those of
  the respondents, the learned Single Judge has correctly injuncted the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                               Page 53 of 69</span>
   appellants from so doing, which injunction we affirm. The argument by
  the appellants that how else would the appellants know about the
  working of the particular product hardly impresses us for the reason the
  appellants can design their website in a manner where they are able, on
  their own strength, without any meta-tagging, to display the relevant
  information.‖

102.12 The above passages in Kapil Wadhwa v Samsung Electronics (supra)
are a complete answer to many of the contentions raised by Amway,
Modicare and Oriflame in the present case. In the considered view of this
Court, the learned Single Judge was in error in distinguishing the decision in
Kapil Wadhwa v Samsung Electronics (supra) by holding that the principle
of exhaustion cannot be invoked by the Appellants/Defendants.
</p>


<p id="p_141">Reports of the LC
</p><p id="p_142">103. At this stage, it is necessary to notice that the learned Single Judge has
based the conclusions about the tampering of goods of the Plaintiffs
essentially on the four reports of the LCs. The first LC report dated 6th
October, 2018 has been submitted by Mr. Aditya Vaibhav Singh, who visited
the premises of Cloudtail. All that the report indicates is that the LC was
informed that the Amway goods supplied to Cloudtail were bought from one
Mr. Vinit, who operated from Bhaghirath Place. The representative on the site
informed the LC that he did not have any bills for the said transaction and the
purchases had been made in cash. He further stated that ―he could not satisfy
the complete purchase order (with respect to Amway) and only supplied the
goods which he could purchase at that point of time.‖ Thus, this report is
entirely unhelpful to support the conclusions drawn by the learned Single


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                               Page 54 of 69</span>
 Judge about large-scale tampering of goods.
</p>

<p id="p_143">104. The second report is dated 12th October, 2018 and has been submitted by
Mr. Arun Wighmal. He visited the premises of Pioneering Products, the
Defendant No. 1 in CS (OS) 480/2018, and found that it was under the control
of and being operated by Amazon. He found various products bearing the
mark ‗Amway' getting packed to be dispatched to their respective buyers. The
LC states that despite the denial and resistance of Amazon's representatives,
he inspected the premises, upon which he found a ―good quantity‖ of products
labelled ‗Amway' on the second floor. He found copies of stock transfer notes
dated 8th and 27th September, 2018, showing that more than 2400 Amway
products were transferred from the premises of Pioneering Products to the
premises under inspection, which actually belonged to Amazon but was
referred to as ―the additional place of business‖ of Pioneering Products.
</p>

<p id="p_144">105. The crucial portion of the report is where the LC states that he opened
two different sealed packages of the said Amway products and found that one
of those did not contain the unique code. The package which did not contain
the unique code was resealed. The learned Single Judge has, in the impugned
judgment, set out in the body of the judgment the photographs taken by the
LC with the caption ―images showing removal of seals and repackaging at
Amazon warehouse.‖


</p><p id="p_145">106. What the LC has not indicated is whether prior to the LC opening the
sealed packages, he found the packages to have been otherwise tampered
with. If it was the LC who opened the seal of the packages, then clearly till

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                Page 55 of 69</span>
 such time they remained sealed. It could not therefore be said that it was
Amazon or Amazon's representatives which opened those sealed packages.
Only two products are referred to by the LC, one of which did not have the
bar code. Who removed these bar codes is still in question. If the seller who
sold the product to Amazon had itself removed it, clearly then Amazon could
not be blamed for tampering with the bar code.
</p>

<p id="p_146">107. From this one example, it is difficult to understand how the learned
Single Judge could have concluded that Amazon was tampering with the
products of Amway. This was too sweeping a conclusion to arrive at. It could
not form the basis for the denial of the principle of exhaustion by invoking
<a href="/doc/454306/" id="a_87">Section 30</a> (4) of the TM Act. As to whether the goods were in fact tampered
with, since the report of the LC does not appear to indicate that he saw such
tampering take place in his presence by Amazon, the question could only be
settled by examining evidence.
</p>

<p id="p_147">108. In fact, in the written submissions on behalf of Amway, it is conceded
that these constitute matters awaiting trial. If that is the position, then it was
not open to the learned Single Judge to conclude, and that too at the
interlocutory stage, that there was tampering of the products by Amazon. The
second LC's report, therefore, does not come to the Plaintiffs' aid in order to
assert that Amway products were being tampered with on Amazon's
premises. Amazon states that it receives goods in a packed condition and then
repacks them in Amazon's own packing, for further security and safety, to
make the packages tamper proof. This again is a matter for evidence.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                  Page 56 of 69</span>
<p id="p_148"> 109. Turning now to the third LC's report dated 15th October, 2018, Ms.
Richa Bhargava visited the premises of Black Olive (Defendant No. 2 in CS
(OS) 480/2018). The LC concluded that the premises were under the control
of Amazon on the basis that boards and hoardings of Amazon were found
there. The LC found various products bearing the mark ‗Amway' getting
packed to be dispatched to their respective buyers. This report, therefore, did
not indicate any tampering of Amway products.
</p>

<p id="p_149">110. The LC found that ―many of the products did not have the unique bar
code.‖ However, the LC's report is not helpful in determining whether it was
Amazon which had removed the unique code. It is possible that there are
products of Amway that do not have the unique code but some other marker.
These, again, are matters for evidence. Therefore, this report is also unhelpful
in determining if any tampering was done by Amazon.
</p>

<p id="p_150">111. The fourth report dated 16th October, 2018 is of Mr. B. Prashant Kumar.
He also visited the premises of Cloudtail. He noticed that it was used as a
common office for Cloudtail and its sister concern, Prione. The LC has placed
on record pictures taken at the premises where Prione refers to itself as ―a
Catamaran and Amazon venture.‖ The premises were ―almost empty, with the
desks completely clean.‖ There were no laptops, files, desktops or any other
office related products to inspect. There was no particular warehouse that
could be associated with Cloudtail in and around the premises. How this
report could then form the basis for inferring that there had been tampering of
goods by Cloudtail or Amazon is beyond imagination.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                Page 57 of 69</span>
<p id="p_151"> 112. The broad conclusions reached by the learned Single Judge tend to
obfuscate the factual distinctions between the cases involving the different
online platforms. For instance, both in the first and the fourth reports of the
LCs, no Amway products were found on Cloudtail's premises. Similarly, the
learned Single Judge has failed to appreciate Snapdeal's submissions that
unlike Amazon, it does not even engage in large-scale ‗fulfilment' of orders,
and consequently has very few storage and transportation facilities and barely
comes into contact with the products sold on its platform. These submissions
are at least prima facie supported by the LC's Report dated 27th September,
2019 in FAO (OS) 157/2019, to which the learned Single Judge has made no
reference at all. No LC was appointed in Oriflame's suit. The facts revealed in
the LCs reports were insufficient to make any specific conclusions regarding
the impairment of the products vis-à-vis each of the present Appellants.
</p>

<p id="p_152">113. The learned Single Judge also appears to have accepted the plea of the
Plaintiffs that the Defendants engage in the inflation of the maximum retail
price (‗MRP') of their products to offer ‗fake discounts' to consumers.
Amazon's case is that it has a strict policy of removing listings without
further questions if a complaint is received claiming that the MRP of a
particular product has been ‗inflated'. In any event, according to Amazon, the
MRP displayed on the listings are ―entirely user generated‖ and it ―does not
determine or influence the MRP whatsoever.‖


</p><p id="p_153">114. The learned Single Judge also did not inquire about the discounts passed
on by Amway to its distributors, which are then passed on to the consumers,
resulting in the sale of Amway products at high discounts in any case. In a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                               Page 58 of 69</span>
 similar vein, the conclusion that the consumers have to embark on a
―Sherlockian venture‖ to trace the sellers of these products or that the sellers
on Amazon's marketplace are not identifiable has not taken into account the
sellers' details visible along with product listings on Amazon's marketplace,
which were disclosed in Amazon's additional affidavits dated 24th April,
2019.
</p>

<p id="p_154">115. Not only Amazon, but also Cloudtail and Snapdeal submit that details of
the products, such as the brand and the seller are clearly provided on their
online marketplaces. Where there are multiple sellers, the details of the offers
of all such sellers are said to be available. Such information, it is submitted, is
generated directly by the said sellers and not modified by the Defendants in
any manner. Only the buyer's information is withheld from the seller until
after the sale has concluded, a policy which is in the interest of the buyers
insofar as it prevents the misuse of the buyers' information by the sellers.
These aspects do not appear to have been considered by the learned Single
Judge. These too are matters in respect of which clearer answers would
emerge hopefully at the conclusion of the trial.
</p>

<p id="p_155">116. The Court is, therefore, unable to concur with the view expressed by the
learned Single Judge that the Defendants could not invoke the principle of
exhaustion in terms of <a href="/doc/454306/" id="a_88">Section 30</a> (3) read with <a href="/doc/454306/" id="a_89">Section 30</a> (4) of the TM Act,
or that the sale of the Plaintiffs' products on e-commerce platforms violates
their trademark rights, constitutes misrepresentation and passing off, and
results in the dilution and tarnishing of the goodwill and reputation of the
Plaintiffs' brand. These findings are outside the purview and scope of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                   Page 59 of 69</span>
 pleadings in the suits and unsustainable in law.
</p>

<p id="p_156">Are the Appellants intermediaries?
</p><p id="p_157">117. Turning now to the third issue as to whether Amazon, Cloudtail and
Snapdeal were in fact intermediaries within the meaning of <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_90">Section 79</a> read
with 2 (1) (w) of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_91">IT Act</a>, the learned Single Judge has extensively
examined the incidental services provided by these platforms in the form of
packaging and entering into fresh warranties. This aspect has already been
discussed at length in the decision in <a href="/doc/86466712/" id="a_92">Kapil Wadhwa v. Samsung Electronics
Co. Ltd</a>. (supra) wherein it was held that the mere fact that there could be a
change in the condition of the warranty of a certain product would not attract
<a href="/doc/454306/" id="a_93">Section 30</a> (4) of the TM Act, and equally would not deprive the
intermediaries from the option of invoking <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_94">Section 79</a> of the IT Act in their
defence.
</p>

<p id="p_158">118. The learned Single Judge appears to have misinterpreted <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_95">Section 79</a> of
the IT Act in concluding that is restricted to ‗passive' intermediaries. <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_96">Section

</p>

<p id="p_160">120. The exemption under <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_101">Section 79</a> (1) of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_102">IT Act</a> from liability applies

intermediary merely provides access, it has to comply with <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_107">Section 79</a> (2) (a),

<p id="p_162">121. In Amazon's case, as indeed in Cloudtail's and Snapdeal's, since they
provide services in addition to access, they have to show compliance with

potential customer who is accessing the site, so long as it is he who clicks the
button, it is the customer who is initiating the transmission. Amazon,
Snapdeal or Cloudtail do not ‗select' the receiver of the transmission, which is
the buyer. They do not modify the information contained in the transmission,
such as the choice of the product, the number of units, and so forth. For
example, if a potential buyer goes to Amazon's website and selects a book
sold by a seller whose name is indicated on the site, as long as this entire

 transaction is not controlled by Amazon and the choices, of which the
transaction consists, are made solely by the customer, such as, say, the
decision to purchase three copies of the book, and these choices are not
altered by Amazon, the requirements of <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_112">Section 79</a> (2) (b) of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_113">IT Act</a>
would stand fulfilled.
</p>

<p id="p_164">122. Given the disputed questions of fact that emerge from the pleadings in
the suit, it is obvious that the issue of whether an entity is an intermediary or
not can be decided only after a trial. In this context, it should be noted that the
reasoning of the learned Single Judge in <a href="/doc/99622088/" id="a_114">Christian Louboutin SAS v. Nakul
Bajaj</a> (supra) was disapproved of by a Division Bench of this Court in its
judgment dated 4th April, 2019 in RFA (OS) (COMM) 1/2019 (<a href="/doc/193527086/" id="a_115">M/s. Clues
Network Pvt. Ltd. v. M/s. L'Oréal</a>), wherein the Court set aside an order of
the learned Single Judge, which relied, inter alia, on <a href="/doc/99622088/" id="a_116">Christian Louboutin
SAS v. Nakul Bajaj</a> (supra). Indeed, the learned Single Judge appears to have
erred in distinguishing the decision in <a href="/doc/12972852/" id="a_117">Myspace Inc. v. Super Cassettes
Industries Ltd</a>. (supra), where the Division Bench held that <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_118">Section 79</a> of the
IT Act is not an ―enforceable provision‖, but merely provides ―affirmative
defence‖ to entities which fulfil the criteria set forth therein. It was observed
by the DB in the said case as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_44">       ―51... The true intent of <a href="/doc/1306592/" id="a_119">Section 79</a> is to ensure that in terms of
       globally accepted standards of intermediary liabilities and to
       further digital trade and economy, an intermediary is granted
       certain protections. <a href="/doc/1306592/" id="a_120">Section 79</a> is neither an enforcement
       provision nor does it list out any penal consequences for non-
       compliance. It sets up a scheme where intermediaries have to
       follow certain minimum standards to avoid liability; it provides
       for an affirmative defence and not a blanket immunity from

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                  Page 63 of 69</span>
        liability.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_165">123. <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_121">Section 79</a> of the IT Act is a safe harbour for online market places,
limiting their liability for third party information posted on their systems. It is
to ensure that the liability for non-compliance and/or violation of law by a
third party, i.e. the seller, is not fastened on the online market place. In
holding that Amazon is in fact not an intermediary, the learned Single Judge
has obviated the need for any evidence to be led in the matter.
</p>

<p id="p_166">124.    During       the   course      of   arguments   before   this   Court,    the
Respondents/Plaintiffs were not at all clear as to whether, according to them,
Amazon was in fact an intermediary or not. In any event, the alternative
arguments, claiming that Amazon is not an intermediary, appear to be riddled
with inconsistencies. If, in fact, Amazon is not an intermediary, the question
of Amazon having to comply with <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_122">Section 79</a> (2) of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_123">IT Act</a> would not
arise at all. Clearly, the Respondents seem to be unsure as to what their stand
ought to be. As a result, the burden of proof has shifted unfairly onto the
Defendants to show that they have complied with the requirements of <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_124">Section
79</a> of the IT Act, when in fact the Plaintiffs have to first show that there had
been a violation of any of their rights due to the Defendants' activities before
the ―affirmative defence‖ of <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_125">Section 79</a> could be sought to be invoked.
Therefore, <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_126">Section 79</a> of the IT Act has been, contrary to the judgment in
<a href="/doc/12972852/" id="a_127">Myspace Inc. v. Super Cassettes Industries Ltd</a>. (supra), sought to be
enforced by the Plaintiffs positively, rather than be deployed as ―affirmative
defence.‖



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                    Page 64 of 69</span>
</p><p id="p_167"> 125. There is prima facie merit in the contention of the Appellants that the
value-added services provided by them as online market places, as listed out
by the learned Single Judge, do not dilute the safe harbour granted to them
under <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_128">Section 79</a> of the IT Act. <a href="/doc/545792/" id="a_129">Section 2</a> (1) (w) of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_130">IT Act</a> does envisage
that such intermediaries could provide value-added services to third party
sellers. This interpretation is sought to be buttressed by Press Note No. 2
issued by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. In particular, reference is
made to para 5.2.15.2.4 (vi), which reads as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_45">       ―In marketplace model goods/services made available for sale
       electronically on website should clearly provide name, address
       and other contact details of the seller, post sales, delivery of
       goods to the customers and customer satisfaction will be
       responsibility of the seller.‖

</blockquote><p id="p_168">126. There was no occasion for the learned Single Judge to have, at the stage
of considering applications for interim injunction, returned a conclusive
finding that Amazon is ―a massive facilitator‖ and plays an ―active role in the
sales process.‖ These are too sweeping and definitive a set of findings which
have to be properly rendered at the conclusion of the trial. Here again there is
prima facie merit in Amazon's contention that merely because it packs and
ships the product does not mean that the sale is consummated by Amazon.
Amazon contends that such an interpretation runs afoul of both <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_131">Section 79</a> of
the IT Act and the policy laid down by the Press Note No. 2, a portion of
which have been extracted hereinabove. Amazon explains that when the sale
of product is ―fulfilled by Amazon‖, all it means is that Amazon guarantees
the quality of the product by rendering logistical support services, which
include storage, packaging and delivery. These are again matters that would


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                Page 65 of 69</span>
 have to be tested at the trial.
</p>

<p id="p_169">127. Under <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_132">Section 79</a> (2) (c) of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_133">IT Act</a>, the obligation of the intermediary
is that, in terms of the Intermediary Guidelines, it publishes its policies for the
information and convenience of its users. The enforcement of such a policy is
another matter. Clause 17 of Amazon's policy prohibits sale, on its platform,
of ―unauthorised‖ products. This Clause 17 was put forth with the object of
enabling Amazon to refuse listing of a product where, for instance, it
originates from a country that does not follow international exhaustion.
Amazon seeks to point out that this does not apply to India where the
principle of international exhaustion is in fact followed. It is contended that
Clause 17 cannot be interpreted to empower Amway to seek restrictions on
the sale of its products on Amazon's online platform.
</p>

<p id="p_170">128. The Supreme Court in Shreya Singhal (supra) held, inter alia, that the
obligation of an intermediary to remove content under <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_134">Section 79</a> (3) (b) of
the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_135">IT Act</a> arises only if there is a Court order or a notification from a
government agency on the grounds mentioned under <a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_136">Article 19 (2)</a> of the
Constitution. Amazon points out that it did not receive any such Court order
from Amway in support of its allegations. The letter of the FSSAI dated 9 th
April, 2018 was not a notification by an appropriate government agency and
did not conform to the grounds enumerated in <a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_137">Article 19 (2)</a> of the
Constitution.
</p>

<p id="p_171">129. Therefore, on the third issue also, this Court is unable to concur with the
learned Single Judge that Amazon, Snapdeal and Cloudtail would have to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                  Page 66 of 69</span>
 meet the diligence requirement, failing which the benefit of the safe harbour
provision i.e. <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_138">Section 79</a> of the IT Act would not be available to them.
</p>

<p id="p_172">Tortious interference
</p><p id="p_173">130. The Court turns now to the last issue, viz., whether the platforms are
guilty of tortious interference with a contractual relationship. This incidentally
is the central plank of Modicare's case.
</p>

<p id="p_174">131. In the first place, the tort of inducement to breach of contract necessitates
that there be a contract in the first place between the online platforms and the
DSEs. The mere fact that the online platforms may have knowledge<a href="/doc/206650/" id="a_139"> of the
Code</a> of Ethics of the DSEs, and the contractual stipulation imposed by such
DSEs on their distributors, is insufficient to lay a claim of tortious
interference. It was incumbent on the part of the Plaintiffs to demonstrate
active efforts on the part of or contracts entered into by the
Appellants/Defendants to make a viable case for tort of inducement to breach
of contract.
</p>

<p id="p_175">132. The Appellants state that the placing of the products on the Appellant's
online platforms is entirely voluntary. It is not induced by these platforms.
The services of warehousing, transportation, packing, and so on are provided
by these online platforms, not just to the products of the DSEs, but to all
products offered for sale on their platforms. They accordingly contend that the
mere provision of platforms for sale would not amount to inducement to
breach of contract. They contend that it is for the DSEs to proceed against
their respective ABOs/sellers to deal with the breach of contractual

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                  Page 67 of 69</span>
 obligations on their part. These are again contentions that can be decided
upon finally only at trial. The learned Single Judge could not, at the
interlocutory stage, have brushed these contentions aside.
</p>

<p id="p_176">133. The judgments relied upon in this regard by the learned Single Judge, the
Appellants submit, are distinguishable on facts from the present case. The sale
of products of the DSEs on the Appellants' online platforms was neither in
violation of extant laws or opposed to public policy, as in <a href="/doc/1255547/" id="a_140">Aasia Industrial
Technologies Limited vs Ambience Space Sellers Limited</a> (supra), nor were
there, in the present instance, specific acts intended to induce breach, such as
the persuasive telexes in <a href="/doc/1313377/" id="a_141">Balailal Mukherjee and Company Private Limited
vs. Sea Traders Private Limited</a> (supra). In any event, on the facts of the
present case, whether in fact any of the online platforms induced a breach of
contract between the DSE and its ABOs/sellers is at best a matter of evidence,
and not of inference.
</p>

<p id="p_177">No case for interim injunction
</p><p id="p_178">134. Of the three elements to be considered for the grant of interim injunction,
the Plaintiffs, in the considered view of this Court, failed to establish that they
have a prima facie case particularly since the DSGs could not be considered
to be binding law. Interestingly, the ABOs/direct sellers alleged to have
committed the breach of the DSGs were not impleaded as Defendants.
</p>

<p id="p_179">135. Even on the test of balance of convenience, the learned Single Judge has
only returned such a conclusion, without actually examining whether the
grant of injunction would have an adverse impact on online marketing. What

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">FAO(OS) 133/2019 &amp; connected matters                                  Page 68 of 69</span>
 was not considered is whether the requirement of online marketing entities to
seek prior consent of the DSEs would not deprive the consumer of exercising
the choice to buy such products on online platforms, while ensuring free flow
of trade.
</p>

<p id="p_180">136. As regards irreparable loss and injury, there was no empirical data placed
before the learned Single Judge by the Plaintiffs in support of their contention
that they had suffered huge losses. This again was a matter of evidence and
not inference.
</p>

<p id="p_181">137. Consequently, the Court is unable to concur with the learned Single
Judge that the three elements for the purposes of grant of interim injunction
have been fulfilled in the present case.
</p>

<p id="p_182">Conclusion
</p><p id="p_183">138. For all of the aforementioned reasons, the impugned judgment of the
learned Single Judge is hereby set aside. The applications seeking interim
injunction in the suits stand dismissed. The appeals are allowed and
applications disposed of in the above terms with costs of Rs. 50,000/- in each
of the appeals, which will be paid by the respective Plaintiffs/Respondents to
the corresponding Appellants within four weeks from today.
