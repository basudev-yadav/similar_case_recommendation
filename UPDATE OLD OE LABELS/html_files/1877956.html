ACT:
    Kerala  General  Sales Tax Act, 1963:  s.  10--Power  of
Government  to grant exemption and reduction  of  Tax--Small
Scale  Industries--Purchase  Tax  and  Sales   Tax   Conces-
sion--Whether  could  be withdrawn.
Promissory estoppel--Applicability of.



HEADNOTE:
    Section  10	 of the Kerala General Sales Tax  Act,	1963
empowers the Government in public interest to make an exemp-
tion  or reduction in rates either prospectively  or  retro-
spectively in respect of any tax payable under the Act.
    The State Government with a view to boost industrialisa-
tion,  by an order dated 11th April, 1979 offered  incentive
to Small Scale industries, to be set up thereafter, in	form
of exemption from sales tax and purchase tax for a period of
five years from the date of commencement of production. By a
second	order dated 29th September, 1980, published  in	 the
Gazette on 21st October, 1980 purported to be made under  s.
10 of the Act, the Government withdrew the exemption  relat-
ing  to purchase tax and confined the exemption	 from  sales
tax to the limit specified.
    The	 appellants who set up their industries after  April
11,  1979,  including those who did it after  21st  October,
1980,  claimed	benefit of exemption from purchase  tax	 and
sales tax in terms of the first order. They pleaded the rule
of  estoppel  against  the State Government  in	 making	 the
second order. The High Court in dismissing their Writ  Peti-
tions proceeded on the footing that the first order was	 not
made  in exercise of statutory power while the second  order
was issued under I0 of the Act.
Allowing the appeals by Special Leave, the Court,
    HELD:  I. Where the authority making an order has  power
conferred  upon it by statute to that effect, such an  order
if made without
655
indicating  the section under which it is made, it would  be
deemed	to have been made under the enabling  provision.  In
the instant case, therefore, both the orders are covered  by
s. 10, though in the earlier order there was no reference to
the statutory provision. [658G-H]
    2.	The  appellants who in response to the	first  order
dated  April 11, 1979 set up their industries prior to	21st
October, 1980 would be entitled to exemption extended and/or
promised under that order. Such exemption would continue for
the  full  period of five years from the date  they  started
production.  New industries set up after 21st October,	1980
would not be entitled to that benefit as they had noticed of
the curtailment in the exemption before they came to set  up
their  industries. They would be entitled to exemption	from
sales  tax only to the limit specified in the second  order.
[659G-600A]
    3. If in response to an order made by the Government and
in  consideration of the concession made  available  therein
the promoters of any small scale concern set up their indus-
tries within the State, they would certainly be entitled  to
plead  the rule of estoppel in their favour when  the  State
purports  to  act differently. In the facts of	the  present
case, however, the plea of estoppel is unanswerable.  [659B.

<p id="p_3">    Two Notifications/Orders issued by the State  Government
are  relevant.	The first one is dated 11.4.  1979  and	 the
second is. dated 29.9.1980 which was published in the  State
Gazette on 21.10.1980. For convenience, the texts of the two
Notifications/Orders are extracted below:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	      "Order dated 11.4.1979:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	      The incentives now given to the industries  in
	      the  State  are too meagre and  inadequate  to
	      attract industries to this State when compared
	      to the incentives available for the industries
	      in  many other States. Further there are	cer-
	      tain inherent disincentives. also peculiar  to
	      this  State such as high wage  rates,  minimum
	      wages for certain sections, lack of availabil-
	      ity  of  raw materials, etc. The	question  of
	      offering	some  incentives  by  the  State  to
	      attract new industries has been under  consid-
	      eration of the Government.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">			The question whether any  additional
	      incentive	 can  be  given	 to  the  industrial
	      concern the State plans to consider in  detail
	      and it was felt that the question of strength-
	      ening  the  traditional industries  which	 are
	      labour-intensive, rehabilitation of sick units
	      and the promotional activities for the  growth
	      of new industries should be examined in  depth
	      for indentifying the problems and adoption  of
	      various  measures necessary to promote  indus-
	      trial  growth in the State. A  Committee	con-
	      sisting  of the following officers was  there-
	      fore set up to study the various problems	 and
	      submit
	      report  ....................................."
</blockquote><p id="p_4">The Committee finalised its report on 20th March, 1979.	 The
Government  has considered the recommendations	and  sugges-
tions  of  the Committee in detail and they are	 pleased  to
approve	 the  following package of  measures  for  promoting
industrial development in Kerala:
</p><p id="p_5">SMALL SCALE INDUSTRIES:
</p><p id="p_6">Sales-Tax Concessions:
</p><p id="p_7">     New  industrial Units under small-scale industries	 set
up  after  1.4.1979  will be exempted from  the	 payment  of
sales-tax  for a period of five years from the date of	pro-
duction	 ...........................
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">657</span>
<p id="p_8">The relevant portion of the second notification reads thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">	      "In exercise of the power conferred by section
	      10 of the Kerala General Sales Tax Act ( 15 of
	      1963) the Government of Kerala have considered
	      it necessary in the public interest so to	 do,
	      hereby make an exemption in respect of the tax
	      payable under the said Act on the turnover  of
	      the sale of goods produced and sold by the new
	      industrial units under the small-scale  indus-
	      tries for a period of five years from the date
	      of  commencement of sale of such goods by	 the
	      said  units subject to the conditions that  if
	      the tax collected by any such units by way  of
	      tax  on  their  sales shall be  paid  over  to
	      Government  and  that the sales tax,  if	any,
	      already paid by such units to Government shall
	      not be refunded.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">		       Provided	 that such units shall	pro-
	      duce  proceedings	 of  the  General   Manager,
	      District	Industries  Centre,  declaring	 the
	      eligibility  of the units for claiming  exemp-
	      tion from sales-tax.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">		       Provided further that the  cumulative
	      sales tax concessions granted to a unit at any
	      point  of	 time within this period  shall	 not

		       This notification shall be deemed  to
	      have  come  into force with  effect  from	 1st
	      April, 1979".</blockquote>
<p id="p_9">    Section  10 of the Kerala General Sales Tax Act  at	 the
time the two orders were made ran thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">	      "Power  of Government to grant  exemption	 and

	      in  the Gazette, cancel or vary any  notifica-

<p id="p_10">    It may be possible to contend with plausibility that  in
the  absence  of an enabling provision in  the	statute	 the
State Government would not have the power to give up a	part
of  the	 tax due to the State and there can be	no  estoppel
against	 statute.  But	that question does  not	 arise	here
because	 we have Section 10 empowering the State  Government
to grant exemption from tax.
</p><p id="p_11">    During the heating of the appeals it has been  contended
that  the notifications in question were not in exercise  of
the  powers under section 10 of the Act. The High Court	 has
proceeded'  on the footing that the first order dated  11.4.
1979 was not made in exercise of statutory powers while	 the
second order was issued in exercise of powers under  section
</p><p id="p_12">10.  Having read the two orders and the contents, we are  of
the view that both the orders are covered by the  provisions
of  section 10 of the Act though in the earlier order  there
is no reference to section 10. It is a well-settled  princi-
ple  of	 law that where the authority making  an  order	 has
power conferred upon it by statute to make an order made  by
it  and	 an order is made without indicating  the  provision
under  which it is made, the order would be deemed  to	have
been made under the provision enabling the making of it,  We
accordingly  hold that both the orders are under section  10
of the Act.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">659</span>
<p id="p_13">    Under  the order dated 11.4.1979, new small-scale  units
were  invited  to set up their industries in  the  State  of
Kerala	and  with a view to boosting  of  industrialisation,
exemption  from sales tax and purchase tax for a  period  of
five  years was extended as a concession and  the  five-year
period	was to run from the date of commencement of  produc-
tion.  If in response to such an order and in  consideration
of  the concession made available, promoters of	 any  small-
scale concern have set up their industries within the  State
of  Kerala,  they would certainly be entitled to  plead	 the
rule  of estoppel in their favour when the State  of  Kerala
purports to act differently. Several decisions of this Court
were cited in support of the stand of the appellants that in
similar	 circumstances the plea of estoppel can be  and	 has
been applied and the leading authority on this point in	 the
case of <a href="/doc/409693/" id="a_3">M.P. Sugar Mills v. State of U.P</a>., [1979] 2 SCC 409.
On the other hand, reliance has been placed on behalf of the
State  on  a judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/1891606/" id="a_4">Bakul Cashew  Co.  v.
Sales Tax Officer, Quilon</a>, [1986] 2 SCC 365. In Bakul Compa-
ny's (supra) case this Court found:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">	      "That there was no clear material to show	 any
	      definite	or certain promise had been made  by
	      the  Minister  to the  concerned	persons	 and
	      there was no clear material also in support of
	      the  stand that the parties had altered  their
	      position	by acting upon	the  representations
	      and  suffered any prejudice. On facts,  there-
	      fore, no case for raising the plea of estoppel
	      has been made out."
</blockquote><p id="p_14">This  Court proceeded on the footing that  the	notification
granting  exemption  retrospectively was not  in  accordance
with <a href="/doc/915880/" id="a_5">section 10</a> of the State Sales Tax Act as it then stood,
as there was no power to grant exemption retrospectively. By
an amendment that power has been subsequently conferred.  In
these  appeals there is no question of retrospective  exemp-
tion.  We also find that no reference was made by  the	High
Court to the decision in M.P. Sugar Mills' case (Supra).  In
our  view,  to the facts of the present case, the  ratio  of
M.P.  Sugar  Mills' case directly applies and  the  plea  of
estoppel is unanswerable.
</p><p id="p_15">    It is not disputed that the first Order namely, the	 one
dated 11.4. 1979 gave more of tax exemption than the  second
one. The second notification withdrew the exemption relating
to purchase tax and confined the exemption from sales tax to
the limit specified in the proviso of the Notification.	 All
parties before us who in response to the Order of April	 11,
1979 set up their industries prior to 21.10.1980 within	 the
State of Kerala would thus-be entitled to the exemption
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">660</span>
extended  and/or promised under that Order.  Such  exemption
would  continue for the full period of five years  from	 the
date  they started production. New industries set  up  after
21.10. 1980 obviously would not be ,entitled to that benefit
as  they  had noticed of the curtailment  in  the  exemption
before they came to set up their industries.
    In the course of hearing and in the written	 submissions
furnished  on behalf of the State it was contended that	 the
question  as to which of the appellants are entitled to	 the
benefit	 should	 be  left to the Sales	Tax  Authorities  to
decide.	 We  are of the view that once the law	is  settled,
that  part of the decision may be left to  the	Departmental
authorities  and they may decide the question on  merits  in
appropriate proceeding in accordance with the law laid	down
in this judgment.
