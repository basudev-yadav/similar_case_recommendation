13.9.1996   reported   in   1996   (6)   SCC   129),   on   the   following 



premises :
</p>


<p id="p_3">(i)     When this Court, by the said judgment dated 13.9.1996 



        quashed the charges framed against accused Nos. 2 to 5, 



        7 to 9 and 12 under Sections 304 (Part II), 324, 326 and 



        429   <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1">IPC</a>   and   directed   the   trial   court   to   frame   charges 



        under   <a href="/doc/1371604/" id="a_2">Section   304A</a>   IPC,   this   Court   had   before   it 



        adequate   material   to   make   out   prima   facie,   an   offence 



        chargeable   under   <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_3">Section   304</a>   (Part   II)   IPC.     Therefore, 



        this   Court   committed   a   serious   error   in   ignoring   such 



        material   and   quashing   the   charge   under   <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_4">Section   304</a> 



        (Part II) IPC.
</p>


<p id="p_4">(ii)    The   evidence   placed   in   support   of   the   charge   under 



        <a href="/doc/1371604/" id="a_5">Section   304A</a>   IPC   during   the   trial   of   the   said   accused 



        before   the   learned   Chief   Judicial   Magistrate,   Bhopal 



        showed prima facie that the said accused had committed 



        offences punishable under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_6">Section 304</a> (Part II) IPC.  But 



        for the said judgment of this Court dated 13.9.1996, the 



        learned Magistrate would have, by taking note of the said 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                              3</span>



         material,   committed   the   case   to   the   Court   of   Sessions 



         under <a href="/doc/770961/" id="a_7">Section 323</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure (for 



         short  `the  Code').  However,   in  view  of  categorical   finding 



         recorded   by   this   Court,   in   its   binding   judgment   dated 



         13.9.1996 that there was no material for a charge under 



         <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_8">Section   304</a>   (Part   II)   IPC   and   consequential   quashing   of 



         the   said   charge,   with   a   direction   to   frame   the   charge 



         under   <a href="/doc/1371604/" id="a_9">Section   304A</a>   IPC,   the   learned   Magistrate   was 



         barred   from   exercising   his   judicial   power   under   <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_10">Section 



         323</a>   of   the   Code,   even   though<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_11">   the   Code</a>   vested   the 



         jurisdiction in him to alter the charge or commit the case 



         to the Court of Sessions as the case may be, on the basis 



         of evidence that came on record during the trial.
</p>


<p id="p_5">(iii)    The   judgment   dated   13.9.1996   therefore   resulted   in 



         perpetuation of irremediable injustice necessitating filing 



         of   the   curative   petitions   seeking   recall   of   the   judgment 



         dated 13.9.1996.

<p id="p_6">2.    On the night of December 02, 1984 there was a massive 



escape of lethal gas from the MIC storage tank at Bhopal plant 



of   the   Union   Carbide   (I)   Ltd.   (UCIL)   into   the   atmosphere 



causing   the   death   of   5,295   people   leaving   5,68,292   people 



suffering   from   different   kinds   of   injuries   ranging   from 



permanent total  disablement to less  serious injuries.   On the 



day   following   the   incident,   the   SHO,   Hanuman   Ganj   Police 



Station, suo moto, registered a Crime Case No. 1104 of 1984 



under <a href="/doc/1371604/" id="a_12">Section 304A</a> IPC.  On December 06, 1984 investigation 



was   handed   over   to   the   CBI,   which   investigation   stood 



completed,   resulting   in   filing   of   charge   sheets   by   the   CBI   in 



the Court of C.J.M., Bhopal on December 01, 1987.  Since the 



charge   sheets   inter   alia   alleged   commission   of   offence   under

case   was   committed   by   the   C.J.M.   to   the   Sessions   Court   as 



Sessions   Case   No.   237   of  1992   (See   :   Order   dated   30th  April, 



1992).   On 8th  April, 1993, the 9th  Additional Sessions Judge, 



Bhopal  passed  an order  framing  charges  against the  accused 



Nos. 5 to 9 under Sections 304 (Part II), 324, 326 and 429 of

same Sections but with the aid of <a href="/doc/177872/" id="a_19">Section 35</a> of IPC.  It may be 



mentioned that at the time of framing of charge, the Court had 



before   it,   accused   Nos.   2   to   9   and   accused   No.   12     (UCIL) 



whereas   accused   No.   1   (Warren   Anderson)   was   absconding

Nos. 10 and 11.

order   framing   charge   by   the   Court   of   Sessions   before   the 



Madhya Pradesh High Court, brought the matter to this Court 



in four separate appeals in which the leading case was Appeal 



(Cri.) No. 1672 of 1996 filed at the instance of accused No. 2 



which   stood   ultimately   disposed   of   by   the   judgment   of   the 



Division Bench of this Court dated September 13, 1996 in the 



case   of  Keshub   Mahindra  (supra).     This   Court   held   that   on 



the   material   produced   by   the   prosecution   before   the   Trial 



Court  at   the   stage   of   framing   of   charges,   no   charges   could

enhancement of sentences under the  existing charges.    On 23rd 



August,   2010,   CBI   filed   the   criminal   revision   only   after   the

2, 2010.  All the appeals and revisions remain pending before the

<p id="p_11">4.     It   is   clear   to   us   that   in   the   criminal   revisions   filed   by   the

<p id="p_12">But the curative petitions are based on a plea that is wrong and 



fallacious.     As   noted   above,   one   of   the   main   planks   of   the 



curative petitions is that even though in course of trial before the 



Magistrate,  additional  evidences  have  come  on  record  that  fully 



warrant the framing of the higher charge (s) and the trial of the 



accused on those higher charges, as long as the 1996 judgment 



stands   the   Sessions   Court   would   feel   helpless   in   framing   any 



higher charges against the accused in the same way as the trial 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                                            9</span>



court   observed   that   in   view   of   the   judgment   of   the   Supreme 



Court no court had the power to try the accused for an offence 



higher than the one under <a href="/doc/1371604/" id="a_46">Section 304A</a> of IPC.  The assumption 



is   wrong   and   without   any   basis.     It   stems   from   a   complete 



misapprehension   in   regard   to   the   binding   nature   of   the   1996 



judgment.  No decision by any court, this Court not excluded, 


can be read in a manner as to nullify the express provisions 


of an Act or<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_47"> the Code</a> and the 1996 judgment never intended to 


do so.  In the 1996 judgment, this Court was at pains to make it 



absolutely   clear   that   its   findings   were   based   on   materials 



gathered in investigation and brought before the Court  till that 


stage.   At every place in the judgment where the Court records 


the finding or makes an observation in regard to the appropriate 



charge   against   the   accused,   it   qualifies   the   finding   or   the 



observation   by   saying   "on   the   materials   produced   by   the 



prosecution for framing charge".   "At this stage", is a kind of a 



constant   refrain   in   that   judgment.     The   1996   judgment   was 



rendered at the stage of <a href="/doc/323386/" id="a_48">sections 209</a>/<a href="/doc/1969991/" id="a_49">228</a>/<a href="/doc/326674/" id="a_50">240</a> of the Code and 



we are completely unable to see how the judgment can be read to 



say that it removed from<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_51"> the Code</a>  <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_52">sections 323</a>, <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_53">216</a>, <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_54">386</a>, <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_55">397</a>,

those   provisions.     In   our   view,   on   the   basis   of   the   material   on 



record, it is wrong to assume that the 1996 judgment is a fetter 



against   the   proper   exercise   of   powers   by   a   court   of   competent 



jurisdiction   under   the   relevant   provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_59">   of   the   Code</a>.     If 



according to the curative petitioner, the learned Magistrate failed 



to appreciate the correct legal position and misread the decision 



dated   13.9.1996   as   tying   his   hands   from   exercising   the   power 



under   <a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_60">Section   323</a>   or   under   <a href="/doc/1865807/" id="a_61">Section   216</a>   of   the   Code,   it   can 



certainly be corrected by the appellate/revisional court.   In fact, 



the revision petitions though belatedly filed by the State of M.P. 
</p>


<p id="p_13">and the CBI  (which are still pending) have asserted this position 



in   the   grounds   of   revision.     Moreover,   no   ground   falling   within 



the parameters of <a href="/doc/123456797/" id="a_62">Rupa Ashok Hurra vs. Ashok Hurra</a> 2002 (4)
