HEADNOTE:
     By treaty and by international convention, India allows
transit facilities to Nepal, its neighbour and a land-locked
country. A  company based  in Kathmandu,  Nepal	 imported  a
consignment of	pre-recorded cassettes	from Singapore which
was awaiting its despatch to Nepal at Calcutta Port. As the
665
appellant  company   suspected	 those	 cassettes   to	  be
unauthorised reproductions of its records and cassettes, the
import of  which into  India was  prohibited, the appellant-
company moved  the Registrar  of Copyrights for action under
s.53 of the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_3">Copyright Act</a>, 1957 which enables the Registrar,
after making  such enquiries as he deemed fit, to order that
copies made  out of  India of  a work which if made in India
would infringe	copyright, shall  not be  imported.  As	 the
Registrar did  not take	 expenditious action, the appellant-
company moved  the High	 Court by  a writ petition. A single
Judge made an interim order permitting the appellant-company
to inspect  the consignment and if any of the cassettes were
found to have infringed the appellant's copyright, they were
to be  kept apart until further orders of the Registrar. The
Registrar was  directed to  deal with the application of the
appellant-company in  accordance  with	law.  The  consignee
preferred an  appeal against this order of the single Judge.
A Division  Bench of  the High	Court allowed the appeal and
dismissed the  writ petition  of the  appellant-company. The
Division Bench	held that  there was no importation when the
goods entered  India en	 route to  Nepal. The Division Bench
was of	the view  that the word `import' did not merely mean
bringing the  goods into  India, but  comprehended something
more, that  is, "incorporating	and mixing,  or mixing up of
the goods  imported with  the mass  of the  property in	 the
local area".  The company  obtained special leave to appeal.
The questions  which arose  were : (i) whether international
law is,	 of its	 own force,  drawn into	 the law of the land
without the  aid of  a municipal  statute, (ii)	 whether, so
drawn, it overrides municipal law in case of conflict; (iii)
whether there  is any well established rule of international
law on	the question  of the  right of land-locked states to
innocent passage  of the  goods across	the soil  of another
state; and  (iv) what  is the  meaning of  the word `import'
used in s.53 of the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_4">Copyright Act</a>.
     Allowing the appeal,
^
     HELD :
     On questions (i) &amp; (ii).
     There can	be no  question that nations must march with
the international  community  and  the	municipal  law	must
respect rules  of international	 law even as nations respect
international opinion.	The comity  of nations requires that
rules of  international	 law  may  be  accommodated  in	 the
municipal law  even  without  express  legislative  sanction
provided  they	do  not	 run  into  conflict  with  Acts  of
Parliament. But	 when they  do run  into such  conflict, the
sovereignty and	 the  integrity	 of  the  republic  and	 the
supremacy of the constituted legislatures in
666
making the  laws may  not be  subjected	 to  external  rules
except	to   the  extent   legitimately	 accepted   by	 the
constituted  legislatures   themselves.	 The   doctrine	  of
incorporation also recognises the position that the rules of
international law  are incorporated  into national  law	 and
considered to  be part	of the national law, unless they are
in conflict  with an Act of Parliament. Comity of nations or
no, municipal law must prevail in case of conflict. National
courts cannot  say yes	if  Parliament	has  said  no  to  a
principle of international law. National courts will endorse
international law but not if it conflicts will national law.
National courts	 being organs  of the national state and not
organs of international law must perforce apply national law
if international  law conflicts	 with it. But the courts are
under  an   obligation	within	 legitimate  limits,  to  so
interpret the  municipal statute  as to	 avoid confrontation
with  the   comity  of	 nations  or  the  well	 established
principles  of	 international	law.   But  if	conflict  is
inevitable, the letter must yield. [673 E-H]
     Per Lord  Danning MR  in Trend  text <a href="/doc/1854950/" id="a_5">Trading  Corpn. v.

SCR 53 referred to.
     On question (iii).
     As	 the   leading	authorities   on  international	 law
expressed divergent  views on  the question  of the  transit
rights of  land-locked countries,  the result  has been that
the  land-locked   countries  have  to	rely  on  bilateral,
regional or  multi-lateral agreements for the recognition of
their rights.  They very  existence of innumerable bilateral
treaties, while	 on the	 one hand it raises a presumption of
the existence  of a customary right of transit, on the other
it indicates  the dependence  of the right on agreement. The
most recent  1965 Convention on Transit Trade of Land-Locked
States, to which both Nepal and India are signatories, while
providing for  freedom of  transit for	the passage of goods
between the  land-locked  state	 and  the  sea,	 across	 the
territory  of	a  transit  state  emphasize  the  need	 for
agreement between  the land-locked  country and	 the transit
country. The bilateral Treaty of Trade and Treaty of Transit
entered into  between India  and Nepal	in order  to  expand
trade between the two countries in practice mean a guarantee
to Nepal  to permit free and unhampered flow of goods needed
by Nepal  from India  and a  guarantee of freedom of transit
for  goods   originating  from	 outside  India	 across	 the
territory of  India to	reach Nepal.  But the  Convention on
Transit Trade of Land-locked States and the Treaties between
the two	 countries, leave  either  country  free  to  impose
necessary  restrictions	  for  the   purpose  of  protecting
industrial,
667
iterary or  artistic property  and preventing  false  marks,
false indications  of origin  or  other	 methods  of  unfair
competition in	order to  further other general conventions.
It is  clear that for this purpose, it is not necessary that
the land-locked	 country should	 be a  party to	 the general
conventions   along    with   the   transit   country.	 The
interpretation placed  by John	H.B.  Fried  in	 the  Indian
Journal of international law that the provisions of the 1965
Convention permit  the States  of transit  to enforce, say a
Copyright or  trade mark  convention even  if, for  example,
neither the country of origin nor of destination is party to
it appears to be a correct interpretation. [675 B-H]
     An artistic,  literary or	musical work  is the  brain-
child of  its author,  the fruit  of  his  labour,  and	 so,
considered to be his property. So highly is it prized by all
civilised nations that it is thought worthy of protection by
national laws  and  international  Conventions	relating  to
Copyright. The	International Convention  for the protection
of literary  or artistic  works first signed at Berne on 9th
September,  1886  and  finally	revised	 at  Paris  in	1971
provided for  protection to  the  authors  of  literary	 and
artistic works.	 The Universal	Copyright  Convention  first
signed at  Geneva on 6th September 1952 and revised in Paris
in 1971	 requires the  contracting states to provide for the
adequate and  effective protection  of the rights of authors
and other  copyright proprietors in literary, scientific and
artistic works	including writings,  musical,  dramatic	 and
cinematograph works  and paintings  engraving and sculpture.
[684 G-H]
     On question No. (iv)
     The word  `import' is  not defined in the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_7">Copyright Act</a>
though it  is defined  in the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_8">Customs Act</a>. But the same word
may mean  different things  in different  enactments and  in
different contexts.  It may  even mean	different things  at
different places  in the same statute. It all depends on the
sense  of  the	provision  where  it  occurs.  Reference  to
dictionaries is hardly of any avail particularly in the case
of words  of ordinary  parlance with  a variety of well-know
meanings. Such	word take colour from the context. Appeal to
the Latin  root won't  help. The appeal must be to the sense
of the statute. [689 C-D]
     The submission  that where	 goods are  brought into the
country not  for commerce,  but for  onward transmission  to
another country,  there can,  in law,  be no importation, is
not acceptable.	 In the	 first place,  the language of<a href="/doc/359894/" id="a_9"> s. 53</a>
does not  justify reading  the words `imported for commerce'
for the	 words `imported;  Nor is there any reason to assume
that  such   was  the	object	of  the	 legislature.  While
interpreting the  words`import' in  the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_10">Copyright  Act</a>,	 one
must take  note that  while the	 positive requirement of the
Copyright Conventions is to protect copyright, negatively
668
also, the  Transit Trade Convention and the bilateral Treaty
make exceptions	 enabling the  tranait state to take measure
to protect  Copyright. If  this much  is borne	in mind,  it
becomes clear  that   the word	`import' in <a href="/doc/359894/" id="a_11"> s.	 53</a>  of	 the
Copyright Act  cannot bear  the narrow interpretation sought
to be  placed upon it to limit it to import for commerce. It
must be	 interpreted in a sense which will fit the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_12">Copyright
Act</a> into  the setting of the International Conventions. [690
B-E]
     The word  `import' in seces. 51 and 53 of the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_13">Copyright
Act</a> means  bringing into  India from outside India', that it
is  not	 limited  to  importation  for	commerce  only,	 but
includes importation  for transit  across the  country. This
interpretation,	 far   from  being   inconsistent  with	 any
principle of  International Law,  is entirely in accord with
International Conventions and the Treaties between India and
Nepal.[691 H, 692A]
     The High  Court thought  that goods  may be  said to be
imported into  the country only if there is an incorporation
or mixing  up of  the goods  imported with  the mass  of the
property in  the local	area. In  other words the High Court
relied on  the Original	 Package Doctrine'  as enunciated by
Chief Justice  Marshall in  Brown v.  State of Maryland 6 L,
Ed. 78.	 Reliance was  placed by  the High  Court  upon	 the
decision of  this Court	 in the	 <a href="/doc/1432129/" id="a_14">Central India	Spinning and
Weaving &amp;  Manufacturing Co.  Ltd. The Empress Mills, Nagpur
v. The Municipal Committee, Wardha</a> [1958] SCR 1102. That was
a case	which arose  under the C.P. and Berar Municipalities
Act and	 the question  was whether  the power  to impose  "a
terminal tax goods or animals imported into or exported from
the limits of a municipality" included the right to levy tax
on goods  which `were  neither loaded  or unloaded at Wardha
but were  merely carried across through the municipal area'.
We are	afraid the  case is really not of any guidance to us
since in the context of a `terminal tax' the words `imported
and exported' could be construed in no other manner than was
done by	 the Court.  We must  however say that the `original
package doctrine' on which reliance was placed was expressly
disapproved first  by the  Federal Court  in the <a href="/doc/882976/" id="a_15">Province of
Madras v.  Boddu Paidanna</a>  : [1942]  FCR 90 and again by the
Supreme Court in the <a href="/doc/334293/" id="a_16">State of Bombay v. F.N. Balsara</a>, [1951]
SCR 682. [690 G-H, 691 A-E]
     An order  made under <a href="/doc/359894/" id="a_17"> s. 53</a>  of the  Copyright  Act  is
quasi-judicial. The  Registrar is not bound to make an order
under<a href="/doc/359894/" id="a_18"> s.  53</a> of	 the Copyright Act so soon as an application
is presented  to him  by the  owner of the Copyright. He has
naturally to  consider the context of the mischief sought to
be prevented.  He must	consider whether  the  copies  would
infringe the  Copyright if the copies were made in India. He
must consider  whether the  applicant owns  the copyright or
the duly  authorised agent  of the  Copyright. He  must hear
those claiming	to be  affected if  an	order  is  made	 and
consider any contention that may be put forward as an excuse
for  the   import.  He	 may  consider	any  other  relevant
circumstance. Since all legitimate defences are upon and the
enquiry is  quasi-judicial, no	one can	 seriously complain.

     CHINNAPPA	 REDDY,	  J.   Nepal   is   our	  neighbour.
Unfortunately Nepal  is land-locked.  Nepal's only access to
the sea	 is across  India. So,	as  one	 good  neighbour  to
another with a view to `maintain, develop and strengthen the
friendly relations  between our two countries, by treaty and
by International  Convention, we  allow a  right of innocent
passage in  order to facilitate Nepal's international trade.
One of the questions before us is the extent of this right :
Does the right cover the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">670</span>
transit of  goods which	 may not be imported into India? May
goods which  may not  be brought  into India be taken across
Indian territory? What does "import" mean, more particularly
what does "import" mean in Sec. 53 of the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_19">Copyright Act</a>? Can
an  unauthorised   reproduction	 of  a	literary,  dramatic,
musical	 or   artistic	work   or  a   record  embodying  an
unauthorised  recording	 of  a	record	(which,	 for  short,
adopting trade	parlance, we may call a pirated work), whose
importation  into   India  may	 be  prohibited,  but  whose
importation into  Nepal is  not prohibited,  be taken across
Indian territory  to Nepal?  These are some of the questions
which arise for consideration in this appeal.
</p><p id="p_8">     The questions  have arisen this way: The appellant, the
Gramophone  Company   of  India	 Limited,  is  a  well-known
manufacturer or	 musical records and cassettes. By agreement
with the performing artistes to whom royalties are paid, the
appellant company  is the  owner of  the Copy  right in such
recordings. The	 appellant  received  information  from	 the
Custom.	 Authorities  at  Calcuttath  at  a  consignment  of
prerecorded cassettes  sent by	Universal  Overseas  Private
Ltd.  Singapore	 to  M/s.  Sungawa  Enterprises,  Kathmandu,
Nepal, had arrived at Calcutta Port by ship and was awaiting
despatch to  Nepal. The	 appellant learnt that a substantial
number of  cassettes were  pirated works',  this fact having
come  to   light  through   the	 broken	  condition  of	 the
consignment which  was lying  in the  Calcutta docks. Basing
upon the  information received,	 the  appellant	 sought	 the
intervention of the Registrar of Copyrights for action under
Sec. 53	 of the	 <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_20">Copyright Act</a>, 1957. This provision enables
the Registrar,	after making such enquiries as he deems fit,
to order  that copies  made out	 of India of a work which if
made in	 India would  infringe	copy  right,  shall  not  be
imported. The  provision also enables the Registrar to enter
any ship,  dock or  premises where  such copies may be found
and to	examine such, copies. All copies in respect of which
an order  is made  prohibiting their import are deemed to be
goods the  import of which is prohibited or restricted under
Sec. 11	 of the	 <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_21">Customs Act</a>,  1962. The  provisions of	 the
Custom Act,  are to  have effect in respect of those copies.
All copies  confiscated under the provisions of the said Act
are not	 to vest  in the  Government, but to be delivered to
the owner  of the  copy right  in the work. As the Registrar
was not	 taking expeditious action on the application of the
appellant  and	as  it	was  apprehended  that	the  pirated
cassettes would be released for transportation to Nepal, the
appellant filed	 a writ	 application in	 the  Calcutta	High
Court seeking a writ in the nature of Mandamus to compel the
Registrar to  pass an appropriate order under Sec. 53 of the
<a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_22">Copyright Act</a> and to prevent release
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">671</span>
of  the	  cassettes  from   the	 custody   of  the   customs
authorities. The  learned single  judge of the Calcutta High
Court, on  the request	of the appellant, issued a Rule Nisi
and made  an  interim  order  permitting  the  appellant  to
inspect the  consignment of  cassettes and  if	any  of	 the
cassettes  were	  thought  to	infringe   the	 appellant's
copyright, they	 were to  be kept apart until further orders
of the	Registrar. After causing the necessary inspection to
be made,  the  Registrar  was  directed	 to  deal  with	 the
application under Sec. 53 of the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_23">Copyright Act</a> in accordance
with law after hearing interested parties. The Registrar was
directed to  deal with	the application	 within eight  weeks
from the date of the High Court's order. In the event of any
of the	cassettes held back by the appellant being found not
to infringe  any  provision  of	 the  Copy  right  Act,	 the
appellant was  to pay  damages as  assessed  by	 the  Court.
Against the  learned Single  Judge's  order,  the  consignee
preferred an appeal under clause 15 of the Letters Patent. A
Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court held that the word
'import' did  not merely mean bringing the goods into India,
but comprehended something more, that is, "incorporating and
mixing, or  mixing up of the goods imported with the miss of
the property  in the local area". The learned judges thought
it would  be wrong  to say  that there	was importation into
India, the  moment the	goods  crossed	the  Indian  customs
barrier. Keeping  in  view  the	 treaties  with	 Nepal,	 the
Division Bench	took the  view that there was no importation
when the  goods entered	 India en route to Nepal. The appeal
was, therefore,	 allowed and  the writ petition filed by the
present appellant was dismissed. And so, the writ petitioner
in the	High Court  has appealed  to us	 under	136  of	 the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_9">     First, we	shall examine  if there	 is any	 mandate  of
international law  or if  the  rules  of  international	 law
afford us  any guidance	 and if	 such mandate or guidance is
perceptive under  Indian law.  Two questions  arise,  first,
whether international  law is,	of its own force, drawn into
the law	 of the	 land without the aid of a municipal statute
and, second,  whether, so  drawn, it overrides municipal law
in case	 of conflict. It has been said in England that there
are  two   schools  of	 thought,  one	 school	 of  thought
propounding the doctrine of incorporation and the other, the
doctrine of  transformation.(') According  to the one, rules
of international  law are  incorporated into  the law of the
land automatically  and considered  to be part of the law of
the land unless in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">672</span>
conflict with  an Act of Parliament. According to the other,
rules of  International law  are not  part of the law of the
land, unless  already so  by an	 Act of Parliament, judicial
decision or  long established  custom. According  to the one
whenever the  rules of international law changed, they would
result in  a change  of the law of the land along with them,
'without the  aid of an Act of Parliament.  According to the
other, no  such change	would occur  unless those principles
are 'accepted and adopted by the domestic law'. Lord Danning
who had	 once accepted	the transformation  doctrine without
question, later veered round to express a preference for the
doctrine of  incorporation and	explained  how	courts	were
justified in applying modern rules of international law when
old  rules  of	international  law  changed.  In  fact,	 the
doctrine of  incorporation,  it	 appears,  was	accepted  in
England long  before  Lord  Danning  did  so.  Lord  Danning
himself referred to some old cases. Apart from those, we may
refer to  West Rand  Central Gold  Mining Co. v. The King(1)
where the court said:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	  "It is  quite true  that whatever has received the
     common consent  of civilized nations must have received
     the assent	 of our	 country, and  that to which we have
     assented  along  with  other  nations  in	general	 may
     properly be  called international law, and as such will
     be acknowledged  and applied by our municipal tribunals
     when legitimate  occasion arises for those tribunals to
     decide questions  to which	 doctrines of  international
     law may be relevant".</blockquote>
<p id="p_10">     Lauterpacht in International Law (General Works) refers
to the	position in Germany, France, Belgium and Switzerland
and says  it is the same. He quotes what a German Court said
to meet an argument that the role of customary international
law conflicted	with <a href="/doc/1540780/" id="a_24">Art.24</a>  of the  German  Code  of  Civil
Procedure. The	court had  said,  "The	legislature  of	 the
German Reich  did not  and could not intend any violation of
generally  recognised	rules  of  international  law,	when
enacting <a href="/doc/1540780/" id="a_25">Art.  24</a> of  the German  Code of  Civil Procedure".
Lauterpacht refers to another German case where the argument
that 'there  ought not to be a direct recourse to the law of
nations, except	 in so far as there has been formed a German
customary  law'	  was  rejected	 with  the  statement,	"The
contention  of	 the  Creditor	that  international  law  is
applicable only	 in so	far as it has been adopted by German
Customary law,	lacks foundation  in law. Such a legal maxim
would, more-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">673</span>
<p id="p_11">over, if  generally applied,  lead to  the untenable  result
that in	 the intercourse  of nations with one another, there
would obtain  not a  uniform system-international  law-but a
series of  more or less diverse municipal laws". Lauterpacht
summarises the position this way:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	  "While it, is clear that international law may and
     does act directly within the State, it is equally clear
     that as  a rule  that direct operation of international
     law is,  within the  State subject	 to  the  overriding
     authority of  municipal law. Courts must apply statutes
     even if  they  conflict  with  international  law.	 The
     supremacy of international law lasts, pro foro interno,
     only so  long as  the  State  does	 not  expressly	 and
     unequivocally derogate from it. When it thus prescribes
     a departure  from international  law,  conventional  or
     customary, judges	are confronted	with a	conflict  of
     international law	and municipal  law and, being organs
     appointed by the State, they are compelled to apply the
     latter".</blockquote>
<p id="p_12">     There can	be no  question that nations must march with
the international  community  and  the	Municipal  law	must
respect rules  of International	 law even as nations respect
international opinion.	The comity  of Nations requires that
Rules of  International	 law  may  be  accommodated  in	 the
Municipal Law  even  without  express  legislative  sanction
provided  they	do  not	 run  into  conflict  with  Acts  of
Parliament. But	 when they  do run  into such  conflict, the
sovereignty and	 the  integrity	 of  the  Republic  and	 the
supremacy of the constituted legislatures in making the laws
may not	 be subjected to external rules except to the extent
legitimately  accepted	 by  the   constituted	legislatures
themselves. The	 doctrine of  incorporation also  recognises
the  position  that  the  rules	 of  international  law	 are
incorporated into  national law and considered to be part of
the national  law, unless  they are  in conflict with Act of
Parliament. Comity  of Nations	or no,	Municipal  Law	must
prevail in  case of conflict. National Courts cannot say yes
if Parliament  has said	 no to	a principle of international
law. National  Courts will endorse international law but not
if it  conflicts with  national law.  National courts  being
organs of the National State and not organs of international
law must  perforce apply  national law	if international law
conflicts with	it. But	 the Courts  are under an obligation
within legitimate  limits, to  so  interpret  the  Municipal
Statute as  to avoid conformation with the comity of Nations
or the well established principles of International law. But
if conflict is inevitable, the latter must yield.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">674</span>
<p id="p_13">     The proposition  has been	well stated  by Latham CJ in
Politics v. The Commonwealth(1):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	  "Every statute  is to	 be interpreted and applied,
     as	 far   as  its	 language  admits,   as	 not  to  be
     inconsistent with	the comity  of nations	or with	 the
     established rules	of international  law ..........  It
     must be  held that	 legislation  otherwise	 within	 the
     power of  the. Commonwealth  Parliament does not become
     invalid  because	it  conflicts	with   a   rule	  of
     international law,	 though every  effort should be made
     to	 construe  Commonwealth	 statutes  so  as  to  avoid
     breaches of  international	 law  and  of  international
     comity. The  question, therefore,	is not a question of
     the power	of the	Commonwealth Parliament to legislate
     in breach	of international  law,	but  is	 a  question
     whether in fact it has done so".</blockquote>
<p id="p_14">     The Supreme  Court of  India has  said practically	 the
same thing  in Tractor	export, <a href="/doc/189907/" id="a_26">Moscow	v.  M/s	 Tarapore  &amp;
Company and Anr</a>.(2)
	  "Now, as  stated in  Halsboury's Laws	 of England,
     Vol.  36,	 page  414,  there  is	a  presumption	that
     Parliament does not assert or assume jurisdiction which
     goes  beyond  the	limits	established  by	 the  common
     consent of	 nations and  statutes are to be interpreted
     provided, that  their language permits, so as not to be
     inconsistent with	the comity  of nations	or with	 the
     established principles  of international  law. But this
     principle applies	only where there is an ambiguity and
     must give	way before a clearly expressed intention. If
     statutory enactments are clear in meaning, they must be
     construed according  to their  meaning even though they
     are contrary  to the comity of nations or international
     law".
</p><p id="p_15">     The observations show that the court was only concerned
with a principle of interpretation, but, by, implication, it
may be possible to say that the court preferred the doctrine
of incorporation;  otherwise the  question of interpretation
would not truly arise. What has been
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">675</span>
said in	 the Tractoroexport case is entirely consistent with
what we have  said earlier.
</p><p id="p_16">     Is	  there	   any	 well	established   principle	  of
international law  on the  question of	the right  of  land-
locked States  to innocent  passage of goods across the soil
of another  State? It  appears that "the leading authorities
on international  law have  expressed divergent views on the
question of  the transit  rights of  land-locked  countries.
While one  group of  writers, such  as, Sibert,	 Scelle	 and
others have  held the  view that  these	 countries  have  an
inherent right	of transit  across  neighbouring  countries,
other equally eminent authorities, such as, Mc Nair and Hyde
have held  the view  that these	 rights are  not  principles
recognised   by	  international	  law,	 but   arrange	 but
arrangements made  by sovereign	 States". (1)  The result of
the  lack  of  unanimity  has  been  that  the	land  locked
countries have	to rely	 on bilateral,	regional  or  multi-
lateral agreements  for the recognition of their rights. The
very existence	of innumerable	bilateral treaties, while on
the one	 hand it  raises it  raises  a	presumption  of	 the
existence of  a customary  right of transit, on the other it
indicates the  dependence of  the right	 on  agreement.	 The
discontenting situation	 led  to  attempts  by	national  to
commodity the  rules relating to transit trade. The earliest
attempt was  the Convention  on the Freedom of Transit known
generally as  the Barcelona  Convention. The  second attempt
was the	 Convention on the High Cease, 1958. The most recent
in the	1965 CONVENTION	 ON  TRANSIT  TRADE  OF	 LAND-LOCKED
STATES. As  this is the latest Convention on the subject and
as both	 India and  Nepal have signed the Convention, it may
be useful  to refer to it in some detail. The Convention was
the result  of a  Resolution of	 the United  Nations General
Assembly  which,   "recognising	 the   need  of	 land-locked
countries  for	adequate  transit  facilities  in  promoting
international trade",  invited "the  Governments  of  Member
States to  give full recognition to the needs of land-locked
Member States  in the matter of transit trade and therefore,
to accord them adequate facilities in terms of international
law and	 practice in  this regard,  bearing mind  the future
requirements resulting	from the economic development of the
land-locked countries".	 <a href="/doc/498442/" id="a_27">Article 1  (a)</a>	 of  the  Convention
defines	 the  term  'land-locked  States'  as  meaning	'any
Contracting State  which has  no sea-cast. The term "traffic
in Transit"  is defined	 like this:  the  passage  of  goods
including unaccompanied	 baggage across	 the territory	of a
Contracting State between
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">676</span>
a land-locked  State and  the sea  when	 the  passage  is  a
portion of  a complete	 journey  which begins or terminates
within the  territory of  that land-locked  State and  which
includes sea  transport directly preceding or following such
passage. The  transshipment, warehousing, breaking bulk, and
change in the mode of transport of such goods as well as the
assembly, disassembly  or reassembly  of machinery and bulky
goods shall  not render	 the passage  of goods	outside	 the
definition of  "traffic in  transit" provided  that any such
operation  is  undertaken  solely  for	the  convenience  of
transportation. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed
as imposing  an	 obligation  on	 any  Contracting  State  to
establish  or	permit	the   establishment   of   permanent
facilities on  its territory  for such assembly, disassembly
or reassembly";	 The term  "transit  State"  is	 defined  as
meaning 'any  Contracting State with or without a sea-coast,
situated between  a land-locked	 State and  the sea, through
whose territory	 "traffic in  transit"	passes'.  <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_28">Article  2</a>
prescribes that	 freedom of  transit shall  be granted under
the terms  of this  Convention for  traffic in	transit	 and
means of  transport. Traffic in transit is to be facilitated
on routes  in use  mutually acceptable	for transit  to	 the
Contracting States  concerned. No  discrimination is  to  be
exercise based on the place of origin departure, entry, exit
or  destination	  or  any   circumstances  relating  to	 the
ownership  of	the  goods   or	 the   ownership,  place  of
registration or	 flag of   vessels,  land vehicles  or other
means of  transport used.  <a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_29">Art. 3</a>  provides for exemption of

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">618</span>
<p id="p_20">     It is thus seen that the Convention while providing for
freedom of  transit for the passage of goods between a land-
locked State  and the sea, across the territory of a transit
State emphasizes  the need  for agreement  between the land-
locked country	and the	 transit country and, more important
for our	 present purposes,  it specifies certain exceptions.
It is  indeed remarkable  that the Convention places traffic
(illicit) in  industrial, literary  or artistic	 property on
the same  footing as  traffic in  narcotics, dangerous drugs
and arms.  This opinion	 of the	 International Community  as
revealed by  the convention  must be borne in my mind in our
further	 consideration	 of  the   question.  It   may,	  be
interesting to	notice	here  what  Johan  H.E.	 Fried,	 who
represented the Government of Nepal as one of the members of
the delegation	at the	U.N. Conference	 which produced	 the
Convention, has to say about these exceptions. In an article
which he  wrote in  the Indian Journal of International law,
he said,:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">	  "The test  of a  treaty are  its  exceptions.	 The
     proof of  a treaty pudding is, when it cannot be eaten.
     It is  the old  problem of	 finding a  balance  between
     demands for  saving clauses and the opposite claim that
     the very  value of a treaty depends on its reliability.
     For land  locked States,  conditions under their outlet
     to the  outside world may be curtailed can of course be
     crucial.</blockquote>
<p id="p_21">     The Convention declares exceptions permissible for five
reasons (1) certain well-specified reasons of public policy;
(2) because  of overriding  international  obligations;	 (3)
emergency in the country of transit; (4) in case of war: (5)
protection of its essential security interests.
</p><p id="p_22">     A few  words about each, in view of their extraordinary
importance.
</p><p id="p_23">     1. Exceptions  for reasons	 of public policy. The State
of transit  may-this is	 permissive, not obligatory-prohibit
transit of  certain goods  for the  reason that their import
into its  own territory is prohibited, namely (<a href="/doc/1678224/" id="a_50">Art. 11</a>, Para
</p><p id="p_24">1):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">     (a)     grounds  of   public  morals-   e.g.,  indecent

	  (e.g.,  contaminated	food  or  improperly  packed
	  explosives);
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">     (c)    as	precaution  against  animal  diseases  plant
	  diseases or pests.</blockquote>
<p id="p_25">     This clause  (dubbed at  the Conference  as the  "dirty
pictures  and	rotten	fish   clause")	   will	 not  hamper
international trade if properly applied.
</p><p id="p_26">     2. The same can probably be said of the "measures which
a Contracting  State may  be called  upon to take ("poutetre
amena a	 prendre" in  the equally  authentic French  version
which is  several niches  less permissive)  in obedience  to
certain international  treaties to  which  it  is  a  party,
namely, treaty provisions relating to
</p><p id="p_27">     (a)  "expert, import or (i) transit of particular kinds
	  of articles  such as narcotics, or other dangerous
	  drugs, or  arms". (As to arms this would therefore
	  only become  operative if  a worldwide or regional
	  treaty prohibiting  or  restricting  international
	  arms trade existed).
</p><p id="p_28">     (b)  "protection of  industrial, literary	or  artistic
	  property, or	protection of  trade names", and the
	  like
	  These	 provisions   are  noteworthy  because	they
     permit the	 States of  transit to	enforce, say a copy-
     right or  trade-mark convention  even if  for  example,
     neither the  country of  origin nor  of destination  is
     party to  it...........................  Far  as  these
     provisions go, transit traffic must not be hampered for
     any other	reason of  public policy  of  the  State  of
     transit. If  that State  forbids importation of certain
     luxury goods  for	financial  reasons,  or	 of  certain
     textiles to protect its own spinning industry, that is,
     economic reasons,	or of shortwave radios for political
     reasons-all such  goods must still be permitted to pass
     through its territory.

neighbour Nepal	 and the  Protocols. First,  the 'Treaty  of
Trade' which  was  contracted  "in  order  to  expand  trade
between	  their	  respective   territories   and   encourage
collaboration in  economic development".  <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_51">Art. 2</a>  stipulates
that  the  contracting	parties	 shall	endeavour  to  grant
maximum facilities  and to  undertake all necessary measures
for the	 free and  unhampered flow  of goods,  needed by one
country	 from  the  other,  to	and  from  their  respective
territories. <a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_52">Art.  3</a>  enjoins  the  contracting	 parties  to
accord unconditionally	to  each  other	 treatment  no	less
favourable than	 that accorded	to any	third  country	with
respect to  (a) customs	 duties and  charges of	 any	kind
imposed on or in connection with importation and exportation
and   (b)    import   regulations   including	quantitative
restrictions. <a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_53">Art.  4</a> provides	that the contracting parties
should, on  a reciprocal  basis, exempt	 from basic  customs
duty as well as from quantitative restrictions the import of
such primary  products as  may be mutually agreed upon, from
each other.  <a href="/doc/691208/" id="a_54">Art. 8</a>  casts a duty on the contracting parties
to  cooperate	effectively  with   each  other	 to  prevent
infringement  and  circumvention  of  the  laws,  rules	 and
regulations of	either country	in  regard  to	the  matters
relating to  foreign exchange  and  foreign  trade.  <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_55">Art.  9</a>
specially  provides   that   notwithstanding   the   earlier
provisions  of	the  treaty  either  Contracting  Parry	 may
maintain or introduce such restrictions as are necessary for
the purpose of

hereafter, to  which it	 is a  party  relating	to  transit,
export or  import of  particular kinds	of articles  such as
opium or  other dangerous  drugs or  in pursuance of general
conventions intended  to prevent infringement of industrial,
literary or  artistic property	or relating  to false marks,
false indications  of origin  or  other	 methods  of  unfair
competition".
</p><p id="p_39">     It appears	 to us	that the  Treaty of  Trade concerned
itself with trade between India and Nepal and not with trade
between Nepal  and other  countries. The provisions relating
to import,  export, transit and the free and unhampered flow
of goods refer to the import and the export from one country
to another  i.e. from India to Nepal and from Nepal to India
and to the transit and the free and unhampered flow of goods
in the	course of  trade between the two countries. Even so,
express reservation  is made to enable each of the countries
to impose restrictions for certain purposes and to take such
measures as may be necessary for the protection of essential
security   interests	and    effectuating    international
conventions relating  to opium and other dangerous drugs and
also to	 effectuate "general conventions intended to prevent
infringement of industrial, literary or artistic property or
relating to  false marks,  false indications  or  origin  or
other methods of unfair competition". (<a href="/doc/492977/" id="a_57">Art. 10</a>)
     The Treaty of Transit is more relevant. Its scheme, and
sequence and  even the language indicate that it is based on
the  1965   CONVENTION	ON   TRANSIT  TRADE  OF	 LAND-LOCKED
COUNTRIES. The Preamble to the treaty mentions that a treaty
has been  concluded 'recognising that Nepal as a land-locked
country needs  access to  and from  the sea  to promote	 its
international trade,  and recognising the need to facilitate
the traffic  in transit	 through their	territories'. <a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_58">Art. 3</a>
defines 'Transit' in Transit' and is as follows:
</p><p id="p_40">     "The term	'Traffic in  Transit' means  the passage  of

not render  the passage	 of goods outside the idefinition of

undertaken solely  for the  convenience	 of  transportation.
Nothing in  the Article	 shall be  construed as	 imposing an
obligation on  either  Contracting  Party  to  establish  or

territory for such assembly, disassembly, or reassembly".
</p><p id="p_41">     <a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_59">Art.1</a>  requires   the  Contracting	 Parties  to  accord

</p><p id="p_44">     <a href="/doc/19636/" id="a_62">Art. 6</a>  stipulates that  Traffic in  Transit  shall  be

STATES and  are similar	 to <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_63">Article  9</a> and  <a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_64">5</a> to  10 of	 the
Treaty of  Trade and  reserve  the  right  of  each  of	 the
contracting  parties  to  impose  restrictions	for  certain
purposes  and  take  measures  in  connection  with  certain
interests. In particular <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_65">Art. 9</a> mentions that nothing in the
treaty shall  prevent either  Contracting Party	 from taking
any measure  which may	be necessary in pursuance of general
conventions intended  to prevent infringement of industrial,
literary or  artistic property	or relating  to false marks,
false indications of origin or other methods of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">683</span>
unfair competition.
</p><p id="p_45">     The protocol  annexed to the Treaty of Transit contains
a detailed  procedure for  the transit	of goods  across the
territory of  India en-route  from the	Port of	 Calcutta to
their	Nepalese destination. The Protocol contains detailed
provisions to ensure the goods reaching Nepal and to prevent
the contingency of the goods escaping into the Indian market
while on the way to Nepal.
</p><p id="p_46">     While the	Treaty of Trade generally guarantees to each
of the	Contracting Parties  the free and unhampered flow of
goods needed  by one  country from  the other, the Treaty of
Transit generally  guarantees to  each	of  the	 Contracting
Parties freedom of transit across the territory of the other
Contracting Party  in respect  of goods	 which have  to pass
through the  territory of  such other  Contracting party  to
reach the first Contracting Party from outside the territory
of  the	 second	 Contracting  Party.  In  practice  the	 two
treaties really mean a guarantee to Nepal to permit free and
unhampered flow	 of goods  needed by  Nepal from India and a
guarantee of  freedom of  transit for goods originating from
outside India  across the territory of India to reach Nepal.
In the	matter of  payment of  customs duties  the Treaty of
Trade provides	for the	 most favourable treatment while the
Treaty of  Transit grants  exemption from such payment. Both
treaties  contain   reservations.  There  is  a	 reservation
enabling  the	imposition  of	 such  restrictions  as	 are
necessary for  the  purpose  of	 protecting  public  morals,
human,	animal	 and  plant   life,  safeguarding   national
treasures, the implementation of laws relating to the import
and export  of gold  and silver bullion and the safeguarding
of other  mutually agreed  interests. There  is	 an  express
reservation  for   the	protection   of	 essential  security
interests. There is also provision for necessary measures in
pursuance of  general international  conventions relating to
transit, export or import of articles such as opium or other
dangerous drugs.  There	 is  further  provision	 for  taking
necessary  measures  in	 pursuance  of	general	 conventions
intended to prevent infringement of industrial, literary and
artistic  property   or	 relating   to	false  marks,  false
indications  of	  origin  or   other   methods	 of   unfair
competition. So,  the two treaties generally assure to Nepal
the free  and unhampered  flow from  India  and	 freedom  of
transit across	India, to goods or of goods which we may say
in the broad way are not res extra commercium. In particular
the treaties expressly contain reservations enabling each of
the contracting parties to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">684</span>
take measures  in pursuance  of general	 conventions for the
protection of industrial, literary and artistic property.
</p><p id="p_47">     So we  have it  that <a href="/doc/1678224/" id="a_66">Art.	11</a> of the 1965 CONVENTION ON
TRANSIT TRADE  OF LAND-LOCKED  STATES, <a href="/doc/492977/" id="a_67">Art. 10</a> of the Treaty
of Trade  and <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_68">Art.  9</a>  of  the	Treaty	of  Transit  contain
exceptions to  protect	"industrial,  literary	or  artistic
property" and  to prevent "false marks, false indications of
origin or  other methods of unfair competition", pursuant to
general conventions. Neither the International Convention of
1965 nor  the Treaties	between the two nations prohibit the
imposing of  restrictions for  this purpose.  On  the  other
hand, they contain reservations to the contrary. So great is
the concern  of the  International Community for industrial,
literary or artistic property that the Convention on Transit
Trade of  Land-locked Countries	 views traffic in, this kind
of property  with the  same gravity  as it  views traffic in
narcotics   dangerous drugs  and arms. So, the Convention on
Transit Trade of Land-locked States and the Treaties between
the two	 countries, leave  either  country  free  to  impose
necessary  restrictions	  for  the   purpose  of  protecting
industrial, literary  or artistic  property  and  preventing
faise marks, false indications of origin or other methods of
unfair competitions  in order  to  further    other  general
conventions. It	 is clear  that for  this purpose, it is not
necessary that	the land-locked country should be a party to
the general  Convention along  with the transit country. The
interpretation	placed	 by  Johan   H.E.  Fried   that	 the
provisions of  the 1965.  Convention permit  the  States  of
transit to enforce, sa/ a Copyright or trade mark convention
even if,  for example,	neither the country of origin nor of
destination is	party to  it appears  to us  to be a correct
interpretation.
</p><p id="p_48">     The next  step for	 us to	consider is whether there is
any general  Convention on  Copyright. An artistic, literary
or musical  work is the brain-child of its author, the fruit
of his	labour, and,  so, considered  to be his property. So
highly is  it prized  by all  civilised nations	 that it  is
thought	 worthy	  of  protection   by  national	  laws	 and
international  Conventions   relating  to   Copyright.	 The
International Convention  for the  protection of literary or
artistic works first signed at Berne on 9th September, 1886,
was revised  at Berlin in 1908, at Rome in 1928, at Brussels
in 1948,  at Stockholm in 1967 and finally at Paris in 1971.
<a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_69">Art. 1</a>	of  the	 Convention,  as  revised,  constitutes	 the
countries to  which the	 Convention applies into a Union for
the protection of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">685</span>
the rights  of authors in their literary and artistic works.
The expression	 'literary and artistic works' is defined to
include every  production in  the literary,  scientific	 and
artistic domain whatever may be the mode or formation of its
expression.  It	 is  provided  that  the  work	shall  enjoy
protection in  all countries of the Union. Various detailed,
provisions are	made in the Convention for the protection of
the works.  <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_70">Art. 9</a>  provides that  authors of  literary	 and
artistic works	protected by  the convention shall enjoy the
exclusive right	 of authorising	 the reproduction  of  these
works in any manner or form. It is also expressly stipulated
that any  sound or visual recording shall be considered as a
reproduction for  the purposes of the Convention. We are not
really concerned with the several details of the Convention.
But we may refer to <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_71">Art. 16</a> which provides:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">     "1.   Infringing copies  of a  work shall	be liable to
	  seizure in any country of the Union where the work
	  enjoy legal protection;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">     2.	   The	provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall
	  also apply  to reproductions coming from a country
	  where the  work is  not protected or has ceased to
	  be protected.</blockquote>
<p id="p_49">     3. The  seizure shall take place in accordance with the
Legislation of	each country".	India we  may mention  is  a
party to the Berne Convention.
</p><p id="p_50">     The Universal  Copyright  Convention  which  was  first
signed in  Geneva on  September 6, 1952 was revised in Paris
in 1971.  Each Contracting State is called upon to undertake
'to provide for the adequate and effective protection of the
right  of  authors  and	 other	copy-right  proterietors  in
literary, scientific  and artistic works including writings,
musical, dramatic  and cinematograph  works  and  paintings,
engraving and  sculpture'. The	rights are  to	include	 the
exclusive right	 to authorise  reproduction  by	 any  means,
public performance  and broadcasting. Each Contracting State
is required  to adopt  such measures  as  are  necessary  to
ensure the  application of the Convention. The Convention is
not in	any  way  to  affect  the  provision  of  the  Berne
Convention for	the protection of literary or artistic works
or membership  in the  Union created by that Convention. The
Universal Copyright  Convention is  not	 applicable  to	 the
relationships among countries of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">686</span>
the Berne Union in so far as it relates to the protection of
works having  as their country of origin, within the meaning
of the Berne Convention, a country of the Berne Union. India
is a signatory to the Universal Copyright convention also.

"any such  record embodying  the  same	recording.  If	such

     Sec. 52  enumerates the acts which shall not constitute

of the excepted acts.
</p><p id="p_60">     Sec. 53  which is	of direct relevance as it deals with

the owner  of the  copyright in	 any work  or by  this	duly
authorised agent  and on payment of the prescribed fee, may,
after making such inquiry as he deems fit, order that copies
made out  of India  of the work which if made in India would
infringe copyright shall not be imported.
</p><p id="p_62">     (2) Subject  to any  rules made  under  this  Act,	 the

</p><p id="p_67">     The question is what does the word import' mean in Sec.
53 of  the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_92">Copyright  Act</a> ?  The word  is not defined in the
<a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_93">Copyright Act</a>  though it  is defined in the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_94">Customs Act</a>. But
the  same  word	 may  mean  different  things  in  different
enactments and	in different  contexts.	 It  may  even	mean
different things at different places in the same statute. It
all depends  on the  sense of the provision where it occurs.
Reference  to	dictionaries  is   hardly  of	any   avail,
particularly in	 the case of words of ordinary parlance with
a variety  of well  known meanings.  Such words	 take colour
from the  context. Appeal  to the Latin root won't help. The
appeal must  be to  the sense of the statute. Hidayatullah J
in Burmah  Shall etc v. Commercial Tax Officer, [1961] 1 SCR
902 has	 illustrated how the contextual meanings of the very
words import' and export' may vary.
</p><p id="p_68">     We may  look at  Sec.  53,	 rather	 than  elsewhere  to
discover the meaning of the word  "import". We find that the
meaning is  stated in  that provision itself. If we ask what
is not to be imported, we find the answer is copies made out
of India which if made in India would infringe copyright. So
it follows  that 'import'  in the  provision means  bringing
into India  from out of India. That, we see in precisely how
import is  defined under  the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_95">Customs Act</a>. Sec. 2(23) of the
<a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_96">Customs Act</a>, 1962 defines the word in this manner:
</p><p id="p_69">     "Import, with  its grammatical  variation	and  cognate
expression means  bringing into	 India from  a place outside
India. But we do not propose to have recourse to <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_97">Customs Act</a>
to interpret  expressions in the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_98">Copyright Act</a> even if it is
permissible to do so because Sec. 53 of the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_99">Copyright Act</a> is
made to run with Sec. 11 of the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_100">Customs Act</a>.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">690</span>
<p id="p_70">     It	 was   admitted	 by  the  learned  counsel  for	 the
respondents that  where go  are brought into the country not
for commerce,  but for onward submission to another country,
there can,  in law,  be no  important. It  was said that the
object of  the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_101">Copyright  Act</a>  was  to	precious  authorised
reproduction of	 the work  or the  unauthorised explosion of
the reproduction  of a	work in	 India and this object would
not be	frustrated if  infringing  copies  of  a  work	were
allowed transit	 across the country. If goods are brought in
only to	 go out,  there is  no import,	it was	said. It  is
difficult to  agree with this submission thought it did find
favour with  the Division  Bench of the Calcutta High Court,
in the	judgment under	appeal.	 In  the  first	 place,	 the
language of  Sec. 53  does not	justify	 reading  the  words
'imported for commerce for the words imported'. Nor is there
any reason  to assume  that  such  was	the  object  of	 the
legislature. We have already mentioned the imported attached
by International  opinion,  as	manifested  by	the  various
International Conventions and Treaties, to the protection of
Copyright and  the gravity with which traffic in industrial,
literary or  artistic  property	 is  viewed,  treating	such
traffic on  par with  traffic in  narcotics, dangerous drugs
and arms.  In interpreting the word import' in the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_102">Copyright
Act</a>, we	 must take  note that  while positive requirement of
the  Copyright	 Conventions  is   to	protect	  copyright,
negatively  also,  the	Transit	 Trade	Convention  and	 the
bilateral Treaty  make exceptions enabling the Transit State
to take	 measure to protect Copyright. If this much is borne
in mind, it becomes bear that the word import' in Sec. 53 of
the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_103">Copyright  Act</a> cannot  bear the  narrow   interpretation
sought to  be placed  upon it  to limit	 it  to	 import	 for
commerce. It  must be  interpreted in a sense which will fit
the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_104">Copyright  Act</a> into	 the setting  of  the  International
Conventions.
</p><p id="p_71">     The Calcutta  High Court thought that goods may be said
to be  imported	 into  the  country  only  if  there  is  an
incorporation or  mixing up  of the  goods imported with the
mass of	 the property  in the local area. In other words the
High Court  realized on	 the original  package doctrine'  as
enunciate by  the American Court. Reliance was placed by the
High Court  upon the  decision of  this court in the Central
India Spinning	and Weaving  &amp; Manufacturing  Co.  Ltd;	 The
Empress Mills,	Nagpur v.  The Municipal  Committee,  Wardha
[1958] SCR 1102). That was a case which arose under the C.P.
and Berar  Municipalities Act  and the	question was whether
the power  to impose  'a terminal  tax on  goods or  animals
imported into
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">691</span>
or exported  from the limits of a municipality" included the
right to  levy tax  on goods  which were  neither loaded  or
unloaded at  Wardha but	 were merely  carried across through
the municipal  area'. This  court said	that it did not. The
word 'import'  it was  thought meant not merely the bringing
into but  camprised something  more, that  is 'incorporating
and mixing  up of the goods with the mass of the property in
the local  area', thus	accepting  the	enunciation  of	 the
'Original Package  Doctrine' by	 Chief Justice	Marshall  in
Brown v.  State of Maryland 6 L.Ed. 78. Another reason given
by the	learned Judges to arrive at the conclusion that they
did, was  that the  very levy  was  a  'terminal  tax'	and,
therefore, the	words 'import  and  export',  in  the  given
context, had something to do with the idea of a terminus and
not an	intermediate Stage  of a  journey. We are afraid the
case is	 really not  of any  guidance to  us  since  in	 the
context	 of   a	 'terminal  tax'  the  words  'imported	 and
exported' could	 be construed  in no  other manner  than was
done by	 the Court.  We must  however say that the 'original
package doctrine' as enunciated by Chief Justice Marshall on
which reliance was placed was expressly disapproved first by
the Federal  Court  in	the  Province  of  Madras  v.  Buddu
Paidama, [1942]	 FCR 90	 and again  by the  Supreme Court in
<a href="/doc/334293/" id="a_105">State of Bombay v. F.N. Balsara</a>, [1951] SCR 682. Apparently,
these decisions	 were not brought to the notice of the court
which decided the case of Central India Spinning and Weaving
and  Manufacturing   Co.  Ltd.	 The  Empress  Mills  Nagpur
Municipal Committee,  Wardha. So we derive no help from this
case. As we said, we prefer to interpret the words  'import'
as it is found in the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_106">Copyright Act</a> rather than research for
its meaning  by referring  to other  than research  statutes
where it has been used.
</p><p id="p_72">     The learned  counsel  for	the  appellant	invited	 our
attention to <a href="/doc/1248515/" id="a_107">Radhakishan v. Union of India</a> : [1965] 2 S.C.R.
213, <a href="/doc/895622/" id="a_108">Shawhney  v. Sylvania  and Laxman</a>,	 77  Bom.  LR.	380,
<a href="/doc/967622/" id="a_109">Bernado v.  Collector of  Customs</a> A.I.R. 1960 Kerala 170, to
urge that  importation was  complete so	 soon as the Customs
barrier was  crossed. They  are cases  under the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_110">Customs Act</a>
and it	is needless for us to seek aid from there when there
is enough  direct light	 under the  <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_111">Copyright  Act</a>  and	 the
various conventions and treaties which have with the subject
Copyright' from	 different angles.  We do not also desire to
crow our  judgment with	 reference to  the  history  of	 the
Copyright and the Customs legislations in the United Kingdom
and India  as we  do not think it necessary to do so in this
case.
</p><p id="p_73">     We have,  therefore, no  hesitation in  coming  to	 the
conclusion that	 the word 'import' in Secs. 51 and 53 of the
<a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_112">Copyright Act</a>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">692</span>
means 'bringing	 into India  from outside India', that it is
not limited  to importation  for commerce  only but includes
importation   for    transit   across	the   country.	 Our
interpretation,	 far   from  being   inconsistent  with	 any
principle of  International law,  is entirely in accord with
International Conventions and the Treaties between India and
Nepal. And, that we think is as it should be.
</p><p id="p_74">     We have said that an order under Sec. 53 may be made by
the Registrar  of Copyrights on the application of the owner
of the	Copyright, but	after making  such  enquiry  as	 the
Registrar deems	 fit. On  the order being made the offending
copies	are  deemed  to	 be  goods  whose  import  has	been
prohibited or  restricted under	 Sec. 11 of the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_113">Customs Act</a>.
There upon the relevant provisions of the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_114">Customs Act</a> are to
apply, with the difference that confiscated copies shall not
vest in	 the Government, but shall be delivered to the owner
of the	Copyright. One	fundamental difference	between	 the
nature of  a Notification  under Sec.  11 of the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_115">Customs Act</a>
and an order made under Sec. 53 of the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_116">Copyright Act</a> is that
the former  is quasi-legislative  in  character,  while	 the
latter is  quasi-judicial in  character. The  quasi-judicial
nature of the order made under Sec. 53 is further emphasised
by the	fact that  an appeal  is provided  to the  Copyright
Board against the order of the Registrar under Sec.72 of the
Copyright Act.	We mention  the character of the order under
Sec. 53 to indicate that the effect of an order under of the
<a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_117">Copyright Act</a>  is not  as portentous as a notification under
Sec. 11	 of the	 <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_118">Customs Act</a>.  The Registrar is nor bound to
make an	 order under Sec. 53 of the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_119">Copyright Act</a> so soon as
an application	is presented  to him  by the  owner  of	 the
Copyright. He  has naturally  to consider the context of the
mischief sought	 to be	prevented. He  must consider whether
