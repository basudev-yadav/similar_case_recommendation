<p id="p_1">1.     By this order, I propose to decide the pending interim application
being I.A. No. 10442/2013 filed by the plaintiff under Order XXXIX, Rules
1 and 2 of Code Of Civil Procedure 1908 (hereinafter referred to as "CPC")
in a suit for permanent injunction restraining infringement of trade mark,
corporate name, copyright, passing off, rendition of accounts, delivery up
etc.
</p><p id="p_2">2.     The case of the plaintiff is that plaintiff i.e. Mex Switchgears Private
Limited through its predecessor is the first adopter and user of the trade
mark MEX since the year 1960 for electric switchgears, switches, ignition
switches, electric capacitators, electric meters, starting devices for electric
motors etc. and various other electric goods. The plaintiff is also stated to be
using the trade mark MEX on CFL bulbs, kitkats, fuses, distribution boxes,




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">I.A. No.10442/2013 in CS(OS) No.1299/2013                       Page 1 of 37</span>
 circuit breakers wires and cable miniature circuit breaker (MCBS), Control
Panels for Meters and submersible pumps etc.
</p><p id="p_3">3.     It has been stated by the plaintiff that the word MEX is an integral
part of the corporate name of the Plaintiff Company since its incorporation
in the year 1979 and that earlier to this, the Managing Director of the
plaintiff i.e. Mr. Jai Krishan Saini had a partnership firm consisting of the
name Mex Electro Corporation and the firm had adopted the trademark
MEX in 1960. The plaintiff claims that it has an exclusive right over the
word MEX both by virtue of trademark registration and presence of the
word MEX in its corporate name.
</p><p id="p_4">4.     The plaintiff has stated that it is a registered proprietor of various
trademarks relating MEX under classes 7, 9 and 11 for various goods, details
of which are given in Para 5 of the plaint and some of which are: trademark
MEX (label) registered for electric switchgears and switches under class 9 as
on 31st August 1962 bearing registration no. 211055; trademark MEX
registered for ignition switches, electric capacitators, electric plugs, electric
distribution boards, electric meters and electric circuit breakers included in
class 9 as on 28th July 1979 bearing registration no. 351897; trademark MEX
registered for electric motor (not for land vehicles) and parts thereof
included in class 7 as on 4th August 1988, used since 1st April 1960, bearing
registration no. 495452; trademark MEX registered for gas stoves and parts
thereof under class 11 as on 20th June 1983 bearing registration no. 406916.
</p><p id="p_5">5.     The plaintiff is also stated to have obtained registrations of its trade
mark MEX in Nepal under classes 7 and 11. The plaintiff also holds a
copyright registration of the artistic work titled MEX. The plaintiff has a
huge sales turnover details of which are given in Para 12 of the plaint and
the sales turnover for the year 2011-12 is stated to be ` 20,81,50,303/-. The


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">I.A. No.10442/2013 in CS(OS) No.1299/2013                        Page 2 of 37</span>
 plaintiff has widely advertised the trade mark MEX and the details of the
advertisement and publicity expenses have been given in Para 13 of the
plaint and the said expenses for the year 2011-2012 have been stated to be
`42,46,105/-.
</p><p id="p_6">6.     It has been stated that the plaintiff has attained enviable reputation and
goodwill for its trademark MEX and has successfully contested several
oppositions in the trade mark registry from time to time on the basis of its
prior adoption and use. Also in a suit preferred by the plaintiff against one
Mr.Gopal Krishan using the trademark MAX standard as well as the
corporate name MAX STANDARD SWITCHGEARS PVT. LTD., the
plaintiff vide an order dated 22nd February, 1992 had got an injunction
against the said defendant. The plaintiff states to have been always vigilant
about protection of its trademark MEX.
</p><p id="p_7">7.     It is the case of the plaintiff that its attention was drawn to the
defendant company which has been incorporated only in the year 2011. The
defendant had, according to the plaintiff, adopted an identical trade mark and
also an identical corporate name. On the receipt of the said information the
plaintiff addressed two notices dated 31st October, 2012 and 27th November,
2012 to the defendant, out of which though the first notice dated 31 st
October, 2012 was served on the defendant, second returned as unserved.
</p><p id="p_8">8.     It is the case of the plaintiff that the use of expression MAX, which is
identical/deceptively similar to the registered trademark MEX of the
plaintiff, either as a trademark or trade name by the defendant is bound to
cause confusion and deception amongst the purchasing public and trade
which leading to think that the defendant's goods bearing the trademark
MAX originate from the same source i.e. the Plaintiff. The presence of the
word MAX in the corporate name of the defendant would also create


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">I.A. No.10442/2013 in CS(OS) No.1299/2013                        Page 3 of 37</span>
 deception and confusion and create an impression as if the defendant has
some connection with the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_9">9.     The plaintiff contends that the trade mark MAX is visually,
phonetically as well as structurally similar to the well known trade mark
MEX of the plaintiff. The adoption of the trademark/trade name MAX by
the defendant is with a dishonest motive to create mischief and to deceive
the purchasing public by seeking to create an impression that its products are
somehow connected with the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_10">10.    On the other hand, it is the case of the defendant that its directors are
in the business of Heavy Electrical for the last many years and in the year
2011 the defendant took over the running business of its predecessor M/s
MAX ELECTRICKS which was one of the proprietary concerns of one of
its directors who conceived the idea of starting the present business in the
year 2000.
</p><p id="p_11">11.    It has been stated that the product sold by the defendant bears only a
device mark/logo which has been conceived and adopted by the defendant
itself and that the aforesaid device mark/logo of the defendant is entirely
different and has no visual or any kind of other similarity with any
trademark(s) of the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_12">12.    It has also been stated that the defendant is a seller of well known
prestigious heavy electrical goods and is the business of electrical and
consulting engineers, electrical contractors, manufactures and supplier of
electrical items used in medium to high transmission lines like vacuum
circuit breaker (VCBs), load break switches and panels, unitised sub-stations
and equipments etc. the said electrical products are heavy engineering
products which are customised as per the requirements of the client which
varies in each and every case depending upon industry to industry. So as


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">I.A. No.10442/2013 in CS(OS) No.1299/2013                       Page 4 of 37</span>
 per the defendant, the question of trademark infringement does not arise.
Further, the products of the defendant are purely manufactured and sold on
prior quotations and verifications and then orders are placed. It was stated
that the products of petitioner do not bear any trademark identical or similar
to MEX or any other similar or identical mark of the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_13">13.    It has been submitted that the defendant is in the business of
switchgear items and the word 'swtichgears' is common to the entire
industry dealing in such items and that the word MAX has been adopted
from the common dictionary word MAXIMUM and there are number of
business houses in the electrical line in the country that use the trade name
"MAX" as a part of their business name. So the plaintiff could not be
permitted to claim exclusive rights over such common names which are
common in the industry. It is also stated that the defendant started the
business in the year 2000 through its predecessor and later in the year 2011
the defendant was renamed and that since 2007, the website of the
predecessor of the defendant is available. The plaintiff never raised an
objection on the trade name of the defendant and thus by conduct allowed
the defendant to continue with the name MAX.
</p><p id="p_14">14.    It has been averred that the defendant has a reputation of its own and
has nothing to do with the business reputation/goodwill of the plaintiff. The
details of the sales turnover of the defendant has been given in Para 23 of the
written statement filed by the defendant and the sales turnover for the period
2012-13 is stated to be ` 6,40,99,240/-. It has been stated that the defendant
has never adopted the trademark MAX for any of its goods and the product
of the defendant are known for their quality and identified by its unique
logo/device mark which has been invented by the defendant.
</p><p id="p_15">15.    The following defences are raised by the defendant:
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">I.A. No.10442/2013 in CS(OS) No.1299/2013                         Page 5 of 37</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">        i.     The trade mark MAX is adopted by the defendant from the
              common dictionary. It was bonafide adoption as the same was
              adopted from the word "MAXIMUM".
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">       ii.    The trade mark MAX is not similar with the trade mark of the
              plaintiff i.e. MEX.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">       iii.   The mark MAX is common to the trade in the industry of
              Switch Gears.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">       iv.    The defendant started the business in 2000 through its
              predecessor and later in the year 2011 the defendant was
              renamed and since 2007 the website of the predecessor is
              available bearing the name MAX.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">       v.     There is delay of acquiescence on the part of the plaintiff to file
              the action.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">       vi.    This Court has no territorial jurisdiction to entertain and try the
              suit.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">       vii.   The defendant is selling heavy electrical goods and is in the
              business of electrical and consulting engineers, electrical
              contractors, manufacturers and supplier of electrical items used
              in medium to high transmission lines etc. Thus, the question of
              confusion and deception does not arise.
</blockquote><p id="p_16">16.    However arguments were addressed by the learned counsel for the
defendant on points No. (i) to (iii) and (vii) only.
</p><p id="p_17">17.    Before dealing with the defences raised by the defendant, it appears
from the record that the plaintiff company through its predecessor has been
using the trade mark MEX since the year 1960 in respect of electrical
switchgears of various kinds, electrical meters, starting devices for electric
motors and various other electrical goods. The plaintiff is also using the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">I.A. No.10442/2013 in CS(OS) No.1299/2013                        Page 6 of 37</span>
 trade mark MEX in respect of CFL bulbs, fuses, distribution boxes, circuit
breakers wires and cables miniature circuit breaker etc.
</p><p id="p_18">18.       The plaintiff is a registered proprietor of trade mark MEX in various
trade marks, the details of which are mentioned in para 5 of the plaint in
classes 7, 9 and 11 in respect of the registered goods mentioned above as
well as other large number of specification of goods mentioned in the said
para. The plaintiff has also given the details of expenses on advertisement
and sale figures of the goods under the trade mark MEX in pars 12 and 13 of
the plaint from the year 1960 to 2011-2012.
</p><p id="p_19">19.       The trade mark of the plaintiff has been protected from time to by
various courts including the Bombay High Court as well as District Court,
Delhi. The details of the said protections are given in paras 15 and 16 of the
plaint.
</p><p id="p_20">20.       Before filing of the suit, the plaintiff also issued notices to the
defendant not to use the trade mark MAX as well as part of corporate name,
otherwise it would amount to infringement and passing off of the trade mark
of the plaintiff. The case of the plaintiff is that the present case is a triple
identity whereby two set of trade marks i.e. MEX and MAX are almost
identical. The goods are also same goods and trade channel is also the same.
</p><p id="p_21">21.       The goods of the plaintiff are admittedly sold in every nook and
corner of India. The said fact has not been denied by the defendant during
the course of hearing. The plaintiff states that the defendant's predecessor or
the defendant ought not to have used the trade mark MAX in relation to
same goods as well as part of their corporate name as on the date of adoption
they were fully aware about the goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_22">22.       It is also argued by the plaintiff that the defendant has never used the
trade mark MAX from the year 2000 as alleged by the defendant. They have


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">I.A. No.10442/2013 in CS(OS) No.1299/2013                         Page 7 of 37</span>
 been using the trade mark and corporate name Max Switchgears Pvt. Ltd. In
any case, since the plaintiff is holding the registration of the trade mark
MEX and corporate name Mex Switchgears Pvt. Ltd., the delay, if any, is
not fatal to the case of the infringement of trade mark. Therefore, the
plaintiff is pressing for injunction against the defendant.
</p><p id="p_23">23.    The rival submissions of the defendant have been dealt with by the
learned counsel for the plaintiff during the course of the arguments denying
all the statements made in the written statement. It is argued by the learned
counsel for the plaintiff that all the pleas raised by the defendant are false
and frivolous and the same are not sustainable in law. The present case is a
case of infringement also where the plaintiff has been able to establish a
strong prima facie case against the defendant for using the identical trade
mark and trade name in relation to the same goods and they are selling their
goods in the same market. Counsel further states that it is immaterial if the
goods of the defendant are heavy engineering products.
Infringement of Trade Mark
</p><p id="p_24">24.    It is the admitted position that the plaintiff is a registered proprietor of
the trade MEX in respect of large number of goods i.e. electric switchgears,
switches, ignition switches, electric capacitators, electric meters, starting
devices for electric motors etc. and various other electric goods. The trade
mark MEX is registered in various classifications of goods falling in classes
7, 9 and 11 including electric distribution boards, electric meters and electric
circuit breakers. The registration of the plaintiff is not denied by the
defendant. The defendant has not stated that the defendant has challenged
the validity of the trade mark of the plaintiff. It is also the admitted position
that the plaintiff and its predecessor have been using the trade mark MEX
since 1960. The mark MEX is also dominant part of their corporate name.

<p id="p_27">26.    By mere reading of these provisions, it is clear that a registered

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">I.A. No.10442/2013 in CS(OS) No.1299/2013                        Page 11 of 37</span>
 relation to the goods or services which are identical or similar to that in
respect of which the trademark is registered without the permission of the
trademark owner.
</p><p id="p_28">27.    So far as infringement qua different goods is concerned, separate
enactment of <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_3">Section 29(4)</a> makes it clear that the strict rigors are prescribed
as against the ordinary case of similar goods wherein a registered proprietor
has to establish that the registered trademark has reputation in India and is of
such a nature wherein the use of the mark by the other side without due
cause would tantamount to taking unfair advantage or detrimental to the
distinctive character or repute of a trademark.
</p><p id="p_29">28.    A reading of <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_4">Section 29(4)</a> of the Act would reveal that the said
protection qua different goods is earmarked by the Legislature for the
trademarks which are either highly reputed or well known or famous
trademarks and enjoy either high level of distinctiveness or the marks which
are inherently distinctive in nature or has become distinctive due to their
repute; the use of which will cause detrimental to the distinctive character
and repute of the trademark only when the ingredients of <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_5">Section 29(4)</a> are
satisfied conjunctively which is sub sections (a), (b) and (c) the infringement
qua <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_6">Section 29(4)</a> in relation to different goods is attracted. In the present
case, no doubt, in view of the goodwill, reputation, huge sale and
advertisement, prime facie, it establishes that the trade mark "MEX" has
acquired a unique name in the market and by virtue of that it is satisfied that
it comes within the meanings of <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_7">Section 29</a> (4) of the Act.

       injunction order restraining order the infringer should straightway
       follow. For the purpose of Section 29(5) of the TM Act 1999 there is
       no requirement to show that the mark has a distinctive character or
       that any confusion is likely to result from the use by the infringer of

<p id="p_33">31.     It is settled law that in order to prove the case for infringement of
trade mark, the plaintiff has to show that the essential features of the
registered trade mark which has been adopted by the defendant has been
taken out from the plaintiff's registration.       Only the marks are to be
compared by the Court and in case the registration is granted in favour of the
plaintiff, he acquires valuable right by reason of the said registration.
</p><p id="p_34">32.    The test of comparison of the marks side by side is not a sound one
since a purchaser will seldom have the two marks actually before him when
he makes his purchase. The eye is not an accurate recorder of visual detail
and that marks are remembered rather by general impression or by some
significant detail than by any photographic recollection of the whole. While
judging the question as to whether the defendant has infringed the trade
mark by colourable imitation of the mark or not, the Court has to consider
the overall impression of the mark in the minds of general public and not by
merely comparing the dissimilarities in the two marks.

146, the Supreme Court held that ocular comparison is not always the
decisive test. Resemblance between the two marks must be considered with
reference to the ear as well as to the eye. In this case, the Registrar held that

 the sound of "AMBAL" does not so nearly resemble the sound of
"ANDAL" in spite of certain letters being common to both the marks, as to
be likely to cause confusion or deception. The Registrar thus found that the
marks were not deceptively similar. But on appeal both the Single Judge
and Division Bench found deceptive similarity.           The Supreme Court,
dismissed the appeal, and held that there was a striking similarity and
affinity of sound between the word "Andal" and "Ambal" and held that there
was a real danger of confusion between the two marks.

               inconsistent really proceeds on an error in appreciating
               the basic differences between the causes of action and
               right to relief in suits for passing off and for infringement
               of a registered trade mark and in equating the essentials of
               a passing off action with those in respect of an action
               complaining of an infringement of a registered trade mark.
               We have already pointed out that the suit by the
               respondent complained both of an invasion of a statutory
               right under<a href="/doc/1056401/" id="a_21"> s. 21</a> in respect of a registered trade mark and
               also of a passing off by the use of the same make. The
               finding in favour of the appellant to which the learned
               Counsel drew our attention was based upon dissimilarity
               of the packing in which the goods of the two parties were
               vended, the difference in the physical appearance of the
               two packets by reason of the variation in their colour and
               other features and their general get-up together with the
               circumstance that the name and address of the
               manufactory of the appellant was prominently displayed
               on his packets and these features were all set out for
               negativing the respondent's claim that the appellant had
               passed off his goods as those of the respondent. These


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">I.A. No.10442/2013 in CS(OS) No.1299/2013                        Page 15 of 37</span>
               matters which are of the essence of the cause of action for
              relief on the ground of passing off play but a limited role in
              an action for infringement of a registered trade mark by
              the registered proprietor who has a statutory right to that
              mark and who has a statutory remedy in the event of the
              use by another of that mark or a colourable limitation
              thereof. While an action for passing off is a Common Law
              remedy being in substance an action for deceit, that is, a
              passing off by a person of his own goods as those of
              another, that is not the gist of an action for infringement.
              The action for infringement is a statutory remedy
              conferred on the registered proprietor of a registered trade
              mark for the vindication of the exclusive right to the use of
              the trade mark in relation to those goods (Vide<a href="/doc/1056401/" id="a_22"> s. 21</a> of the
              Act). The use by the defendant of the trade mark of the
              plaintiff is not essential in an action for passing off, but is
              the sine qua non in the case of an action for infringement.
              No doubt, where the evidence in respect of passing off
              consists merely of the colourable use of a registered trade
              mark, the essential features of both the actions might
              coincide in the sense that what would be a colourable
              limitation of a trade mark in a passing off action would
              also be such in an action for infringement of the same
              trade mark. But there the correspondence between the two
              ceases. In an action for infringement, the plaintiff must, no
              doubt, make out that use of the defendant's mark is likely to
              deceive, but were the similarity between the plaintiff's and
              the defendant's mark is so close either visually,
              phonetically or otherwise and the court reaches the
              conclusion that there is an limitation, no further evidence
              is required to establish that the plaintiff's rights are
              violated. Expressed in another way, if the essential
              features of the trade mark of the plaintiff have been
              adopted by the defendant, the fact that the get-up, packing
              and other writing or marks on the goods or on the packets
              in which he offers his goods for sale show marked
              differences, or indicate clearly a trade origin different
              from that of the registered proprietor of the make would be
              immaterial; whereas in the case of passing off, the
              defendant may escape liability if he can show that the

no uncertain terms that a person may sell his goods or deliver his services
under a trading name or style which, with the passage of time, may acquire a
reputation or goodwill and may become a property to be protected by the
Courts. It was held that a competitor initiating sale of goods or services in
the same name or by imitating that name causes injury to the business of one
who has the property in that name. It was held that honesty and fair play are
and ought to be the basic policy in the world of business and when a person
adopts or intends to adopt a name which already belongs to someone else, it
results in confusion, has the propensity of diverting the customers and
clients of someone else to himself and thereby resulting in injury. It was held

           whether the latter person does so fraudulently or otherwise.
           The reasons are two. Firstly, honesty and fair play are, and
           ought to be, the basic policies in the world of business.
           Secondly, when a person adopts or intends to adopt a name
           in connection with his business or services which already
           belongs to someone else it results in confusion and has
           propensity of diverting the customers and clients of
           someone else to himself and thereby resulting in injury."
      In this case, the Apex Court further observed that:

no requirement for a common field of activity to found a claim on passing
off action, because the real question in each of such cases is, whether there

 is, as a result of mis-representation, a real likelihood of confusion or
deception of the public and consequent damage to the plaintiff is likely to be
caused and if that is taken to be the test then the focus is shifted from the
external objective test of making comparison of activities of the parties, to
the state of mind of public, in deciding whether it will be confused.
Applying these principles the injunction in favour of the plaintiff was
granted.
</p><p id="p_41">38.    As already held that the defendant is guilty of infringement of trade
mark, it is also clear that the defendant is passing its goods as that of the
plaintiff who has been able to make out a strong prima facie case for passing
off against the defendant. The fact remains that the descriptions of goods of
both the parties are almost same. Therefore, even the defendants are using
the deceptively similar trade mark MAX. Being heavy engineering products
is also immaterial as there would be confusion and deception if the
defendant is allowed to use the trade mark in relation to electrical
contractors, circuit breaker (VCBs), load break switches, panels and unitised
sub-stations. The justification given by the defendant that it has bonafide
adopted the trade mark MAX from the common word MAXIMUM is also
without any substance because of the reason that the defendant has been
using the trade mark MAX in relation to similar goods and not the mark
MAXIMUM. The defendant is also using the trade mark MAX as dominant
part of its corporate name which amounts to infringement under <a href="/doc/1206371/" id="a_32">Section
29(5)</a> of the Act. Therefore, the adoption and use of the name MAX is not
bonafide. It is also pertinent to mention that on the date of adoption of the
trade mark MAX either by the defendant's predecessor or by the defendant
in the year 2011, they were fully aware about the trade mark and trading
style of the plaintiff as the said name was extensively advertised in the area

strong case for passing off.

incorporated in order to avoid the civil litigation before the Court and duty
was cast upon the Registrar of Companies to apply its mind at the time of

 is undisputed fact that when the defendant company was incorporated in the
year 2007, the plaintiff was registered proprietor of two trade marks. The
trade marks and trade names used by both the parties are almost identical,
thus, it is evident that the Registrar of Companies granted the registration
contrary to <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_46">Section 20</a> of the Indian Companies Act. The Registrar of
Company by complying the provisions of <a href="/doc/1820419/" id="a_47">Section 20(2)</a> (ii) obtained the
search report from the office was Trade Marks Registration, the registration
of the name of the company of defendant No.1 would not have been issued
under the mandatory provision and litigation could have been avoided
however, it did not happened despite of direction issued by the Apex
Court and in various other cases and mandatory provisions of various Acts.
Thus it appears to the Court that use of corporate name which formed part of
a similar registered trademark of the plaintiff amounts to infringement and
passing off of the registered trademark of the plaintiff.
Territorial Jurisdiction
</p><p id="p_47">42.    Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1985585/" id="a_48">Section 134</a> enacts that for the purposes of clauses

District Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction, the person or one
of the persons instituting the suit or proceeding actually and voluntarily
resides or carries on business or personally works for gain. The law in this
respect, which is similar to <a href="/doc/999236/" id="a_49">Section 62</a> of the Copyright Act, makes a
departure from the general law contained in the Code of Civil Procedure
1908 regarding jurisdiction. <a href="/doc/1919244/" id="a_50">See Gharkul Utadane v. Kharpe Gruh Udyog</a>,

<p id="p_49"> 43.    In terms of <a href="/doc/1985585/" id="a_52">Section 134</a>, it would appear that the plaintiff has an

infringement of a registered trade mark or relating to any right in a registered
trade mark, at the option of the plaintiff, the suit may be filed in any court
not inferior to the district court having jurisdiction, within the local limits of
whose jurisdiction, the plaintiff resides or carries on business. On the other
hand, in respect of matters specified in clause (c) of sub-section (1) namely a
passing of action based on a registered or unregistered trade mark, the suit
will have to be filed only in the appropriate district court having jurisdiction

limitation is attached to these words.

plaintiff's goods are available in every nook and corner of India including in
the State of Tamil Nadu from where the defendant is carrying on its
business. Thus, the plaintiff is entitled to invoke the territorial jurisdiction
of this Court under Sub-Section (2) of <a href="/doc/969470/" id="a_57">Section 134</a> of the Act. The plaintiff
has invoked the jurisdiction of this Court by alleging that the plaintiff has its
branch office in Delhi and its goods are also being sold in Delhi. The
plaintiff has also many dealers in Delhi. The defendant is selling its goods
in clandestine manner in Delhi. It is further stated that the name of the
defendant company is available on the internet site of Registry of companies
which accessible in Delhi. Though the issue of territorial jurisdiction is not
argued by the counsel for the defendant, however since it was one of the
pleas was taken in the written statement, thus the same is dealt with. In view
of the settled law, prima facie this Court finds that this Court has got the
territorial jurisdiction. However, issue of jurisdiction has to be decided after
framing of issues when the matter is taken for final disposal of the suit. The
said issue as raised by the defendant is thus kept open.

            as we have earlier stated, that there were various trademarks
            with a prefix or suffix 'Gluco'or 'Vita'and that made it
            impossible to say that the common features 'Glu' and 'Vita'
            were only associated with the appellant's products. This
            view was founded on a passage which the learned appellate
            Judges quoted from Kerly on Trade Marks, 7th Edn., p.624.
            That passage may be summarized thus: Where there are a

             relief to the plaintiff. It cannot also be said that the plaintiff's
             trademark has lost its distinctiveness for the said reason. The
             reply affidavit of the plaintiff lists the orders of the Trade
             Mark Registry from 1964 to 2000, where plaintiff's mark has
             been protected inter alia for reason of having great
             reputation. It also shows that the plaintiff has been enforcing
             its rights. Though the list filed by defendant No.1 in this
             regard is long but a perusal thereof shows a number of
             applicants to have abandoned or withdrawn their
             applications. This is a vast country. Mere long list of
             applicants/registrants of mark, without any extensive use of

<p id="p_58">51.    As the defendant has failed to produce any evidence of the actual use
of the mark MAX by third parties, the mark MAX is common to the trade in
an action for passing off is not available. Further the present suit is also for
infringement of trade mark which is filed on the basis of exclusive and
statutory rights granted in favour of the plaintiff under <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_65">Section 28</a> of the Act.
Thus, there is no force in the submission of the defendant that the mark
MAX is common to the trade and the defendant is entitled to use the same.

defendant started business in 2000 through its predecessor and later in the

 year 2011 the defendant was renamed as Max Switchgears Pvt. Ltd. It is also
alleged that since 2007 the website of the predecessor is available bearing
the name MAX. In support of his submissions, the defendant has filed
certain documents by list of dates dated 23 rd September, 2013.           First
document is certificate dated 21st May, 2013 issued by the Chartered
Accountant in which the statement of sales turnover and net profit is shown
from the year 2007-2008. The defendant has also filed few invoices from
the pear 2007 to 2013 with regard to the sale of Transformer Switch Board
and other related material.        No other document has been filed by the
defendant to show the user of the predecessor earlier to the year 2007. Even
the defendant has also not filed the advertisement figures or any newspaper
or cogent and clear evidence in order to show that the defendant and its
predecessor have been using the trade mark/trade name MAX since the year
2000 as alleged by the defendant in the written statement. Even if the face
value of the documents is taken as correct, the said documents about the use
of the mark MAX by the predecessor are from the year 2007 to 2010 and
about the use of mark MAX by the defendant are from the year 2011 to
2013.
</p><p id="p_60">53.     On the other hand, the plaintiff has filed large number of newspapers
and evidence in order to show that the plaintiff's mark MEX was being
advertised in the same are from where the defendant is carrying on its
business.     The said advertisements are advertised in the well-known
newspaper bearing the mark MEX and in its corporate name Mex

impression that on the date of adoption of the trade mark by the defendant's

 the user of trade mark MEX by the plaintiff. Even otherwise, the delay, if
any, as per settled law in a case of infringement is not fatal because of the
reason that in trade mark cases, the cause of action is a recurring cause of
action. Few decisions on this aspect of delay and acquiescence are referred
to as under:

                not sufficient to defeat grant of injunction in such cases. The

                seeking an injunction may be aground for refusing an
                injunction in certain circumstances. In the present case, we are
                dealing with a statutory right based on the provisions of the

                granted by the registration to the holder of a registered trade
                mark. We do not think statutory rights can be lost by delay.
                The effect of a registered mark is so clearly defined in the
                statute as to be not capable of being misunderstood. Even if
                there is some delay, the exclusive right cannot be lost. The

<blockquote id="blockquote_81">                "20.........It is now well settled that an action for passing off
                is a common law remedy being an action in substance of
                deceit under the Law of Torts. Wherever and whenever fresh
                deceitful act is committed the person deceived would naturally
                have a fresh cause of action in his favour. Thus every time
                when a person passes off his goods as those of another he
                commits the act of such deceit. Similarly whenever and

<p id="p_62"> 55.    In the absence of any cogent and clear evidence for the user claimed
by the defendant since 2000 by its predecessor, the benefit of the same
cannot be granted to the defendant. It appears from the record that the some
invoices and sale figures certified by the chartered accountant are available
from the year 2007 only. The said user even taken as correct from the 2007
is not fatal in an action for infringement in view of the above mentioned
settled law. It is also pertinent to mention that no evidence is placed on
record by the defendant to show that the plaintiff was aware about the
defendant's user from the year 2007.         Thus, the plea of delay and
acquiescence is also rejected.
</p><p id="p_63">56.    In an action for infringement, the plaintiff must no doubt make out
that the use of the defendant's mark is likely to deceive, but where the
similarity between the plaintiff's and the defendant's mark is so close either
visually, phonetically or otherwise that the court reaches the conclusion that
there is an imitation, no further evidence is required to establish that the
plaintiff's rights are violated. Expressed in another way, if the essential
features of the trade mark of the plaintiff have been adopted by the
defendant, the fact that the get up, packing and other writing or marks on the
goods or on the packets, in which he offers his goods for sale show marked
differences, or indicate clearly a trade origin, different from that on the
registered proprietor of the mark, would be immaterial.
</p><p id="p_64">57.    In view of the above said facts and circumstances of the matter, it
appears that the plaintiff has been able to make a strong prima facie case in
its favour and against the defendant being the registered proprietor of the
trade mark MEX in relation to same goods as well as allied and cognate
goods falling in class 7, 9 and 11. The balance of convenience also lies in
favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant. If the interim order is not

 passed, the plaintiff will suffer irreparable loss and injury. On the other
hand, the defendant will continue to use the said trade mark/trade name
MAX in relation to the same goods as well as a dominant part of its
corporate name. Therefore, prima facie a strong case for passing an ad-
interim order has been made out by the plaintiff. Accordingly, till the
disposal of the suit, the defendant, its servants, agents, dealers, distributors
and all others persons acting for and on its behalf from manufacturing,
selling, offering for sale and directly or indirectly dealing with electrical
goods i.e. switchgear, switches and other allied and cognate goods under the
trade mark MAX as well as from using the same as dominant part of its
corporate name. The defendant is also restrained from using any deceptively
similar trade mark which may amount to infringement of plaintiff's
registered trade mark No.211055 in class 9 as well as passing of its goods as
that of the plaintiff and from doing any other thing which is likely to create
confusion and deception.

dispose of the existing stock and to change the trade mark and trade name of
the defendant.
