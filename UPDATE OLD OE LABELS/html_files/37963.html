HEADNOTE:
Notification  under  Section  4(1)  of	the  Rajasthan	Land
Acquisition  Act 1953 was published in the Gazette  for	 the
acquisition  of	 certain  lands	 for  the  benefit  of	 the
Rajasthan  Housing Board.  Another notification	 was  issued
under<a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_3"> S. 17(4)</a> dispensing with the provisions of<a href="/doc/66420479/" id="a_4"> S. 5(A)</a>  of
the Act.  A declaration under S.6 of the Act was also issues
in  respect  of that area.  The validity  of  the  aforesaid
notifications was challenged before the High Court by way of
writ  petitions.   The	challenge made	was  mainly  on	 the
grounds that since the land acquired was not waste or arable
land inasmuch as there were houses, huts, cattle sheds	etc.
on  the land, the inquiry contemplated under<a href="/doc/66420479/" id="a_5"> S.	 5(A)</a>  could
not have been dispensed with; that there was no real urgency
for  dispensing	 with the Inquiry and that  the	 houses	 and
other structures on the land should not have been  acquired.
The  Writ  Petitions were dismissed by a  Single  Judge	 and
Special Appeals were preferred to Division Bench.  Since the
two Judges In the Division Bench deferred in their opinions,
the  matter  was referred to Third Judge.  The	Third  Judge
recorded his opinion on the questions, viz., whether it	 was
necessary or obligatory for the Government to mention in the
notification issued under<a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_6"> S. 17(4)</a> that the land proposed to
be acquired was waste or arable and whether the	 non-mention
thereof, vitiated the said notifica
270
tions; and if a small fraction of an arable land proposed to
be acquired was occupied by buildings like buts kham  houses
and  pucca houses for residential purposes and	for  keeping
fodder,	 cattle	 farms, cattle sheds and for  similar  other
purposes, was it still permissible to treat the entire	land
as  arable land and Issue notification under<a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_7"> s.	 17(4)</a>	read
with  Section  17(1) of the Rajasthan Land  Acquisition	 Act
1953,  and the legal consequences thereof.  Then the  matter
went  back  to the Division Bench which	 observed  that	 the
opinion	 of the Third Judge was not categorical on the	last
question.   Therefore, the last question was referred  to  a
Full  Bench.   By a majority view the Full Bench  held	that
inasmuch as there were pucca and kutcha houses, cattle-sheds
etc.  on  a fraction of a land proposed to be  acquired	 and
since	the  notification  was	not  severable	the   entire
notification  under<a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_8"> s. 17(4)</a> failed.  Accordingly, the	Full
Bench  quashed	the  declaration  under<a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_9"> s.  6</a>  of  the	Act.
Against	 this  the respondent Board  preferred	the  present
appeal.	  Contending that the matter stood concluded by	 the
decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/469498/" id="a_10">State of U.P. v. Smt.	 Pista Devi</a>,
[1986] 4 SCC 251.
The Writ Petition flied before this Court claimed that since
the  Petitioner	 Society  also	fulfilled  the	same  public
purpose served by the housing Board viz. housing, the  Urban
Development Minister had recommended that the land  allotted
to  the petitioner.  Society be denotified  and	 de-acquired
and  to regularise the scheme of the Society, and  that	 the
Chief  Minister	 has accepted the same.	  The  Society	thus
contended  that	 the proceedings were final  and  its  lands
could not be acquired.
Allowing the appeals by the Housing Board and dismissing the
Writ Petition flied by the Housing Society, this Court,
HELD  : 1. 'Mere was material before the government in	this
case  upon  which it could have and did form  the  requisite
opinion	 that  it was a case calling for exercise  of  power
under <a href="/doc/851925/" id="a_11">Section 17(4)</a> of the Rajasthan land Ceiling Act, 1953.
The  material  placed before the Court	disclosed  that	 the
government  found,  on due verification, that there  was  an
acute  scarcity	 of land and there was	heavy  pressure	 for
construction of houses for weaker sections and middle income
group people, that the Housing Board had obtained a loan  of
Rs.16 crores under a time-bound	 programme to construct	 and
utilise	  the  said  amount  by	 31.3.1983;  that   in	 the
circumstances  the  Government	was  satisfied	that  unless
possession  was	 taken immediately, and	 the  Housing  Board
permitted to proceed with
271
the  construction, the Board will not be able to  adhere  to
the  time-bound	 programme.There  were	also  certain  other
materials  upon	 which the government had  formed  the	said
satisfaction  viz, that In view of the time-bound  programme
stipulated  by	the  lendor, HUDCO, the	 Board	and  already
appointed a large number of engineers and other	 subordinate
staff  for  carrying out the said work and that	 holding  an
inquiry	 under <a href="/doc/273666/" id="a_12">Section 5-A</a> would have resulted	in  uncalled
for delay endangering the entire scheme and time-schedule of
the Housing Board.  The satisfaction under <a href="/doc/851925/" id="a_13">Section 17(4)</a>  of
the  Act  Is a subjective one and that so long as  there  is
material  upon	which the government could have	 formed	 the
said satisfaction fairly, the court would not interfere	 nor
would  it  examine the material as an  appellate  authority.
This is the principle affirmed by decision of this Court not
only under <a href="/doc/851925/" id="a_14">Section 17(4)</a> but also generally with respect  to
subjective satisfaction. [279E-H, 280A-<a href="/doc/469498/" id="a_15">B]

2.1. The petitioner-cooperative society which claims to have
purchased  about  525  bighas of  land	from  the  khatedars
represented   to  the  Government  to  de-notify  the	land
purchased by them.  On the basis of the said representation,
the  then  Minister in-charge of Urban	Development  took  a
decision  to release the lands but he was over-ruled by	 the
then Chief Minister.  This issue lay dormant till 1990	till
the  general elections were announced.	It is at this  stage
the petitioner-society made a representation to the Minister
for  Urban Development to de-notify the lands  purchased  by
them.	The Minister for Urban Development  recommended	 de-
notification  which  was  approved by  the  Chief  Minister.
[281A-D]
2.2. 'Mere  was no final decision at any time  to  de-notify
the said lands.	 A tentative decision was no doubt taken  in
February,  1990	 but  before it	 could	be  implemented	 the
government thought it necessary to ascertain the view of the
Housing Board and to find out as to what the Board had	done
upon the land, what structures it had raised and what amount
it  had spent so that the Board could be  compensated  while
delivering  the	 possession  back to  the  Housing  society.
Before	this  could  be	 done there  was  a  change  In	 the
Government and the said tentative decision
272
was  reversed.	 In  this  view of the	matter,	 it  is	 not
necessary  to  go  into the question  whether  there  was  a
communication  of  the 'decision' of the government  to	 the
petitioner.   The communication must be of a final  decision
and not of a provisional or tentative decision. [285A-C]
2.3. In	 any event the government could not  have  withdrawn
from the acquisition under <a href="/doc/273666/" id="a_18">Section 48</a> of the Act inasmuch as
the  Government had taken possession of the land.  Once	 the
possession  of	the  land is taken it is  not  open  to	 the
government  to	withdraw from the  acquisition.	  Admittedly
possession was taken over by the Housing Board. (285D]
2.4. The notification under S.4 need not necessarily  recite
that  the land proposed to be acquired is waste	 or  arable.
The non-recital does not vitiate the notification. [279C]
2.5. Where a large extent of land is acquired, the existence
of a few superstructures here and there does not prevent the
Govt. from exercising the power under S.17(4). [277B]

<p id="p_5">The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
B.P.  JEEVAN REDDY, J. These appeals are  preferred  against
the  judgment of the Full Bench of the Rajasthan High  Court
allowing a batch of 16 special appeals.	 The special appeals
were  preferred	 against the judgment of  a  learned  Single
Judge  dismissing a batch of 24 writ petitions.	 The  result
of the judgment of the Full Bench is that the  notification
issued by the Government of Rajasthan under Section 4(1)  of
the  Rajasthan	Land  Acquisition  Act,	 1953  proposing  to
acquire a large extent of land stands quashed.
The  notification under Section 4(1) of the  Rajasthan	Act,
published in the Rajasthan Gazette dated 13.1.1982, proposed
to  acquire a total extent of 2,.517  bighas  (approximately
equal  to  1,580 crores) for the benefit  of  the  Rajasthan
Housing Board.	On 9.2.1982, another notification was issued
under  <a href="/doc/851925/" id="a_19">Section	17(4)</a> of the said Act  dispensing  with	 the
provisions of <a href="/doc/1516779/" id="a_20">Section 5(A)</a>.  On the same day, a	 declaration
under <a href="/doc/1316024/" id="a_21">Section 6</a> was also issued in respect of the said area.
According to the Government, the possession of the land	 was
also  taken on 22nd and 24th of May, 1982.  The validity  of
the  said notifications was questioned in the batch of	writ
petitions  (being S.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 707  of	1982
etc.) on three grounds viz., (i) that the land acquired	 was
not a waste or arable land inasmuch as there were pucca	 and
kutchha	 houses,  huts and cattle sheds etc.   On  the	said
land.	If so, the power under sub-section (1) and  sub-sec-
tion  (4)  of  <a href="/doc/851925/" id="a_22">Section 17</a> could not  have  been	 invoked  to
dispense  with	the enquiry under <a href="/doc/1516779/" id="a_23">Section  5(A)</a>;  (ii)	that
there  was  no	real urgency warranting	 the  invocation  of
urgency clause.	 An inquiry under <a href="/doc/1516779/" id="a_24">Section 5(A)</a> ought to have
been  held,  which is a valuable right given  to  the  land-
owners whose land is acquired under the Act; and (iii)	that
at  any	 rate the houses and other structures  on  the	land
acquired should not have been acquired.
</p><p id="p_6">The  learned  Judge rejected all the three  contentions	 and
dismissed   the	 writ  petitions.   Special   appeals	were
preferred  against the same which were heard by	 a  Division
Bench  in the first instance.  The two learned Judges,	N.M.
Kasliwal  and K.S. Siddhu, JJ. differed in  their  opinions.
Accordingly, the matter was referred to a third Judge by  an
order dated 12.12.1983. Three questions were framed for	 the
consideration  of  third  Judge viz.,  (1)  whether  it	 was
necessary for the Government to mention in the	notification
that the land is waste or arable and whether the non-men-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">274</span>
<p id="p_7">tion of the said fact vitiates the notification; (2) whether
it  was	 obligatory upon the Government to  mention  in	 the
notification  issued  under  <a href="/doc/851925/" id="a_25">Section  17(4)</a>  that  the	land
proposed  to be acquired is waste or arable and whether	 the
non-mention thereof vitiates the said notification; and	 (3)
"if  a	small  fraction of an arable  land  proposed  to  be
acquired is occupied by buildings like huts, kham houses and
pucca  houses  for  residential	 purposes  and	for  keeping
fodder,	 cattle	 farms, cattle sheds and for  similar  other
purposes,  is it still permissible to treat the entire	land
as  arable land and issue notification under  <a href="/doc/851925/" id="a_26">Section  17(4)</a>
read  with Section 17(1) of the Rajasthan  Land	 Acquisition
Act,  1953?  If not, what are the legal	 consequences  which
such  buildings aforementioned entail in the context of	 the
said notification?'
The  third Judge recorded his opinion on the said  questions
but when the matter went back to the Division Bench, it	 was
of  the opinion that while the opinion of the learned  third
Judge  on questions 1 and 2 was categorical,  affirming	 the
view  of the learned Single Judge, his opinion	on  question
No.3  was not clear or categorical.  Accordingly,  the	said
question No.3 was referred to a Full Bench.  The Full  Bench
comprising N.M. Kasliwal, M.B. Sharma and Farooq Hasan,	 JJ.
heard the parties and held by a majority (Sharma and  Farooq
Hasan,	JJ.) that inasmuch as there were pucca	and  kutchha
houses,	 cattle sheds etc. on a fraction of a land  proposed
to  be	acquired and also because the  notification  is	 not
severable,  the entire notification under <a href="/doc/851925/" id="a_27">Section  17(4)</a>  is
liable to fail.	 Accordingly, the declaration under  <a href="/doc/1316024/" id="a_28">Section
6</a>  was	also quashed.  The minority view  was  expressed  by
Kasliwal  J. He was of the opinion that merely because on  a
small portion of the land proposed to be acquired there were
pucca  and  kutchha houses, the invocation  of	power  under
<a href="/doc/851925/" id="a_29">Section	 17(4)</a>	read with <a href="/doc/1681645/" id="a_30">Section 17(1)</a> of the Act  was	 not
bad.   The opinion of the majority Judges is  questioned  in
these appeals before us.
</p><p id="p_8">Sri  Soli Sorabji, learned counsel for the appellant  (State
of Rajasthan) submitted that the question considered by	 the
Fun Bench of the High Court is since concluded by a decision
of this court in <a href="/doc/469498/" id="a_31">State of U.P. v. Smt. Pista Devi</a>, [1986]  4
S.C.C.	251  and,  therefore, the appeals  must	 be  allowed
straightaway.  On the other hand, S/Sri D.D. Thakur and S.K.
Jain,  learned counsel for the	respondent-writ	 petitioners
submitted on the basis of the decision in <a href="/doc/1325151/" id="a_32">Sarju Prasad	Saha
v.  The State of Uttar Pardesh</a>, A.I.R. 1965 S.C.  1763	that
once it is found that a portion of a land proposed to be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">275</span>
acquired  is  not waste or arable, the	entire	notification
should	fail inasmuch as the notification is not  severable.
They  also  submitted that the decision in <a href="/doc/1330923/" id="a_33">Dom	Phalauli  v.
State of Punjab and Ors</a>., [1979] 4 S.C.C. 485 supports their
contention  that the notification under <a href="/doc/851925/" id="a_34">Section	 17(4)</a>	read
with  <a href="/doc/1681645/" id="a_35">Section 17(1)</a> should itself expressly recite that	 the
land in respect of which the said power is being invoked  is
a waste or arable land and that non-recital of the said fact
vitiates the notification.  The learned counsel also  sought
to  argue  that	 there was no such urgency as  to  call	 for
dispensing  with  the  inquiry	under  <a href="/doc/1516779/" id="a_36">Section	5(A)</a>.	They
submitted  that when a large chunk of land  comprising	four
villages was being acquired it was but fair and just that an
inquiry	 under	<a href="/doc/1516779/" id="a_37">Section 5(A)</a> was held  The  construction  of
houses by Housing Board, it was submitted, was not so urgent
as  to	brook  no delay and, therefore,	 the  invocation  of
urgency was not called for.
</p><p id="p_9">So far as the main question which was considered by the	 Fun
Bench  is concerned,it is necessary to refer to the  factual
finding	  in   the  first  instance.   Although	  the	writ
petitioners  contended	that there were pucca  houses,	kham
houses	and  huts  used for residential	 purposes  and	also
cattle	sheds, cattle-ponds and other structures,  no  clear
material was placed before the court.  With the result	that
the Full Bench proceeded on the basis that these  structures
were  stituated only upon a fraction of a land sought to  be
acquired.   We may quote the following observation from	 the
judgment of Sharma, J. (majority opinion):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	      "From  the  pleadings of the parties,  it	 can
	      also no longer be disputed that in the case of
	      some  of	the appellants on fraction  of	this
	      land kuchcha houses, kham houses and even some
	      pucca  constructions  are situated  which	 are
	      being  used  by the appellants  for  tethering
	      their cattle, storage of fodder and grain	 and
	      also  for residential purposes.  It cannot  be
	      said  as to out of the large area	 of  2570.15
	      bighas on what portion such constructions have
	      been  made, but in case of the  appellants  in
	      each case they could be only on a fraction  of
	      the entire land sought to be acquired.</blockquote>
<p id="p_10">			     (emphasis added)
The  question is, whether in such a situation  the  majority
Judges	of  the Full Bench were right in  holding  that	 the
notification under <a href="/doc/851925/" id="a_38">Section 17(4)</a> should fail.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">276</span>
<p id="p_11"><a href="/doc/469498/" id="a_39">In  State  of U.P. v. Smt.  Pista Devi</a>, a  bench  comprising
E.S.  Venkataramiah and Khalid, JJ. considered an  identical
question.   That case arose from Uttar Pradesh where by	 way
of  a  State amendment sub-<a href="/doc/1418392/" id="a_40">section 1(A)</a>	 was  introduced  in
<a href="/doc/851925/" id="a_41">Section	 17</a>.   Paragraph 7 of the judgment  brings  out	 the
ratio  of  the	judgment  besides  quoting  the	 said  State
Amendment.  It reads:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	      "It  was	next  contended that  in  the  large
	      extent  of land Acquired which has  about	 412
	      acres there were some buildings here and there
	      and  so the acquisition of those parts of	 the
	      land  on	which buildings	 were  situated	 was
	      unjustified  since  those	 portions  were	 not
	      either  waste or arable lands which  could  be
	      dealt  with  under <a href="/doc/1681645/" id="a_42">Section 17(1)</a> of  the	Act.
	      This contention has not been considered by the
	      High  Court.   We do not,	 however,  find	 any
	      substance	 in  it.   The	government  was	 not
	      acquiring any property which was substantially
	      covered  by buildings.  It acquired about	 412
	      acres of land in the outskirts of Meerut	city
	      which  was  described as arable  land  by	 the
	      Collector.  It may be true that here and there
	      were  a  few super-structures.  In a  case  of
	      this  nature where a large extent of  land  is
	      being acquired for planned development of	 the
	      urban area it would not be proper to leave the
	      small   portions	 over  which   some   super-
	      structures  have been constructed out  of	 the
	      development scheme.  In such a situation where
	      there is real urgency it would be difficult to
	      apply  <a href="/doc/273666/" id="a_43">Section 5-A</a> of the Act in the  case  of
	      few bits of land on which some structures	 are
	      standing	and  to	 exempt	 the  rest  of	 the
	      property	from its application.	Whether	 the
	      land  in question is waste or arable land	 has
	      to be judged by looking at the general  nature
	      and   condition  of  the	land.	It  is	 not
	      necessary in this case to consider any further
	      legality	or the propriety of the	 application
	      of  <a href="/doc/1681645/" id="a_44">Section 17(1)</a> of the Act to such  portions
	      of  land	proposed to be	acquired,  on  which
	      super-structures were standing because of	 the
	      special  provision which is inserted  as	sub-
	      section (1-A) of <a href="/doc/851925/" id="a_45">Section 17</a> of the Act by	 the
	      Land  Acquisition (U.P. Amendment Act) (22  of
	      1954) which reads thus:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	      (1-A) The power to take possession under	sub-
	      section (1) may also be exercised in the	case
	      of land other than waste or arable land, where
	      the land is acquired for or in connection with
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">	      277</span>
	      sanitary	improvements of any kind or  planned
	      development."
</blockquote><p id="p_12">We  are of the opinion that the principle enunciated in	 the
said  paragraph	 is  the  correct  one	and  that  the	said
principle  is  not really based upon  sub-section  (1-A)  of
<a href="/doc/851925/" id="a_46">Section	 17</a>  introduced	 by U.P.  State	 Amendment.   Having
expressed a definite opinion that existence of a few  super-
structures  here and there, where a large extent of land  is
being  acquired,  does	not  prevent  the  government	from
exercising the power under <a href="/doc/851925/" id="a_47">Section 17(4)</a>, the learned  Judge
evolved the following test: "whether the land in question is
waste  or arable has to be judged by looking at the  general
nature	and  condition	of the land.' Having  so  held,	 the
learned	 Judges referred to the U.P. State Amendment by	 way
of  an additional supporting ground.  We are of the  opinion
that even apart from the said State amendment, the principle
enunciated  in the said decision is the correct one  and  is
fully applicable here.	Mr. Sorabji is, therefore, right  in
contending  that the said decision concludes the said  issue
in these appeals.
</p><p id="p_13">The learned counsel for the respondents, however,  submitted
on  the	 basis of the decision in <a href="/doc/1325151/" id="a_48">Sarju Prasad Saha  v.	 The
State  of U.P. &amp; Ors</a>., A.I.R. 1965 S.C. 1763 that in such  a
situation  the notification being not severable, the  entire
notification  should  fail.  We cannot agree.	That  was  a
converse  case	in the sense that a major part of  the	land
proposed  to  be  acquired  was	 covered  by  buildings	 and
constructions whereas only smaller part was waste or arable.
It  is	in  such  a case that  the  court  opined  that	 the
notification  cannot  be  held	to  be	partially  good	 and
partially  bad.	 Accordingly, it was held,  dispensing	with
enquiry under <a href="/doc/1516779/" id="a_49">Section 5(A)</a> by invoking the urgency clause in
<a href="/doc/851925/" id="a_50">Section	 17(4)</a>	was bad.  Paragraph (9) relied upon  by	 the
learned counsel may now be set out.  It reads:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">	      "One  other  point raised at the	Bar  may  be
	      briefly referred to.  It was contended by	 Mr.
	      S.P.   Sinha  appearing  on  behalf   of	 the
	      Municipal	 Board,	 Basti, that a part  of	 the
	      land  notified  for acquisition was  waste  or
	      arable  and  in  support	of  his	 contention,
	      counsel referred us to certain revenue record.
	      But  if  only a part of the land is  waste  or
	      arable  and  the rest is not,  a	notification
	      under<a href="/doc/851925/" id="a_51"> S. 17(4)</a> dispensing with compliance with
	      the  requirements of<a href="/doc/273666/" id="a_52"> S. 5-A</a> would be  invalid.
	      It  would not be open to the Court  to  regard
	      the   notification  as  partially	  good	 and
	      partially	 bad, for if the State had no  power
	      to dispense with the inquiry in respect of any
	      part of the land notified under
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">	      278</span>
	      S.4(1),  an inquiry must be held	under  S.5-A
	      giving an opportunity to persons interested in
	      the land notified to raise their objections to
	      the  proposed acquisition and in that  inquiry
	      the persons interested cannot be restricted to
	      raising  objections in respect of	 land  other
	      than waste or arable land."
</blockquote><p id="p_14">We  don not think that in a case where only a fraction of  a
large  extent of land sought to be acquired is not waste  or
arable,	 the  observations  made in the	 said  judgment	 are
applicable.
</p><p id="p_15">The  counsel  for  the respondents  then  relied  upon	<a href="/doc/1330923/" id="a_53">Dora
Phalauli  v. State of Punjab &amp; Ors</a>., [1979] 4 S.C.C. 485  in
support	 of  their contention that  the	 notification  under
<a href="/doc/851925/" id="a_54">Section	 17(4)</a>	should	necessarily  recite  that  the	land
concerned  is waste or arable land and that absence of	such
recital renders the. notification invalid.  The observations
relied	upon in the judgment of N.L. Untwalia and A.P.	Sen,
JJ. read thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">	      "It  is  to be clearly understood	 that  under
	      sub-section  (4), the  appropriate  Government
	      may direct that the provisions of <a href="/doc/273666/" id="a_55">Section	 5-A</a>
	      shall  not apply where in the opinion  of	 the
	      State  Government,  the  provisions  of	sub-
	      section (1) or sub-section (2) are applicable,
	      otherwise	 not.  For making the provisions  of
	      sub-section (1) applicable, two things must be
	      satisfied, firstly that the land in respect of
	      which  the urgency provision is being  applied
	      is waste or arable and secondly, that there is
	      an urgency to proceed in the matter of  taking
	      immediate	 possession and so the right of	 the
	      owner  of	 the land for  filing  an  objection
	      under <a href="/doc/273666/" id="a_56">Section 5-A</a> should not be made available
	      to  him.	In the portion of  the	notification
	      which  we have extracted above, it is  neither
	      mentioned that the land is waste or arable nor
	      has it been stated that in the opinion of	 the
	      Government,  there  was any  urgency  to	take
	      recourse	to the provisions of <a href="/doc/851925/" id="a_57">Section  17</a>  of

	      the ground of urgency but this is not a  legal
	      and complete fulfillment of the requirement of
	      the  law.	  It is to be  remembered  that	 the
	      right  of a person having any interest in	 the
	      property to file an objection under <a href="/doc/1735362/" id="a_59">Section 5-</a>
	      A of the Act should not be interfered with  in
	      such  a casual or cavalier manner as has	been
	      done in this case."
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">279</span>
<p id="p_16">  The learned Judges observed that the notification  neither
mentions  that	the  land is waste or  arable  nor  does  it
mention	 that  in the opinion of the  government  there	 was
urgency	 to  take recourse to the provision of	<a href="/doc/851925/" id="a_60">Section	 17</a>.
The  decision is not really based upon the ground  that	 the
notification  fails  to	 recite that the land  is  waste  or
arable.	  The  paragraph  read as a  whole  shows  that	 the
learned	 Judges	 were impressed more by the  fact  that	 the
notification  does not state that the government is  of	 the
opinion	 that it was a case where the inquiry under  <a href="/doc/273666/" id="a_61">Section
5-A</a>  ought to be dispensed with under <a href="/doc/851925/" id="a_62">Section 17(4)</a>.  It  is
in  that  context  that	 they  also  pointed  out  that	 the
notification  does  not	 recite that the land  is  waste  or
arable.	  <a href="/doc/851925/" id="a_63">Section 17(4)</a> does not require  that	notification
itself	should	recite the fact that the land  concerned  is
waste or arable.  In such a situation there is no basis	 for
the  respondent's  contention that the	notification  should
itself	recite	the  said fact nor does	 the  said  decision
support their contention.
</p><p id="p_17">   Sri Thakur further argued that the construction of houses
by  Housing Board is not of such urgency as to call for	 the
invocation  of	the  said  power.   We	are  not  satisfied.
Firstly, on this question the decision of the Rajasthan High
Court  is against the writ petitioners.	 The learned  Single
Judge  negatived it as well as Division Bench following	 the
opinion of the third Judge.  Secondly, we are satisfied that
there  was material before the government in this case	upon
which it could have and did form the requisite opinion	that
it  was a case calling for exercise of power  under  <a href="/doc/851925/" id="a_64">Section
17(4)</a>.	 The  learned  Single  Judge  has  referred  to	 the
material  upon	which  the government had  formed  the	said
opinion.   The	material placed before the  Court  disclosed
that  the government found, on due verification, that  there
was  an acute scarcity of land and there was heavy  pressure
for  construction of houses for weaker sections	 and  middle
income	group people; that the Housing Board had obtained  a
loan  of  Rs.  16 crores under	a  time-bound  programme  to
construct and utilise the said amount by 31.3.1983; that  in
the  circumstances the Government was satisfied that  unless
possession  was	 taken immediately, and	 the  Housing  Board
permitted  to proceed with the construction, the Board	will
not  be	 able  to adhere to the	 time-bound  programme.	  In
addition  to the said fact, the Division Bench	referred  to
certain	 other material also upon which the  government	 had
formed the said satisfaction viz., that in view of the time-
bound  programme stipulated by the lender, HUDCO, the  Board
had already appointed a large number of engineers and  other
subordinate  staff for carrying out the said work  and	that
holding an inquiry under <a href="/doc/273666/" id="a_65">Section 5-A</a> would have resulted  in
uncalled
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">280</span>
for delay endangering the entire scheme and time-schedule of
the   Housing  Board.	It  must  be  remembered  that	 the
satisfaction  under  <a href="/doc/851925/" id="a_66">Section 17(4)</a> is a subjective  one	 and
that so long as there is material upon which the  government
could  have formed the said satisfaction fairly,  the  court
would not interfere nor would it examine the material as  an
appellate  authority.	This is the  principle	affirmed  by
decisions  of  this court not only under <a href="/doc/851925/" id="a_67">Section  17(4)</a>	 but
also generally with respect to subjective satisfaction.
  For  the  above reasons, the appeals are allowed  and	 the
judgment  of  the  Full Bench of the  Rajasthan	 High  Court
impugned  herein as set aside.	Having regard to  the  facts
and circumstances of the case, we direct the parties to bear
their own costs.
</p><p id="p_18">    WITH PETITION (C) NO. 290 OF 1989
   This	 writ  petition is preferred by the  New  Pink	Grih
Nirman Sahkari Sangh questioning the very same	notification
which  were  questioned	 in  the  writ	petitions  filed  in
Rajasthan  High	 Court	and which have	given  rise  to	 the
aforementioned	Civil Appeals.	It was admitted	 because  of
the  pendency  of the above appeals and was directed  to  be
heard alongwith them.  In the writ petition, several reliefs
are  asked  for	 viz., quashing of  the	 notification  under
<a href="/doc/1381865/" id="a_68">Section	 4(1)</a>,	quashing of the notification  under  <a href="/doc/1681645/" id="a_69">Section
17(1)</a>,	quashing of the notification under <a href="/doc/851925/" id="a_70">section 17(4)</a>  as
well  as the declaration under <a href="/doc/1316024/" id="a_71">Section 6</a>. It is prayed	that
the  acquisition proceedings must be declared to  have	been
withdrawn  by  virtue of the order of  the  Hon'ble  Housing
Minister of Rajasthan dated 20th July, 1984.
   Before us, however, Sri D.D. Thakur, learned counsel	 for
the  petitioner	 urged	only one contention  viz.,  that  by
virtue	of the decision of the Minister in-charge  of  Urban
Development, Government of Rajasthan and the Chief  Minister
dated 8.2.1990 the Rajasthan Government must be held to have
withdrawn  from the said acquisition proceedings within	 the
meaning	 of <a href="/doc/460525/" id="a_72">Section 48</a> of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894  in
so far as the lands purchased by the petitioner-society	 are
concerned.  For a proper appreciation of this contention, it
is necessary to notice the relevant facts and  circumstances
in their sequence.
</p><p id="p_19">   The	notification  under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_73">section 4(1)</a> was  published on
12.1.1982. On 9.2.1982, the notification under <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_74">section 17(4)</a>
and the declaration under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_75">section 6</a> were issued.   According
to the government, possession was also
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">281</span>
taken of the entire extent of land on 22nd and 24th of	May,
1982.
</p><p id="p_20">The  petitioner-cooperative  society which  claims  to	have
purchased  about  525  bighas of  land	from  the  khatedars
represented   to  the  Government  to  de-notify  the	land
purchased by them.  On the basis of the said representation,
the  then  Minister in-charge of Urban	Development  took  a
decision on 20.7.1984 to release the lands but he was  over-
ruled  by  the	then Chief Minister  Sri  Harideo  Joshi  on
29.4.1985. The decision of the Chief Minister has also	been
placed	before	us.  This issue lay dormant till  1990.	  On
27.1.1990, general elections were announced.  Polling was to
take  place on 27.2.1990. It is at this stage that a  sudden
urgency appears to have developed in this matter again.	 The
petitioner-society made a representation on 6.2.1990 to	 the
Minister  for  Urban  Development  to  de-notify  the  lands
purchased  by  them.   The Minister  for  Urban	 Development
recommended de-notification which was approved by the  Chief
Minister Sri Harideo Joshi on 8.2.1990. It was signed by the
Minister concerned on 13.2.1990.
</p><p id="p_21">The recommendation put up by the Urban Development  Minister
for  the  consideration	 of the Chief  Minister	 stated	 the
following  facts:  The petitioner-society had  entered	into
agreements  of sale in 1974-75 and 1975-76 for purchasing  a
substantial  extent of land for developing the Indira  Bihar
Residential Scheme and had also allotted plots to its  three
thousand members during the years 1976 to 1981.	 The society
had  deposited Rs. 50,000 as sub-division charges  according
to  rules in the year 1981 with the Urban Improvement  Trust
and had initiated proceedings for technical approval of	 the
scheme	in the same year.  The society had also deposited  a
sum  of	 Rs. 9 lakhs towards conversion of  the	 land  (from
agricultural to urban land) in the office of the  Additional
Collector,  Land  Conversion in March, 1982 under  the	Land
Conversion  Rules,  1981.  The Housing	Board  had  actually
started the proceedings for acquisition and the	 acquisition
notifications  were issued in January, 1982 i.e., after	 the
society	 had taken the above steps.  The  petitioner-society
had  obtained a stay order against the acquisition  proceed-
ings  and that as in 1990, the stay granted by	the  Supreme
Court was in force.  On 18.1.1990, the State Government	 had
taken  a  policy decision to regularise and  de-acquire	 the
lands  under acquisition covered by schemes of	the  Housing
Cooperative Societies on payment of prescribed amount.	 The
said  policy may be applied to the  petitioner-society.	  As
far as the question of exemption
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">282</span>
from  urban land ceiling is concerned, all the plot  holders
of this society, like other societies, will hand over  their
plots to the Jaipur Land Authority and it shall be deemed to
be  the government land but will be re-allotted to the	same
plot holders after charging the fixed price and	 development
charges	 on  prescribed	 terms.	  This	procedure  is  being
followed by Jaipur Development Authority in other matters as
well.  In this way, the problem of exemption from the  urban
land ceiling would also be solved.  The final recommendation
was: 'looking  to  the aforesaid facts it  is  desirable  to
direct to de-acquire that land	   of  the scheme under	 the
provisions of <a href="/doc/460525/" id="a_76">section 48</a> of the Land Acquisition Act,  1894
and regularise the scheme because this society is fulfilling
the  same public purpose of housing by starting	 proceedings
for which the Housing Board wants to acquire this land later
on for this purpose."
</p><p id="p_22">The above recommendation was accepted by the Chief  Minister
on  8.2.1990  as stated hereinbefore.  It appears  that	 the
matter	again  came  before the Hon'ble	 Chief	Minister  on
23.2.1990 when he approved a note, the latter half of  which
reads as follows: "Therefore, it will be in the interest  of
broad  public  interest	 that this land of  the	 society  be
regularised  according	to  the decision  of  Cabinet  after
releasing  it  from  acquisition,  as  is  the	opinion	  of
Honourable  Minister Incharge Local Self Govt,	and  Housing
Minister.  As far as the question of Scheduled	Caste/Tribes
land  is  concerned,  in this  respect	the  Government	 has
already taken a decision much before, according to which the
proceedings are to be taken." Evidently, in pursuance of the
aforesaid decision, the Deputy Secretary, Urban	 Development
and Housing Department, Government of Rajasthan, Jaipur	 ad-
dressed	 the  following letter to the  secretary,  Rajasthan
Housing Board, Jaipur:

<p id="p_26">      Sir,
	      In  respect of the above subject it  has	been
	      directed by the State Govt. that a decision to

	      acquisition  has	been  taken.   It  has	been

<p id="p_31">The learned counsel for the writ petitioners stops here	 and
says  that the above proceedings constitute a  definite	 and
final  decision	 to de-notify and de-acquire the  lands	 and
that  nothing  more was required to be	done  to  constitute
withdrawal  from acquisition within the meaning	 of  section
</p><p id="p_32">48.
Sri  F.S.  Nariman, the learned counsel	 appearing  for	 the
government  of	Rajasthan,  however,  filed  an	  additional
affidavit  setting  out the developments subsequent  to	 the
aforesaid  letter dated 24.2.1990 which may now be  noticed.
The  additional	 affidavit  is sworn to	 by  the  Secretary,
Rajasthan  Housing Board, Sri M.K.Khanna. It is stated	that
in  response  to the aforesaid letter dated  24.2.1990,	 the
Rajasthan  Housing Board represented to the Government	that
the land should not be de-notified whereupon the  Secretary,
urban  Development and Housing ordered the stopping  of	 the
issuance  of notification for de-acquisition of the land  of
the  petitioner	 society  on 25.5.1990.	 (Meanwhile,  a	 new
Government  represented by a different political  party	 had
come  into  power).   The  order  of  the  secretary   dated
25.5.1990 is filed as Ann.  X-1 to the additional affidavit.
It is further submitted that at no time any notification was
issued	withdrawing  from the acquisition.   It	 is  further
stated	that on 13.12.1990 the then Chief Minister  referred
the   entire   matter  pertaining   to	 de-acquisition	  of
petitioner's  land to the Beri Commission for  report.	 The
said  commission was constituted to look  into	illegalities
and  irregularities  committed	by  the	 functionaries	 and
officials  of the previous government.	The Beri  Commission
reported  that the decision to de-acquire the lands  of	 the
petitioner-society  was	 in  contravention  of	the  earlier
decision of the Cabinet, contrary to law and against  public
interest.  The commission stated that the said decision	 was
the  result  of	 the influence brought	upon  the  concerned
Minister  by  the  petitioner- society and  is	not  a	fair
decision.  The Chief Minister also acted under the influence
and  pressure of the petitioner-society and, therefore,	 his
decision  too  is  not a proper	 one.	Accepting  the	said
report, the government intimated the Rajasthan Housing Board
that  there  is no question of de-acquiring the	 said  land.
The  letter dated 24.4.1990 was also formally  withdrawn  on
31.10.1991.  It	 is  also  stated  in  the  said  additional
affidavit  that the Khatedars from whom the society  claimed
to  have purchased the said land under agreements  of  sale,
have by separate letters intimated the Secretary,  Rajasthan
Housing Board and the Land Acquisition Collector as far back
as  5th	 April,	 1982  that they had  no  objection  to	 the
acquisition  of their lands.  They asked for compensation  @
Rs. 40,000/ per bigha.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">285</span>
<p id="p_33">From the above material it is clear that there was no  final
decision  at  any  time	 to de-notify  the  said  lands.   A
tentative decision was no doubt taken in February, 1990	 but
before	it  could be implemented the government	 thought  it
necessary to ascertain the views of the Housing Board and to
find  out as to what the Board had done upon the land,	what
structures  it	had raised and what amount it had  spent  so
that  the  Board could be compensated while  delivering	 the
possession  back to the Housing society.  Before this  could
be  done there was a change in the government and  the	said
tentative  decision  was  reversed.  In	 this  view  of	 the
matter,	 it is not necessary for us to go into the  question
whether	 there was a communication of the 'decision' of	 the
government to the petitioner.  The communication must be  of
a  final  decision  and not of a  provisional  or  tentative
decision.
</p><p id="p_34">We  are	 of  the  further opinion  that	 in  any  event	 the
government  could  not have withdrawn from  the	 acquisition
under  <a href="/doc/460525/" id="a_77">section 48</a> of the Act inasmuch as the Government	 had
taken  possession of the land.	Once the possession  of	 the
land  is taken it is not open to the government to  withdraw
from  the  acquisition.	  The very  letter  dated  24.2.1990
relied	upon by the counsel for the petitioner recites	that
'before	 restoring the possession to the society the  amount
of   development   charges   will  have	  to   be   returned
back.............  This	 shows clearly that  possession	 was
taken  over by the Housing Board.  Indeed the very tenor  of
the  letter  is,  asking  the  Housing	Board  as  to	what
development  work they had carried out on the land  and	 how
much expenditure they had incurred thereon, which could	 not
have  been  done unless the Board was in possession  of	 the
land.	The  Housing  Board  was  asked	 to  send  the	full
particulars  of	 the  expenditure and not to  carry  on	 any
further development works on that land.	 Reading the  letter
as a whole, it cannot but be said that the possession of the
land  was taken by the government and was also delivered  to
