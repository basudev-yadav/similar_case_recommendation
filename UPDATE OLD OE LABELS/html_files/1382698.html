HEADNOTE:
The  appellant	Shamsher Singh was a  Subordinate  Judge  on
probation.   His services were terminated by the  Government
of  Punjab  in the name of Governor of Punjab  by  an  order
which did not give any reasons for the termination.
Likewise,  the	services of Ishwar Chand Agarwal  were	also
terminated  by	the  Government of Punjab  in  the  name  of
Governor  on  the  recommendation of the  High	Court.	 The
appellants    contended	  that	 the   Governor	   as	 the
constitutional. or the formal head of the State can exercise
powers	and functions of appointment and removal of  members
of  the	 subordinate judicial service only  personally.	 the
appellants placed reliance on the decision of this Court  in
Sardari	 Lal's case where it is held that  the	satisfaction
for  making  an	 order under <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_5">Article  311</a>  is  the  personal
satisfaction  of the President or the Governor.	 The  State,
on  the	 other hand, contended that the	 Governor  exercises
powers	of  appointment and removal conferred on him  by  or
under  the Constitution like executive powers of  the  State
Government  only  on the aid and advice of  his	 council  of
Ministers and not personally.  The Governor is by and  under
the  Constitution  required  to act  in	 his  discretion  in
several matters.  Articles where the expression "acts in his
discretion" is used in relation to the powers and  functions
of   the   Governor  are  those	 which	speak	of   special
responsibilities of the Governor.  Our constitution embodies
generally the parliamentary or cabinet system of  Government
of  the British model.	Under this system the  President  is
the constitutional or formal head of the Union and exercises
his  powers and functions conferred on him by or  under	 the
Constitution  on  the  aid  and advice	of  his	 council  of
Ministers.   Under  the cabinet system	of  Government,	 the
Governor  is the constitutional or formal head of the  State
and exercises all his powers and functions conferred on	 him
by  or under the Constitution on the aid and advice  of	 his
council of Ministers, save in spheres where the Governor  is
required  by  or  under the  Constitution  to  exercise	 his
functions in his discretion.  These appeals have been placed
before	a larger bench to consider whether the	decision  in
Sardari Lal's case correctly lays down the law.
It   was  further  contended  that  since  the	 probationer
continued in service after the expiry of the maximum  period
of probation he became confirmed that the termination was by
way  of punishment and was in violation of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_6">article 311;</a>	 and
that the High Court failed to act in terms of the provisions
of  <a href="/doc/1345754/" id="a_7">art. 235</a> of the Constitution and abdicated	the  control
over  subordinate  judiciary  by asking	 the  government  to
enquire through the vigilance department.
815
(Per   A.   N.	Ray  C.J.  Palekar,   Mathew,	Chandrachud.
Alagiriswami, JJ).
HELD :-The decision in Sardari Lal's case that the President
has  to	 be satisfied personally in  exercise  of  executive
power  or function and that the functions of  the  President
cannot be delegated is not the correct statement of law, and
is against the established and uniform view of this Court as
embodied in several decisions.	The President as well as the
Governor  is  the constitutional head or formal	 head.	 The
President  as well as the Governor exercises his powers	 and
functions  conferred on him by or under the Constitution  on
the  aid  and  advice of his council of	 Ministers  save  in
spheres	 where	the  Governor is required by  or  under	 the
Constitution  to exercise his functions in  his	 discretion.
[833C-F]
Sardari Lal's case overruled.
HELD FURTHER : The President or the Governor acts on the aid
and  advice  of	 the Council of	 Ministers  with  the  Prime
Minister at the head in the case of the Union and the  Chief
Minister  at  the head in the case of State in	all  matters
which  vests  in the executive whether those  functions	 are
executive   or	legislative  in	 character.    Neither	 the
President  nor	the Governor is to  exercise  the  executive
functions  personally.	 The  present  appeals	concern	 the
appointment  of	 persons other than District Judges  to	 the
Judicial  Service  of the State which is to be made  by	 the
Governor as contemplated in <a href="/doc/205445/" id="a_8">Article 234</a> of the	constitution
after consultation with the State Public Service  Commission
and the High Court.  Appointment or dismissal or removal  of
persons	 belonging to the Judicial Service of the  State  is
not a personal function but is an executive function of	 the
Governor  exercised  in accordance with the  rules  in	that
behalf under the Constitution. [836B-D]
HELD FURTHER : No abstract proposition can be laid down that
where  the  services of probationer are	 terminated  without
saying anything more in the order of termination that it can
never amount to a punishment in the facts and  circumstances
of  the case.  If a probationer is discharged on the  ground
of misconduct or inefficiency or for similar reason  without
a  proper  enquiry  and without	 his  getting  a  reasonable
opportunity of showing cause against his discharge it may in
a  given  case	amount to removal from	service	 within	 the
meaning of <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_9">Article 311(2)</a> of the Constitution. [837 F]
HELD  FURTHER  :  In the absence of any	 rules	governing  a
probationer the authority may come to the conclusion that on
account	 of inadequacy for the job or for any  temperamental
or  other  object  not involving moral	turpitude  the	pro-
bationer  is  unsuitable  for  the job	and  hence  must  be
discharged,  the same does not involve any punishment.	 The
authority may in some cases be of the view that the  conduct
of  the	 petitioner may result in dismissal  or	 removal  on
enquiry	 but  in those cases the authority may not  hold  an
enquiry and may simply discharge the petitioner With a	view
to  giving him a chance to make good in other walks of	life
without	 a  stigma.  The fact of holding an enquiry  is	 not
always conclusive.  What is decisive is whether the order is
really by way of punishment.  It the facts and circumstances
of the case indicate that the substance of the order is that
the termination is by way of punishment then the  petitioner
is entitled to attract <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_10">Article 311.</a>  Where the	departmental
enquiry	 is contemplated and if any enquiry is not  in	fact
proceeded with, <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_11">Article 311</a> will not be- attracted unless it
can  be shown that the order though unexceptionable in	form
is  made following a report based on misconduct.  [837	G-A;
838 C; F&amp;G]
HELD  FURTHER  :  Rule7(1)  of	the  Punjab  Civil   Service
(Judicial Branch) Rules 1951 provides that every Subordinate
Judge in the first instance would be appointed on  probation
for 2 years but the said period might be extended from	time
to  time expressly or impliedly so that the total period  of
probation  including  extension	 if any does  not  exceed  3
years.	 The  explanation  to rule 7(1)	 provides  that	 the
probation  shall  be  deemed  to have  been  extended  if  a
Subordinate,  Judge, is not confirmed on the expiry  of	 his
probation.  Any confirmation by implication is negatived  in
the  present case because before the completion of  3  years
the High Court found Prima facie that the conduct as well as
the  work of the appellant was unsatisfactory and  a  notice
was  given  to	the appellant to show cause as	to  why	 his
services should not be terminated.  Explanation to rule 7(1)
shows  that the period of probation shall be deemed to	have
been  extended	impliedly  if a	 subordinate  Judge  is	 not
confirmed  on the expiry of probation.	Therefore,  no	con-
firmation  by  implication can arise in	 the  present  case.
[839B; E-G]
816
HELD FURTHER : The High Court for the reasons which are	 not
stated	decided to depute the Director of Vigilance to	hold
an enquiry.  It is indeed strange that the High Court  which
had control over the judiciary asked the Government to	hold
an enquiry through the Vigilance Department.  The members of
the subordinate judiciary are not only, under the control of
the  High Court but are also under the care and	 custody  of
the High Court.	 The High Court failed to discharge the duty
of preserving its control.  The request by the High Court to
hold an enquiry through the Director of Vigilance was an act
of  self abnegations.  The High Court should have  conducted
the enquiry preferably through District Judges.	 The members
of the Subordinate judiciary look up to High Court not	only
for  discipline but also for dignity.  The  enquiry  officer
nominated   by	the  Director  of  Vigilance  recorded	 the
statements  of witnesses behind the back of  the  appellant.
The  enquiry  was to ascertain the truth of  allegations  of
misconduct.  Neither the report nor the statements  recorded
by  the Enquiry Officer reached the appellant.	The  Enquiry
Officer gave his findings on allegations of misconduct.	 The
High Court accepted the report of Enquiry Officer and  wrote
to  the	 Government  that in the light of  the	report,	 the
appellant  was	not  a suitable person	to  be	retained  in
service. [841C-F]
The  order  of termination of the services of  Ishwar  Chand
Agarwal	 is  clearly by way of punishment in the  facts	 and
circumstances  of the case.  The High Court not only  denied
Ishwar	Chand  merely the protection under <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_12">Article  311</a>	 but
also   denied	itself	the  dignified	control	  over	 the
subordinate  judiciary.	  The  form  of	 the  order  is	 not
decisive  as to, whether the order is by way of	 punishment.
Even an innocuously worded order terminating the service may
in the facts and circumstances of the case establish that an
enquiry	 into allegations of serious and grave character  of
misconduct  involving stigma has been made in infraction  of
the  provisions	 of  <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_13">Article  311.</a>   In	 such  a  case	 the
simplicity  of	the  form of the order	will  not  give	 any
sanctity.   The order of termination is illegal and must  be
set aside. [841 G-H]
In  case of Shamsher Singh the orders of termination of	 the
services  are  set  aside.   The  appellant  Shamsher  Singh
succeeds by setting aside the order of termination. in	view
of the fact that Shgamsher Singh is already employed in	 the
Ministry  of  Law,  no relief  accepting  salary  and  other
monetary  benefits  which accrued to him upto  the  time  he
obtained employment in the Ministry of Law is given.
(Per Krishna lyer J. for himself and Bhagwati J. concurring)
(i)  The  argument about the oath of office of President  to
defend	the Constitution is sometimes put forward  by  inti-
ministerialist	 advocates.   The  President   defends	 the
Constitution not by denying its spiritual essence of Cabinet
responsibility-indeed	he  subverts  it  that	way-but	  by
accepting   as	 his  Constitutional   function	  what	 his
responsible'  ministers	 have  decided.	  Can  a  Judge,  in
fulfillment  of the oath of his office, ignore	all  binding
precedents  and decide according to the ad hoc	dictates  of
his uninformed conscience ?  Tribhovandas's case answers the
point  in the negative.	 If every functionary who takes	 the
oath  by  the Constitution interprets it  according  to	 his
lights,	 this solemn document would be the source  of  chaos
and  collusion and the first casualty would be the  rule  of
law.  Such mischief cannot merit juristic acceptance. [856H;
85-A-B]
It  is clear from <a href="/doc/1951021/" id="a_14">article 74(1)</a> that it is the	function  of
the  Council of Ministers to advise the President  over	 the
whole  of  the	Central	 field.	  Nothing  is  left  to	 his
discretion or excepted from that field by this article.	  By
way  of contract see <a href="/doc/674146/" id="a_15">Article 163</a> which is the  corresponding
provision for Governors and which expressly excepts  certain
matters	  in  which  the  Governor  is,	 by  or	 under	 the
constitution,  required to act in his discretion.  There  is
no such exception in the case of the President. [858FG]
However,  <a href="/doc/1336375/" id="a_16">Article  75(3)</a>  makes	 the  Council  of  Ministers
responsible to the House of the People.	 If, therefore,	 the
President  acted  contrary to advice,  the  ministers  would
either	resign or, since the advice tendered  reflected	 the
view of the House of the People, they would be thrown out of
office by the House of the People.  For the same reason,  no
one else
817
would  then  be	 able to form a	 government.  The  President
would, therefore be compelled to dissolve the House.   Apart
from  the  technical  difficulty of carrying  out  the	many
details	 of  a	general election in  such  a  situation	 the
President  might have to dismiss the Ministry and install  a
caretaker'  government to co-operate with him in ordering  a
general election--the consequences of the election might  be
most  serious.	if  the electorate should  return  the	same
government  to	power,	the President might  be	 accused  of
having sided with Opposition and thrown the country into the
turmoil and expense of a general--election in a vain attempt
to get rid of a Ministry that had the support of  Parliament
and  the people.  This would gravely impair the position  of
the President. [858G-H; 859A-B]
If  we hold that in a conflict between the Ministry and	 the
President,  the	 President's  Voice should  prevail  in	 the
last resort, either generally or even in a particular  class
of cases, this would mean the elimination to that extent  of
the authority of a Ministry which is continuously subject to
control or criticism by the house of the People in favour of
the  authority	of a President who is not  so  subject.	  It
would	thus  result  in  a  reduction	of  the	 sphere	  of
responsible  government. So important a subtraction must  be
justified  by some express provisions in  out  constitution.
[859C-D]
 If the President, in a particular case, where his own views
differ	front  those of his  Ministers,	 ultimately  accepts
their  advice  in defence to a well  understood	 convention,
then  even  if	the act should result in a  breach  of	some
fundamental right, or directive principle' enunciated in the
constitution,  the  responsibility  will  be  that  of	 the
ministers and not of the President. [859D-E]
The  President under the Indian Constitution is not  a	mere
figure head.  Like,, the King in England he will still	have
the right to be consulted, to encourage and to wam Acting on
ministerial  advice  does  not	necessarily  mean  immediate
acceptance of the Ministry's first thoughts.  The  President
can  state  all his objections to any  purposed.  course  of
action	and ask his Ministers in Council, if  necessary,  to
reconsider the matter. it is only in the last resort that he
must accept their final advice. [859F-G]
The President in India is not at all a glorified cipher.  Ho
represents the majesty of the State, is at the apex,  though
only  symbolically,  and ha,, rapport with  the	 people	 and
parties	 being above politics.	His vigilant presence  makes
for good government if only he uses, what Bagehot  described
as the	  right	 to  be consulted, to warn  and	 encourage.'
Indeed, <a href="/doc/220543/" id="a_17">Article 78</a> wisely     sad,  keeps the  President  in
close  touch with the Prime Minister on matters of  national
importance  and policy significance, and there is  no  doubt
that the imprint of his personality may chasten and  correct
the  political government, although the actual	exercise  of
the  functions entrusted to him. by law is in effect and  in
law carried on by his duly appointed mentors, i.e. the Prime
Minister and his colleagues.  In short, the President,	like
the' King, has not merely been constitutionally romanticized
but  actually  vested  with a  persuasive  role.   Political
theorists are quite conversant with the dynamic role of	 the
Crown  which  keeps  away from politics and  power  and	 yet
influences  both.   While he plays such a role he is  not  a
rival  centre of power in any sense and must abide,  by	 and
act  on	 the advice tendered by his Ministers  except  in  a
narrow	territory which is sometimes slippery.	 Of  course,
there is some qualitative difference between the position of
the  President and the Governor.  The former, under <a href="/doc/127060/" id="a_18">Art.  74</a>
hag  no discretionary powers; the latter too has none.	save
in the tiny strips covered by Arts. 163 (2), 371A(1)(b)	 and
(d),  371A(2)(b)  and  (f); VI Schedule para  9(2)  (and  VI
Schedule para 18(3), until omitted recently with effect from
21-1-1972).   These  discretionary powers exist	 only  where
expressly spelt out and even these are not left to the sweet
will of the Governor but are remote-controlled by the  Union
Ministry  which	 is  answerable	 to  Parliament	 for   those
actions.   Again, a minimal area centering round reports  to
be  dispatched	under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_19">Art. 356</a> may not, in  the  nature  of
things, be amenable to ministerial advice. [867F-H; 868A-C]
L192SupCI/75
818
If only we expand the ratio of Sardarilal and Jayantilal  to
every  A  function  which the Article  of  the	Constitution
confer	on  the	 President on  the  Governor,  Parliamentary
democracy  will	 become	 a dope	 and  national	elections  a
numerical  exercise  in	 expensive  futility.  we  will	  be
compelled  to hold that there are two  parallel	 authorities
exercising  powers of governance of the country, as  in	 the
dyarchy	 days,	except	that  Whitehall	 is  substituted  by
Rashtrapati  Bhavan  and  Rai  Bhawan.	 The  cabinet	will
shrinkat   Union   and	State  levels	in   political	 and
administrative	authority and, having solemn regard  to	 the
gamut of his powers and responsibilities, the Head of  State
will  be reincarnation of Her Majesty's Secretary  of  State
for  India,  untroubled	 by even the  British  Parliament  a
little taller in power than the American President.  Such  a
distortion,  by	 interpretation,  it appears  to  us,  would
virtually amount to a subversion of the structure, substance
and vitality of our Republic, particularly when we  remember
that  Governors	 are  but appointed  functionaries  and	 the
President  himself is elected on a limited  indirect  basis.
[869G-H; 870A-B]
HELD FURTHER:
The  President	means,	for  all  practical  Purposes,	 the
Minister or the Council of Ministers as the case may be, and
his  opinion, satisfaction of decision	is  constitutionally
secured	  en   his  Ministers  arrive	at   such   opinion,
satisfaction   or   decision.	The  independence   of	 the
judiciary, which is a cardinal principle of the Constitution
and has been relied on to justify the deviation, is  guarded
by  the relevant Article making consultation with the  Chief
Justice	 of  India  obligatory.	 In  all  conceivable  cases
consultation  with that highest dignitary of Indian  justice
will  and should be accepted by the Government of India	 and
the  Court will have an opportunity to examine if any  other
extraneous  circumstances have entered into the	 verdict  of
the  Minister, if he departs from the counsel given  by	 the
Chief Justice of India.	 In practice the last word in such a
sensitive subject must belong to the Chief Justice of India,
the  rejection	of his advice being ordinarily	regarded  as
prompted by oblique considerations vitiating the order.	  In
this  view  it is immaterial whether the  President  or	 the
Prime Minister or the Minister for Justice formally  decided
the issue. [873A-C]
HELD FURTHER:
Nor  is	 Sardarilal  of such antiquity	and  moment  that  a
reversal  would upset the sanctity of stare  decisis.	Some
rulings, even of the highest Court. when running against the
current	 of  case  and the clear  stream  of  Constitutional
thought, may have to fall into the same class as  restricted
railroad ticket, good for the day and train only,' to  adopt
the  language  of Justice Roberts (Smith v.  Alleright,	 321
U.S. 649, 665). [875E-F]
In short the law of this branch of our constitution is	that
the President and Governor, Custodians of all executive	 and
other  powers  under various Articles shall,  by  virtue  of
these  provisions,  exercise  their  formal   constitutional
powers only upon and in accordance with the advice of  their
Ministers  save in a few well-known exceptional	 situations.
Without	 being	dogmatic  of  exhaustive,  these  situations
relate to (a) the choice of Prime Minister (Chief Minister),
restricted   though   this  choice  is	by   the   paramount
consideration  that  he	 should command a  majority  in	 the
House; (b) the dismissal of a Government which has lost	 its
majority  in the House but refuses to quit office;  (c)	 the
dissolution of the House where an appeal to the country.  is
necessarily, although in this area the Head of State  should
avoid  getting involved in politics and must be	 advised  by
his Prime Minister (Chief Minister) who will eventually take
the  responsibility  for  the step.  We do  not	 examine  in
detail the constitutional proprieties in these	predicaments
except	to utter the caution that even here the action	must
be compelled by the peril to democracy and the appeal to the
House  or to the country must become  blatantly	 obligatory.
[875F-H]
(ii) So far as the appeals are concerned, the effect is that
there  is no infirmity in the impugned orders on  the  score
that  the  Governor has not himself perused  the  papers  or
passed the orders. [876C-D]
819
The orders of terminations are liable to be quashed and	 set
aside  on the facts set out in the judgment of	the  learned
Chief Justice.
Arguments on behalf of the appellant :
<a href="/doc/205445/" id="a_20">Article 234</a> of the Constitution confers on the Governor	 the
power  first  to frame rules in consultation with  the	High
Court  and the Public Service Commission and  then  requires
him  to	 appoint persons to judicial service of a  State  in
accordance  with  the Rules so made.  The power	 to  appoint
includes  The  power to dismiss or  terminate  according  to
section 16 of the general <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_21">Clauses Act</a> read with <a href="/doc/579323/" id="a_22">Article	 367</a>

The power of the Governor under <a href="/doc/205445/" id="a_23">Article 234</a> as regulated  by
the  rules framed thereunder is not the executive  power  of
the  State  as	contemplated under  <a href="/doc/1995256/" id="a_24">Article  154</a>  and  under
<a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_25">Article	 162</a>  of  the Constitution and	is,  therefore,	 not
exercisable under <a href="/doc/1995256/" id="a_26">Article 154</a> through subordinate  officers,
which,	includes  Ministers but must, on the  language,	 the
purpose and the setting of the Article, be exercised by	 the
Governor  as  a power exercisable by himself.  Even  Rule  7
framed	in consultation with the High Court and	 the  Public
Service	 Commission  of the Punjab Civil  Service  (Judicial
Branch	Rules)	confers	 the power  of	termination  on	 the
Governor  alone	 and being bound by those  rules  he  cannot
leave exercise thereof to a subordinate officer.  Since	 the
impugned order of termination dated 15th December, 1969	 was
passed admittedly without even placing the papers before the
Governor  the  same  is	 in  contravention  of	and  is	 not
authorized by <a href="/doc/205445/" id="a_27">Article 234</a> and the rules framed thereunder.
Under <a href="/doc/674146/" id="a_28">Article 163</a> of the Constitution the Governor is to act
on  the	 aid and advice of his Council of Ministers  in	 the
exercise  of  Ms functions except in so far as he is  by  or
under the Constitution required to exercise his functions in
his discretion.	 The power of termination conferred by	Rule
7  is  a power conferred by and under the  Constitution	 and
since Rule 7 requires the Governor in his own discretion  to
decide	whether	 or  not  to terminate	the  services  of  a
probationer judicial officer the function could be exercised
by  the	 Governor  even without the aid and  advice  of	 his
Council	 of Ministers.	<a href="/doc/1782200/" id="a_29">Article 163(2)</a>	further	 strengthens
this  submission in as much as it confers on  the  Governors
the  power even to decide whether a matter is or is not	 one
in his discretion.
Alternatively  and assuming that the function under  <a href="/doc/205445/" id="a_30">Article
234</a>  read  with	 Rule  7  was  not  within  the	  Governor's
discretion  in terms of <a href="/doc/674146/" id="a_31">Article 163</a>, the power conferred  by
<a href="/doc/205445/" id="a_32">Article	 234</a>  and said Rule 7 was  not	exercisable  through
subordinates   under   <a href="/doc/1995256/" id="a_33">Article	154</a>  although  it   may	  be
exercisable  by	 the Governor on the aid and advice  of	 his
Council	 of Ministers since the power is not  the  executive
power of the State, but a law making cum executive power  of
the Governor himself.
Under  <a href="/doc/1345754/" id="a_34">Article 235</a> of the Constitution it is the High  Court
alone which is vested with the control over the	 subordinate
judiciary  in  all  matters  including	the  initiating	 and
holding	 of enquiries against judicial officers.  Since	 the
dismissal  or  termination of the  appellant's	services  is
based	on   the   Superintendent   of	 Police,   Vigilance
Department's  findings	of guilt the order is in  breach  of
<a href="/doc/1345754/" id="a_35">Article 235</a> of the Constitution.
The  appellant having completed his maximum period of  three
years probation. a legal right to be confirmed in favour  of
the  appellant.	 Thereafter he ceased to be  a	probationer.
Since the appellant had acquired a right to be confirmed his
services  could not have been terminated without  compliance
with the provisions of Article. 311 of the Constitution.
The impugned order of termination though innocuous in  form,
is  really  an	order  by way  of  punishment  removing	 the
appellant  from	 service on the basis of  charges  of  gross
misconduct   found  established	 by  an	  ex-parte   enquiry
conducted  by  the S.P. Vigilance Department with  the	only
object of ascertaining the truth, of the alleged  misconduct
and for the purpose of dismissing or removing the petitioner
if the charges were found established.	It was ultimately on
the  basis of specific findings recorded by  S.P.  Vigilance
that the appellant's services were terminated.	The  enquiry
was clearly in breach of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_36">Article 311</a> of the Constitution  as
also in breach of rules of Natural justice.  The enquiry  by
SP.   Vigilance was essentially and in character and  object
different from the infor-
820
mal  enquiry into the suitability of the appellant  held  by
the two District Judges (Ferozpur and Bhatinda) towards the,
end of the maximum period of probation.
The report of the Vigilance Department which formed the very
basis of the termination is therefore, based on an  entirely
uncommunicated material.
Even  the  adverse  reports referred to	 by  the  Respondent
Government  were  not made the subject matter  of  the	show
cause notice proposing termination so that in terms of	Rule
9  the	petitioner never had the opportunity to	 show  cause
against	 them.	Although the said reports related to a	pre-
show  cause  notice, period they were not made	the  subject
matter of the show cause notice )so that the impugned  order
of termination, which, is admittedly based on these  adverse
reports also is in breach of Rule 9.
The  appellant's  service have thus been terminated  on	 the
basis  of  grounds  entirely extraneous to  the	 show  cause
notice and since the appellant was not applied of these	 new
grounds and allegations and was not given an opportunity  to
submit an explanation with regard to the same, the order  of
termination dated 15th December, 1969 has clearly been	made
in breach of mandatory provisions of rule 9 and is liable to
be quashed.
Arguments on behalf of the Respondent
It is a fundamental principle of English Constitutional	 law
that  there  must be no conflict between the  King  and	 his
people,	 and consequently no conflict between the  King	 and
the,  House  of Commons which represents the people.  It  is
this principle which is responsible for three settled  rules
of  English Constitutional Law : (i) That for  every  public
act  of the King, his Ministers must accept  responsibility,
(ii)  That  the	 Sovereign must never act on  his  own	res-
ponsibility  that is, he must always have advisers who	will
bear responsibility for his acts; and (iii) The Power of the
Sovereign  to  differ  from  or	 dismiss  his  Ministers  is
conditioned  by the practical rule that the Crown must	find
advisers  to  bear responsibility for his action  and  those
advisers  must have the confidence of the house of  Commons.
This  rule of English Constitutional Law is incorporated  in
the  Constitution of India.  See Articles 74(1),  75(3)	 and
361(1)	and  second  proviso  which  clearly  point  to	 the
conclusion   that  the	Indian	Constitution   envisages   a
Parliamentary or "responsible" form of Government and not  a
Presidential  form  of	Government.   The  powers  of	the,
Governor as constitutional head are no different-See <a href="/doc/1749700/" id="a_37">Article
163(1</a><a href="/doc/331399/" id="a_38">), 164(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/1340387/" id="a_39">361(1)</a> and second proviso.
The  Supreme Court of India has consistently taken the	view
that  the  powers  of the President and the  powers  of	 the
Governor  under	 the  Indian Constitution are  akin  to	 the
powers of the Crown under the British Parliamentary  system.
<a href="/doc/1318432/" id="a_40">See Ramajawari Kapur v. State of Punjab</a> [1955] 2 SCR at 236-
237  (Mukherjea, CJ.), A. Sanjeevi Naidu v. State of  Madras
[1970]	3  SCR 505 at 511 (Hegde J.); <a href="/doc/494666/" id="a_41">U. N.  Rao  v.  Indira
Gandhi</a>	[1971] Supp.  SCR p. 46 (Sikri, C.J.). In  the	last
case  this Court held that <a href="/doc/1951021/" id="a_42">Article 74(1)</a> was  mandatory	 and
therefore  the	President could not exercise  the  executive
power  without the aid and advice of Council  of  Ministers;
but  the principle of the decision is not restricted to	 the
exercise  of  executive power alone.  A	 similar  view	with
regard to the powers of the President and the Governor under
our  Constitution  is expressed by  Constitutional  lawyers.
(See,  for  instance, Jennings Constitutional  Laws  of	 the
Commonwealth 1952 p. 365 where the author characterizes	 the
description  of	 the  Indian  Constitution  as	a  Sovereign
Democratic Republic as "wholly accurate" but that "it  might
also  be  described as a constitutional monarchy  without  a
monarch".
The  Governor  is  at  the apex of  the	 Executive  and	 the
executive  power  of  the State is vested  in  the  Governor
[<a href="/doc/598144/" id="a_43">Article 154(1)].</a>  The Governor is also at the annex of	 the
State Legislature (<a href="/doc/1295106/" id="a_44">Article 169</a>).
In both these capacities the Governor has several  functions
to perform.  The word functions' includes powers and duties-
The  nature of these functions and the capacity in which  he
examines them is set out in the Explanatory Note appended to
this written argument.
The power to terminate the engagement of a member of a State
Public Service Commission such as a Sub-Judge is part of the
executive power of
821
the State. (<a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_45">Art. 162</a> read will Entry 41 of List 11).  It can
be  allocated  to a Minister under <a href="/doc/1431979/" id="a_46">Art. 166(3).</a>	 It  can  be
exercised by subordinate officials if this is in  accordance
with the rules of allocation.
In any case the executive power of the State extends to, but
is  not limited to, matters in respect of which	 legislature
has  power  to make laws.  Neither the appointment  nor	 the
termination  of	 the services of a District  Judge  (<a href="/doc/1704953/" id="a_47">Article
233</a>)  nor  the appointment or termination of  service  of  a
member of the Subordinate Judicial Service (<a href="/doc/205445/" id="a_48">Article 234</a>)  is
a  matter with respect to which the Governor is required  to
act  in	 his  discretion.  The argument (on  behalf  of	 the
Interveners)  that  the "Governor" in Articles 233  and	 234
mean  the  Governor personally and not	acting	through	 any
other  agency is contrary to the plain language of  articles
154(1), 162(1) and 166.	 It is also contrary to the  concept
"responsible" Government.  That the actions of "responsible"
Ministers should be scrutinized by a nominated Governor, who
is  responsible	 to  no	 one,  is  a  strange  argument	 the
confidence in the personal opinion of a nominated individual
may  or may not be justified; but it is not warranted  in  a
Parliamentary system of democracy.  There is nothing in	 the
form  of the oath taken by the Governor to militate  against
the  State's  submissions.  If the Governor is true  to	 his
oath  he  cannot  ignore  or refuse  to	 follow	 a  ride  of
constitutional	Law-which is that he must act as  a  consti-
tutional  head	of  a State having a  Council  of  Ministers
responsible  to	 the  State Legislature.   In  fact  such  a
contention   runs   counter  to	 the   theory	of   Cabinet
responsibility on which our Constitution is based.
The  argument  founded on <a href="/doc/1091985/" id="a_49">article 167</a> does not	advance	 the
case  of  the  petitioners.  The Governor has  no  right  to
refuse	to  act on the advice of the Council  of  Ministers.
Such   a  position  is	antithetical  to  the	concept	  of
"responsible' Government.  <a href="/doc/1091985/" id="a_50">Article 167</a> was inserted for	 the
limited	 purpose  of enabling him to obtain  information  so
that  he could discharge the constitutional functions  of  a
Governor.  It was not intended to give the Governor power to
interfere  in the administration and as such a	result	does
not flow from the language used in <a href="/doc/1091985/" id="a_51">article 167.</a>
A person appointed to a permanent post in Government service
on probation has no right to continue to hold that post	 any
more  than  a  servant employed on probation  by  a  private
employer is entitled to do.  Termination' of the services of
the  probationer  during  or at the end	 of  the  period  or
probation will not ordinarily and by itself be a  punishment
attracting the provisions of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_52">article 311.</a>  If termination of
service of a probationer is founded on a right flowing	from
the  contract or the service rules, then prima facie  it  is
not a punishment and <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_53">article 311</a> is not attracted.  The test
is  :  Is termination sought to be brought  about  otherwise
than  by  way of punishment ? If yes, <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_54">article 311</a>  will	 not
apply.	This is ordinarily to be ascertained by reference to
the order terminating the service.
Though termination of the service of a probationer during or
at  the end of the period of probation will  not  ordinarily
and  by itself be a punishment-the  circumstances  attending
the  termination would be relevant to determine	 whether  or
not the termination was by way of punishment.  An  important
circumstance would be the fact that disciplinary action	 was
contemplated  and  taken.  The form of the order is  not  by
itself conclusive.
An  order of termination of service in unexceptionable	form
preceded  by an inquiry launched by the superior  authority-
whether under specific rules or otherwise for the purpose of
ascertaining  whether the public servant should be  retained
in service does not attract the operation of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_55">article 311.</a>
Even where a departmental inquiry is initiated and a  charge
sheet	submitted  followed  by	 an  explanation  from	 the
probationer  the  provisions  of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_56">article 311</a>  would  not  be
attracted  if the inquiry was not proceeded with  and  there
was a termination of service simpliciter.
But where the inquiry is held under rules giving the  public
servant on probation an opportunity of showing cause why the
probationer's appointment should not be terminated and	such
a  show cause notice is given and an inquiry held under	 the
relevant rule. the order of discharge of the probationer  if
unexceptionable in form, will not amount to "dismissal".
In  the.  present case Rule 9 was invoked and  was  applied.
The    confidential   reports	themselves    disclose	  an
unsatisfactory record implying unsuitability for
822
further	 service.  This itself is sufficient to dispose	 of.
the  petitioner's contentions on merits.   The	confidential
reports	 were  available with the Government  as  they	were
forwarded  by  the  High  Court.   The	explanation  of	 the
petitioner  was considered by the High Court both  prior  to
the issue of a show cause notice by the Chief Secretary	 and
after, and the explanation of the petitioners was also	con-
sidered	 by the High Court.  The record does not  show	that
the view of the High Court was in any way perverse.  On	 the
contrary,  it is clearly warranted by the facts	 on  record.
The  contention that the show cause notice should have	been
under  the specific directions of the Chief Minister is	 not
warranted  either by the Allocation Rules of 1966 nor is  it
justified  on  a true construction of Rule 9 of	 the  Punjab
Civil Service (Punishment and Appeal) Rules, 1952.

</p><p id="p_11">The appellants rely on the decision of this Court in Sardari
Lal v. union of India &amp; Ors. (1971)3 S.C.R. 461 where it has
been  held that where the President or the Governor, as	 the
case  may  be, if satisfied, makes an  order  under  <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_57">Article

this   ruling  contend	that  under  <a href="/doc/205445/" id="a_58">Article  234</a>   of	 the
Constitution  the appointment as well as the termination  of
services of subordinate Judges is to be made by the Governor
personally.
</p><p id="p_12">These  two  appeals  were placed before a  larger  Bench  to
consider whether the decision in Sardari Lal's case  (supra)
correctly lays down the law that where the President or	 the
Governor is to be satisfied it is his personal satisfaction.
The appellants contend that the power of the Governor  under
<a href="/doc/205445/" id="a_59">Article	 234</a> of the Constitution is to be exercised  by	 him
personally for these reasons.
</p><p id="p_13">First there are several constitutional functions, powers and
duties of the  Governor.   These  are conferred	 on  him  eo
nomine	the  Governor.	The Governor, is, by and  under	 the
Constitution,  required to act in his discretion in  several
matters.   These constitutional functions and powers of	 the
Governor eo nomine as well as these in the discretion of the
Governor  are not executive powers of the State	 within	 the
meaning of <a href="/doc/1995256/" id="a_60">Article 154</a> read with <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_61">Article 162.</a>
Second, the Governor under <a href="/doc/674146/" id="a_62">Article 163</a> of the  Constitution.
can take aid and advice of his Council of Ministers when  he
is  exercising executive power of the State.   The  Governor
can exercise powers and functions without the aid and advice
of his Council of Ministers when he is required by or  under
the  Constitution  to  act in his discretion,  where  he  is
required to exercise his Constitutional functions  conferred
on him eo nomine as the Governor.
</p><p id="p_14">Third, the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers  under
<a href="/doc/674146/" id="a_63">Article 163</a> is different from the allocation of business  of
the  Government of the state by the Governor to the  Council
of Ministers under <a href="/doc/1431979/" id="a_64">Article
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">824</span>
166(3)</a>	of the constitution.  The allocation of business  of
Govt.  under <a href="/doc/1431979/" id="a_65">Article, 166(3)</a> is an instance  of exercise  of
executive  power  by  the Governor through  his	 council  by
allocating  or delegating his functions. The aid and  advice
is a constitutional restriction on the exercise of executive
powers of the State by the Governor.  The Governor will	 not
be  constitutionally competent to exercise  these  executive
powers	of  the	 State without the aid	and  advice  of	 the
Council of Ministers.
</p><p id="p_15">Fourth, the executive powers of the State are vested in	 the
Governor  under <a href="/doc/598144/" id="a_66">Article 154(1).</a>	 The powers  of	 appointment
and removal of Subordinate Judge under <a href="/doc/205445/" id="a_67">Article 234</a> have	 not
been allocated to the Ministers under the Rules of  Business
of  the State of Punjab.  Rule 18 of the Rules	of  Business
States	that except as otherwise provided by any other	rule
cases  shall  ordinarily  be disposed of  by  or  under	 the
authority  of  the  Minister-in-Charge	who  may,  by  means
of   Standing orders, give such directions as he thinks	 fit
for the disposal of cases  in his department.  Rule 7(2)  in
Part  D	 of the Punjab civil Rules which  states  that	the,
Governor  of Punjab may on the, recommendation of  the	High
Court  remove from service without assigning any  cause	 any
subordinate  Judge  or revert him to  his  substantive	post
during	the, period of probation is incapable of  allocation
to a Minister.	Rule 18 of the, Rules of Business is subject
to exceptions and rule 7(2) of the Service Rules is such  an
exception.  Therefore, the appellants contend that the power
of  the Governor to remove Subordinate Judges under  <a href="/doc/205445/" id="a_68">Article
234</a>  read with the aforesaid Rule 7(2) of the Service  Rules
cannot be allocated to a Minister.
</p><p id="p_16">The Attorney General for the Union, the Additional Solicitor
General for the State of Punjab and Counsel for the State of
Haryana contended that the President is the,  constitutional
head  of  the Union and the Governor is	 the  constitutional

exercises  all powers and functions conferred on them by  or
under the Constitution on the aid and advice of the  Council

respect of his powers and functions are is satisfied', if of

</p><p id="p_18"><a href="/doc/1749700/" id="a_69">Article	 163(1)</a>	 states	 that there shall be  a	 Council  of
Ministers  with	 the Chief Minister at the head to  aid	 and

in  so far as he is by or under this Constitution,  required
to  exercise  his  functions  or any of	 them  in  his	dis-
cretion.  <a href="/doc/1782200/" id="a_70">Article 163(2)</a> states that if any question  arises
whether	 any matter is or is not a matter as respects  which
the  Governor is by or under this Constitution	required  to

discretion shall be final and the validity of anything	done
by  the	 Governor  shall not be called in  question  on	 the
ground	that  the ought or ought not to have  acted  in	 his
discretion.   Extracting  the words "in his  discretion"  in

Governor  may  sue  or be sued in the  name  of	 the  State.
Second,	 <a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_105">Article 361</a> states that proceedings may be  brought
against	 the Government of India and the Government  of	 the
State  but  not	 against  the  President  or  the  Governor.
Articles 300 and 361 indicate that neither the President nor
the  Governor  can  be sued for	 executive  actions  of	 the
Government.   The reason is that neither the  president	 nor
the Governor exercises the executive functions	individually
or  personally.	 Executive action taken in the name  of	 the
President  is  the action of the  Union.   Executive  action
taken in the name of the Governor is the executive action of
the State.

the  rules  of	business.   These  provisions  are  for	 the
discharge  of  the  executive powers and  functions  of	 the
Government  in	the name of the President or  the  Governor.
Where functions entrusted to a Minister are performed by  an
official  employed in the Minister's Department there is  in
law  no	 delegation  because  constitutionally	the  act  or
decision  of  the official is that of  the,  Minister.	 Ile
official  is merely the machinery for the discharge  of	 the
functions  entrusted to a Minister (See Halsubry's  laws  of
England 4th Ed.	 Vol. I paragraph 748 at p. 170 and <a href="/doc/157352718/" id="a_130">Carleton
Ltd. v. Works Commissioners</a> (1943) 2 AU. (E.R. 560)
It is a fundamental principle of English Constitutional	 law
that   Ministers  must	accept	responsibility	 for   every
executive act.	In England, the sovereign never acts on	 his
own   responsibility.	The  power  of	the   sovereign	  is
conditioned  by the practical rule that the Crown must	find
advisers  to  bear  responsibility for	his  action.   Those
advisers  must have the confidence of the House of  Commons.
This  rule of English constitutional law is incorporated  in
our  Constitution.   The  Indian  Constitution	envisages  a
parliamentary  and  responsible form of	 Government  at	 the
Centre	and  in the States and not a  Presidential  form  of
Government.    Tie   powers   of   the	 Governor   as	 the
Constitutional head are not different.
</p><p id="p_28">This  Court has consistently taken the view that the  powers
of the President and the powers of the Governor are  similar
to  the powers of the Crown under the British  Parliamentary
system. (<a href="/doc/1318432/" id="a_131">See Ram Jawaya Kapur v. State of Punjab</a> (1952) 2 S.

(1971)	Supp.	S.  C. R. 46.  In Ram  Jawaya  Kapur's	case
(supra)	 Mukherjea, C. J. speaking for the Court stated	 the
legal  position as follows.  The executive has	the  Primary
responsibility	for the formulation of	governmental  policy
and  its transmission into law.	 The condition precedent  to
the  exercise of this responsibility is that  the  executive
retains	 the  confidence of the legislative  branch  of	 the
State.	 The initiation of legislation, the  maintenance  of
order, the promotion of Social and economic welfare, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">829</span>
direction  of foreign policy, the, carrying on	the  general
administration	of  the State are ail  executive  functions.
The  executive	is  to act subject to  the  control  of	 the
legislature.  Ile executive power of the Union is vested  in
the   President.    The	  President   is   the	 formal	  or
constitutional	head of the executive.	The  real  executive
powers are vested in the Ministers of the Cabinet.  There is
a  Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister as the	head
to  aid	 and  advise the President in the  exercise  of	 his
functions.
</p><p id="p_29">The  functions	of the Governor under rules of	business  of
Madras Government in regard to a scheme for  nationalization
of  certain  bus  routes were considered by  this  Court  in
Sanjeevi  Naidu's case (supra).	 The validity of the  scheme
was  challenged on the ground that it was not formed by	 the
State  Government  but by the Secretary	 to  the  Government
pursuant  to powers conferred on him under Rule 23-A of	 the
Madras Government Business Rules.
</p><p id="p_30">The Scheme was upheld for these reasons.  The Governor makes
rules	under  <a href="/doc/1431979/" id="a_134">Article	166(3)</a>	for  the   more	  convenient
transaction  of business the Government of the	State.	 The
Governor can not only allocate the various subjects  amongst
the Ministers but may go further and designate a  particular
official  to  discharge any particular function.   But	that
could  be done on the, advice of the Council  of  Ministers.
The  essence of Cabinet System of Government responsible  to
the   Legislature   is	that  an  individual   Minister	  is
responsible for every action taken or omitted to be taken in
his Ministry.  In every administration, decisions are  taken
by the civil servants.	The Minister lays down the policies.
The Council of Ministers settle the, major policies.  When a
Civil  Servant	takes  a decision, he does not do  it  as  a
delegate  of  his  Minister.  Ho does it on  behalf  of	 the
Government.   The officers are the limbs of  the  Government
and  not its delegates.	 Where functions are entrusted to  a
Minister and these are performed by an official employed  in
the  Ministry's	 department, there is in law  no  delegation
because constitutionally the act or decision of the official
is that of the Minister.
</p><p id="p_31">In  Rao's  case (supra) this Court had to  consider  whether
House  of  People  being dissolved by the  President  on  27
December,  1970,  the Prime Minister ceased to	hold  office
thereafter.   Our  Constitution is modeled  on	the  British
Parliamentary	system.	  The  executive  has  the   primary
responsibility for the formation of Government policy.	 The
executive  is to act subject to control by the	Legislature.
The  President acts on the aid and advice of the Council  of
Ministers with the Prime Minister at the head.	The  Cabinet
enjoying   as  it  does	 a  majority  in   the	 Legislature
concentrates   in  itself  the	virtual	 control   of	both
legislative  and executive functions.  <a href="/doc/1951021/" id="a_135">Article	74(1)</a>  Which
states	that there shall be a Council of Ministers with	 the
Prime  Minister at the head to aid and advise the  President
in  the legislative functions is mandatory.  The  contention
in  that  case that on the President dissolving	 the  House,
there will be no Prime Minister was not accepted because  it
would change the entire content of the executive Government.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">830</span>
<p id="p_32">If there will be no Council of Ministers, the President will
not have a Prime Minister and Ministers to aid and advise in
the exercise of his functions.	As there will be no  Council
of Ministers, nobody will be responsible to the House of the
People.	  <a href="/doc/1324537/" id="a_136">Article 75</a> states that the Prime Minister will  be
appointed by the President and the other Ministers shall  be
appointed  on  the advice of the  Prime	 Minister.   <a href="/doc/1336375/" id="a_137">Article
75(3)</a>  states that the Council of Ministers is	collectively

responsible  Government.   <a href="/doc/1336375/" id="a_138">Article 75(3)</a> by itself  may	 not
apply  when the House of People, is dissolved or  prorogued.
But  the  harmonious reading of the mandatory  character  of
<a href="/doc/1532170/" id="a_139">Article	 75(1)</a> along with Articles 75(2) and 75(3)  is	that
the  President cannot exercise executive powers without	 the
aid  and advice of the Council of Ministers with  the  Prime
Minister  at the head.	In that context, Articles 77(3)	 and
78 have full operation for duties of the Prime Minister	 and
allocation of business among Ministers.

notification  what the Legislature could do by	legislation,
namely,	 to entrust functions relating to matters  to  which
executive  power of the Union extends to officers  named  in
the notification.  The notification issued by the  President
was  held  to have the force of law.  This Court  held	that

State the functions which are vested in the Union, and which
are exercisable by the President on behalf of the Union	 and

exercise  by  legislation,  to	entrust	 functions  to	 the
Officers to be specified in that behalf by the President and
subject to the conditions Prescribed thereby.  The result of
the notification by the President under <a href="/doc/373660/" id="a_164">Article 258</a> is	that
wherever  the expression appropriate Government"  occurs  in
the  Act in relation to provisions for acquisition  of	land
for  the  purposes  of the  Union,  the	 words	"Appropriate
Government  or	the  Commissioner  of  the  Division  having

exercised  with	 the  aid  and	advice	of  the	 Council  of

the other is Jayantilal Amritlal Shodhan's case (supra) Moti

interest of the security of the State it is not expedient to

President  under <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_173">Article 311(2)</a> cannot be  delegated.	This
Court  also  stated in Sardari Lal's case (supra)  that	 the

functions  of  the nature entrusted by certain	Articles  in
which  the President has to be: satisfied himself about	 the
existence  of  certain facts or state of affairs  cannot  be
delegated by him to anyone else.
</p><p id="p_43">The decision in Sardari Lal's case that the President has to

and  is	 against the established and uniform  view  of	this
Court  as embodied in several decisions to  which  reference
has  already been made.	 These decisions are from  the	year
1955  upto the years 1971.  The decisions are Rai Saheb	 Ram

</p><p id="p_44">The President as well as the Governor is the  Constitutional
or  formal  head.   The President as well  as  the  Governor
exercises  his powers and functions conferred on him  by  or
under the Constitution on the aid and advice of his  Council
of Ministers, save in spheres where the Governor is required
by  or under the Constitution to exercise his  functions  in
his  discretion.   Wherever the	 Constitution  requires	 the
satisfaction of the President or the Governor for the  exer-
cise  by  the  President or the Governor  of  any  power  or
function, the	satisfaction required by the Constitution is
not  the personal satisfaction of the President or  Governor
but  the  satisfaction of the President or Governor  in	 the
Constitutional	sense in the Cabinet system  of	 Government,
that  is, satisfaction of his Council of Ministers on  whose
aid  and  advice  the President or  the	 Governor  generally
exercise all his powers and functions.	The decision of	 any
Minister  or officer under rules of business made under	 any
of these two Articles 77(3)   and 166(3) is the decision  of
the President or the Governor respectively.  These  articles
did not provide for any delegation.  Therefore, the decision
of  Minister or officer under the rules of business  is	 the
decision of the President or the Governor.
In  Moti Ram Deka's case (supra) the question  for  decision

The  decision  in  Moti	 Ram Deka's case  supra	 is  not  an
authority  for the proposition that the power to  dismiss  a
servant at pleasure is outside the scope of <a href="/doc/1995256/" id="a_179">Article 154</a>	 and
cannot	be  delegated  by  the	Governor  to  a	 subordinate
officer.
</p><p id="p_45">This Court in State of Uttar Pradesh &amp; Ors. v. Babu Ram Upa-
dhya [1961] 2 S.C.R. 679 held that the power of the Governor
to dismiss at pleasure, subject to the provisions of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_180">Article
311</a>,  is  not  an executive power under <a href="/doc/1995256/" id="a_181">Article	 154</a>  but  a
Constitutional	power and is not capable of being  delegated
to officers subordinate to him.	 The effect of the  judgment
in  Babu  Ram Upadhya's case (supra) was that  the  Governor
could not delegate his pleasure to any officer nor could any
law provide for the exercise of that pleasure by an  officer
with the result that statutory rules governing dismissal are
binding	 on  every officer though they were subject  to	 the
overriding  pleasure of the Governor.  This would mean	that
the officer was bound by the Rules but the Governor was not.
In Babu Ram Upadhya's case (supra) the majority view  stated
seven propositions at p. 701 of the report.  Proposition No.
2 is that the power to dismiss a public servant at  pleasure
is outside the scope of <a href="/doc/1995256/" id="a_182">Article 154</a> and therefore cannot  be
delegated  by the Governor to a subordinate officer and	 can
be  exercised  by him only in the manner prescribed  by	 the
Constitution.	Propositions  No. 3 and 4  are	these.	 The
tenure of a public servant is subject to the limitations  or
qualifications mentioned in <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_183">Article 311</a> of the Constitution.
The  Parliament or the Legislatures of States cannot make  a
law  abrogating	 or modifying this tenure so as	 to  impinge
upon  the overriding power conferred upon the  President  or
the Governor under <a href="/doc/1342309/" id="a_184">Article 310</a> as qualified by <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_185">Article	311.</a>
Proposition No. 5 is that the Parliament or the Legislatures
of  States  can	 make a law  regulating	 the  conditions  of
service	 of such a member which includes proceedings by	 way
of disciplinary action, without affecting the powers of	 the
President   or	the  Governor  under  <a href="/doc/1342309/" id="a_186">Article  310</a>  of	 the
Constitution  read with <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_187">Article 311.</a>  Proposition No.  6  is
that the Parliament and the Legislatures also can make a law
laying	down  and regulating the scope and  content  of	 the
doctrine  of  "reasonable opportunity" embodied	 in  <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_188">Article
311</a>, but the said law would be subject to judicial review.
All these propositions were reviewed by the majority opinion
of this Court in Moti Ram Deka's case (supra) and this Court
restated that proposition No. 2 must be read along with	 the
subsequent propositions specified as propositions No. 3,  4,
5 and 6. The ruling in Moti Ram Deka's case (supra) is	that
a  law can be framed prescribing the procedure by which	 and
the  authority by whom the said pleasure can  be  exercised.
The pleasure of the President or the Governor to dismiss can
therefore  not	only  be delegated but is  also	 subject  to
<a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_189">Article	 311.</a>	The true position as laid down in  Moti	 Ram
Deka's	case  (supra) is that Articles 310 and 311  must  no
doubt be read together but once the true scope and effect of
<a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_190">Article	 311</a> is determined the scope of <a href="/doc/1820385/" id="a_191">Article 310(1)</a>	must
be limited in the sense
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">835</span>
That  in  regard to cases falling under <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_192">Article	 311(2)</a>	 the
pleasure  mentioned in <a href="/doc/1582763/" id="a_193">Article 310(2)</a> must be exercised	 in-
accordance with the requirements of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_194">Article 311.</a>
The  majority view in Babu Ram Upadhya's case (supra) is  no
longer	good law after the decision in Moti Ram Deka's	case
(supra).  The theory that only the President or the Governor
is personally to exercise pleasure of dismissing or removing
a public servant is repelled by express words in <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_195">Article 311</a>
that no person who is a member of the Civil service or holds
a  civil post under the Union or a State shall be  dismissed
or removed by authority subordinate to that by which he	 was
appointed.  The words "dismissed or removed by an  authority
subordinate to that by which he was appointed" indicate that
the  pleasure of the President or the Governor is  exercised
by  such  officers on, whom the President  or  the  Governor
confers or delegates power.
</p><p id="p_46">The  provisions of the Constitution which expressly  require
the  Governor to exercise, his powers in his discretion	 are
contained in Articles to which reference has been made.	  To
illustrate,  <a href="/doc/398881/" id="a_196">Article 239(2)</a> states that where a Governor  is
appointed  an Administrator of an adjoining Union  Territory
he  shall  exercise  his  functions  as	 such  administrator
independently  of  his	Council	 of  Ministers.	  The  other
Articles  which speak of the discretion of the Governor	 are
paragraphs 9(2) and 18(3) of the Sixth Schedule and Articles
371(1)(b),  371A(1)(d) and 371A(2)(b) and  371A(2)(f).	 The
discretion  conferred  on  the Governor means  that  as	 the
constitutional	or  formal head of the State  the  power  is
vested	in him.	 In this connection, reference may be,	made
to  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_197">Article  356</a> which states that the Governor can  send  a
report to the President that a situation has arisen in which
the  Government	 of  the  State cannot	be,  carried  on  in
accordance with the provisions of this Constitution.   Again
<a href="/doc/1580975/" id="a_198">Article	  200</a>	requires  the  Governor	  to   reserve	 for
consideration  any  Bill which in his opinion if  it  became
law, would so derogate from the powers of the High Court  as
to endanger the position which the High Court is designed to
fill under the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_47">In  making a report under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_199">Article 356</a> the Governor  will  be
justified in exercising his discretion even against the	 aid
and advice of his Council of Ministers.	 The reason is	that
the  failure of the Constitutional machinery may be  because
of   the  conduct  of  the  Council  of	  Ministers.	This
discretionary  power is given to the Governor to enable	 him
to  report  to the President who, however, must act  on	 the
advice of his Council of Ministers in all matters.  In	this
context	 <a href="/doc/1782200/" id="a_200">Article 163(2)</a> is explicable that the	decision  of
the  Governor  in  his discretion shall	 be  final  and	 the
validity shall not be called in question.  The action  taken
by  the	 President on such a report is a  different  matter.
The  President	acts  on  the  advice  of  his	Council	  of
Ministers.  In all other matters where the Governor acts  in
his  discretion he will act in harmony with his	 Council  of
Ministers.   The  Constitution does not aim at	providing  a
parallel  administration  within the State by  allowing	 the
Governor  to  go  against  the	advice	of  the	 Council  of
Ministers.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">836</span>
<p id="p_48">Similarly  <a href="/doc/1580975/" id="a_201">Article 200</a> indicates another instance where	 the
Governor may act irrespective of any advice from the Council
of  Ministers  In  such matters where  the  Governor  is  to
exercise his discretion has must discharge his duties to the
best  of his judgment.	The Governor is required  to  pursue
such courses which are not detrimental to the State.
For the foregoing reasons we hold that the President or	 the
Governor  acts	on  the aid and advice	of  the	 Council  of
Ministers with the Prime Minister at the head in the case of
the Union and the Chief Minister at the head in the case  of
State  in all matters which vests in the  executive  whether
those  functions are executive or legislative in  character.
Neither	 the President nor the Governor is to  exercise	 the
executive functions personally.	 The present appeals concern
the appointment of persons other than District Judges to the
Judicial  Service  of the State which is to be made  by	 the
Governor as contemplated in <a href="/doc/205445/" id="a_202">Article 234</a> of the	Constitution
after consultation with the State Public Service  Commission
and the High Court.  Appointment or dismissal or removal  of
persons	 belonging to the Judicial Service of the  State  is
not a personal function but is an executive function of	 the
Governor  exercised  in accordance with the  rules  in	that
behalf under the Constitution.

</p><p id="p_53">The position of a probationer. was considered by this  Court
in <a href="/doc/1270113/" id="a_203">Purshotam Lal Dhingra v. Union of India</a> [1958] S C.R. 828
Das,  C.J., speaking for the Court said that where a  person
is  appointed to a permanent post in Government	 service  on
probation  the termination of his service during or  at	 the
end  of	 the period of probation win not ordinarily  and  by
itself	be  a punishment because the Goverrment	 servant  so
appointed  has no right to continue to hold such a post	 any
more  than  a  servant employed on probation  by  a  private
employer is entitled to do so.	Such a termination does	 not
operateas a forfeiture of any right of a servant to hold the
post,	for  he	 has  no  such	right.	 Obviously  such   a
termination  cannot be a dismissal, removal or reduction  in
rank  by  way  of  punishment.	 There	are,  however,	 two
important  observations	 of  Das, C.J.,	 in  Dhingra's	case
(supra).  One is that if a right exists under a contract  or
service Rules to terminate the service the motive  operating
on  the	 mind of the Government is wholly  irrelevant.	 The
other is that if the termination of service is sought to  be
founded	 on  misconduct, negligence, inefficiency  or  other
disqualification,  then	 it  is a  punishment  and  violates
<a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_204">Article	 311</a> of the constitution.  The reasoning why  motive
is said to be irrelevant is that it inheres in the state  of
mind  which  is	 not  discernible. on  the  other  land,  if
termination is founded on misconduct it is objective and  is
canifest.
</p><p id="p_54">No  abstract  proposition can be laid down  that  where	 the
services  of  a probationer are	 terminated  without  saying
anything  more	in the, order of termination than  that	 the
services are terminated it can never amount to a  punishment
in   the  facts	 and  circumstances  of	 the  case.   If   a
probationer  is discharged on the ground of  misconduct,  or
inefficiency or for similar reason without a proper  enquiry
and without his getting a reasonable opportunity of  showing
cause against his discharge it may in a given case amount to
removal from service within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_205">Article 311(2)</a> of
the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_55">Before a probationer is confirmed the authority concerned is
under  an  obligation to consider whether the  work  of	 the
probationer  is satisfactory or whether he is  suitable	 for
the  post.   In	 the  absence  of  any	Rules  governing   a
probationer  in this respect the authority may come  to	 the
conclusion that on account of inadequacy for the job or	 for
any  temperamental  or	other  object  not  involving  moral
turpitude  the	probationer is unsuitable for  the  job	 and
hence  must  be discharged.  No punishment is  involved,  in
this.	The authority may in some cases be of the view	that
the  conduct of the probationer may result in  dismissal  or
removal on an inquiry.	But in those cases the authority may
not hold an inquiry and may simply discharge the probationer
with  a	 view to giving him a chance to make good  in  other
walks of life without a stigma at the time of termination of
probation.  If, on the other hand,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">838</span>
the  probationer  is  faced with an enquiry  on	 charges  of
misconduct  or	inefficiency  or  corruption,  and  if	 his
services are terminated without following the provisions  of
<a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_206">Article	 311(2)</a>	 he can claim protection.  In  Gopi  Kishore
Prasad	v. Union of India A.I.R. 1960 S.C. 689 it  was	said
that if the Government proceeded against the probationer  in
the direct way without casting any aspersion on his  honesty
or  competence, his discharge would not have the  effect  of
removal	 by way of punishment.	Instead of taking  the	easy
course	the  Government	 chose the  more  difficult  one  of
starting  proceedings  against	him and branding  him  as  a
dishonest and imcompetent officer.
</p><p id="p_56">The  fact  of holding an inquiry is not	 always	 conclusive.
What  is decisive is whether the order is really by  way  of
punishment.  (See State of Orissa v. Ramnarain Das [1961]  1
S.C.R.	606).	If  there  is  an  enquiry  the	 facts	 and
circumstances  of the case will be looked into in  order  to
find out whether the order is one of dismissal in substance,
(<a href="/doc/1984082/" id="a_207">See  Madan Gopal v. State of Punjab</a> [1963] 3  S.C.R.  716).
In R. C. Lacy v. State of Bihar &amp; Ors. (Civil Appeal No. 590
of  1962  decided on 23 October, 1963) it was held  that  an
order	of  reversion passed following an enquiry  into	 the
conduct of the probationer in the circumstances of that case
was  in	 the  nature of preliminary inquiry  to	 enable	 the
Government  to decide whether disciplinary action should  be
taken.	 A probationer whose terms of service provided	that
it  could be terminated without any notice and	without	 any
cause  being  assigned	could not claim	 the  protection  of
<a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_208">Article	 311  (2).</a>  (See R. C. Banerjee v.  Union  of  India
[1964] 2 S.C.R. 135.) A preliminary inquiry to satisfy	that
there  was  reason  to	dispense  with	the  services  of  a
temporary employee has been held not to attract Artiele	 311
(<a href="/doc/1237844/" id="a_209">See  Champaklal G. Shah v. Union of India</a> [1964]  5  S.C.R.
</p><p id="p_57">190).	On  the	 other hand, a statement  in  the  order  of
termination  that the temporary servant is  undesirable	 has
been  held to import an element of punishment  (<a href="/doc/656567/" id="a_210">See  Jagdish
Mitter v. Union of India</a> A.I.R. 1964 S.C. 449).
If the facts and circumstances of the case indicate that the
substance of the order is that the termination is by way  of
punishment then a probationer is entitled to attract Article
</p><p id="p_58">311.   The substance of the order and not the form would  be
decisive. (<a href="/doc/1204018/" id="a_211">See K. H. Phadnis v. State of Maharashtra</a>  [1971]
Supp.  S.C.R. 118).
</p><p id="p_59">An order terminating the services of a temporary servant  or
probationer  under  the	 Rules	of  Employment	and  without

State of Bihar v. Shiva Bhikshik</a> [1971] 2 S.C.R. 191).
The  appellant	Ishwar	Chand  Agarwal	contended  that	  he
completed  his initial period of two years' probation on  11
November,  1967	 and  the maximum  period  of  three  years'
probation  on  11 November, 1968 and by reason of  the	fact
that he continued in service after the expiry
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">839</span>
of the maximum period of probation he became confirmed.	 The
appellant also contended that he had a right to be confirmed
and  there  was	 a permanent vacancy in	 the  cadre  of	 the
service on 17 September, 1969 and the same should have	been
allotted to him.
</p><p id="p_60">Rule 7(1) states that every Subordinate Judge, in the  first
instance,  be appointed on probation for two years but	this
period	may  be	 extended from time  to	 time  expressly  or
impliedly  so that the total period of	probation  including
extension,  if	any,  does  not	 exceed	 three	years.	 The
explanation  to	 Rule 7(1) is that the period  of  probation
shall be deemed to have been extended if a Subordinate Judge
is not confirmed on the expiry of his period of probation.
Counsel	 for  the appellant relied on the decision  of	this
Court  in <a href="/doc/1662853/" id="a_215">State of Punjab v. Dharam Singh</a> [1968] 3 S.C.R.  1
where this Court drew an inference that an employee  allowed
to continue in the post on completion of the maximum  period
of  probation is confirmed in the post by  implication.	  In
Dharam	Singh's case (supra) the relevant rule	stated	that
the probation in the first instance is for one year with the
proviso	 that  the total period of probation  including	 ex-
tension	 shall	not exceed three years.	 In  Dharam  Singh's
case (supra) he was allowed to-continue without an order  of
confirmation  and  therefore the only possible view  in	 the
absence of anything to the contrary in the Service Rules was
that by necessary implication he must be regarded as  having
been confirmed.
</p><p id="p_61">Any confirmation by implication is negatived in the  present
case  because before the completion of three years the	High
Court found prima facie that the work as well as the conduct
of  the appellant was unsatisfactory and a notice was  given
to the appellant on 4 October, 1968 to show cause as to	 why
his services should not be terminated.	Furthermore, Rule  9
shows  that the employment of a probationer can be  proposed
to be terminated whether during or at the end of the  period
of probation.  This indicates that where the notice is given
at  the	 end of the probation the period of  probation	gets
extended  till	the  inquiry proceedings  commenced  by	 the
notice under Rule 9 come to an end.  In this background	 the
explanation to rule 7(1) shows that the period of  probation
shall  be  deemed  to  have been  extended  impliedly  if  a
Subordinate  Judge  is not confirmed on the expiry  of	this
period	of  probation.	 This  implied	extension  where   a
Subordinate  Judge  is not confirmed on the  expiry  of	 the
period	of  probation is not found in  Dharam  Singh's	case
(supra).  This explanation in the present case does not mean
that  the  implied extension of the probationary  period  is
only  between two and three years.  The explanation  on	 the
contrary  means	 that the provision  regarding	the  maximum
period	of probation for three years is I directly  and	 not
mandatory  unlike in Dharam Singh's case (supra) and that  a
probationer  is	 not  in fact confirmed	 till  an  order  of
confirmation is made.
</p><p id="p_62">In this context reference may be made to the proviso to Rule
7(3).  The proviso to the Rule states that the completion of
the  maximum  period  of three years'  probation  would	 not
confer on him the right to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">840</span>
be confirmed till there is a permanent vacancy in the cadre.
Rule  7 (3) states that an express order of confirmation  is
necessary.  The proviso to Rule 7(3) is in the negative form
that  the  completion of the maximum period of	three  years
would  not  confer a right of confirmation till there  is  a
permanent vacancy in the cadre.	 The period of probation  is
therefore extended by implication until the proceedings com-
menced	 against  a  probationer  like	the  appellant	 are
concluded  to  enable  the Government to  decide  whether  a
probationer  should be confirmed or his services  should  be
terminated.  No confirmation by implication can arise in the
present	 case in the facts and circumstances as also by	 the
meaning and operation of Rules 7(1) and 7(3) as aforesaid.
 It  is	 necessary  at this stage to  refer  to	 the  second
proviso	 to  Rule  7(3)	 which came  into  existence  on  19
November,  1970.  That proviso of course does not  apply  to
the facts of the present case.	That proviso states that  if
the  report of the High Court regarding	 the  unsatisfactory
work  or conduct of the probationer is made to the  Governor
before	the  expiry  of the  maximum  period  of  probation,
further	 proceedings in the matter may be taken	 and  orders
passed	by  the	 Governor  of  Punjab  dispensing  with	 his
services or reverting him to his substantive post even after
the  expiry of the maximum period of probation.	 The  second
proviso	 makes explicit which is implicit in Rule  7(1)	 and
Rule  7(3) that the period of probation gets  extended	till
the  proceedings  commenced  by the notice come	 to  an	 end
either by confirmation or discharge of the probationer.
In  the	 present case, no confirmation	by  implication	 can
arise  by  reason  of the notice to show cause	given  on  4
October,  1968, the enquiry by the Director of Vigilance  to
enquire into allegations and the operation of Rule 7 of	 the
Service Rules that the probation shall be extended impliedly
if a Subordinate Judge is not confirmed before the expiry of
the  period of probation.  Inasmuch as Ishwar Chand  Agarwal
was not confirmed at the end of the period of probation con-
firmation by implication is nullified.
</p><p id="p_63">The second contention on behalf of Ishwar Chand Agarwal	 was
that  the termination is by way of punishment.	It was	said
to  be an order removing the appellant from service  on	 the
basis  of  charges of gross misconduct by  ex-parte  enquiry
conducted by the Vigilance Department.	The enquiry was said
to be in breach of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_216">Article 311</a> as also in violation of rules
of natural justice.  The appellant relied on Rule 9 to	show
that  he was not only entitled to know the grounds but	also
to  an opportunity to represent as a condition precedent  to
any  such termination.	The appellant put in  the  forefront
that  the  termination	of his services	 was  based  on	 the
findings  of  the Vigilance Department which  went  into  15
allegations  of misconduct contained in about  8  complaints
and these were never communicated to him.
</p><p id="p_64">The High Court under <a href="/doc/1345754/" id="a_217">Article 235</a> is vested with the  control
of  subordinate judiciary.  The High Court according to	 the
appellant  failed to act in terms of the provisions  of	 the
Constitution  and  abdicated the control by  not  having  an
inquiry through Judicial Officers
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">841</span>
subordinate to the Control of the High Court but asking	 the
Government to enquire through the Vigilance Department.
It  was	 submitted on behalf of the State that	the  enquiry
suggested  by  the  High  Court	 through  the  Director	  of
Vigilance was not to satisfy itself about the  unsuitability
of  the	 appellant but to satisfy the  Government  that	 the
recommendation	which  had already been made  by,  the	High
Court  for  the termination of the service of  Ishwar  Chand
Agarwal should be accepted.
</p><p id="p_65">The  High Court for reasons which are not  stated  requested
the  Government to depute the Director of Vigilance to	hold
an enquiry.  It is indeed strange that the High Court  which
had  control  over  the	 subordinate  judiciary	 asked	 the
Government   to	 hold  an  enquiry  through  the   Vigilance
Department.   The members of the subordinate  judiciary	 are
not  only under the control of the High Court but  are	also
under  the  care and custody of the High  Court.   The	High
Court  failed  to  discharge  the  duty	 of  preserving	 its
control.  The request by the High Court to have the  enquiry
through	 the  Director	of  Vigilance was  an  act  of	self
abnegations.   The  contention of the State  that  the	High
Court  wanted the Government to be satisfied  makes  matters
worse  The  Governor will act on the recommendation  of	 the
High  Court.  That is the broad basis of <a href="/doc/1345754/" id="a_218">Article  235.</a>	 The
High  Court  should have conducted  the	 enquiry  preferably
through	 District  Judges.  The members of  the	 subordinate
Judiciary look up to the High Court not only for  discipline
but  also for dignity.	The High Court acted in	 total	dis-
regard	of Articles 235 by asking the Government to  enquire
through the Director of Vigilance.
</p><p id="p_66">The  enquiry officer nominated by the Director of  Vigilance
recorded the statements of the witnesses behind the back  of
the  appellant.	 The enquiry was to ascertain the  truth  of
allegations  of	 misconduct.   Neither the  report  nor	 the
statements  recorded  by  the Enquiry  Officer	reached	 the
appellant.  The Enquiry Officer gave his finding,; on  alle-
gations of misconduct. The High Court accepted the report of
the Enquiry Officer and wrote to the Government on 25  June,
1969 that in the light of the report the appellant was not a
suitable  person  to be retained in service.  The  order  of
termination  was  because  of  the  recommendations  in	 the
report.
</p><p id="p_67">The  order  of termination of the services of  Ishwar  Chand
Agarwal	 is  clearly by way of punishment in the  facts	 and
circumstances  of the case.  The High Court not only  denied
Ishwar	Chand Agarwal the, protection under <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_219">Article 311</a>	 but
also   denied	itself	the  dignified	control	  over	 the
subordinate  Judiciary.	  The  form  of	 the  order  is	 not
decisive  as to whether the order is by way  of	 punishment.
Even an innocuously worded order terminating the service may
in the facts and circumstances of the case establish that an
enquiry	 into allegations of serious and grave character  of
misconduct involving stigma has been made ill infarction  of
the  provision	of  Article  Ill.   In	such   a  case	file
simplicity  of	the  form of the order	will  not  give	 any
sanctity.  That is exactly
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">842</span>
what has happened in the case of Ishwar Chand Agarwal.	 The
Order of termination is illegal and must be set aside.
The appellant Samsher Singh was appointed on 1 May, 1964- as
Subordinate Judge.  He was on probation.  On 22 March,	1967
the  Chief  Secretary issued a notice to  him  substantially
repeating  the same charges which had been  communicated  by
the  Registrar on 15 December, 1966 and asked the  appellant
to show cause a to why his services should not be terminated
as he was found unsuitable for the job.	 The appellant	gave
an answer.  On 29 April, 1967 the services of the  appellant
were terminated.
</p><p id="p_68">The appellant Shamsher Singh in the context of the Rules  of
Business  contended that the removal of a Subordinate  Judge
from  Service  is a personal power of the  Governor  and  is
incapable  of being delegated or dealt with under the  Rules
of  Business.	We have already held that the  Governor	 can
allocate the business of the Government to the Ministers and
such  allocation is no delegation and it is an	exercise  of
executive power by the Governor through the Council or Offi-
cers  under  the Rules of Business.  The contention  of	 the
appellant  that the order was passed by the  Chief  Minister
without	 the formal approval of the Governor is,  therefore,
untenable.  The order is the order of the Governor.
The appellant was asked to show cause as to why his services
should not be terminated.  There were four grounds.  One was
that  the  appellant's	behavior towards  the  Bar  and	 the
litigant  public was highly objectionable  derogatory,	non-
cooperative  and  unbecoming  of a  judicial  officer.	 The
second was that the appellant would leave his office  early.
The  third  was	 the complaint of  Om  Prakash,	 Agriculture
Inspector   that  the  appellant  abused  his  position	  by
proclaiming that he would get Om Prakash involved in a	case
if  he did not cooperate with Mangal Singh, a friend of	 the
appellant  and	Block Development Officer,  Sultanpur.	 The
fourth	was the complaint of Prem Sagar that  the  appellant
did  not  give	full  opportunity  to  Prem  Sagar  to	lead
evidence.  Prem Sagar also complained that the decree-holder
made an application for execution of the decree against Prem
Sagar  and  the appellant without  obtaining  office  report
incorporated  some  additions in the original  judgment	 and
warrant of possession.
</p><p id="p_69">The appellant showed cause.  The appellant said that he	 was
not  provided  with an opportunity to work  under  the	same
superior officer for at least six months so that independent
opinion	 could	be  formed about  his  knowledge,  work	 and
conduct.  On 29 April, 1967 the appellant received a  letter
from the Deputy Secretary to the Government addressed to the
Registrar,  Punjab and Haryana High Court that the  services
of the appellant had been terminated.
</p><p id="p_70">It appears that a mountain has been made out of a mole hill.
The  allegation against the appellant is that he helped	 the
opponent  of  Prem Sagar.  The case against Prem  Sagar	 was
heard  on 17 April, 1965.  Judgment was pronounced the	same
day.   The  application	 for execution	of  the	 decree	 was
entertained on the same day by the appellant.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">843</span>
<p id="p_71">In  the warrant the appellant wrote with his own  hands	 the
words, "Trees, well, crops and other rights attached to	 the
land".	 This correction was made by the appellant in  order
that the warrant might be in conformity with the plaint	 and
the  decree.   There  is nothing  wrong	 in  correcting	 the
warrant	 to make it consistent with the decree.	 It  appears
that  with regard to the complaint of leaving  office  early
and  the complaint of Om Prakash, Agriculture Inspector	 the
appellant was, in fact punished and a punishment of  warning
was inflicted on him.
</p><p id="p_72"> The appellant claimed protection of Rule 9. Rule 9 makes it
incumbent   on	the  authority	that  the  services   of   a
probationer  can  be  terminated on  specific  fault  or  on
account of unsatisfactory record implying unsuitability.  In
the  facts and circumstances of this case it is. clear	that
the order of termination of the appellant Samsher Singh was,
one  of	 punishment.  The authorities were to find  out	 the
suitability  of	 the  appellant.   They	 however   concerned
themselves  with  matters which were  really  trifle.	The-
appellant rightly corrected the records in the case of	Prem
Sagar.	 The appellant did so with his own hand.  The  order
of  termination	 is in infraction of Rule 9.  The  order  of
termination is therefore set aside.
</p><p id="p_73">The appellant Shamsher Singh is now employed in the Ministry
of  law.   No useful purpose will be served  by	 asking	 for
reconsideration	 as  to	 the suitability  of  the  appellant
Samsher	 Singh for confirmation.  If the authorities had  at
the  proper  time been a little more  careful  and  cautious
perhaps	 the appellant might not have left  the	 subordinate
Judicial Service and sought employment elsewhere.
For the foregoing reasons we hold that the President as well
as the Governor acts on the aid and advice of the Council of
Ministers  in  executive action and is not required  by	 the
Constitution to act personally without the aid and advice of
the  Council of Ministers or against the aid and  advice  of
the  Council  of  Ministers.  Where  the  Governor  has	 any
discretion  the	 Governor  acts on his	own  judgment.	 The
Governor  exercises  his  discretion  in  harmony  with	 his
Council of Ministers.  The appointment as well as removal of
the  members  of  the Subordinate  Judicial  Service  is  an
executive action of the Governor to be exercised on the	 aid
and  advice of the Council of Ministers in  accordance	with
the  provisions	 of  the  Constitution.	  Appointments	 and
removals  of  persons  are made by  the	 President  and	 the
Governor as the constitutional head' of the executive on the
aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.  That is why any
action by any servant of the Union or the State in regard to
appointment dismissal is brought against the Union or the Jr
State and not against the President or the Governor.
The orders of termination of the services of the  appellants
are  set  aside.   The appellant  Ishwar  Chand	 Agarwal  is
declared  to  be  a  member  of	 the  Punjab  Civil  Service
(Judicial Branch).  The appellant Samsher Singh succeeds  in
so far as the order of termination is set aside.  In view of
the  fact  that	 Samsher Singh is already  employed  in	 the
Ministry of Law no relief excepting salary or other monetary
benefits  which	 accrued to him upto the  time	he  obtained
employment in the Ministry of Law is given.
The State of Punjab will pay costs to the appellants.

lodestar,  as we search for the true semantics of  terms  of
art used in the Great Charter.
</p><p id="p_80">It is surprising that extreme views have been propounded  by
responsible  jurists on the law of our Constitution  in	 the
strategic sector of the President vis-a-vis his Cabinet	 and
dangerous portents must	 therefore  be	forestalled  by	  an
authoritative  statement of the constitutional	position  by
the apex court. If, in that process, earlier ruling of	this
Court  have to be over-ruled, we may not hesitate to do	 so.
For,  it is truer to our tryst to be ultimately right,	than
to  be consistently wrong, where the constitutional  destiny
of a developing nation	 is  at	 stake.	 In  the  words	  of
Learned Hand,the judiciary's proper representative character
as a complementary organ of the social will' cannot	  be
overlooked.
</p><p id="p_81"> A skeletal projection of the facts on the forensic  screen,
sufficient     to  follow  the	problems  raised  in   these
appeals,  may  now  be made. Two  fresher,,;  in  the  State
judiciary, the appellants, were undergoing their  prescribed
probation. Before the full term set by the rules had   run
out,  the  High Court discovered unsavory conduct  in  these
officers  and, as controlling authority, considered the need
to terminate their  services  on grounds  of  unsuitability.
The  ups and downs of the follow-up action vary in  the	 two
cases.	In one, during the President's rule,  the  Governor,
instead of acting     on the High Court's advice  indicated
that  the  charges  were  vague	 and  a	 fresh	enquiry	  be
held.Thereupon,	 the High Court requested   the Director  of
Vigilance, to  make some investigations which were  actually
carried	 out  by  his  subordinate,  the  Superintendent  of
Police. The Administrative Full Court, however held, on	 the
materials  available, but without a formal  or	full-blooded
enquiry, that on the proved charges the officer's  probation
deserved  to  be terminated for unsuitability. By  then	 the
Council	 of  Ministers	had  come  into	 being	and,  on   a
consideration of the High Court's report, the Chief Minister
acted on it and ended the probation of the officer, although
the  Governor's	 personal satisfaction about this  step	 was
neither sought nor secured. Also, by that time, the  maximum
probation  period of three years, under the relevant  rules,
had  expired and a permanent vacancy had  also	arisen.(This
bears  on another argument about the import of	the  service
Rules.)	 In  the other case also, the High  Court  held	 the
officer unfit
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">846</span>
to be confirmed without any elaborate enquiry and this	view
was accepted by the Chief Minister without reference to	 the
Governor.
</p><p id="p_82">The  orders terminating probation have been challenged on  a
few grounds.  Primarily, the power of appointment being with
the  Governor  (or  the President, in the  case	 of  Central
Services)  the	removal must be by him alone,  the  argument
runs.	Wherever  the Constitution vests a function  in	 the
Governor  or President, as such. it has to be discharged  by
him,  applying	his mind to the materials.  He	can  neither
surrender  to his ministers, nor delegate to  his  officers,
what the Constitution has enjoined shall-be executed by	 him
personally.   Admittedly, in the present case, the  ultimate
order  was made, without reference to the Governor,  by	 the
Chief-Minister who virtually accepted the recommendation  of
the  High  Court.   The learned	 Attorney  General  and	 the
Additional  Solicitor General, have refuted the whole  basis
of this argument.  We have, in the President and Governor, a
replicate   of	a  constitutional  monarch  and	 a   Cabinet
answerable   to	 Parliament,  substantially  embodying	 the
conventions  of	 the  British  Constitution-not	 a  turn-key
project imported from Britain, but an. edifice made in India
with  the  know-how of British Constitutionalism.   If	this
theory	be sound, Government is carried on by the  Ministers
according  to the rules of allocation of business  and,	 the
Governor,  no  more  than the Queen, need  know	 or  approve
orders	issued	in his name.  The core	of  the	 Westminster
system	is that the Queen resigns, but the  Ministers  rule,
except in a few special, though blurred, areas, one of which
certainly  is  not the appointment and	dismissal  of  civil
servants.   The second major contention of Shri Sanghi,	 for
the  appellant, is that the High Court and Government  have,
in  substance, dismissed the probationers and, in doing	 so,
violated  the  constitutional mandate of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_221">Art.  311</a>  and	 the
canons	of  natural justice.  Even on the footing  that	 the
impugned orders are innocuous terminations of probation, the
rules which embody procedural fairness have been flouted the
consequence  being  invalidation.   In	the  course  of	 the
submissions,  some criticism was leveled at the	 High  Court
requesting  the	 Director  of  Vigilance  police  officer-to
investigate  into the veracity of charges  against  judicial
officers.   Thirdly,  has  the	High  Court  the  last	word
regarding  termination	of service  of	judicial  personnel,
Government being a formal agency to implement it?  This	 was
challenged at the bar, although we do not finally deal	with
it,  for  the reasons to be mentioned later.   Other  lesser
illegalities  were relied on, but they have been dealt	with
in the judgment of the learned Chief justice, with which  we
wholly	agree.	We confine ourselves to the  dual  principal
pleas  whose  impact will far exceed  the  nullification  of
orders	by  Ministers removing	judicial  probationers	from
service and deserve careful study.
</p><p id="p_83">The  first broad proposition of the appellants is  that	 the
presidentand   the  Governor-are  not  just   constitutional
cousins	 of the British Queen, but real wielders  of  power,
bestowed on them expressly by the terms of the text,  almost
next  of  kin to their American	 counterparts  with  similar
designations.	 The  issue  is	 so  fundamental  that	 its
resolution  is necessary to know not only who can declare  a
probationer's fitness but who can declare a war in  national
defence or proclaim
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">847</span>
a breakdown of the State constitutional machinery or  assent
to a bill passed by Parliament.	 For, if under <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_222">Art. 311</a>	 the
President  must	 be personally satisfied for  certain  small
steps,	he must surely be individually	convinced  regarding
the  far more momentous spectrum of functions he  is  called
upon  to  discharge under a big bunch of  other	 provisions.
And  this  reasoning  regarding	 disposal  of  gubernatorial
business  or.  discharge of official  responsibilities	will
equally apply to Governors.
</p><p id="p_84">A sort of constitutional mini-crisis has been sparked off by
the  decision  in Sardarilal's Case(1)	which  regarded	 the
President's  personal satisfaction for dispensing,  with  an
enquiry,  for reasons of security of the State under  clause
</p><p id="p_85">(c)of  the  proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_223">Art. 311(2)</a> of the  Constitution,  as
necessary  and	non-delegable.	We will	 presently  project,
with   reference   to	the   Articles,	  the	rainbow	  of
administrative,	  quasi-judicial   and	 legislative   tasks
specifically directed by the Constitution to be performed by
the Head of the State in contradistinction to his Council of
Ministers,  if the appellant's proposition were sound,	thus
bringing   dyarchy  by	a  side	 wind,	as  it	 were,	 and
emasculating the plenary authority of Parliament to whom the
President   is	 not  but  the	Council	 of   Ministers	  is
responsible.	The  peril  to	the  Westminster  model	  of
government is self-evident and serious if vital business  of
government  is to be transacted de facto and de jury by	 the
head of the State, and the Ministers, who are responsible to
the  House consisting of the elected representative  of	 the
people,	  arc  to  be  relegated  to  carrying	on  of	 the
administration	only, subject to the  over-riding  presence,
pleasure and powers of their uncrown republican King.-
This  dilemma  of democracy, created by a spreadout  of	 the
rationale of Sardarilal(1), can be resolved only by a  study
in depth of the political perspective and philosophy and  of
the conspectus of provisions, as well as an understanding of
the models which influenced the Constitution framers.	What
are  the basic fabric, the animating spirit,  and  juridical
ideas of our constitutional structure and dynamics ?
The law of our Constitution, any student of Indian political
history	 and  of  comparative  constitutional  systems	will
agree,	is  partly eclectic but	 primarily  an	Indo-Anglian
version	  of  the  Westminster	model	with   quasi-federal
adaptations,	historical    modifications,	geopolitical
mutations andhomespun traditions-basically a blended brew of
the  British  parliamentary system, and	 the  Government  of
India Act, 1935 and near-American, nomenclature-wise and  in
some other respects.

<p id="p_88">Draft Constitution, in support.	 Several pages from the many
volumes of the Constituent Assembly debates were read at the
Bar and the keynote thought in the lengthy deliberations has
been given by Granville Austin in these words :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">	      "in  the	rapidly	 moving world  of  the	mid-
	      twentieth century, a new India had to be built
	      almost overnight.	 How was the leadership	 for
	      this  task  to  be  provided?   What  type  of
	      Executive would be stable, strong,  effective,
	      and quick, yet withal, democratic ?
	      The Assembly chose a slightly modified version
	      of  the British cabinet system.  India was  to
	      have  a  President, indirectly elected  for  a
	      term   of	  five	years,	who   would   be   a
	      constitutional head of State in the manner  of
	      the  monarch in England. As in England,  there
	      was  to be a council of ministers,  headed  by
	      the    Prime   Minister	 and	collectively
	      responsible  to Parliament, to aid and  advise
	      the  head of State.  The President was  to  be
	      nominal  head  of	 the  Executive;  the  Prime
	      Minister the real head."
</blockquote><p id="p_89">Nehru,	 Patel,	  Munshi,  Sir	B.N.   Rao,.	Sir   Alladi
Krishnaswamy  Aiyar  and, above all, Dr. Ambedkar,  who	 was
Chairman of the Drafting Committee, spoke in one voice, with
marginal  variations  on  points  immaterial  to  our  major
purpose.   What	 emerges  from such a study  is	 that,	with
minimal innovations, a Parliamentary-style  quasi-federalism
was  accepted,	rejecting the substance of  a  Presidential-
style	executive.   This  welding  of	 statesmanship	 and
scholarship   and   willingness	 to  borrow   whatever	 was
beneficial  resulted in a constitutional college  where	 the
Westminster  symbols,  backed  by  Indian  experience,	were
reverentially  preserved  and  the  pattern  of	 ministerial
responsibility	was  built  into the  framework	 of  federal
republicanism.	While the shopping list of Constitutions was
large,	our  founders' selectivity narrowed it down  to	 the
Constitutions  of  Commonwealth	 countries.   Also   British
export of Cabinet Government had been made Swadeshi by	past
experience.  Ill-assorted excerpts from the speeches of	 the
activists make for marvelous unanimity on the Cabinet form.
Prime  Minister Nehru explained the position with  political
clarity	 when moving the clause relating to the election  of
the President:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">	      'One  thing  we  have to decide  at  the	very
	      beginning	 is  what  should  be  the  kind  of
	      governmental  structure,	whether	 it  is	 one
	      system	where	 there	  is	 ministerial
	      responsibility   or   whether   it   is	 the
	      Presidential system as prevails in the  United
	      States  of America; many members	possibly  at
	      first  sight  might object  to  this  indirect
	      election	and may prefer an election by  adult
	      suffrage.	  We have given anxious	 thought  to
	      this  matter and we came to the very  definite
	      conclusion  that	it would not  be  desirable,
	      first   because  we  want	 to  emphasize	 the
	      ministerial character of the government,	that
	      power  really resided in the Ministry  and  in
	      the  Legislature and not in the  President  as
	      such.   At  the same time we did not  want  to
	      make the President just a mere figurehead like
	      the French President.  We did not give
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">	      849</span>
	      him  any	real  power but	 we  have  made	 his
	      position	one of great authority and  dignity.
	      You  will notice from this Draft	Constitution
	      that  he is also to be  Commander-in-Chief  of
	      the  Defence  Forces  just  as  the   American
	      President	 is.   Now, therefore if we  had  an
	      election	by adult franchise and yet  did	 not
	      give  him	 any real powers,  it  might  become
	      slightly	anomalous  and there might  be	just
	      extraordinary  expense of time and energy	 and
	      money without any adequate result."
	      His opposition to a fixed tenure for Ministers
	      stemmed from the same ground :
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">	      "That raises a very fundamental issue of	what
	      form   you   are	going  to   give   to	your

	      type  or	the American type.  So far  we	have

	      during  the  last	 one  hundred  years  Indian

	      not   working   as   well	  as   the   British

	      from    the   legislature.    The	   strongest
	      Government and the most elastic Executive have
	      been  found  to  be in  England  and  that  is
	      because  the  executive  powers  vest  in	 the
	      Cabinet  supported by a majority in the  Lower
	      House  which  has financial powers  under	 the

	      advises  the  Head of the State,	namely,	 the
	      King  or	the  President.	 The  Kind,  or	 the

</blockquote><p id="p_90">B.   N. Rau's preliminary note suggested that the  President
be  clothed  with some discretionary powers, but  the  Union
Constitution   Committee-early	 in   June   1947   "decided
unreservedly   in  favour  of  the  parliamentary  type	  of
government  in	which the President would  have	 no  special
powers	vested personally in him but would exercise all	 his
functions, including the dissolution of the lower chamber of
Parliament, only on the advice of his Ministers."
The  deletion of the earlier proposal for an  Instrument  of
Instructions,  has  been mentioned in this context  by	some
writers,  but  the  reason for dropping it was	set  out  by
Alladi Krishnaswamy Ayyar in the Assembly thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">	      "It  was provided in the Constitution...	that

	      would   be   guilty  of	violation   of	 the
	      Constitution and would even be liable for	 im-

	      euphemistic  way of saying that the  President
	      had  to  be  guided  by  the  advice  of	 his
	      Ministers.   The	Council	 of  Ministers	 was
	      collectively  responsible to the House of	 the
	      People,  answerable to the House in regard  to
	      the  budget,  all legislation and	 indeed	 for
	      every matter connected with the administration
	      of  the  country.	  There	 was  therefore	  no
	      necessity	 for  setting out in  detail  in  an
	      article of the Constitution what the functions
	      and incidents of responsible government  would
	      be."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_15">	      On another occasion he reiterated
	      "the  Union  Constitution Committee  and	this
	      Assembly	have all adopted what may be  called
	      the  Cabinet System of Government. "An  infant
	      democracy	   cannot   afford   under    modern
	      conditions,  to  take the	 risk  of  perpetual
	      cleavage,	 feud,	or conflict,  or  threatened
	      conflict	between	 the  Legislature  and	 the
	      executive."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">	      Dr.    Ambedkar's	  comprehensive	   statement
	      introducing the Draft Constitution on November
	      4, 1948, is scintillating.  He said :
	      "In the Draft Constitution there is placed  at
	      the head of the Indian Union a functionary who
	      is  called  the President of the	Union.	 The
	      title  of this functionary reminds one of	 the
	      Presiden	to  the United States.	 But  beyond
	      identity	of names there is nothing in  common
	      between  the form of government  prevalent  in
	      America  and the form of	government  proposed
	      under the Draft Constitution.  Under the Draft
	      Constitution  the President occupies the	same
	      position as the King under the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">	       851</span>
	      English  Constitution.  He is the head of	 the
	      State  but not the executive.   He  represents
	      the  nation but does not rule the nation.	  He
	      is the symbol of the nation.  His place in the
	      administration is that of a ceremonial  device
	      on a seal by which the nation's decisions	 are
	      made  known.  Under the American	Constitution
	      the  President  has under him  Secretaries  in
	      charge  of  different  Departments.   In	like
	      manner the President of the Indian Union	will
	      have   under  him	 Ministers  in	 charge	  of
	      different departments of administration.	Here
	      again   there  is	 a  fundamental	  difference
	      between the two.	The President of the  United
	      States  is  not  bound to	 accept	 any  advice
	      tendered	to  him by any of  his	Secretaries.
	      The  President  of the Indian  Union  will  be
	      generally	  bound	  by  the  advice   of	 his
	      Ministers.   He  can do  nothing	contrary  to
	      their  advice nor can he do  anything  without
	      their  advice.   The President of	 the  United
	      States can dismiss any Secretary at any  time.
	      The President of the Indian Union has no power
	      to  do so so long as his Ministers  command  a
	      majority in Parliament.

	      In  England,  where the  Parliamentary  system
	      evails,  the assessment of  responsibility  of
	      the executive is both daily and periodic.	 The
	      daily assessment is done by members of Parlia-
	      ment,  through  questions,  resolutions,	 no-

	      done  by	the electorate at the  time  of	 the
	      election which may take place every five years
	      or   earlier.    The   daily   assessment	  of
	      responsibility  which is not  available  under
	      the  American system is, it is felt, far	more
	      effective than the periodic assessment and far
	      more  necessary in a country like India.	 The
	      Draft   Constitution   in	  recommending	 the

</blockquote><p id="p_93">  "  It	 has been mentioned that  one  of  the
	      chief defects of this Constitution is that  we
	      have not anywhere mentioned that the President
	      is a constitutional head and the future of the
	      President's powers is, therefore,	 doubtful...
	      This  is a matter which has been	examined  by
	      the  Drafting Committee to some  extent.	 The
	      position	of  the President in  a	 responsible
	      government is not the same as the position  of
	      the    President	 under	 a    representative
	      Government like America and that is a  mistake
	      that a number of people in the House have been
	      making, when they said that the President will
	      be an autocrat, and no one appears to  realize
	      that the President has to act on the advice of
	      the Prime Minister. So far as the relationship
	      of   the	 President  with  the	Cabinet	  is
	      concerned, I must say that we have, so to say,
	      completely  copied the system  of	 responsible
	      government  that	is  functioning	 in  Britain
	      today;  we have made no deviation from it	 and
	      the deviations that we have made are only such
	      as  are necessary because our Constitution  is
	      federal in structure."
</p><p id="p_94">	      Participating   in   the	 same	 discussion,
	      President Rajendra prasad said
	      "We  have had to reconcile the position of  an
	      elected President with an elected legislature,
	      and in doing so, we have adopted more or less,
	      the  position of the British monarch  for	 the
	      President.   I.Es	 position  is  that   of   a
	      constitutional President.	 Then we come to the
	      Ministers.   They are, of course,	 responsible
	      to  the Legislature and tender advice  to	 the
	      President	 who  is bound to act  according  to
	      that  advice.  Although there are no  specific
	      provisions,   so	far  as	 I  know,   in	 the
	      Constitution  itself making it binding on	 the
	      President	  to  accept  the  advice   of	 his
	      Ministers,  it  is hoped that  the  convention
	      under which in England the King acts always on
	      the   advice   of	 his   Ministers   will	  be
	      established  in  this  country  also  and	 the
	      President.  not  so  much on  account  of	 the
	      written  word-in	the Constitution, but  as  a
	      result  of this very healthy convention,	will
	      become  a	 constitutional	 President  in	 all
	      matters."

	      "It is the Prime Minister's business, with the

	      and  the	President may be permitted  now	 and

	      which is the result of conventions."
</blockquote><p id="p_97">If  the	 inner	voice' of the founding fathers	may  be	 any
guide,	it  is	proved	beyond	reasonable  doubt  that	 the
President and, a fortiori, the Governor, enjoy nothing	more
and  nothing less than the status. of a constitutional	head
in  a Cabinet-type governments few exceptions  and  marginal
reservations apart.
</p><p id="p_98">We must however notice that a strong current of	 high-placcd
scholarship has expressed itself in the opposite  direction.
For instance, Mr. K.M. Munshi, the author, has gone back  on
his thesis as framer.  He writes in The President under	 the
Indian	Constitution' that the President is  an	 independent
organ  of  the	State  representing  the  whole	 Union	 and
exercising independent powers' and reads cur Constitution as
a composite one in which the Parliamentary form of executive
and  a	President with power and  authority  are  combined'.
Why?   To prevent a parliamentary government  from  becoming
parliamentary	anarchy.'  Indeed,  he	has   regarded	 the
importation  of	 English  inventions  as  tantamount  to  an
amendment of the Constitution'.	 The election of  President,
his  oath of office, his specific powers and his  obligation
to prevent Cabinet dictatorship, have been marshaled by this
respected  statesman.	He  has climaxed  his  reasoning  by
taking	the  view that aid and advice' in <a href="/doc/127060/" id="a_227">Art.	74</a>,  do	 not
imply  that the advice must be accepted in all cases.	Shri
K.  Santhanam,	another cider statesman,  also	shares	this
view.	Even  Dr. Rajendra Prasad is reported  to  have	 had
second thoughts on the denudation of Presidential powers (p.
141, The Constitution of India-How it has been framed-Pratap
Kumar Ghosh).  This interpretative volte fsce may be due  to
disillusionment; for, Shri Munshi has plainly stated :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_30">	      "During  the framing of the  Constitution,  we
	      all dreamt that
	      we  would	 make  a  success  of  parliamentary
	      democracy and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">	      855</span>
	      the  British  Cabinet  system.   It  must	  be
	      confessed that this experiment has failed.  If
	      I had to make a choice again, I would vote for
	      the Presidential form of Government, so  that,
	      whenever	the  politicians fail  the  country,
	      there  is	 at least one strong  organ  of	 the
	      State capable of tiding over the crisis."
</blockquote><p id="p_99">In  the field of legal interpretation, is wish to be  father
to the thought?
</p><p id="p_100">Similarly, Mr. Justice P.B. Mukherjea and Mr. Justice Ismail
have  argued that the Rashtrapati is more than	the  British
Crown, that he reigns and rules and is not a faint  presence
like a full moon at mid-day, but queen of the Constitutional
sky.  We will briefly examine the arguments which have	been
set  forth  to	substantiate  the  thesis  that	 while	 the
initiative  to deal with all matters of policy will be	with
the Cabinet and the Prime Minister, the final decision shall
be  such that the President can give his assent with  honour
and  self respect' [quoted from p. 98 of (1) supra].   After
bewailing  how when unconcealed opportunism reigns  supreme,
when principles are thrown to the winds in favour of  office
and  power,  when  ideologies are given the  go-by  for	 the
temporary  advantage of gaining and gathering votes  on	 the
basis  of  catchy  slogans,  when  self-interest  and  petty
considerations	prevail over national interest and  when  an
object of immediate gain gets ascendancy over the  permanent
and  paramount object of bringing into existence  a  healthy
and  contented society assured of the basic requirements  of
life,  there  can  be no guarantee  against  perversion	 and
subversion of any Constitution howsoever perfectly it  might
have  been  drawn up', the learned jurist-judge	 states	 his
sequitur :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_31">	      "In view of all these aspects. my view is that
	      the Constitution has not imposed on obligation
	      either on the President or on the Governors to
	      act  in  accordance  with the  advice  of	 the
	      Council of Ministers in ill matters and  under
	      all circumstances and they have got a  certain
	      amount of discretion in the matter of preserv-
	      ing, protecting and defending the Constitution
	      and  devoting  themselves to the	service	 and
	      well-being of the people of India,  overriding
	      the  temporary advantages sought to be  gained
	      by any particular party in power for the	time
	      being."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_32">	      Shri P.B. Mukherjea, in his Chimanlal Setalvad
	      Lectures, has propounded the thesis that-
	      "These constitutional features and  provisions
	      are   not	  mere	pious	wishes	 devoid	  of
	      constitutional  and legal substance,  but	 are
	      specific	tenets of the  Indian  Constitution.
	      Their  wisdom  lies  in  the  fact  that	 the
	      President	 is a Constitutional  and  effective
	      check on Cabinet dictatorship, flowing out  of
	      the   overwhelming   strength  of	  a   single
	      political	  party	  without   any	   effective
	      opposition.

	      the  constitutional  provisions  it  has	been

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">	      856</span>

</blockquote><p id="p_101">Which means that the President and Governor actually  govern
and the Council of Ministers live up to their name by merely
tendering advice in a take it or leave it' spirit.  It is at
once,  difficult and dangerous to enshrine  the	 personality
cult  in  a Republican Constitution and	 emasculate  Cabinet
Government into a cabal of counselors.	It is easier for one
person	dressed	 in omnipotent authority and  answerable  to
none  to misuse power or for a collective body,	 exposed  to
opposition frequently and diversely and obligated to command
the  confidence of a Parliament of elected  representatives?
Is  it	not straining at a gnat and  swallowing	 the  camel?
Those who are critical of popular Government being perverted
by   party  rais-rule  may  argue  for	a  change   in	 the
Constitution  if  they	have a case,  but  cannot  miss	 the
meaning	 of  the  organic law as it is,	 enacted  wisely  or
foolishly,  but with eyes open, on the basic fabric  of	 the
Westminster  model.  Nor can constitutional construction  be
deflected from its natural role of gathering the intendment,
by an elitist touch reminiscent of imperial argument against
Indian	 aspiration   for  Poorna  Swaraj.    Here   is	  an
introductory passage by Shri Ismail on the subject :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_34">	      "Certainly  it  cannot be said that,  in	this
	      connection,  there  is  either  similarity  or
	      identity between England and India.  In India,
	      with  its vast illiteracy and  ignorance,	 the
	      traditions   of  the   British   Parliamentary
	      democracy	 will  take a long time	 to  acquire
	      effective	  acceptance  or  find	useful	 and
	      beneficial adoption.  The history of India has
	      been   characterized   only   by	  benevolent
	      monarchical   traditions	 and  not   by	 any
	      completely  popular  democratic  institutions.
	      The  temperament	and emotions of	 the  Indian
	      people  have been attuned only to such  insti-
	      tutions  and  they  will	have  to   gradually
	      acclimatize  themselves to a total  democratic
	      tradition,"
</blockquote><p id="p_102">This  attitude may give insight into why the  conclusion  he
has drawn has been reached.
</p><p id="p_103">it  is	argued	that the President's action  is	 beyond	 the
scrutiny of the Court to know if it is based on	 Ministerial
advice.	  Even so, the fact that Courts cannot enquire	into
whether	 any and, if so, what advice has been given  by	 his
Ministers  to  the  Constitutional head does  not  mean	 the
latter can act as he fancies.  A thing is lawfully done	 not
because a Court can examine it but because it is  sanctioned
by the law.  Many are the ways, e.g. impeachment, censure by
Parliament,  massive protest-in which law is  recognised  by
social organs.	Rights are enforced not by Courts alone	 and
remedies are not the source of right.
</p><p id="p_104">The argument about the oath of office of President to defend
the    Constitution    is   sometimes	put    forward	  by
antiministerialist   advocates.	   Yes,	  he   defends	 the
Constitution not by denying its spiritual essence of Cabinet
responsibility-indeed he subverts it that way-but by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">857</span>
accepting   as	 his  Constitutional   function	  what	 his
responsible'  ministers	 have  decided.	 Can  a	 Judge',  in
fulfillment  of the oath of his office, ignore	all  binding
precedents  and	 decide according to the ad hoc	 dictate  so
this uninformed conscience?  Tribhovandas'Case(1)answers the
point  in the negative.	 If every functionary who takes	 the
oath  by  the Constitution interprets it  according  to	 his
lights,	 this solemn document would be the source  of  chaos
and  collusion and the first casualty would be the  rule  of
law.  Such mischief cannot merit juristic acceptance.
Seervai	  and	other  jurists	take  the  view	  that	 our
Constitution had adopted the English system of parliamentary
executive;  that  the  President  and  the  Governors	were
constitutional	 heads	of  the	 executive  and	 that	real
executive power was vested in the Council of Ministers' (2).
Alexandrovicz has brought out the same point :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_35">	      "The provisions of Chapter I of Part V of	 the
	      Constitution relating to the executive  convey
	      prima facie the impression that the  President
	      of  India, the Head of the State, is also	 the
	      real  head of the Executive, and the  Ministry
	      is only there to aid and to advise him in	 the
	      exercise of his functions.  However, a careful
	      reading  of the Constituent  Assembly  debates
	      and the examination of Constitutional practice
	      in  the  post-independence years	show  beyond
	      doubt that the position is exactly the reverse
	      and  that	 the  President	 is  by	  convention
	      reduced	to  a  more  figurehead	 while	 the
	      Ministry is the real Executive."

in England, he will still have the right to be consulted, to
encourage  an( to Warn'.  Acting on ministerial advice	does
not necessarily mean immediate acceptance of the  Ministry's
first thoughts.	 The President can state all his  objections
to  any proposed course of action and ask his  Ministers  in
Council, if necessary, to reconsider the matter.  It is only
in  the last resort that he must accept their final  advice.
It has been observed that the influence of the Crown-and  of
the House of Lords as well-in England' has grown with  every
curtailment  of its legal powers by convention. or  statute.
A  similar result is likely to follow in India too; for,  as
has  been  well said, "the voice of reason is  more  readily
heard  when. it can persuade but no longer coerce", One	 can
conceive of no better future for the President of India than
that he should be more and more like the Monarch in England,
"eschewing  legal  power,  standing  outside  the  clash  of
parties	 and  gaining in moral	authority."  These.words  of
constitutional wisdom come from one who played a key role in
shaping	 the framework of the Republic and had no  political

Supreme Commander of Forces, he can send for individual army
officers to elicit information about the defence forces.  In
this  case  also,  Shri Setalvad gave his  answer  in  "firm
negative".   Sir Alladi, whose views were also	elicited  by
President  Prasad on the same sensitive issues,	 struck	 the
same note thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_46">	      "In  not	stating in detail the  incidents  of

	      "The  one point which the President misses  in

	      the  same is vested in the Crown	in  England,

A coup can be constitutionally envisioned by an	 erroneously
literal	 interpretation of the living words of	the  Organic
Law.  Prof.  Allen Glendhill, we must warn ourselves, wrote
	      "Let  us	assume	that a	President  has	been
	      elected  who  has successfully  concealed	 his
	      ambition to establish an authoritarian  system
	      of Government.  One-fourth of the members of a

	      danger, give notice of a motion to impeach the
	      President.   Before the fourteen days  with,in
	      which it can be moved, the President dissolves
	      Parliament, a new House must be elected but it
	      need  not meet for six months.   He  dismisses
	      the  Ministers and appoints others of his	 own
	      choice, who for six months need not be Members
	      of  Parliament and during that period  he	 can
	      legislate	 by  Ordinance.	  He  can  issue   a
	      proclamation  of Emergency, legislate  on	 any
	      subject and deprive the States of their shares
	      in  the proceeds of distributable	 taxes.	  He
	      can  issue directions to States calculated  to
	      provoke  disobedience  and  then	suspend	 the
	      States'Constitutions.   He can use  the  armed
	      forces in support of the civil power.  He	 can
	      promulgate preventive detention Ordinances and
	      imprison his opponents."
</p><p id="p_115">	      Again, that learned jurist has commented
	      "The Constitution vests the executive power of
	      the  Union in the President and provides	that
	      all executive action shall
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">	      863</span>
	      be  taken in his name.  The President is	also
	      given  many powers, shortly to  be  discussed,
	      but  the	last fourteen years have  shown	 the
	      world that India is a parliamentary  democracy
	      in which Ministers decide policy and carry  on
	      Government, but the Constitution does not	 say
	      in  as many words that the President must	 act
	      on  ministerial advice; what it says  is	that
	      there  shall be a Council of Ministers to	 aid
	      and advice the President; no court may inquire
	      into the question whether any, and if so what,
	      advice  was tendered to the  President.	What
	      the Constitution contemplates is that normally
	      the  government  shall  be  carried  on  by  a
	      committee	 of  Ministers	selected  from	 the
	      elected representatives of the people, but  it
	      recognizes  that	circumstances may  arise  in
	      which  that  system may break down, so  it  is
	      discrable that there should be some  authority
	      empowered	 to continue the government and	 set
	      about  restoring parliamentary  government  as
	      soon as possible.	 It is for this reason	that
	      the  Constitution legally vests the  executive

	      has  said that the Council of  Ministers	does
	      not  enjoy  the  confidence of  the  House  of

	      more ceremonies; and in their stead a sure and
	      commanding    influence	 of    which	 the
	      constitution, it seems, is totally ignorant."
</blockquote><p id="p_129">In  Blackstone's commentaries on the Laws of  England,	said
Dicey,	 students   might   read   that	  the	Constitution
concentrated  all executive power in the hands of the  King.
The   language	 of   this   passage',	 he   remarked,	  is
impressive......  It has but one fault : the  statements  it
contains are the direct opposite of the truth".'
The President in India is not at all a glorified cipher.  He
represents the majesty of the State, is at the apex,  though
only  symbolically,  and  has rapport with  the	 people	 and
parties, being above politics.	His vigilant presence  makes
for good government if only he uses, what Bagehot  described
as,  the  right	 to be consulted, to  warn  and	 encourage'.
Indeed,	 <a href="/doc/220543/" id="a_258">Art. 78</a> wisely used, keeps the President  in  close
touch  with  the  Prime	 Minister  on  matters	of  national
importance  and policy significance, and there is  no  doubt
that the imprint of his personality may chasten and  correct
the  political government, although the actual	exercise  of
the  functions entrusted to him by law is in effect  and  in
law  carried  on by his duly appointed	mentors.  i.e.,	 the
Prime Minister and his colleagues.  In short, the President,
like   the  King,  has	not  merely  been   constitutionally
romanticized  but  actually  vested  with  a  pervasive	 and
persuasive  role.  Political theorists are quite  conversant
with  the  dynamic role of the Crown which keeps  away	from
politics and power
(1)  AIR 1971 SC 1551.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_46"> 868</span>
<p id="p_130">and yet influences both.  While he plays such a role, he  is
not  a rival centre of power in any sense and must abide  by
and act on the advice tendered by his Ministers except in  a
narrow territory which is sometimes slippery.
Of course, there is some qualitative difference between	 the
position  of  the President and the Governor.	The  former,
under  <a href="/doc/127060/" id="a_259">Art. 74</a> has no discretionary powers; the	 latter	 too
has  none, save in the tiny strips covered by  <a href="/doc/1782200/" id="a_260">Art.  163(2</a><a href="/doc/89891/" id="a_261">),
371</a> A (1)b &amp; (d) 371 A (2)(b) and (f), VI Schedule para 9(2)
(and  VI Schedule para 18(3) _ until omitted  recently	with
effect	from 21-1-1972).  These discretionary  powers  exist
only  where expressly spelt out and even these are not	left
to the sweet will of the Governor but are  remote-controlled
by the Union Ministry which is answerable to Parliament	 for
those  actions.	  Again,  a  minimal  area  centering  round
reports	 to  be dispatched under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_262">Art. 356</a> may  not,  in	 the
nature	of things, be amenable to ministerial  advice.	 The
practice   of  sending	periodical  reports  to	 the   Union
Government is a pre-constitutional one and it is doubtful if
a  Governor  could or should report behind the back  of	 his
Ministers.    For  a  Centrally	  appointed   constitutional
functionary to keep a dossier on his Ministers or to  report
against	 them  or  to take up  public  stances	critical  of
Government policy settled by the cabinet or to interfere  in
the administration directly-these are unconstitutional	faux
pas  and  run counter to parliamentary system.	In  all	 his
constitutional functions' it is the Ministers who act;	only
in the narrow area specifically marked out for discretionary
exercise by the Constitution, he is untrammeled by the State
Ministers'  acts  and advice.  Of course,  a  limited  free-
wheeling is available regarding choice of Chief Minister and
dismissal  of  the  Ministry, as  in  the  English  practice
adapted to Indian conditions.
</p><p id="p_131">Shri Sanghi, counsel for the appellant, adopted an ingenious
argument to get round the holdings of this Court that  India
has accepted the Cabinet form of Government, by urging	that
while the Ministers exercise powers by virtue of  allocation
of business of Government under <a href="/doc/1608494/" id="a_263">Art. 77(3)</a> and have, on	 the
strength  of  <a href="/doc/127060/" id="a_264">Art. 74</a>, the authority to	 discharge  all	 the
functions  of  the head of State, still wherever  the  Cons-
titution  has  expressly vested powers in the  President  by
Governor, they belong to him alone and cannot be handled  on
his  behalf  by	 Ministers  under  the	relevant  Rules	  of
Business.   He	concedes that we cannot	 read  the  Articles
literally  in the context of a Parliamentary  Executive	 but
insists	 on  an exception in the  category  just  mentioned.
Inspiration for this argument comes from Sardarilal (2)	 and
a  few other Cases which do lead countenance to this  rather
extravagant  claim  of	personal  power	 for  President	 and
Governor.    How   ambitious   and   subversive	  such	  an
interpretation	 can  be  to  Parliamentary  (and   popular)
authority  unfolds itself when we survey the wide  range  of
vital powers so enunciated in the Constitution.
The  argument  of  the counsel for  the	 appellant  is	that
wherever  the President is invested with power-and the	same
holds good for the Governor-he is sovereign in his own right
and has to exercise the functions  personally and the orders
of a proxy, even a Minister, cannot do duty for the exercise
of Presidential power.	There is logic in arguing
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47"> 869</span>
that  if, under <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_265">Art. 31 1</a>, the President or  Governor  means
President  or  Governor	 personally.  under  other   similar
Articles  the  rules  of business making  over	exercise  of
functions  to  Ministers  and  officers	 cannot	 be   valid.
Indeed,	 a  whole  host	 of  such  Articles  exist  in	 the
Constitution, most of them very vital for the daily  running
of the administration and embracing executive, emergency and
legislative powers either of a routine or momentous  nature.
The  power to grant pardon or to remit sentence (<a href="/doc/873751/" id="a_266">Art.  161</a>),
the  power  to	make appointments  including  of  the  Chief
Minister  (Art	164), the Advocate General (<a href="/doc/1673997/" id="a_267">Art.  165</a>),	 the
District  Judges  (<a href="/doc/1704953/" id="a_268">Art.	 233</a>), the  Members  of	 the  Public
Service	  Commission  (<a href="/doc/317644/" id="a_269">Art.  316</a>)  are	of  this   category.
Likewise, the power to prorogue either House of	 Legislature
or to dissolve the Legislative Assembly (<a href="/doc/1582504/" id="a_270">Art. 174</a>) the right
to address or send messages to the Houses of the Legislature
(<a href="/doc/1923834/" id="a_271">Art. 175</a> and <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_272">Art.16</a>), the power to assent to Bills or with-
hold   such   assent   (<a href="/doc/1580975/" id="a_273">Art.  200</a>),  the   power   to	make
recommendations for demands of grants (<a href="/doc/1746072/" id="a_274">Art.203(3</a>)), and	 the
duty to cause to be laid every year the annual budget  (Art.
</p><p id="p_132">202), the power to promulgate ordinances during recesses  of
the  Legislature (<a href="/doc/860592/" id="a_275">Art. 213</a>) also belong to this	 species  of
power.	 Again,	 the  obligation to make  available  to	 the
Election Commission the requisite staff for discharging	 the
functions  conferred by <a href="/doc/359300/" id="a_276">Art. 324(1)</a> on the Commission  (<a href="/doc/222870/" id="a_277">Art.
324 (6</a>)), the power to nominate a member of the Anglo-Indian
Community to the Assembly in certain situations (<a href="/doc/37191/" id="a_278">Art.  333</a>),
the  power to authorize the use of Hindi in the	 proceedings
in  the	 High Court (<a href="/doc/639860/" id="a_279">Art. 348(2</a>)), are illustrative  of	 the
functions of the Governor qua Governor.
</p><p id="p_133">Similarly, the President is entrusted with powers and duties
covering  a wide range by the Articles of the  Constitution.
Indeed, he is the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces (Art
53(2)),	 appoints Judges of the Supreme Court and  the	High
Courts and determines the latter's age when dispute  arises,
has power to refer questions for the Advisory opinion of the
Supreme	  Court.(Art  143)  and	 has  power  to	 hold	that
Government  of a State cannot be carried in accordance	with
the  Constitution  (<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_280">Art.  356</a>).	  The  Auditor-General,	 the
Attorney  General,  the	 Governors and the  entire  army  of
public	servants  hold	office during the  pleasure  of	 the
President.   Bills  cannot  become law, even  if  passed  by
Parliament,   without	the   assent   of   the	  President.
Recognizing and derecognising rulers of former native States
of   India  is	a  power  vested  in  the  President.	 The
extraordinary	powers	 of   legislation   by	 Ordinances,
dispensing  with  enquiries against public  servants  before
dismissal,  declaration	 of  emergency	and  imposition	  of
President's  rule  by  proclamation upon  States.  are	vast
powers of profound significance.  Indeed, even the power  of
summoning  and	proroguing and dissolving the House  of	 the
People and returning Bills passed by the Parliament  belongs
to  him.  If only we expand the ratio of Sardarilal (2)	 and
Jayantilal (12) to every function which the various Articles
of the Constitution confer on the President or the Governor,
Parliamentary  democracy  will become a	 dope  and  national
elections  a numerical exercise in expensive  futility.	  We
will  be  compelled  to hold that  there  are  two  parallel
authorities exercising powers of governance of the  country,
as in the dyarchy days, except that Whitehall is substituted
by  Rashtrapati	 Bhavan and Raj Bhawan.	  The  Cabinet	will
shrink	 at  Union  and	 State	levels	in   political	 and
administrative authority and,,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">870</span>
having	solemn	regard	to  the	 gamut	of  his	 powers	 and
responsibilities, the Head of State will be a  reincarnation
of Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India, untroubled by
even  the British Parliament-a little taller in	 power	than
the    American	  President,   Such   a	   distortion,	  by
interpretation, it appears to us, would virtually amount  to
a subversion of the structure, substance and vitality of our
Republic,  particularly when we remember that Governors	 are
but  appointed	functionaries and the President	 himself  is
elected	 on  a limited indirect basis.	As we  have  already
indicated  the	overwhelming catena of authorities  of	this

	      words  he has to be satisfied personally	that
	      in the interest of the security of the  State,
	      it  is  not  expedient  to  hold	the  inquiry
	      prescribed by clause (2).	 In the first place,
	      the general consensus has been that  executive
	      functions	 of  the  nature  entrusted  by	 the
	      Articles,	 some of which have  been  mentioned
	      before  and  in particular those	Articles  in
	      which  the  President  has  to  be   satisfied
	      himself about the existence of certain fact or
	      state of affairs cannot be delegated by him to
	      any  one else.  Secondly even with  regard  to
	      clause(c) of the proviso, there is a
	      specific observation in the passage  extracted
	      above  from the case of Jayantilal  Amrit	 Lal
	      Shodhan that the powers of the President under
	      that provision cannot be delegated.   Thirdly,
	      the  dichotomy  which has.  been	specifically
	      introduced between the authority mentioned  in
	      clause  (b)  and the  President  mentioned  in
	      clause  (c) of the proviso cannot	 be  without
	      significance,    The    Constitution    makers
	      apparently felt that a matter in which the in-
	      terest of the security of the State has to  be
	      considered   should   receive   the   personal
	      attention of the President or the head of	 the
	      State and he should be himself satisfied	that

<p id="p_138">Before jettisoning wholesale the theory of absolute power of
Presidency   we	  must	deal  with  two	 Articles   of	 the
Constitution,  one relating to the determination of the	 age
of High Court Judges [Art 217 (3)] and the other relating to
the  Election  Commission (Art 361) which have come  up	 for
judicial  consideration.   Counsel  for	 the  appellant	 has
relied	on passages from these cases which hark back,  in  a
way,  to the, theory of individual judgment of the  Head  of
State.
</p><p id="p_139"><a href="/doc/1720564/" id="a_305">In  J. P.  Mitter v. Chief Justice, Calcutta</a> (1) this  Court
had  to consider the decision of the Government of India  on
the  age of a Judge of the Calcutta High Court and, in	that
context, had to ascertain the true scope and effect of	<a href="/doc/604649/" id="a_306">Art.
217   (3)</a>  which  clothes  the	President   with   exclusive
jurisdiction  to determine the age of a Judge  finally.	  In

this  decision which was, in due course communicated to	 the
appellant."  When  the	said decision was  attacked  as	 one
reached	 by the Home Minister only and not by the  President
personally, the Court observed:

	      took  was that the Executive was not  entitled
	      to   determine  his  age;	 and  it   must	  be
	      remembered  that this stand was  taken  before
	      <a href="/doc/604649/" id="a_308">Art. 217 (3)</a> was inserted in the Constitution;
	      the  appellant  was undoubtedly  justified  in
	      contending   that	  the  Executive   was	 not
	      competent to determine the question about	 his
	      age because that is a matter which would	have
	      to  be tried normally,in judicial	 proceedings
	      instituted  before  High Courts  of  competent
	      jurisdiction.  There is considerable force  in

	      Executive is allowed to determine the age of a
	      sitting  Judge  of a High	 Court,	 that  would
	      seriously	 affect	 the  independence  of	 the
	      Judiciary itself."
</blockquote><p id="p_140">Based  on this reasoning, the Court quashed the	 order,	 the
ratio  of the case being that the President  himself  should
decide the age of the Judge, uninfluenced by the  Executive,
i.e. by the Minister in charge of the portfolio dealing with
Justice.

the  President himself and not of the Prime Minister or	 the
Home Minister.
</p><p id="p_142">In  the	 light	of the scheme of the  Constitution  we	have

<p id="p_144">the  President	means,	for  all  practical  purposes,	 the
Minister or the Council of Ministers as the case may be, and
his  opinion, satisfaction or decision	is  constitutionally
secured	  when	his  Ministers	arrive	at.  such   opinion,
satisfaction  or  decision.  The independence of  the  Judi-
ciary, which is a cardinal principle of the Constitution and
has  been relied on to justify the deviation, is guarded  by
the  relevant  Article making consultation  with  the  Chief
Justice	 of  India  obligatory.	 In  all  conceivable  cases
consultation with that highest dignitary of Indian-. justice
will  and should be accepted by the Government of India	 and
the  Court will have an opportunity to examine if any  other
extraneous,  circumstances have entered into the verdict  of
the  Minister, if he departs from the counsel given  by	 the
Chief Justice of India.	 In practice the last word in such a
sensitive subject must belong to the Chief Justice of India,
the  rejection of his advice being ordinarily  regarded	 as,
prompted by oblique considerations vitiating the order.	  In
this  view  it is immaterial whether the  President  or	 the
Prime Minister or the Minister for Justice formally  decides
the issue.,

is   a	 sacred	 principle  of	our  democracy,	  like	 the
independence  of  the  Judiciary,  that	 decisions  on	 the
disqualifications   of	Members	 of  Assemblies	 should	  be
unbiased.   While formally the power to decide a dispute  in
this  behalf  is vested in the President  and  the  Governor
under Arts 103 and 192 respectively, it would be a  travesty
of impartiality if such decision were to be made on the	 aid
and advice of a Ministry which is essentially chosen from  a
party  or  combination	of parties.   How  can	a  political
activist with party loyalty in our pluralistic society judge
a  cause  in  which he has  deep,  concern.   Therefore	 the
Constitution  has  made	 the Election  Commission  the	real
arbiter	 in the dispute, it being assumed that the  Election
Commission  is free and fearless and unobliged to the  party
in   power.   The  constitutional  mechanism  is  that	 the
President   (Govern,,	shall	refer	the   question	  of
disqualification of a member for the opinion of the Election
Commission and shall act according to such opinion', so that
whether the right to decide is formally in the President  or
is  to be exercised by the aid and advice of his  Ministers,
it  is immaterial, since the actual adjudication has  always
to  be	made  by the Election  Commission  which  binds	 the
Government and the President merely appends his signature to
the  order  in	regard	to  such  decision.  in	 this  view,
Brundaban(2)  deals  with a special situation and  does	 not
affect	the  otherwise universal rule of the Head  of  State
being  bound  to  act only in accordance with  the  aid	 and
advice of his Ministers.

State  level,with  the additional fact or that an  `area  of
discretionary  Power is expressly left to him.	What  is  of
grave  import  is  that the Court  has	no  jurisdiction  to
inquire	 what advice has been given by the Ministers to	 the
President  or the Governor and thus the	 effective  judicial
check  on  exercise of power is also under eclipse.   If  we
read  these  powers literally as personal' to  the  Head  of
State.	the  conclusion is rather disquieting in  a  country
which  has already had a long night of	imperial  subjection
and  monarchical  tradition.  Dr.  Ambedkar  expressed	this
warning	 in  the Constituent Assembly in  words	 Which	have
contemporary relevance:

State level is euphemistically inscribed in the pages of our
Fundamental  Law  with the obvious intent  that	 even  where

thought, may have to fall into the same class as  restricted
railroad ticket, goods for the day and train only, to  adopt
the language of Justice Roberts ( Smith v. Alleright, 321 U.

</p><p id="p_151">We declare the law of this branch of our Constitution to  be
that the President and Governor, custodians of all executive

powers only upon and in accordance with the advice of  their
Ministers  save in a few well known exceptional	 situations.
Without	 being	dogmatic  or  exhaustive,  these  situations

<p id="p_153">caution	 that even here the action must be compelled by	 the
peril  to  democracy and the appeal to the House or  to	 the
country	 must become blatantly obligatory' We have no  doubt
that  de Smith's statement (1) regarding royal assent  holds
good for the President and Governor in India :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_68">	      "	 Refusal of the royal assent on	 the  ground
	      that  the	 monarch strongly disapproved  of  a
	      bill  or that it was  intensely  controversial
	      would  nevertheless be unconstitutional.	 The
	      only  circunistances in which the	 withholding
	      of the royal assent might be justifiable would
	      be  if  the Government itself were  to  advise

	      possibly	if it was notorious that a bill	 had
	      been   passed   in  disregard   to   mandatory
	      procedural   requirements;   but	 since	 the

	      the  opinion  that  the  deviation  would	 not
	      effect the validity of the measure once it had
	      been  assented to, prudence would suggest	 the
	      giving of assent."
</blockquote><p id="p_154">So far as the appeals before us are concerned, the effect is
that  there  is no infirmity in the impugned orders  on	 the

or passed the orders.
</p><p id="p_155">The  second spinal issue in the ease, as earlier  indicated,
bears  Oil fearless justice, another prominent creed of	 our
Constitution.	The  independence  of  the  Judiciary  is  a
fighting faith of our founding document.  Since the days  of
Lord Coke, judicial independence from executive control	 has
been   accomplished   in  England.   The  framers   of	 our
Constitution,  impressed by this example have fortified	 the
cherished  value  of  the  rule	 of  law  by   incorporating
provisions to insulate the judicature.	Justice becomes fair
and  free  only if institutional immunity and  autonomy	 are
guaranteed (of course there are other dimensions to judicial
independence  which  are important but	irrelevant  for	 the
present	   discussion).	   The	 exclusion   of	   executive
interference  with the Subordinate Judiciary,  i.e.,  grass-
roots  justice, can prove a teasing illusion if the  control
over them is vested in two masters viz., the High Court	 and
the Government, the latter being otherwise stronger.   Some-
times  a transfer could be more harmful than punishment	 and
discipline control by the High Court can also be  stultified
by an appellate jurisdiction being vested in Government over
the High Court's administrative orders.	 This constitutional
perspective  informed  the framer of our  Constitution	when
they  enacted  the  relevant  Articles,	 233  to  237.	 Any
interpretation	of administrative jurisdiction of  the	High
Court  over  its subordinate limbs must be  aglow  with	 the
thought that separation of the Executive from the  Judiciary
is a cardinal principle of our Constitution.  However, we do
not pursue this question further since in the-present  case,
Government  has	 agreed with and acted on the  High  Court's
recommendation'	 and, moreover, the methodology of  conflict
resolution,  when the view of the High Court is	 unpalatable
to  the	 Executive,  falls to be directly  considered  in  a
different set of pending appeals.

<p id="p_157">Nevertheless, we must refer to one aspect of the matter.  It
is  nice on paper to invest disciplinary authority over	 the
subordinate  judiciary in the High Court.  But when  charges
or  aspersions of corrupt practice or  incompetence  against
the  members  of  the lower judiciary  are  brought  to	 the
Cognizance  of	the  High Court,  there	 is  an	 operational
handicap.   Who	 is  to investigate into the  truth  of	 the
allegations?  Is there a machinery at the exclusive disposal
of  the High Court to probe into the primefacie veracity  of
such  complaints?   It	is awkward and,	 ineffectual  for  a
superior  Judge, trained in formal procedures  and  weighing
and  not  collecting evidence, to  undertake  the  sub-rosa,
informal, extensive and technical job of investigation which
demands a different kind of expertise.	At the same time  if
the  police  are  permitted to check  upon  complaints,	 the
successful invasion of judicial independence is	 inevitable.
No Magistrate may function fearlessly if the prosecuting de-
partment  may  also investigate against him.  It  is  indeed
regrettable  that  this	 sensitive side	 of  the  issue	 was
overlooked  by	the  Punjab High  Court	 when  it  requested
Government to direct the Vigilance Commissioner to report on
a member of the judicature.  The true intendment of judicial
independence  is fulfilled not by declining  to	 investigate
into  delinquencies of judicial personnel nor by holding  an
open  enquiry  by  a Judge which is a  poor  substitute	 for
collection  of	evidence but by creating  an  apparatus	 for
collecting  intelligence  and presenting evidence  which  is
under  the complete control of the High Court.	This  is  no
new idea but had been mooted in the 50s at an all-India	 Law
Minister's  Conference but at least, now after such  a	long
lapse of time, this felt want may be remedied.
The  third  contention, argued elaborately  by	both  sides,
turns  on the scope and sweep of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_314">Art. 311</a> in the  background
of the rules framed under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_315">Art. 309</a> and the pleaser' doctrine
expressed  in  <a href="/doc/1342309/" id="a_316">Art.  310.</a>  The	two  probationers,  who	 are
appellants,  have contended that what purport to  be  simple
terminations  of probation on the ground  of  unsuitability'
are really and in substance by way of punishment and falling
short  of the rigorous prescriptions of <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_317">Art. 311  (2</a>),	they
are  bad.  Their complaint is that penal  consequences	have
been visited on them by the impugned orders and since even a
probationer is protected by <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_318">Art. 311 (2</a>), in such situations
the Court must void those orders.  Naturally, the  launching
pad of the argument is Dhingra's Case (supra).	In a  sense,
Dhingra	 is  the Manga Carta of the  Indian  civil  servant,
although  it has spawned diverse judicial trends,  difficult
to be disciplined into one single, simple, practical formula
applicable  to termination of probation of freshens  and  of
the  services of temporary employees.  The  Judicial  search
has  turned  the focus on the discovery of  the	 element  of
punishment  in	the  order passed  by  Government.   If	 the
proceedings are disciplinary, the rule in Dhingra's Case (1)
is attracted.  But if the termination is innocuous and	does
not  stigmatize	 the probationer or temporary  servant,	 the
constitutional	shield	of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_319">Art. 311</a> is	unavailable.   In  a
series of cases, the Court has wrestled with the problem  of
devising  a principle or rule to determine  this  questions'
where	 non-punitive	termination   of    probation	 for
unsuitability  ends  and  punitive  action  for	 delinquency
begins.	 In Gopi Kishore (2) this Court ruled that where the

<p id="p_159">holds  an enquiry on the basis of Complaints  of  misconduct
against	 a  probationer or temporary servant,  the  employer
must  be presumed to have abandoned his right  to  terminate
sine   pliciter	  and  to   have   undertaken	disciplinary
proceedings bringing in its wake the protective operation of
Art  311.  At  first flush, the	 distinguishing	 mark  would
therefore  appear to be the holding of an inquiry  into	 the
complaints of misconduct Sinha C. J., observed :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_69">	      "It  is true that, if the Government  came  to
	      the  conclusion that the respondent was not  a
	      fit  and proper person to hold a post  in	 the
	      public  service  of the State, it	 could	dis-
	      charge  him without holding any  enquiry	into
	      his alleged misconduct. Instead of taking that
	      easy  course,  the Government chose  the	more
	      difficult one of starting proceedings  against
	      him  and	of branding him as a  dishonest	 and
	      incompetent  officer.   He had the  right,  in
	      those  circumstances, to insist upon the	pro-
	      tection of <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_320">Art. 311 (2)</a> of the Constitution."
	      The learned Chief Justice summarized the legal
	      position thus:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_70">	      "1.  Appointment to a post on probation  gives
	      the  person so appointed no right to the	post
	      and  his services may be	terminated,  without
	      taking  recourse to the proceedings laid	down
	      in the relevant rules for dismissing a  public
	      servant. or removing him from service.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_71">	      2.    The	 termination  of  employment  of   a
	      person holding a post on probation without any
	      enquiry  whatsoever cannot be said to  deprive
	      him off any right to a post and is, therefore,
	      no punishment.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_72">	      3.    But	 if  instead of terminating  such  a
	      person's	service	 without  any  enquiry,	 the
	      employer	chooses to hold an enquiry into	 his
	      alleged	misconduct,  or	  inefficiency,	  or
	      foursome	similar reason, the  termination  of
	      servicers	 by  way of punishment,	 because  it
	      puts  a  stigma  on his  competence  and	thus
	      affects his future career.  In such a case, he
	      is entitled to the protection of <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_321">Art. 311	 (2)</a>
	      of the Constitution.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_73">	      4........
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_74">	      5.    But,  if the employer simply  terminates
	      the services of a probationer without  holding
	      an enquiry and without giving him a reasonable
	      chance  of showing cause against	his  removal
	      from  service, the probationary civil  servant
	      can  have no cause of action, even though	 the
	      real  motive behind the removal  from  service
	      may have been that his employer thought him to
	      be unsuitable for the post he was	 temporarily
	      holding,	on  account of	his  misconduct,  or
	      inefficiency, or some such cause."
</blockquote><p id="p_160">The  5th proposition states that the real motive behind	 the
removal is irrelevant and the holding of an enquiry  leaving
an indelible stain as a consequence alone attracts <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_322">Art.	 311
(2)</a>  Ram Narayan Das (1) dealt with a case where  the  rules
under  the  proviso  to <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_323">Art. 309</a> provided some	sort  of  an
enquiry before termination of probation. in such
(1)  A.I.R. 1961 S.C. 177.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">879</span>
<p id="p_161">a case, the enquiry test would necessarily break down and so
the Court had to devise a different test.  Mr. Justice	Shah
(as he then was) stated the rule thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_75">	      "The  enquiry against the respondent  was	 for
	      ascertaining   whether  he  was  fit   to	  be
	      confirmed. The third proposition in  (the Gopi
	      Kishore)	case  refers  to  an  enquiry	into
	      allegations of misconduct or inefficiency with
	      a	 view,	if they were found  established,  to
	      imposing	punishment  and not  to	 an  enquiry
	      whether  a  probationer should  be  confirmed.
	      Therefore,  the fact of holding of an  enquiry
	      is  not  decisive of the	question.   What  is
	      decisive	is  whether the order is by  way  of
	      punishment,  in  the light of the	 tests	laid
	      down in Purshottam lal Dhmgra's Case."
</blockquote><p id="p_162">Thus  a	 shift was made from the factum of enquiry   to	 the
object	of  the enquiry.  Madan Gopal (1)  found  the  Court
applying the object of enquiry doctrine to a simple order of
termination which had been pre	   by  a show  cause  notice
and enquiry. It was held that if the enquiry was intended to
take traumatic action, the innocent phraseology of the order
made  no  difference.  Then came <a href="/doc/656567/" id="a_324">Jagdish Mitter	 v.Union  of
India</a> (2) where Mr. Justice Gajendragadkar (as he then	was)
held
	      "No  doubt  the order purports to	 be  one  of
	      discharge and, as such, can be referred to the
	      power  of	 the  authority	 to  terminate	 the
	      temporary appointment with one month's notice.
	      But it seems to us that when the order  refers
	      to  the  fact  that the  appellant  was  found
	      undesirable to be retained in Government	ser-
	      vice,  it	 expressly  casts a  stigma  on	 the
	      appellant	 and in that sense, must be hold  to
	      be an order of dismissal and not a mere  order
	      of discharge."
</p><p id="p_163">Thus  we see how memberanous distinctions have been  evolved
between an enquiry merely to ascertain unsuitability and one
held to punish the delinquent-to impractical and  uncertain,
particularly  when we remember that the machinery  to  apply
this delicate test is the administrator, untrained in  legal
nuances.   The	impact	on  the	 fired'	 individual,  be  it
termination  of probation or removal from service, is  often
the  same.   Referring	to  the anomaly	 of  the  object  of
inquiry, test, Dr. Tripathi has pointed out (3)
	      "The object of inquiry' rule discourages	this
	      fair  procedure  and the	impulse	 of  justice
	      behind it by insisting that the order  setting
	      up the inquiry will be judicially	 scrutinized
	      for the purpose of ascertaining the object  of
	      the inquiry."
</p><p id="p_164">Again.	could  it  be  that if	you  summarily	pack  off  a
probationer, the order is judicially inscrutable and  immune
?  If  you conscientiously seek to  satisfy  yourself  about
allegations  by some sort of enquiry you get caught  in	 the
coils  of law, however harmlessly the order may be  phrased?
And, so this sphinx-complex has had to give
(1) A I.R. 1963 S.C. 531.     (2) A.I.R. 1964 S.C. 449.

<p id="p_165">way in later cases.  In some cases the rule of guidance	 has
been  stated  to  be the substance of the  matter'  and	 the
foundation'  of the order.  When does motive' trespass	into
foundation'?  When do we lift the veil of form to touch	 the
substance'?   When  the	 Course says  so.   Those  Freudian'
frontiers  obviously  fail in the work-a-day world  and	 Dr.
Tripathi's  observations  in this context  are	not  without
force.	He says
	      "As  already explained, in a  situation  where
	      the order of termination purports to be a mere
	      order   of  discharge  without   stating	 the
	      stigmatizing   results  of  the	departmental
	      enquiry  a  search for the  substance  of	 the
	      matter'  will  be	 indistinguishable  from   a
	      search   for  the	 motive	 (real,	  unrevealed
	      object)  of the order.  Failure to  appreciate
	      this  relationship between motive	 (the  real,
	      but unrevealed object) and from (the apparent,
	      or  officially revealed object in the  present
	      context  has  led to an  unreal  interplay  of
	      words   and  phrases  wherein   symbols	like
	      motive', substance' form or  direct parade  in
	      different	 combinations without  communicating
	      precise situations or entities in the world of
	      facts."
</p><p id="p_166">The need, in this branch of jurisprudence, is not so much to
reach perfect justice but to lay down a plain test which the
administrator  and  civil  servant  can	 understand  without
subtlety  and apply without difficulty.	 After all,  between
unsuitability'	and  misconduct' thin  partitions  do  their
bounds divide'.	 And, over the years, in the rulings of this
Court  the  accent has shifted, the canons have	 varied	 and
predictability	has  proved difficult because  the  play  of
legal light and shade has been baffling.  The learned  Chief
Justice	 has  in  his judgment,	 tackled  this	problem	 and
explained  the rule which must govern the  determination  of
the  question  as  to  when  termination  of  service  of  a
probationer  can be said to amount to discharge	 simpliciter
and  when  it can be said to amount to punishment so  as  to
attract the inhibition of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_325">Art.311.</a> We are in agreement	with
what the learned, Chief Justice has said in this connection.
So far as the present case is concerned, it is clear on	 the
facts  set out in the judgment of the learned Chief  Justice
that  there is breach of the requirements of Rule 7 and	 the
orders of termination passed against the appellants are,  on
that account liable to be quashed and set a side.
In  the result, we agree with the conclusion reached by	 the
learned	 Chief Justice and concur in the order	proposed  by
him.
