    HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE MANMOHAN SINGH
    
    MANMOHAN SINGH, J.
    

1\. The brief facts of the case are that the plaintiff, a company incorporated
in India under the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 having its registered
office at No.230, II Floor, 15th Cross, Sampige Road, Malleswaram, Bangalore-
560003 has filed the present suit for permanent injunction restraining the
defendants from infringing the CS (OS) No.1672/2011 Page 1 of 34 registered
trademark "PREMIER" and copyright of the plaintiff, passing off, dilution,
unfair trade practice and damages.

2\. By way of this order, I propose to decide the following three
applications:

a) I.A. No.10846/2011 under Order XXXIX Rules 1 & 2 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908 filed by the Plaintiff.

b) I.A. No.12084/2011 under Order XXXIX Rules 1 & 2 of the Code of Civil

c) I.A. No.12085/2011 under Order XXXIX Rule 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure,
1908 filed by the defendants.

3\. The plaintiff company through its predecessor "First Aryco India Ltd." had
adopted a trade mark "PREMIER" on 10.01.1997 for manufacturing and marketing
of a wide range of tissue paper products namely Tissues, Tissue Paper, Facial
Tissues, Hanky Packs, Kitchen Towels, Toilet Tissues, Jumbo Rolls, Pop Up
Napkins, Specialty Napkins. (Cocktail, Luncheon, Dinner), Serviettes, C-Fold
Hand Towels, Napkins, Pop U Dispensers, Soap Dispensers etc.

4\. It is averred in the plaint that the plaintiff manufactures and exports a
wide range of tissue paper products including tissue papers, CS (OS)
No.1672/2011 Page 2 of 34 napkins, jumbo rolls, kitchen rolls, toilet rolls,
etc. (herein after referred to as the "tissue paper products") and sells and
markets the said products under various brands including "PREMIER". The
plaintiff has been using the said trademark since 1998. The tissue paper
products of the plaintiff are packed, marketed and sold in packings/boxes
having peculiar artwork, layout, pattern, get up, special fonts, design
placement, colour combination, wordings and descriptions which form an
original work of art that is exclusively owned by the plaintiff and
accordingly, all rights under the Copyright Act, 1957 also exclusively vest
with the plaintiff. The trademark "PREMIER" is prominently written on all the
boxes/packings/labels etc.

5\. One of the products of the plaintiff i.e. Special Face Tissues is packed,
marketed and sold under the trademark "PREMIER" in packings/boxes having
peculiar artwork, layout, pattern, get up, special fonts, design placement,
colour combination, wordings and descriptions which form an original work of
art which is exclusively owned by the plaintiff and accordingly all rights
under the Copyright Act, 1957 also vest with the plaintiff. On the top right
of the box of "Special Face Tissues", the face of a lady is depicted and
placed in the background CS (OS) No.1672/2011 Page 3 of 34 and submerged in
the background colour of the box of the product along with the trademark
"PREMIER" and some descriptive words. On the front left portion of the
packing/box of the product, the front photo of a happy child , on the right
front portion, the facial portion of a happy child, on right front portion the
facial portion of a smiling aged lady and on the left portion of the
packing/box, the photo of smiling faces and a bust of a happy couple are
depicted, placed and submerged with the background colour of the box of the
product along with the trademark "PREMIER" and some descriptive words.

6\. It is stated by the plaintiff that the entire artwork of the packing/box
of PREMIER "Special Tissue" having peculiar artwork, layout, pattern, get up,
special fonts, design placement and colour combination (hereinafter referred
to as the "Special Tissue Box") also form a trademark, which has become
distinctive and capable of distinguishing the same in the market from others.
The "Special Tissue Box" of the plaintiff is also exclusively associated with
the plaintiff by the trade and purchasing public and is also protectable under
the provisions of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 as well as the Copyright Act,
1957\. The plaintiff has registered its trademark "PREMIER" which is CS (OS)
No.1672/2011 Page 4 of 34 prominent and distinctive of the products of the
plaintiff. The details of the registration of the trademark are given in para
16 of the plaint.

7\. It also stated that the plaintiff has also been using another trademark
"ROYAL" and the same is also registered under the Trade Marks Act, 1999 in
Class 16 in respect of tissue paper products. The plaintiff has also
registered the domain name http://www.premiertissues.com.

8\. It is further averred that sometime in the first week June, 2011 the
plaintiff came to know that the defendants are engaged in unauthorized
manufacturing, packing and marketing of tissue papers under the trademark
"PREMIUM" in packing/boxes which are deceptively similar to the trademark
"PREMIER" and "PREMIER SPECIAL TISSUE BOX" the artwork, layout, pattern, get
up, fonts, design placement and colour combination of the defendants‟ boxes is
also deceptively similar to the plaintiffs‟ boxes. According to the plaintiff,
its investigation revealed that the said infringing tissue boxes of the
defendant are being sold in various shops and by roadside vendors in Delhi as
well as other parts of the country. CS (OS) No.1672/2011 Page 5 of 34

9\. Further, the plaintiff came to know that the defendants are engaged in
large scale manufacturing of tissue paper products under the trademark
"PREMIUM" in boxes and packing having deceptively similar artwork, layout,
pattern, get up, fonts, design placement and colour combination as that of the
plaintiffs‟ boxes particularly "PREMIER SPECIAL TISSUE BOX" and are
advertising their products on http://www.premiumtissues.net/about-rolia.html
and http://www.roliatissues.com/.

10\. As per the plaintiff, defendant Nos.1 and 2 in collaboration with each
other, are misleading the customers and general public by using the impugned
trademark "PREMIUM" and a bare comparison of the packing/box of the defendants
will show that the defendants are trying to pass of their spurious goods as
that of the plaintiff by creating deception and confusion in the market and in
the minds of the purchasing public. The said infringing activities of the
defendants have resulted in infringement of the registered trademark "PREMIER"
and registered copyright of the plaintiff.

11\. The plaintiff avers that it is the prior and lawful user of the trademark
"PREMIER", "PREMIER SPECIAL TISSUE CS (OS) No.1672/2011 Page 6 of 34 BOX" and
the copyright in the artwork, layout, pattern, get up, fonts, design placement
and colour combination of the plaintiffs‟ "PREMIER SPECIAL TISSUE BOX" and it
has statutory as well as common law rights vested in it to prevent any
misappropriation and misuse of its trademark and copyright in any manner.

12\. Case of the Defendants 12.1 Defendant left M/s. Wintex Tissues in the
year 1993 and thereafter, started his own business of foils under trademark
„PRIME‟ in the year 1994 (having different kinds of art works for foils) and
of tissue paper etc. in the year 1995 under the trade mark ROLIA
PREMIUM/PREMIUM as the proprietor under taking style M/s. Rolia Tissues and
thereafter opened another firm M/s. Rolia Tissues Industries.

12.2 The defendant extended his business to tissue paper in 1995\. Defendant
developed the box of the ROLIA PREMIUM TISSUES and prepared rough sketch
artwork in 1995 in house with the help of employees of the firm and
thereafter, through the help of computer graphics and other artwork were
added. The font of the CS (OS) No.1672/2011 Page 7 of 34 PREMIUM is one of the
known fonts which is openly available for use on computer/internet and was
taken from there and said font is generic and is not an original artistic
work. The defendants claims copyright over the said carton being first to
prepare the same. The said name was initially used on small scale and
thereafter, since 1997 on a larger scale. 12.3 The defendants mainly supplied
since 1996-97 to the GIANT SUPER STORE and HOME STORES LTD. (SABKA BAZAR) on
very low rates i.e. about 1/3rd of the marketing price with good quality of
products. Defendants were not required to give advertisements as his products
were being sold by Super Stores. The advertisements were made by the said
Super Stores through various media suitable to them like in house
display/pamphlets/newspapers etc.

12.4 The defendants have four/five types of boxes for facial tissues and 20/30
different packaging for other goods. Said original packaging are filed by the
defendants. The plaintiff has not challenged the rest of the packaging of the
defendants.

CS (OS) No.1672/2011 Page 8 of 34 12.5 Defendants are prior user of
trademark/packaging ROLIA PREMIUM TISSUE, ROLIA PREMIUM and PREMIUM since the
year 1995.

12.6 Defendants‟ trade mark "ROLIA PREMIUM TISSUES" is registered under
No.1594703 dated 24.08.2007 and the same is still valid, subsisting and in
full force. However, the defendants have right over the word PREMIUM on
account of long prior user. 12.7 Defendants are continuously and openly using
the said trade marks ROLIA PREMIUM TISSUE, PREMIUM TISSUE, ROLIA PREMIUM and
PREMIUM since 1995.

12.8 Defendants herein are a honest, bonafide, prior and exclusive users of
the trade mark ROLIA PREMIUM TISSUE, ROLIA PREMIUM and PREMIUM since 1995 in
northern India. Defendants are the owners of copyright in its various artistic
packaging/outer packing including the one in dispute etc. of ROLIA PREMIUM
TISSUE, ROLIA PREMIUM and PREMIUM which is an original artistic work
consisting of unique get up, colour combination, font, design, placement,
literary work etc. and also the defendants are the prior user of said artistic
packaging in respect of the said goods. CS (OS) No.1672/2011 Page 9 of 34 12.9
The defendants came from a very poor family, having rural background, not
having many resources, left the job before starting his business and could not
maintain complete start years records as was informed that a firm is not
required to preserve records for more than 6 years. The defendants‟ main sale
is to two big super stores namely Giant Super Stores and Home Stores Ltd.
(SABKA BAZAR). The defendant has hope that the said super stores will provide
him necessary oral as well as documentary evidence. The SABKA BAZAAR has
changed hands to Wadhwa Group who had shifted all the documents to its Bombay
office. Both the super stores have also filed supporting affidavits in this
regard. However, the defendants have filed available unimpeachable documentary
evidence and first bill filed is dated 06.07.1997.

13\. The defendants have also filed counter-claim against the plaintiff on
account of prior user. The defendants have sought an injunction against the
plaintiff and have filed the application under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 & 2 CPC
(being I.A. No.12084/2011).

14\. Large number of documents have been filed by both parties along with
their pleadings as well as during the course of hearing of CS (OS)
No.1672/2011 Page 10 of 34 interim applications.

15\. When the suit along with interim application was listed first time before
the Court, partial interim order was passed to the following effect in the
presence of the defendants:

> "Mr Goel has handed over the set of documents and states that the defendants
> are using the different cartons which are available at page nos. 36 to 39 in
> the copies of the documents supplied by him. On the other hand, the
> plaintiff has filed the four cartons/packaging material allegedly used by
> the defendants which is almost identical with the cartons/packaging of the
> defendants. Since the colour, scheme, getup, layout and arrangement of
> features of the said cartons filed by the plaintiff and the defendants which
> are available at page no. 24 to 26 of the list of documents are similar, the
> defendants are restrained to use the said cartons/packaging material which
> are available at page nos. 24 to 26 of the documents file."

16\. Both the parties have referred large numbers of decisions in support of
their respective submissions. However, both the parties during the hearing of
interim applications have not denied the following facts relating to subject
matter of the present case:

(a) That the trade marks "PREMIER" and "PREMIUM"

used by the parties are deceptively similar as admitted in their pleadings.

CS (OS) No.1672/2011 Page 11 of 34

(b) Most of the packaging used by the parties is similar.

(c) Goods in question are same and are available in the same market.

(d) Both the parties are claiming prior user and are seeking injunction
against each other.

17\. It has now become necessary for the court to examine the relevant issue
as to which party has documentary proof and has cogent, reliable and
unimpeachable documentary evidence in order to come to the positive conclusion
of prior user of the trade mark and trade dress in question as claimed by both
parties.

18\. While coming to conclusion, the Court has to keep in mind the conduct of
the parties not only on the date of suit, but also prior point of time when
the respective claims were made by the parties in various authorities and
other places.

19\. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of both the parties have admitted
that incase both parties would continue to use trade marks and trade dress, as
they have been using, there would be confusion and deception. Scanned copies
of some of the packaging used by the parties are shown as under:-

D Defendants :

20\. Law relating to passing off action is quite well settled in order to
succeed in getting an interim injunction. Party claiming prior/earlier user of
the mark in question has to established prior user in time by production of
cogent and clear evidence. As far as the case of infringement is concerned,
Supreme Court in the case of Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutta Sharma Vs. Navaratna
Pharmaceutical Laboratories; AIR 1965 SC 980 at 990 has laid down as under :

> "the action for infringement is a statutory remedy conferred on the
> registered proprietor of a registered trade mark for the vindication of "the
> exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation to those
> goods"..........In an action for infringement, the plaintiff must, no doubt,
> make out that the use of the defendant‟s mark is likely to deceive, but
> where the similarity between the plaintiff‟s and the defendant‟s mark is so
> close either visually, phonetically or otherwise and the court reaches the
> conclusion that there is in imitation, no further evidence is required to
> establish that the plaintiff‟s rights are violated. Expressed in another
> way, if the essential features of the trade mark of the plaintiff have been
> adopted by the defendant, the fact that the get-up, packing and other
> writing or marks on the goods or on the packets in which he offers his goods
> for sale show marked differences, or indicate clearly a trade origin
> different from that of the registered proprietor of the mark would be
> immaterial......"

> Therefore, I am of the view that it is not necessary at this interim stage
> to refer and discuss all decisions relied upon by the parties when both
> parties are not disputing the settled proposition of CS (OS) No.1672/2011
> Page 17 of 34 law regarding prior user and infringement of trade marks,
> copyright and passing off as according to themselves one party has infringed
> the rights of another party.

24\. Premier Aryco India Ltd. was incorporated on 19.03.1998 and its name was
changed to Premier Tissues India Ltd. on 4.3.2005.

25\. According to the plaintiff, the total annual turnover under the trade
mark/name is approximately Rs.176,57,25,000/- (One hundred and Seventy Six
Crore Fifty Seven Lac Twenty Five Thousand).

CS (OS) No.1672/2011 Page 19 of 34

26\. It is submitted by the plaintiff that the plaintiff has also spent a
considerable amount of sum of Rs.2,08,00,000/- (Rs. Two Crores, and Eight Lac
only) on advertisement of its products under the trade mark „PREMIER‟. All the
advertisements including the advertisement of the plaintiff‟s products under
the trade mark „PREMIER‟ including the advertisement in the January 15, 2001
issue of Femina Magazine, shows that the products of the plaintiff were being
sold throughout India including Delhi.

27\. The plaintiff‟s products were also sold to Wipro, Infosys, Taj Group of
Hotels, Meridien Group of Hotels, Manipal Hospitals, Apollo Hospitals etc. who
are its institutional buyers.

28\. The plaintiff has filed various original bills of its products under the
trade mark „PREMIUM‟, for the period starting from 30.04.1999 upto 31.07.2006.
The plaintiff has also filed some of the copies of Form 3, which is statement
of monthly turnover and tax paid in advance, before the authorities for the
period starting from October, 1998 to March 2002. All the abovementioned forms
and bills mentioned following numbers for the payment of sales tax :

i. KST No.72720074 dated 07.10.1998.

CS (OS) No.1672/2011 Page 20 of 34

ii. CST No.72770077 dated 07.10.1998.

29\. It is stated by the plaintiff that in the year 2010 Avantha Group took
over the plaintiff company, and there was a change in the management of the
Company. During the course of its business the plaintiff company several times
upgraded its billing systems, incorporating new software and statutory changes
to meet the exigencies of its operations. It is also stated that when the
Company was taken over by the Avantha Group, to streamline the operations of
the plaintiff company, it was decided to feed the past records of bills into
the billing system. However, while feeding the data pertaining to the past
bills, the plaintiff‟s employees did not realize that due care was required to
be taken for feeding the billing information in the computerized accounting
system by taking care of various statutory and other changes relating to
shifting from state sales tax/CST to VAT system as well as changes in the name
of the plaintiff company. It is submitted that inadvertently the entire
exercise resulted in faulty data conversion leading to anomalies and errors in
billing system. According to the plaintiff, when for the purpose of filing
this suit, the copies of bills were demanded by the counsel for the plaintiff,
the CS (OS) No.1672/2011 Page 21 of 34 accounts department of the plaintiff
company inadvertently gave the printouts of the bills which were not properly
fed into the computer system. Relying upon such print outs, the plaintiff
filed the bills alongwith the suit. The plaintiff later on realized its
mistake on pointing out by its counsel and thereafter, put strenuous efforts
to dig out the old records which resulted in the discovery of some of the
original bills pertaining to the sale of the goods under trade mark „PREMIER‟.

30\. Similar situation arose in the case of Pioneer Nuts and Bolts Pvt. Ltd.
v. Goodwill Enterprises: 2009 (41) PTC 362 (Del.) (DB) wherein the prior user
was claimed by the parties. The relevant paras of the said judgment are as
under:

> "12. The question was whether the Defendant had made out a case for prior
> use. The learned Single Judge noted that trade mark registration was given
> to the Plaintiff in 2005 with effect from 1998 and 2002. Copyright
> registration was obtained in 2005\. Although the earliest use of the
> disputed mark was claimed by the Plaintiff to be 1996, the invoices and
> bills produced were of the years 2004 onwards. The income tax and sales tax
> returns from 1996 onwards mentioned the Plaintiff‟s income and sales but not
> its products. On the other hand, the Defendant had been able to show three
> advertisements, two of 26.12.1993 and one of 1999, trade enquiries of 1993,
> 1994 and 1995 and different invoices pertaining to Calcutta and Madras. The
> Plaintiff‟s case was that the Defendant was a squatter and merely
> advertising the mark but never using it. Referring to the CS (OS)
> No.1672/2011 Page 22 of 34 judgment in Revlon Inc. v. Sarita Manufacturing
> Company, AIR 1998 Delhi 38: 1997 (17) PTC 394 (Del.), it was held by the
> learned single Judge that the dissemination of knowledge of a trade mark in
> respect of a product through advertisement in media amounts to use of the
> trade mark whether or not the advertisement is coupled with the actual
> existence of the product in the market. The learned single Judge negatived
> the argument of the Plaintiff about the advertisements produced by the
> Defendant amounting to no credible evidence of user.

> 13\. The other issue was of prior user. The learned single Judge relied on
> the copies of the partnership deeds where Harpreet Singh was shown as
> partner of the firm from 1991 in relation to the business and the product.
> Reliance was placed on the judgment in Swaran Singh v. Usha Industries
> (India), AIR 1986 Del 343: 1986 (60 PTC 287 (Del) (DB) and Mocolube India
> Ltd. v. Maggon Auto Centre, 2008 (36) PTC 231 (Delhi) to hold that the
> Plaintiff has been able to establish prima facie existence of registration
> in its favour, in relation to the subject marks, with effect from 1998 and
> 2002. Yet there was no credible evidence of proof of the use of the mark
> from that period; the materials were sketchy. It was held that the Plaintiff
> had not produced any material to show that it had used the mark prior to
> 1998. On the other hand, the Defendant has "prima facie shown that the mark
> was advertized in 1993 and 1999 and trade enquiries through original
> letters, indents, etc. existed in 1993, 1994, 1995 onwards". The issuance of
> telegraphic name „TUFF‟ by the Postal Department in 1994, 1995 was also
> noticed and it was held that the Defendant was "prima facie continuously

31\. Let me now consider the rival submissions of the parties and documentary
evidence in relation to the trade marks PREMIER and PREMIUM and their
packaging material :

32\. Advertisement of Trade Mark

a) Plaintiff : The plaintiff has filed various advertisements by way of
publicity of trade mark PREMIER in the media including newspapers, news items
and in the magazines since the year 1998.

    
    
    b)         The following documents are filed :
    
    a)    Copy of the newspaper article of several newspaper of the year
    

1998 which features the name of the predecessor of the plaintiff and corporate
name/mark "PREMIER".

b) Fresh certificate of incorporation consent on change of name highlighting
the claim of the plaintiff and use of the corporate name/mark "PREMIER".

c) Original Femina Magazine dated 15.01.2001 featuring the advertisement of
mark "PREMIER" with the font and writing style in question of the plaintiff.

d) Internet Print-out of WHOIS record highlighting the creation of the domain
name www.premiertissues.com on 07.09.2001 filed CS (OS) No.1672/2011 Page 26
of 34 with list of documents dated 11.07.2011 by the plaintiff.

e) Advertisement in Femina Magazine dated 15.08.2007, 12.09.2007, 26.09.2007,
10.10.2007, 16.07.2008, 13.08.2008, 14.01.2009 filed with list of documents
dated 11.07.2011 by the plaintiff.

c) Defendants : There is not a single advertisement in the newspaper or in any
known magazine as cogent and clear evidence filed from the date of user
claimed by the defendants or prior to the user claimed by the plaintiff.
Hence, it is clear that on advertisement of their products, the defendants are
not able to establish the prior user.

33\. Sales and Advertisement Figures Plaintiff : The plaintiff has filed the
sale and advertisement figures pertaining to the trade mark PREMIER since
1999-2000 to 2010 as mentioned in para 12 of the written arguments and for
last year, the total annual turnover of the plaintiff‟s products was about
Rs.176,57,25,000 (One Hundred and Seventy Six Crores Fifty Seven Lac Twenty
Five Thousand) and they are selling their products to various well known
clients in India.

34\. In order to show prior user the defendants have produced the sale figures
by way of certificate issued by the chartered accountant Narinder Handa and
Associates from the year 1997-98 to 2010-2011 filed alongwith list of
documents dated 30.08.2011. The CS (OS) No.1672/2011 Page 27 of 34 defendants
have also filed acknowledgement slip of income tax return of defendant No.1
for the assessment years 1998-99, 1999-2000 and 2000-2001 alongwith list of
documents dated 26.07.2011. But these documents do not indicate about the use
of mark PREMIUM except that two firms (defendants) were carrying on business
of tissue papers. The defendants have also filed the certificate issued by
Central Bank of India in the name of the defendants firm about the transaction
in the Bank since 21.2.2009, but, the mark PREMIUM was not mentioned.

35\. The defendants have also referred to many documents filed by them but in
order to show prior user of the trade mark PREMIUM in relation to the goods
the following documents are relied upon :

a) Bill dated 06.07.1997 in respect of sale under trademark ROLIA PREMIUM
issued by the defendants duly received by GIANT THE SUPER MARKET.

b) Bill dated 12.10.1997 issued by the defendants which is counter signed by
Sh. Ajit Mayor duly supported by an affidavit.

c) Bill dated 30.01.1998 in respect of sale under trademark PREMIUM issued by
the defendants duly received by GIANT THE SUPER MARKET.

d) Bill dated 06.09.1998 in respect of sale under trademark PREMIUM issued by
the defendants and duly received by GIANT THE SUPER MARKET.

CS (OS) No.1672/2011 Page 28 of 34

e) Alleged packaging/sheet of the defendants‟ mark PREMIUM dated Jan 1998.

f) Sales figure of M/s. Rolia Tissues industries from financial years 1997-98
to 2010-11 duly certified by Chartered Accountant.

g) Original copy of the certificate issued by Central Bank of India, Badarpur
Branch, New Delhi for the opening of the Bank Account of M/s. Rolia Tissues on
21.02.1997.

h) Original copy of the Income Tax Acknowledgement Form, showing for the
financial year 1997-98 of the defendants under the firm name Rolia Tissues
Industries.

i) Original copy of the challan showing payment of the income tax for the
financial year 1998-99 of the defendant No.1.

j) Original copy of the computation of the income for the financial year
1998-99 of the defendants under the firm name M/s. Rolia Tissues Industries.

k) Original copy of the Saral Form showing filing of income tax return of Sh.
Durgesh Saxena for the financial year 2000-2001.

36\. In support of documents referred to above, the defendants have also
referred to two affidavits of Mr. Ajit Mayor, Ex. Managing Director of M/s.
Ajit Mayor and Company and Mr. Majid Khan Ex. Assistant Manager of M/s. Home
Store India Ltd.

37\. As regard documents i.e. certificate issued by Central Bank of India,
Income Tax acknowledgement for the years 1997-98, 1998- CS (OS) No.1672/2011
Page 29 of 34 99, challan showing the payment of the income tax, sale figures
and certificate issued by the chartered accountant are concerned, the same
have already been discussed in earlier paras that none of the documents show
about the use of the trade mark PREMIUM in question . These documents only
indicate that there was a firm during this period in the year 1995-96 under
the name and style of Rolia Tissues Industries who was carrying on its
business of selling tissues papers but, these documents do not indicate in any
manner that the trade mark PREMIUM is being used as mentioned on these
documents.

38\. The original bills dated 6.7.1997, 12.10.1997, colour copies of box cover
sheet of the defendants for the period January, 1998, do not contain local
sales tax and central sales tax numbers. These bills were issued by Rolia
Tissues which have been filed in order to prove prior user of the trade mark
PREMIUM. There is not a single document on record by the defendants of third
party, like post card, inland letter, newspaper advertisement, copy of
magazines or any other document in the nature of cogent and clear evidence,
though there is a third party evidence available on record from the period
2005 which is subsequent to the user of the plaintiff.

CS (OS) No.1672/2011 Page 30 of 34

39\. This court is of the view that since the defendants are claiming the
prior user and are also seeking the interim injunction against the plaintiff,
it has become more necessary for the defendants to file clear and cogent
evidence which could not be challenged at this prima facie stage. The same is
missing in the present case. It is necessary in the present case due to the
fact as the defendants themselves have claimed in the Trade Mark Registry on
17.5.2005 (the specific date of user is given). It is also pertinent to
mention here that when the application of defendant was examined under Rule 37
of the Trade Marks Rules, 2002, at that time, the plaintiff‟s trade mark
PREMIER was already in existence/pending for registration. At that time the
defendants themselves gave up its exclusive rights to the use of the mark
PREMIUM and accepted the condition of the Registrar and disclaimed its
registration.

40\. If the defendants got the prior user as claimed in the year 1995 in the
present case, then, why the defendants did not claim the same user in the
Trade Mark Registry in their application No.1594703 in Class 16. It was the
most appropriate stage to put their claim of user. Even in the second
application bearing No.1955501 filed by the CS (OS) No.1672/2011 Page 31 of 34
defendants, the user claimed was 01.10.1999. Therefore, prima facie, it is
clear that the defendants were/are taking inconsistent stand about the user at
different stages. It has rather created doubt in the mind of Court, if at this
stage any application for change of user has been filed in Trade Mark
Registry. As discussed, there is no clear, cogent and undisputed evidence
produced by the defendants to show the prior user claimed by them. On the
other hand, the plaintiff‟s documents, like advertisements and news report,
are available on record from the year 1998 for user claimed by the plaintiff.

41\. As far as the two affidavits filed by the defendants are concerned, both
the companies are not in existence any more. The affidavits are filed by Ex.
Managing Director of Ajit Mayor and Company Pvt. Ltd. and Ex. Assistant
Manager of M/s. Home Store India Ltd. These affidavits have been filed by the
defendants in support of claim of longer and prior user and the same cannot be
given due credence as these affidavits would have to be tested at the time of
trial. The identity, authority and authenticity of the deponents cannot be
given due credence at this stage unless they are supported with solid
evidence.

CS (OS) No.1672/2011 Page 32 of 34

42\. The defendants have challenged the validity of documents filed by
plaintiff by stating that these cannot be looked into. But, this Court is of
the view that apart from the documents challenged, there are large number of
other documents available on record which are cogent and clear evidence of
prior user i.e. from the year 1998.

43\. In view of the above, it appears from the record that two set of
packaging are almost similar. Both marks, PREMIER and PREMIUM are deceptively
similar. The defendants could not have designed their packaging without
placing the packaging of the plaintiff. Prima facie, it is clear that it is a
case of violation of vested rights of the plaintiff and pirator thereof cannot
become rightful owner in any manner. Thus, the plaintiff has made out a strong
case of injunction.

44\. Under these circumstances, I am of the considered view that the plaintiff
has been able to make a strong prima facie case for infringement of trade
mark, copyright and passing off. The balance of convenience also lies in
favour of the plaintiff and against the defendants. Incase the
defendants/counter claimant is not stopped from using the mark and trade dress
in the similar packaging, the plaintiff will suffer irreparable loss and
injury, which cannot be compensated in CS (OS) No.1672/2011 Page 33 of 34
terms of money. Therefore, plaintiff‟s application, being I.A. No.10846/2011
under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 and 2 read with Section 151 CPC, is allowed. The
defendants, their dealers, retailers, servants, agents or any one acting for
and on their behalf, are restrained from using the trade mark PREMIUM and/or
any other trade mark, which is deceptively and confusingly similar to the
plaintiff‟s registered trade mark PREMIER as well as similar packaging/trade
dress amounting to infringement of copyright and passing off their goods as
that of the plaintiff in respect of tissues of all kinds, or any other allied
and cognate goods. It is clarified that the finding arrived by this Court
about the defendants‟ user is tentative and prima facie view which shall have
no bearing when the matter would be considered after the trial on merit.

45\. The applications filed by defendants, being I.A. No.12084/2011 under
Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 read with Section 151 CPC and I.A. No. 12085/2011
under Order XXXIX Rule 4 read with Section 151 CPC, are dismissed.
