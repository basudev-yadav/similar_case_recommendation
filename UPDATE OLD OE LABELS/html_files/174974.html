HEADNOTE:
Under  <a href="/doc/1951021/" id="a_17">Article 74(1)</a> of the Constitution "there shall  be  a
Council of Ministers to aid and advise the President in	 the
exercise  of  his  functions".	Under  <a href="/doc/674146/" id="a_18">Article	163</a>  of	 the
Constitution there shall be a Council of Ministers with	 the
Chief Minister at the head to aid and advise the Governor of
a State in the exercise of his functions, except insofar  as
by  or	under  the Constitution	 required  to  exercise	 his
functions or any of them in his discretion.  Both under <a href="/doc/127060/" id="a_19">Art.
74</a>  and <a href="/doc/674146/" id="a_20">Art. 163</a> the question whether any, and if  so  what,
advice	was  tendered  by the Council of  Ministers  to	 the
President/Governor  shall not be inquired into in any  court
Under <a href="/doc/1782245/" id="a_21">Article 174(2)(b</a>), the Governor may from time to, time
dissolve  the Legislative Assembly.  Under <a href="/doc/6135/" id="a_22">Article 172(1)</a>  a
Legislative  Assembly of "a State, unless sooner  dissolved,
shall continue for six years from the date appointed for its
meeting and no longer and the expiration of the said  period
of six years shall operate as a dissolution of the Assembly.
Articles  256 &amp; 257 enjoin that the executive powers of	 the
Union  shall  extend to the giving of such directions  to  a
State  as  may	appear	to the Government  of  India  to  be
necessary  for that purpose.  Under <a href="/doc/490234/" id="a_23">Art. 355</a>, "it  shall  be
the duty of the Union to ensure that the Government of every
State is carried on in accordance with the provisions of the
Constitution." <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_24">Article 356</a> empowers the President to  assume
to himself all or any of the functions of the Government  of
the State and all or any of the powers
2
vested in or exercisable by the Governor or any body or	 any
authority  in  the State other than the Legislature  of	 the
State,	if  on receipt of a report from the  Governor  of  a
State or otherwise, is satisfied that a situation has arisen
in which the Government of the State cannot be carried on in
accordance  with the provisions of the Constitution.   Under
sub-section (5) of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_25">Art. 356 "</a>notwithstanding anything in the
Constitution,  the satisfaction of the President  in  clause
(1)  shall  be	final  and  conclusive	and  shall  not	  be
questioned in any court on any ground.
The  Lok Sabha in which the Congress(R) had an	overwhelming
majority  was dissolved on January 8, 1977 though under	 the
Constitution  (Forty  Second Amendment Act) it	had  another
year  to run out its extended term.  In the fresh  elections
held  in March 1977 the ruling party lost its  majority	 and
went out of power which it had exercised since independence.
On  March 24, 1977, the, Janata Party which had	 secured  an
overwhelming majority of votes of the electorate, formed the
new  Government at the Centre.	On the date that the  Janata
Government  took  office, the Congress (R) was in  power  in
various	 States including Bihar, Haryana, Himachal  Pradesh,
Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and
West Bengal.
On  April  18,	1977, the Union Home  Minister	addressed  a
letter	to the Chief.  Ministers of these States  "earnestly
commending" for their consideration that they may advise the
Governors of their respective States "to dissolve the  State
Assemblies  in exercise of the powers under  <a href="/doc/1782245/" id="a_26">Art.  174(2)(b)</a>
and  seek a fresh mandate from the electorate.	 This  alone
according to the Home Minister's letter would be "consistent
with constitutional precedents and democratic practices."
In  an	interview  on April 22, 1977,  in  the	"Spot  Light
Programme" of All India Radio, Shri Shanti Bhushan, Minister
of Law, Justice and Company Affairs said that "a clear	case
had  been made out for the dissolution of the Assemblies  in
the   nine  congress-ruled  states  and	 holding  of   fresh
elections"  since  "a serious doubt has been cast  on  their
enjoying  the people's confidence, their party	having	been
rejected in the recent Lek Sabha elections." A report of the
said interview appeared in various newspapers including	 the
"Statesman"  of	 the  23rd April.  The	correctness  of	 the
report is not disputed.
The  six plaintiff-States, namely, the State  of  Rajasthan,
Madhya	Pradesh, Punjab, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh and  Orissa
filed suits in this court praying for a declaration that the
letter of the Home Minister was illegal, and ultra vires  of
the  Constitution  and	not binding on	the  plaintiffs	 and
prayed	for  an interim injunction restraining	the  Central
Government  from resorting to <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_27">Art. 356</a> of the  Constitution.
A permanent injunction was also sought for by the plaintiffs
in order to restrain the Central Government permanently from
taking	any step to dissolve the Assemblies until the  fixed
period	of six years was over.	Some of the Members  of	 the
Legislative  Assembly  of  Punjab  had	also  filed  a	writ
petition  complaining  of  violation  of  their	 fundamental
tights and prayed for similar injunctions.
The principal common submissions on behalf of the plaintiffs
as well as the petitioners were :-
Firstly, that the letter dated 18th April 1977 discloses the
sole  ground of an impending proclamation under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_28">Article	 356</a>
of  the	 Constitution  to be followed by  a  dissolution  of
Legislative Assembly of the State concerned and that such  a
proclamation, resulting necessarily in the dismissal of	 the
Ministries  in the six States and the dissolution  of  their
Legislative Assemblies upon the grounds given in the letter,
is  prima  facie  outside the purview of  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_29">Art.	356</a>  of	 the
Constitution  and  would  be  destructive  of  the   federal
structure.
Secondly, that, in any case, the condition precedent to	 the
dissolution of the State Assembly is a ratification by	both
Houses	of Parliament of the Presidential action under	<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_30">Art.
356</a>  so	 that no dissolution at any rate  of  a	 Legislative
Assembly can 'take place without ascertaining the wishes  of
both the Houses of Parliament.
3
Thirdly,   that	 the  grounds  given,  being   outside	 the
constitutionally  authorised  purpose  and  objectives,	 the
proposed action on the face of it is mala fide
and unconstitutional.  'Me respondents' reply in defence are
:-
Firstly,  that	on allegations made in the plaints  no	suit
could	fall  within  the  purview  of	<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_31">Art.  131</a>   of	 the
Constitution  which  is meant for grievances  of  States  as
such, against the Union Government and not those relating to
mere  composition  of  State  Governments  and	Legislatures
without	 involving constitutional or other legal  rights  of
States as such.
Secondly,   the	 questions  which  arise  for  guaging	 the
existence of a "situation", calling for action under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_32">Article
356</a> are, by their very nature, non-justiciable and they	 are
also  made non-justiciable expressly by <a href="/doc/1243357/" id="a_33">Art. 356(5)</a>  of	 the
Constitution  so  that, even if a State could, as  such,  be
said  to be legally and properly interested in	the  dispute
between its Government and the Union  Government, about	 the
desirability or need for any action by the Union  Government
under  <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_34">Article	356of</a> the Constitution, such  a	 dispute  is
outside	 the  sphere of justiciable matters.  If  the  final
action or its grounds are non-justiciable, they could not be
indirectly  assailed by challenging a process which  may  or
may not actually produce the apprehended result or action.
Thirdly,the letter of the Union Home Minister and the speech
of the Union Law    Minister  do not indicate that  anything
failing outside the wide spectrum of	<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_35">Article	 356</a> of	 the
Constitution  is  being or will be taken  into	account	 for
taking,	 action	 under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_36">Art. 356.</a>  Hence, on  matters  stated
there, no cause of action could be said to have arisen.
Fourthly,  mere intimation of some facts, fully	 within	 the
purview of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_37">Art. 356</a> of the Constitution, does not justify  a
prohibition  to	 act  in future when the  situation  may  be
serious	 enough	 on  the strength  of  facts  indicated	 and
possibly others facts also, for action under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_38">Art. 356</a> of the
Constitution.	The freedom of	constitutionally  authorised
executive  action  of the highest executive  organs  of	 the
Union should not be impeded by judicial interference  except
on  grounds  of	 clearest and  gravest	possible  character.
There was nothing beyond bare possibilities before the court
so  that  no  anticipatory  injunction	or  order  could  be
granted.
Dismissing the suits as well as the petitions the Court,
HELD :
Per Beg, C.J.
(1)  The  choice between a dissolution and re-election or  a
retention  of the same membership of the Legislature or	 the
Government  for	 a  certain  period  could  be	matters	  of
political expediency and strategy under a democratic system.
Under	our  system.  quest  for  political  power   through
formation   of	several	 political  powers  with   different
socioeconomic  policies	 and programmes	 and  ideologies  is
legal.	 Hence, a mere attempt to get more  political  power
for  a	party as a means of pursuing the Programme  of	that
party,	 as  opposed  to  that	of  other  parties  is	 not
constitutionally prohibited or per se illegal. [24 F-G]
(2)  One  purpose of our Constitution and laws is  certainly
to  give electors a periodic opportunity of  choosing  their
State's	  legislature  and,  thereby,  of  determining	 the
character of their State Governments also.  It is the object
of every democratic constitution to give such opportunities.
Hence  a  policy  devised to serve that	 end  could  not  be
contrary   to	the  basic  structure  or  scheme   of	 the
Constitution. [24 B]
(3)  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_39">Article  356(1)</a>  of  the  Constitution  calls  for	  an
assessment  of "a situation".  In so far as  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_40">Article  356(1)</a>
may  embrance matters of political and executive policy	 and
expediency, Courts cannot interfere with these unless and
4
until	it  is	shown  what  constitutional  provision	 the
President  'is	going to contravene or	has  contravened  on
attempted  grounds  of action under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_41">Art. 356(1)</a>	 for,  while
<a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_42">Art.  74(2</a>),  disables Courts from inquiring into  the	very
existence or nature or contents of ministerial advice to the
President, <a href="/doc/1243357/" id="a_43">Article 356(5)</a> makes it impossible for Courts  to
question  the  President's  satisfaction  'on  any  ground'.
Hence  Courts can only determine the validity of the  action
on  whatever remains for them or what is admitted on  behalf
of   the  President  to	 be  the  grounds   of	 President's
satisfaction. [25 D, 26 E-F]
(4)  If	 the Union Government thinks that the  circumstances
of the situation demand that the State Governments must seek
a fresh mandate to justify their moral rights in the eyes of
the people to continue to exercise power in the interests of
their  electors,  or else the discontent of the	 masses	 may
have  its  repercussion	 not  only  on	the  law  and  order
situation,  but will also affect legal	responsibilities  or
duties	which the Union Government has towards a  particular
State or towards Indian citizens in general, an of whom live
in  some  State or other, it cannot be said that  resort  to
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_44">Art. 356</a> of the Constitution is not called for. [25 E-F]
(5)  Questions of political wisdom or executive policy	only
could  not  be	subjected to  judicial	control.   No  doubt
executive    policy   must   also   be	  subordinated	  to
constitutionally sanctioned purposes.  It has its sphere and
limitations.   But,  so	 long as  it  operates	within	that
sphere,	  its	operations   are   immune   from    judicial
interference.	This  is also a part of the  doctrine  of  a
rough  separation  of  power  under  the  supremacy  of	 the
Constitution.
				   [27 A-D]
(6)  The   provisions  dealing	with  the  Proclamation	  of
emergency  under  <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_45">Art.	352</a>,  which have  to  be  grave	 and
imminent seem to be covered by the first art of the duty  of
the  Union towards a State mentioned in <a href="/doc/490234/" id="a_46">Article 355</a> but	 the
second part of that duty mentioned-in <a href="/doc/490234/" id="a_47">Art. 355</a>, seems to  be
of  somewhat  different and broader character.	 The  second
part  seems to cover all steps which are enough "to  ensure"
that   the  Government	of  every  State  is  carried,	 "in
accordance  with the provisions of the	Constitution".	 Its
'sweep seems quite wide.  It is this part of the duty of the
Union towards each State which is sought to be covered by  a
Proclamation tinder <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_48">Art. 356.</a>  That Proclamation is not of a
grave emergency.  In fact. the word "emergency" is not	used
there.	 It is a Proclamation intended either  to  safeguard
against	 the  failure of the constitutional machinery  in  a
State  or to repair the defects of a breakdown.	 It  may  be
either	a preventive or a curative action.  It is enough  if
the  President	which,	in view of the	amended	 <a href="/doc/1584119/" id="a_49">Art.  73(1)</a>
really means the Union Council of Ministers, concludes	that
"the  Government  of  the State cannot	be  carried  out  in
accordance with the provisions of the Constitution".  On the
other  hand, action under <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_50">Art. 352</a> is, more  properly,	only
defensive and protective action to be taken to avert or meet
a grave and immant danger. [30 C-F]
(7)  The  language of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_51">Art. 356</a> is so wide and loose that  to
crib  and  confine it within a straight jacket will  not  be
just interpreting or construing it but will be	constitution
making legislation, which does not lie in the domain of	 the
Supreme Court. [31 C-D]

Kerala,	 [1973] Supp.  S.C.R. p. 1 @ 89, <a href="/doc/1240174/" id="a_52">Smt.  Indira  Nehru

@ 307 referred to.
(8)  A conspectus of the provisions of our Constitution will
indicate  that, whatever appearance of a  federal  structure
our  Constitution  may have, its operations  are  certainly,
judged	both by the contents of power which a number of	 its
provisions carry with them and the use that has been made of
them, more unitary than federal. [33 F]
Shamsher  Singh v. State of Punjab, [1975] 1 S.C.R.  p.	 814
referred to.
(9)  In	 a  sense,  the Indian Union is	 federal.   But	 the
extent	of federalism in it is largely watered-down  by	 the
needs of progress and development of 2
5
country	 which has to be nationally integrated,	 politically
and economically co-ordinated and socially,,  intellectually
and  spiritually uplifted. lit such a system,  the  States
cannot	stand in the way of legitimate	and  comprehensively
planned development of the country in the manner directed by
the  Central  Government.   The question  of  legitimacy  of
particular  actions of the Central Government taking  us  in
particular  directions	can often be tested  and  determined
only  by  the verdicts of the people  at  appropriate  times
rather	than by decisions of Courts.  For this reason,	they
become,	 properly  speaking matters for	 political  debates.
rather	than for legal discussion.  If the special needs  of
our   country	to  have   political   coherence,   national
integration,  and planned economic development of all  parts
of  the	 country,  so  as to build  a  welfare	State  where
"Justice-Social, economic and political" are to prevail	 and
rapid  strides are to be taken towards fulfilling the  other
noble  aspirations  act out in the Preamble  strong  Central
directions seem inevitable. [24 C-E]
(10) <a href="/doc/76145/" id="a_54">Article 256</a> of the Constitution covers cases where' the
President may want to	 give directions in exercise of	 the
executive power of the Union to a State Government	  in
relation  to  a matter covered by an existing  law  made  by
Parliament  which applies to that State.  But,	<a href="/doc/214887/" id="a_55">Art.  257(1)</a>
imposes a wider obligation    upon  a State to exercise	 its
powers	in  such  a way as not to  impede  the	exercise  of
executive  power  of the Union which, as would	appear	from
<a href="/doc/883495/" id="a_56">Art.  73</a> of the Constitution, read with <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_57">Art. 248</a>  may  cover
even  a	 subject on which there is no existing law,  but  on
which  some legislation by Parliament impossible.  It  could
therefore, be argued that, although, the Constitution itself
does not Jay down specifically when the power of dissolution
should	be  exercised by the Government on the advice  of  a
Council of Ministers in		       the State, yet, if  a
direction  on  that matter was properly given by  the  Union
Government to a State Government, there is	  a duty  to
carry  it  out.	  The time for the dissolution	of  a  State
Assembly	is not covered by any specific provision  of
the  Constitution  or any law made on the  subject.   It  is
possible,, however, for the Union Government, in exercise of
its  residuary executive power to consider it a fit  subject
for the issue of an appropriate direction when it  considers
that  the political situation in the country is such that  a
fresh  election	 is necessary in the interest  of  political
stability  or to establish the confidence of the  people  in
the Government of a State. [36 B-E]
(11)  Undoubtedly, the subject is one on which	'appropriate
and  healthy  conventions should develop so that  the  power
under  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_58">Art.  356(1)</a>  is neither	 exercised  capriciously  or
arbitrarily  nor  fails	 to be exercised  when	a  political
situation  really calls for it.	 If the views of the  Union
Government  and the State Government differ on the  subject,
there  is no reason why the Union Government should not	 aid
the  development  of  what  it considers  to  be  a  healthy
practice  or convention by appropriate advice or  direction,
and, even to exercise its powers under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_59">Art. 356(1)</a> for	this
purpose when it considers the observance of such a directive
to be so essential that the constitutional machinery  cannot
function  as it was meant to do unless it  interferes.	 The
Supreme	 Court	cannot, at any rate, interdict such  use  of
powers	under  Art 356(1 ) unless and until  resort  to	 the
provision,  in	a particular situation, is shown  to  be  so
grossly	 perverse and unreasonable as to  constitute  patent
misuse	of this provision or an excess of power on  admitted
facts.	 It is not for courts to formulate, and, much  less,
to  enforce  a	convention, however necessary  or  just	 and
proper	a  convention to regulate the exercise	of  such  an
executive  power may be.  That is a matter  entirely  within
the executive field of operations. [36 E-H]
(12) All  that	the  Supreme Court can	do  is	to  consider
whether an action Proposed    on  such a matter	 on  certain
grounds, would fall under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_60">Art. 356(1)</a> of the Constitution if
the Union Government and the State Governments differ on the
question whether, in a particular situation, the dissolution
of  the State Assembly should take place or not.   The	most
that one could say is that a 'dissolution against the wishes
of  the majority in a State Assembly is a grave and  serious
matter.	  Perhaps  it could be observed that  it  should  be
resorted to under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_61">Art. 356(1)</a> of the Constitution only	when
"a  critical  situation'  has  arisen.	 It  is	 not  always
necessary  that the mere defeat of a State Government  in  a
State Assembly must necessarily create a situation in  which
a  dissolution of the State Assembly is obligatory.   If  an
alternate Government is
6
capable	 of being formed which commands the majority in	 the
State  Assembly	 it may be unnecessary.	 The  position	may,
however,  be very different, when a State Government  has  a
majority  in the State Assembly behind it, but the  question
is  whether the party in the majority in the State  Assembly
forming the State Government for the time being having	been
totally and emphatically rejected by the people, a  critical
situation"  has	 arisen	 or is bound  to  arise	 unless	 the
"political  sovereign" is given an opportunity of  giving  a
fresh  verdict.	 A decision on such a  question	 undoubtedly
lies in the Executive realm.  It involves a correct estimate
of a "situation". [41 B-E]
(13)  <a href="/doc/1782245/" id="a_62">Article 174(2) (b)</a>of the Constitution expressly  vests
the  power  of	resolving the legislative  assembly  in	 the
Government  even  if  that had to be on the  advice  of	 the
Council	 of  Ministers in the State, but the power  to	give
such  advice would automatically be taken over by the  Union
Government,  for  the  purposes	 of  dissolution  of   State
Assembly, when the President assumes Governmental powers  by
a  Proclamation	 under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_63">Art. 356(1).</a>  A	dissolution  by	 the
President after the Proclamation would be as good as a	dis-
solution by the Government of a State whose powers are taken
over. [37 C-E]
(14) Indeed,  the usual practice is that the President	acts
under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_64">Art. 356(1)</a> of the Constitution only on the Governor's
report.	  But,	the  use of the	 words	"or  otherwise"	 (In
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_65">Article	 356</a>) show that Presidential satisfaction  could  be
based  on  other  materials as well.  This  feature  of	 our
Constitution  indicates most strikingly the extent to  which
inroads	 have been made by it on the federal  principles  of
Government. [38 A-C]

(15) As the question of the proper time for a dissolution of
a  State Assembly is not a matter extraneous to <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_66">Art.  356(1)</a>
of  the	 Constitution,	the most that can be  said  is	that
questions raised do not go beyond sufficiency of grounds for
resorting to <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_67">Art. 356(1)</a> of the Constitution. [41 H, 42 <a href="/doc/585015/" id="a_68">A]

(16) Attempts  to secure political victories by	 appeals  to
the  electorate,  are  parts of the recognised	rules  of  a
democratic system of Government permitting contests  between
rival parties so as to achieve certain other objectives.  If
such  a	 contest with the desire for achieving	a  political
victory in order to enforce certain programmes, believed  by
the members of a party to be beneficial for the people in  a
State,	as a method of achieving the objects set out in	 the
Preamble,  are	not_only  legal and  permissible  under	 the
Constitution,  but, obviously constitute the  only  possible
and  legal means of attaining the power.to enforce  policies
believed  to  be correct by various  parties,  according  to
their  own  lights, it could not possibly be  asserted	that
procuring  the dissolution of a State  Legislative  Assembly
with  the  object  of gaining a	 political  victory  is,  in
itself,	 an  extraneous object which could not fall  at	 all
under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_71">Art. 356</a> of the Constitution. [42 F-F]

(17) In	 all the grounds of action taken under	Art,  356(1)
are disclosed the public by the Union Government and its own
disclosure  of	grounds reveals that a	constitutionally  or
legally prohibited or extraneous or a collateral purpose  is
sought to be achieved by an impending or actual proclamation
under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_73">Art. 356</a> of the Constitution, the Supreme Court	will

substance, only to the sufficiency of the grounds of  action
under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_74">Art. 356(1)</a> of the Constitution and go no further, the
Court  cannot proceed further with the consideration of	 the
plaints under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_75">Art. 131</a> or the petitions under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_76">Art. 32</a> of the

(18) Proclamations  under  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_77">Article 356(1)</a> are  bound  to  be
placed	under  <a href="/doc/1133729/" id="a_78">Art. 356(3)</a> of the Constitution	before	each
House of Parliament.  However, there is not only nothing  in
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_79">Art.  356</a>  to  make  a	consideration  by  either  House  of
Parliament  a  condition precedent to the  exercise  of	 the
power of dissolution of a State Legislative Assembly by	 the
President  under  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_80">Art.	356 (1</a>), but,  on  the	other  hand,
<a href="/doc/1133729/" id="a_81">Article 356(3)</a> makes it clear that the only effect of even a
failure or refusal by either House of Parliament to  approve
the  Proclamation  is that it ceases to	 operate  after	 two
months.	 Obviously, this means that it operates for at least
two  months.   Hence, whatever is done in these	 two  months
cannot be held to be illegal for that reason alone. [47 A-B]
(19) It is true that the exercise of power under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_82">Art. 356</a> of
the Constitution is subject to Parliamentary control.	This
means  that it is subject to such control as the two  Houses
out  of	 which the Council of States really  represents	 the
State Assembly may be able to exercise during the period for
which  the Proclamation lasts.	But, the existence  of	such
Parliamentary  control,	 as  a	safeguard  cannot   possibly
nullify	 the legality of what is done in the  period  during
which the Proclamation lasts. [47 C-D]
(20) Although  Art 356(1)(a) of the Constitution  imposes  a
bar   against  the  assumption	by  the.President   of	 the
legislative  powers  of the State Legislature,	which  could
only be transferred to Parliament, its provisions, read with
<a href="/doc/1300179/" id="a_83">Art. 357</a> of the Constitution, do not operate as an  absolute
bar  on any expenditure which could be legally	incurred  by
the  President	or  under  the	Presidential  authority	  in
accordance   with   pre-existing  State	  laws	 authorising
expenditure by other authorities or bodies whose powers	 can
be  taken  by the President under <a href="/doc/1330132/" id="a_84">Art.	356(1)(a).</a>   In	 any
case, the provisions of <a href="/doc/1300179/" id="a_85">Art. 357</a> could not possibly be	used
as  a bar against a dissolution of the State Assembly  by  a
Presidential   Proclamation.   Nor  can	 they  be  used	  to
introduce  as  a  condition precedent  to  the	Presidential
Proclamation under <a href="/doc/1330132/" id="a_86">Art. 356(1)(a</a>), involving, as it  usually
does, the dissolution of the State Assembly, an approval  of
both or either of the two.  Houses of Parliament. [49 A-C]
(21) Even if there be some grounds for making a	 distinction
between	 a  State's  interest and rights and  those  of	 its
Government  or	its  members, the Court need  not  take	 too
restrictive or stringent a view of the States' right to	 sue
for   any  rights,  actual  or	fancied,  which	 the   State
Government  chooses  to	 take  up on  behalf  of  the  State
concerned in a suit under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_87">Art. 131.</a> [50 F-G]

(1)  The use of the phrase "Government of India" in  <a href="/doc/271860/" id="a_88">Article
131(a)</a> and <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_89">(b)</a> does  not mean that one party to the  dispute
has  to	 be  the  Government  of  the  day  at	the  Centre.
"Government  of	 India"	 means "Union  of  India"  The	true
construction  of <a href="/doc/271860/" id="a_90">Article 131(a)</a> true in substance  and	true
pragmatically is that a dispute must arise between the Union
of India and a State. [53 E-G]
(2)  The  dispute between the Union of India and the  State
cannot	but be a dispute which arises out of the  difference
between	 the  Government  in office at the  Centre  and	 the
Government in office in the State.  But, there is a  further
prerequisite  which narrows down the ambit of the  class  of
disputes which fall within <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_91">Article 131.</a>	 That requirement is
that  the dispute must involve a question whether of law  or
fact,  on  which the existence or extent of  a	legal  right
depends.  it is this qualification which contains the,	true
guide  for  determining	 whether  a  particular	 dispute  is
comprehended   within  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_92">Art.  131.</a>   Mere  wrangles   between
Governments  have  no place in the scheme of  that  Article.
The  purpose  of  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_93">Art.	131</a> is to afford  a  forum  for	 the
resolution  of disputes which depend for their	decision  on
the existence or extent of a legal right.  It is only when a
legal, not a mere political, issue arises touching upon	 the
existence  or  extent of a legal right that <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_94">Article  131</a>  is
attracted. [54 A-C]

(3)  When  the Plaintiff-States by their suits	directly  or
specifically question the constitutional right and authority
of  the Union Government to issue a directive to  the  State
Governments  commending	 that  the  Chief  Ministers  should
tender a certain advice to their Governors and also question
the constitutional right of the Union Government to dissolve
the  State Assemblies on the grounds mentioned in  the	Home
Minister's  letter  to the Chief Ministers, a legal,  not  a
political, issue arising out of the existence and extent  of
a legal right squarely arises and the suits cannot be thrown
out as falling outside the purview of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_95">Art. 131.</a> [54 D-E]
(4)  It	 is not necessary for attracting the  provisions  of
<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_96">Art.  131</a>  that the plaintiff must assert a legal  right  in
itself.	  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_97">Art.	131</a> contains no such restriction and  it  is
sufficient  in order that its provisions may apply that	 the
plaintiff  questions  the  legal  or  constitutional   right
asserted by the defendant, be it the Government of India  or
any  other State.  Such a challenge brings the	suit  within
the terms of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_98">Article 131</a> for, the question for the  decision
of  the	 Court	is  not	 whether  this	or  that  particular
Legislative Assembly is entitled to continue in office,	 but
whether	  the  Government  of  India,  which   asserts	 the
constitutional right to dissolve the Assembly on the grounds
alleged possesses any such right. [54 F-G]
(5)  The States, have the locus and the interest to. contest
and  seek an adjudication of the claim set up by  the  Union
Government.   The bond of constitutional obligation  between
the Government of India and the States sustains that  locus.
[54 H-55A]
(6)  The  expression "legal right" which occurs in <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_99">Art.	 131</a>
has  to be understood in its proper perspective.  The  legal
right of the States consists in their immunity, in the sense
of  freedom from the power of the Union	 Government.   The),
are entitled under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_100">Art. 131</a>, to assert that right either  by
contending  in the absolute that the Centre has no power  to
dissolve   the	 Legislative   Assemblies   or	 with	 the
qualification  that such a power cannot be exercised on	 the
grounds stated. [55 A-D]

(7)  By	 the Proclamation under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_101">Art. 356(1)</a> the	 Legislative
Assemblies of nine  States    were   dissolved	  and	 the
President's rule was imposed on those States.	  As	   a
result	the  writ petitioners ceased to be  Members  of	 the
Legislative  Assemblies and as a result of their ceasing  to
be  such members the right to salary which they	 could	only
draw if they were members of the Assemblies came to an	end.
Though	the  petitioners could not be denied relief  on	 the
ground that it was not intended by issuing the	Proclamation
to  deprive  them of their salary' the writ  petitions	were
liable to be dismissed on the ground that the injury to	 the
alleged	 Fundamental  Rights  of  the  petitioners  was	 too
indirect and remote. [56 G-H]
(8)  Whether or not, the Proclamation issued under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_102">Art.	 356</a>

Per Bhagwati J. (On behalf of Gupta J. &amp; himself)
(1)  The  satisfaction of the President is a subjective	 one
and cannot be decided	 by  reference to  objective  tests.
It is deliberately and advisedly subjective  because	 the
matter	in  respect to which he is to be satisfied is  '  of
such a nature that its decision must necessarily be left  to
the  executive branch of Government.  It cannot by its	very
nature be a fit subject-matter of judicial determination and
hence  it  is  left to the subjective  satisfaction  of	 the
Central Government which is best in a position to decide it.
The Court cannot, in the circumstances, go into the question
of correctness or adequacy of the facts
9
and  circumstances on which the satisfaction of the  Central
Government is based.  That would be a dangerous exercise for
the  court,  both  because it is not a	fit  instrument	 for
determining  a	question of this kind and also	because	 the
court  would  thereby  usurp  the  function  of	 a   Central
Government  and	 in doing so enter the	"Political  thicket"
which  it must avoid if it is to retain its legitimacy	with
the  people.   But, if the satisfaction is mala fide  or  is
based on wholly extraneous and irrelevant grounds, the court
would have jurisdiction to examine it, because in that	case
there would be no satisfaction of the President in regard-to
the  matter  on which he is required to be  satisfied.	 The
satisfaction  of the President is a condition  precedent  to
the  exercise  of power under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_106">Art. 356(1)</a> and if it  can  be
shown that there is no satisfaction of the President at all,
the exercise of the power would be constitutionally invalid.
Of   course,  by  reason  of  clause  5	 of  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_107">Art.  356</a>	 the
satisfaction  of the President is final and  conclusive	 and
cannot	be  assailed on any ground, but this  immunity	from
attack	cannot	apply where the challenge is  not  that	 the
satisfaction  is improper or unjustified; but that there  is
no  satisfaction  at  &amp;H.  In such a case,  it	is  not	 the
satisfaction   arrived	at  by	the  President	 which.	  is
challenged,  but the existence of satisfaction	itself.	  In
most  cases  it would be difficult, if	not  impossible,  to
challenge  the exercise of power under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_108">Art. 356</a> clause	(1),
even   on  this	 limited  ground,  because  the	 facts	 and
circumstances  on which the satisfaction is based would	 not
be  known,  but	 where it is possible,	to  know  them	from
declarations  made the existence of satisfaction can  always
be challenged on the ground that it is mala fide or based on
wholly	extraneous or irrelevant ground. [ 81 G, H, 82	A-H,

(2)  The  defeat  of  the  ruling party	 at  the  Lok  Sabha
election cannot by itself without anything more support	 the
inference that the Government of the State cannot be carried
on  in accordance with the provisions of  the  Constitution.
To  dissolve the Legislative Assembly solely on such  ground
would be an indirect exercise of the right of recall of	 all
the  members  by  the  President  without  there  being	 any
provision  in  the  Constitution  for  recall  even  by	 the
electorate.  Where there has been a total rout of candidates
belonging to the ruling party and in some of the  plaintiff-
States, the ruling party has not been able to, secure even a
single seat, it is proof of complete alienation between	 the
Government  and	 the  people.	It  is	axiomatic  that	  no
Government  can	 function  efficiently	and  effectively  in
accordance  with  the Constitution in a	 democratic  set  up
unless	it  enjoys the goodwill and support of	the  people.
Where  there  is a wall of estrangement	 which	divides	 the
Government  from  the  people and there	 is  resentment	 and
antipathy   in	the  hearts  of	 the  people   against	 the
Government,  it is not at all unlikely that it may  lead  to
instability  and even the administration may  be  paralysed.
The consent of the people is the basis of democratic form of
Government  and	 when  that is	withdrawn  so  entirely	 and
unequivocally  as  to  leave no room  for  doubt  about	 the
intensity  of public feeling against the ruling	 party,	 the
moral  authority  of  the  Government  would  be   seriously
undermined  and a situation may arise where the	 people	 may
cease	to  give  respect  and	obedience  to	Governmental
authority  and even conflict and confrontation	may  develop
between the Government and the people leading to collapse of
administration.	 These are all consequences which cannot  be
said  to be unlikely to arise from such an unusual State  of
affairs	 and they may make it impossible for the  Government
of  the	 State	to  be carried on  in  accordance  with	 the
provisions  of the Constitution.  Whether the  situation  is
fraught	 with such consequences or not is entirely a  matter
of   political	 judgment  for	the  executive	 branch	  of
Government.   But, it cannot be said that such	consequences
can never ensue and that the ground that on account of total
and  massive  defeat of the ruling party in  the  Lok  Sabha
elections, the Legislative Assembly of the State has  ceased
to  reflect  the will of the people and	 there	is  complete
alienation  between the Legislative Assembly and the  people
is  wholly extraneous or irrelevant to the purpose  of	<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_109">Art.
356</a>, Clause (1).
  On  the facts and circumstances of the present  case	this
ground is clearly a relevant ground having reasonable  nexus
with the matter in regard to which the President is required
to  be	satisfied before taking action	under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_110">Article	356</a>,
Clause (1). [85 A-H]

(3)  There  are two limitations in regard to the  nature  of
the suit which can be entertained by the Supreme Court under
<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_111">Art.  131.</a>  One is in regard to parties and the other is  in
regard	to the subject matter.	It does not contemplate	 any
private	 party being arrayed as a disputant on. one side  or
the  other.   A	 dispute in which such a  private  party  is
involved  must	be brought before a court,  other  than	 the
Supreme	  Court,  having  jurisdiction	over   the   matter.
Moreover, the dispute must be one, relating to a legal right
and  not  a dispute on political plane not  based  on  legal
right.	 A legal right which is the subject of dispute	need
not  arise  in	the  context of	 the  Constitution  and	 the
federalism  it	sets up.  So also the power of	the  Supreme
Court  to  grant relief in a suit under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_112">Article 131</a>  is	 not
restricted  only  to "declaratory  Judgment".	The  Supreme
Court  would  have  power  to  give  whatever  reliefs	 are
necessary for enforcement of the legal right claimed in	 the
suit,	 if    such    legal	right	 is	established.

(4)  Unconstitutional  exercise	 of power by  the  President
under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_115">Article 356</a> clause (1) may injuriously affect  rights

the  constitutional  right of the State to insist  that	 the
federal	 basis	of  the political structure set	 up  by	 the
Constitution  shall not be violated by	an  unconstitutional
assault	 under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_116">Art. 356</a> clause (1).  The present suits	seek

(6)  It	 is  only  where  there	 is  direct  invasion  of  a
fundamental right or imminent danger of such invasion that a
petitioner can seek relief under Art 32.     The  impact  on
the  fundamental right must be direct and immediate and	 not
indirect or remote.
In  the instant case, merely because by the  dissolution  of
the Legislative Assembly, the petitioners would cease to  be
members	 and that would incidentally result in their  losing
their  salary, it cannot be said that the dissolution  would
infringe their right to property.  The petitioners, as such,

Government  to	give  advice  or  suggestion  to  the  Chief
Minister  of  a State and the Chief Minister may  accept  or
reject	such  advice or suggestion as he  thinks  fit.	 'Me
advice	or  suggestion has no binding effect  on  the  Chief
Minister  and no legal consequences flow from it.  Hence  it
could  not  be	said that 'directive'  issued  by  the	Home
Minister  was  unconstitutional,  illegal  or  ultra  vires.
There  was  also  no  question	of  giving  effect  to	 the
"directive"  and no injunction could, therefore, be  granted
restraining  it,;  implementation.  The "directive"  if	 not
accepted  and carried out could certainly be a precursor  to
action	under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_121">Art. 356</a> Clause (1) and, therefore,  might  be
regarded  as indicative of a threat, but standing by  itself
it  could not give rise to any cause of action in the  State
to sue for declaration or injunction. [77 H, 78 A-B]
(8)  It is true that if a question brought before a court is
purely	a political question not involving determination  of
any  legal or constitutional right or obligation, the  Court
would not entertain it, since the Court is concerned only
11
with  adjudication  of legal rights and	 liabilities.	But,
merely because a question has a political complexion that by
itself is no ground for the Court to shrink from  performing
its  duty under the Constitution, if it raises an issue	 for
constitutional determination.  A Constitution is a matter of
purest politics and a structure of power. [79 G-H]
(9)  Merely  because a question has a political	 colour	 the
court cannot fold its hand in despair and declare  "judicial
hands  off."  So  long	as  a  question	 arises	 whether  an
authority under the Constitution has acted within the limits
of its power or exceeded it, it can certainly be decided  by
the Court.  Indeed it would be its constitutional obligation
to  do so.  It is necessary to assert in the clearest  terms
particularly  in  the  context of recent  history  that	 the
Constitution  is suprema lex, the paramount law of the	land
and there is no department or branch of Government above  or
beyond it. [80 F-H]

(1)  Although  the  expression	used in	 <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_122">Art.  131</a>  is	"any
dispute",  the	width of the expression is  limited  by	 the
words  that follow in respect of the nature of dispute	that
can  be	 entertained by the Supreme Court  in  its  original
jurisdiction.	It  is	only a dispute	which  involves	 any
question of law or fact on which the existence or extent  of
a  legal right of the contending party depends that  can  be
subject-matter of a suit under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_123">Art. 131.</a>  The dispute should
be in respect of legal rights and not disputes of  political
character.   Art  131  refers to the  parties  that  may  be
arrayed	 in the litigation as well as to the  subject-matter
of the dispute. [86 F-G]
State  of Bihar v. Union of India, [1970] 2	 S.C.R.	 522
referred to.
(2)  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_124">Article 131</a> speaks of a legal right.  That legal  right
must be that of the State.  The dispute about a legal right,
its  existence	or  extent, must  be  capable  of  agitation
between	 the  Government  of  India  and  the  States.	 The
character  of  the dispute within the scope of	<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_125">Article	 131</a>
that  emerges is with regard to a legal right  which  States
must  be  able to claim against the Government.	  Where	 the
Home  Minister,	 Government of India, is  asking  the  Chief
Ministers  of  the Government of the States  to	 advise	 the
Governors  to dissolve the Legislative Assemblies,  and	 the
Chief  Ministers decline to accept the advice, it is  not  a
dispute between the State on the one hand and the Government
of  India on the other hand.  It is a real  dispute  between
the Government of the State and the Government of India.  It
is  no	doubt  a question of life and death  for  the  State
Government but not so for the State as a legal entity.	Even
after  the  dissolution	 of the	 Assembly,  the	 State	will
continue to have a Government for the time being as provided
for  in	 the  Constitution,  in	 such  a  contingency.	 The
subject-matter	of  the dispute does not  Pertain  to  legal
rights of the State concerned to satisfy the requirements of
<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_126">Article 131</a> of the Constitution. [87 G, 88 H, 89 A-B, 90 C]
(3)  Whether  there  is a case for permanent  injunction  or
other  appropriate writ in these matters are not called	 for
in  view of the fact that the suits and writ  petitions	 are
not maintainable. [92 C-D]
(Concurring with Bhagwati and	   A. C. Gupta, JJ.)
HELD  FURTHER: (4) There is no violation of the	 Fundamental
rights guaranteed to the petitioners under Articles 19(1)(f)
and  31	 of  the  Constitution	as  a  consequence  of	 the
threatened  dissolution	 of the Legislative  Assembly.	 The
Writ  Petitions	 are, therefore, not  maintainable  and	 are
liable for rejection. [90 C-D]

(1)  Assuming,	that the writ applications filed by some  of
the  Members of the Punjab Legislators under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_128">Art. 32</a> of	 the
Constitution  of India axe maintainable, the petitioners  do
not make out a case for issue of any kind of writ  direction
or order in the present case. [92 G]
(2)  The suits as instituted under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_129">Art. 131</a>, in the  instant
case, are not maintainable.  The dispute of the kind  raised
in the suits does not involve any question whether of law or
fact on which the existence or extent of any legal right  of
the  States concerned depends.	The facts as  disclosed	 are
definitely  and exclusively within the prohibited area	into
which it is neither permissible for the Courts, to enter nor
should they ever take upon themselves the hazardous task  of
entering into such an area. [92 H, 93 A, 95 D-F, 97 D]

(1)  A	dispute	 clearly  postulates  that  there  must	  be
opposing  claims which are sought to be put forward  by	 one
party  and  resisted  by the other.  One  of  the  essential
ingredients of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_132">Article 131</a> is that the dispute must  involve
a  legal  right.  based on law or  fact.   If  the  Central
Government  chooses  to	 advise the  President	to  issue  a
Proclamation,  the President has got no option but to  issue
the  Proclamation.  This manifestly shows that	the  Central
Government  has a legal right to approach the  President  to
issue  a  Proclamation for dissolution of an Assembly  as  a
part  of the essential duties which a Council  of  Ministers
have  to  perform while aiding and advising  the  President.
The  State  Governments, however, do not  possess  any	such
right  at  all.	 There is no provision in  the	Constitution
which enjoins that the State Government should be  consulted
or  their concurrence should be obtained before the  Council
of Ministers submit their advice to the President  regarding
a  matter pertaining to the State so far as the	 dissolution
of  an	assembly  is  concerned.  The  right  of  the  State
Governments  to	 exist	depends on  the	 provisions  of	 the
Constitution which is subject to <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_133">Art. 356.</a>  If the President
decides to accept the advice of the Council of Ministers  of
the  Central Government and issue a proclamation  dissolving
the  Assemblies, the State Governments have no right  object
to the constitutional mandate contained in <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_134">Art. 356.</a>
[103 B, F-H, 104 A-B]
(2)  The  mere	fact  that letters were sent  to  the  State
Governments  containing gratuitous advice could	 not  create
any  dispute, if one does not exist before nor would such  a
course	of conduct clothe the State Government with a  legal
right to call for a determination under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_135">Article 131.</a>  If the
State Governments do not possess such a legal, right or	 for
that  matter any right at all, then they cannot put  forward
any claim before a court for a declaration or an injunction.
Unless there is an existing dispute involving a legal  right
between the parties,, the forum provided by <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_136">Art. 131</a>  cannot
be availed of by any party.  Having regard to the facts	 and
circumstances	of  the	 present  case	it  has	  not	been
established  that there was any dispute involving the  legal
right  between	the  Government	 of  India  and	 the   State
Governments and therefore, one of the essential	 ingredients
of  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_137">Art.  131</a> not having been fulfilled, the suits  are	 not
maintainable on this ground alone. [104 C-D, 105 B-C]

F.C.R. 124, 136 followed.
(3)  The  right	 of  the  petitioners  as  members  of	 the
Legislative Assembly of Punjab is not a Fundamental right as
envisaged in Part III of the Constitution.  At the most, the
right  to  receive allowance as members of the	Assembly  is
merely legal right consequent upon their election as members
of  the	 Assembly.  The right of the petitioners is  only  a
limited and inchoate right in as much as it subsists only so
long  as  the Assembly runs its usual course of	 six  years.
The  right  may	 also cease to exist,  if  the	Assembly  is
dissolved by the
13
President  by  issuing a Proclamation under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_138">Art.  356.</a>	 The
right  therefore,  subsists  only  SO  long  as	 these	 two
contingencies  do not _ occur.	The Constitution  also	does
not guarantee any right or allowances to the Members of	 the
Assembly  which are given to them by. local Acts or  Ruler,.
It  was	 not a right which flows,  from	 the  Constitution.,
Thus,  there being no infraction of any Fundamental  right,.
the  petitioners  could not be allowed to take	recourse  to
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_139">Article 32.</a> [107 F-H; 108 <a href="/doc/660275/" id="a_140">G-H]

(4)    The  letter  does  not  amount  to  a  directive	  as
contemplated by <a href="/doc/76145/" id="a_141">Art. 256</a> and <a href="/doc/117780/" id="a_142">257</a> and could not be binding on
the  Chief  Ministers as it pertains purely to	tile  States
concerned, namely, giving of the advice to the Governors for
dissolution  of the Assemblies.	 The Central Government	 can
not  interfere	with  this  executive  power  of  the  State
Government  by giving directions under <a href="/doc/76145/" id="a_143">Article 256</a>  or	<a href="/doc/117780/" id="a_144">Art.
257</a>  of	 the  Constitution because the	dissolution  of	 the
Assembly by the Governor was purely a matter concerning	 the
State  and did not fall within the four corners	 of  either
<a href="/doc/76145/" id="a_145">Art. 256</a> or 257. [111 A-F]

	      arise for decision in this case.)
(5)  Clause  (5) of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_146">Art. 356</a> gives the order passed  by	 the
President  under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_147">Art. 356</a> complete immunity  from  judicial
scrutiny.  As such the Courts cannot go into the sufficiency
or  adequacy  of  the materials on the basis  of  which	 the
Council	 of Ministers of the Central Government	 could	give
any advice to the President. [116 C-D &amp; 120 G]

(6)  If	 the opinion of the Central Government was based  on

Observation :
As  the	 reasons  given	 by  the  Council  of  Ministers  in
tendering  their advice to the President cannot be  inquired
into by the Courts, it is hoped that the Central  Government
in  taking  momentous decisions having far  reaching  conse-
quence	on  the working of the Constitution, will  art	with
great  care  and  circumspection and  with  some  amount  of
objectivity  so	 as to consider the pros and  cons  and	 the
various shades and features of the problems before them in a
coot  and collected manner.  The guiding principles in	such
cases  should be the welfare of the people at large and	 the
intention  to strengthen and preserve the Constitution.	 and
that  this matter will receive the serious attention of	 the
Government.  The stamp of finality given by Cl. (5) of	<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_151">Art.
356</a> of the Constitution does not imply a free licence to the
Central	 Government to give any advice to the President	 and
get an order passed on reasons, which are wholly  irrelevant
or  extraneous	or which have absolutely no nexus  with	 the
passing	 of the Order.	To this extent the  judicial  review
remains. [121 B-D]

HELD FURTHER: (dissenting from the majority)
(7)  The  import  and  purport	of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_152">Art.	 131</a>  is  to  decide
disputes  between  one	state and  another  or	between	 the
Government  of India and one or more States.   The  founding
fathers	 of the Constitution have used the words "State'  in
<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_153">Art.   131</a>  both  deliberately	and  advisedly	so   as	  to
contemplate  the  State as a constituent unit of  the  Union
along  with its territory and permanent	 institutions.	 The
question  as to the personnel who run these institutions  is
only  unrelatable  to the existence of a dispute  between  a
State and the Government of India.  It is only when there is
a complete abolition.of any of the permanent institution  of
a  State  that a real dispute may arise.  A  mere  temporary
dissolution of an assembly under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_154">Art. 356</a> does not amount to
abolition   of	 a  State  Assembly   because	after	such
dissolution,  under  the  provisions  of  the  Constitution,
elections are bound to follow and a new legislature would
evidently come into existence after the voters have  elected
the candidates.
[107 B-D]
(8)  On	 a true and proper construction of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_155">Art. 131</a>  of	 the
Constitution  it may be said that dispute like	the  present
one  is	 totally  outside the scope of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_156">Article	131</a>  of	 the
Constitution.	Therefore,  the State Governments  who	have
raised	the  dispute  are not covered by  the  word  'State'
appearing  in <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_157">Article 131</a> and, therefore, the suits are	 not
maintainable on this ground also. [107 E]

The following Judgments of the Court were delivered
BEG.   C. J. Original Suits Nos. 1 to 6 of 1977,  before  us
now  have been filed on behalf of the States  of  Rajasthan,
Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, and  Orissa
against the Union
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">		     15</span>
of  India under, <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_159">Article 131</a> of the Constitution  of  India.
There are also before us three writ Petitions, Nos. 67 to 69
of 1977, by three members of the Legislative Assembly of the
State of Punjab against tile Union of India and Shri  Charan
Singh,	the  Home Minister in the Government of	 India,	 and
Shri  Zail Singh, Chief Minister of Punjab.  The  six  suits
and the, three Writ Petitions raise certain common questions
of  law	 and fact.  They were, therefore,  permitted  to  be
argued	together.  We have already dismissed the  suits	 and
petitions  after hearing them at length and now	 propose  to
state  our  reasons for doing so as stated in our  order  of
29th  April  1977.  Before dealing with, the.  questions  of
fact  and  law I will indicate the nature  of  the  reliefs,
sought by each plaintiff under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_160">Article 131</a> and the grievance
of each petitioner under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_161">Article 32</a> of the Constitution.
The State of Rajasthan asked for a declaration that what  it
described  as  a "directive" contained in the  letter  dated
18th  April,  1977, issued by Shri Charan Singh,  the  Union
Home  Minister,	 to  the Chief Minister	 of  the  State'  is
"unconstitutional, illegal and ultra vires the	Constitution
and  also  a declaration that the plaintiff  State  is	"not
constitutionally  or  legally obliged to comply with  or  to
give effect to the directive contained in the said letter.
The State of Madhya Pradesh seeks the declaration that	"the
direction   /order dated 18th April, 1977, of the  defendant
through its Home Minister is ultra vires the Constitution".
The  State  of	Punjab asks for a  declaration	of  what  it
describes   as	"direction/order"  as  "ultra	vires"	 the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_8">The  State of Bihar calls the letter a "directive' and	asks
for the declaration that it is "unconstitutional and  void".
it also prays for a declaration that a refusal by the  Chief
Minister  of  Bihar to comply with it "cannot  be  made	 the
basis  for the issue of proclamation under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_162">Article, 356</a>,  of
the Constitution".  'It also seeks a declaration that  Arti-
cle 356 of the Constitution "cannot be invoked for the	sole
purpose	 of  dissolving the State Legislative  Assembly	 and
holding	 fresh	elections for the said	Assembly  after	 the
defeat	of the majority party- in the said Assembly  in	 the
elections for the Lok Sabha".
</p><p id="p_9">The State of Himachal Pradesh prays for eight declarations :
firstly, that "the Council of Ministers of the State is	 not
liable	to  resign  and	 the  Legislative  Assembly  of	 the
plaintiff  is not liable to be dissolved on the ground	that
the   Congress	Party,	which  holds  a	 majority   in	 the
Legislative  Assembly, had lost in the Lok  Sabha  elections
and  the  Janata Party has come into power at  the  centre";
secondly,  that	 "the  Executive ,of the  Defendant  is	 not
entitled  to  encroach	upon the  sole	prerogative  of	 the
Council	 of Ministers as to the nature of the  advice  which
the 'latter thinks fit to render to the Governor";  thirdly,
that "the provisions ,of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_163">Article 356</a> of the Constitution are
not liable to be invoked by the President merely because the
Political party which has been returned to power in the	 Lok
Sabha elections happens to be different from the party which
holds majority in the Legislative Assembly of the  plaintiff
and  which  might have lost heavily in the' said  Lok  Sabha
elections";   fourthly, that "the Legislative,	Assembly  of
the plaintiff is not liable to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">16</span>
be  dissolved  before  the  expiry of  the  term  under	 the
Constitution  because the views of the electorate,  have  an
undergone  a  change  as  stated  in  the  letter.  of	 the
defendant's Home Minister dated 18th April, 1977";  fifthly,
that  "'the  circumstances mentioned in the letter  do	not
constitute  a threat to law and order, and, in,	 any  case,-
such   a   threat  to  law  and	 order	 cannot	  form	 any
constitutional	basis  for dissolution	of  the	 Legislative
Assembly  of  the  plaintiff"; sixthly,	 that  "reasons	 and
circumstances	stated	in  the	 letter	 addressed  by	 the
defendant   to	 the   plaintiff's   Chief   Minister	 and
the,resultant  threatened  action under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_164">Article 356</a>  of	 the
Constitution  are Wholly unconstitutional and mala fide	 and
that  a proclamation issued on. the facts and  circumstances
of the present case, would be utterly void"; seventhly	that
the "condition precedent and prescribed in <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_165">Article 356(1)</a> of
the  Constitution,  is non-existent";  eighthly,  that	"the
Legislature  of the plaintiff cannot be dissolved until	 and
unless	any proclamation issued under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_166">Article 356(1)</a> of	 the
Constitution,  is ratified by both Houses of  Parliament  as
envisaged by <a href="/doc/1133729/" id="a_167">Article 356 (3)</a> of the Constitution
The  State  of	Orissa asked 'for  a  declaration  that	 the
"directive" contained in, the letter of 18th April, 1977, is
"Unconstitutional, illegal and ultra vires the Constitution"
and  also that the plaintiff State is "not  constitutionally
or  legally obliged to comply with or to give effect to	 the

the  letter of Shri Charan Singh, the Home Minister  in	 the
Union Government, and a statement said to have been made  by
Shri   Shanti  Bhushan,	 the  Law  Minister  in	 the   Union
Government.   These,  according	 to  the  Plaintiffs   under

Shri  Charan Singh describes as "advice" is not carried	 out
by the Chief Minister of each of the six states.
The principal common submissions on behalf of the plaintiffs
as well as the petitioners are :
</p><p id="p_18">Firstly,, that the letter of.  Shri Charan Singh dated	18th
April,	1977,  discloses  the sole ground  of  an  impending
Proclamation  under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_179">Art.  356</a> of  the	Constitution  to  be
followed  by a dissolution of the ]Legislative	Assembly  of
the State concerned and that such a proclamation,  resulting
necessarily  in the dismissal of the Ministries in  the	 six
States	and the dissolution of their Legislative  Assemblies
upon  the  grounds given in the letter, is  prima  facie  to
outside the purview of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_180">Article 356</a> of the Constitution.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">18</span>
<p id="p_19">Secondly, that, in any case, the condition precedent to	 the
dissolution  of	 the  State  Legislative  Assemblies  is   a
ratification   by   both  Houses  of   Parliament   of	 the
Presidential   action	under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_181">Article	356</a>   so   that	  on
dissolution, at any rate, of a Legislative Assembly can take
place without ascertaining the wishes of both the Houses of
Parliament.
</p><p id="p_20">3    Thirdly,  that  the  grounds given	 being	outside	 the
constitutionally authorised purposes and objectives make the
proposed   action,  on	the  face  of  it,  mala  fide	 and
unconstitutional.	   Our attention was also  drawn  to
certain assertions in the plaints and petitions for  advanc-
ing the pleas of "malice in fact"' and "malice in law".
The replies on behalf of the Union of India are
Firstly,  that	on allegations made in the plaints  no	suit
before	us would fall within the purview of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_182">Art. 131</a> of	 the
Constitution  which  is meant for grievances of	 States,  as
such,. against the Union Government, and not those  relating
to  mere composition of State Governments  and	Legislatures
without	 involving constitutional or other legal  rights  of
States as such.
</p><p id="p_21">Secondly,   the	 questions  which  arise  for  gauging	 the
existence of a "situation", calling for action under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_183">Article
356</a>  are, by their very nature, inherently  non-jisticiable,
and  they  have also been made nonjusticiable  expressly  by
<a href="/doc/1243357/" id="a_184">Article 356(5)</a> of the Constitution so that, even if a  State
could,	as  such,  be said to be legally  and  properly	 in-
terested in the dispute between its Government and the Union
Government about the desirability or need for any action  by
the Union Government under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_185">Article 356</a> of the  Constitution,
such,  a  dispute  is  outside	the  sphere  of	 justiciable
matters.   If  the  final action or  its  grounds  are	non-
justiciable,  they  could  not be  indirectly  assailed,  by
challenging a process which may or may not actually  produce
the apprehended result or action.
</p><p id="p_22">Thirdly,  the  letter  of the Union Home  Minister  and	 the
speech of the  Union  Law  Minister  do	 not  indicate	that
anything falling outside the wide spectrum of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_186">Article 356</a> of
the  Constitutions being or will be taken into, account	 for
taking	action	under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_187">Article	356.</a>		  Hence,  on
matters	 stated there, no cause of action could be  said  to
have arisen.
</p><p id="p_23">Fourthly  , mere intimation of some facts, fully within	 the
purview of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_188">Article 356</a> of the Constitution, does not justify
a  prohibition	to act in future when the situation  may  by
serious	 enough,  on  the strength of  facts  indicated	 and
possibly, other facts also, for action under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_189">Article.356</a>  of
the  Constitution.  In other words, the submission was	that
it  could not possibly be predicated now whether there	were
or  not other facts or what other possible facts, which	 may
affect the situation, may arise in future.  It was submitted
that  the freedom of constitutionally  authorised  executive
action	of the highest executive organs of the Union  should
not  be, impeded by judicial interference except on  grounds
of clearest and gravest possible character.  Just now, there
was  nothing beyond bare possibilities before the  Court  so
that no anticipatory Injunction or Order could be granted.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">19</span>
<p id="p_24">The  first  ground of objection on behalf of  the  Union  is
confined to the suits.	But, the remaining three grounds  of
objection  are	common	to the suits as	 well  as  the	Writ
Petitions.
</p><p id="p_25">On  behalf  of	Union of India	notices	 were  accepted	 and
preliminary  objections, mentioned above, were taken to	 the
maintainability	 of  the  suits and  the  petitions  on	 the
allegations  made therein.  We, therefore proceeded to	hear
arguments on the preliminary objections. with,out  requiring
defendants  or	respondents to file  written  statements  or
replies	 or framing issues formally.  I propose	 to  examine
the allegations made in the plaints and in the petitions  so
as to determine whether assertions made there, on  questions
of  fact,  are sufficient to disclose any  cause  of  action
necessary to maintain the suits or the petitions for reliefs
asked for.
</p><p id="p_26">As indicated above, the letter of Shri Charan Singh the Home
Minister  in the Union Government, to the Chief Minister  of
each  State provides the primary source of the grievance  of
the  plaintiffs and petitioners.  One of  these	 identically
phrased letters (the one to the Chief Minister of Rajasthan)
may be reproduced here. It runs as follows:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">			       "D. O. No. 355/MS/T/77
				   HOME MINISTER

				     New Delhi,

</blockquote><p id="p_27">Dear Shri Joshi,
We  have given our earnest and serious consideration to	 the
most  unprecedented political situation arising out  of	 the
virtual	 rejection,  in the recent Lok Sabha  elections,  of
candidates belonging to the ruling party in various  States.
The  resultant	climate	 of  uncertainty  is  causing  grave
concern	 to  us.  We have reasons to believe that  this	 has
created	 a  sense  of  diffidence  at  different  levels  of
Administration.	   People  at  large  do  not	any   longer
appreciate the propriety of continuance in power of a  party
which has been unmistakably rejected by the electorate.	 The
climate	 of  uncertainty,  diffidence  and  disrespect	 has
already given rise to serious threats, to law and order.
</p><p id="p_28">2.   Eminent  constitutional experts have long been  of	 the
opinion	 :that	when a Legislature no  longer  reflects	 the
wishes or views of the electorate and when there are reasons
to  believe 'that the Legislature and the electorate are  at
variance,  dissolution,	 with a view to	 obtaining  a  fresh
mandate	 from the electorate would be most appropriate.	  In
the  circumstances prevailing in your State, a fresh  appeal
to  the political sovereign would not only  be	permissible,
but also, necessary and ,obligatory,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">20</span>
</p><p id="p_29">3.   I	 would,	 therefore,  earnestly	commend	  for	your

174(2)(b)</a>  and	seek a fresh mandate  from  the	 electorate.
This  alone  would, in our considered view,  be	 consistent
with constitutional precedents and democratic practices.
</p><p id="p_30">4.   I would be grateful if you would kindly let me know  by

</p><p id="p_33">To substantiate the allegation that the letter,	 constituted
a  "threat" of action under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_191">Article 356</a> of the	Constitution
to  dismiss  the  Government, to  dissolve  the	 Legislative
Assembly  of  each  plaintiff  State  and  to  imposer	 the
President's  rule upon it, corroboration was sought from  :a
report	of a talk of Shri Shanti Bhushan, the  Minister	 for
Law,  Justice and Company Affairs, on the All  India  Radio,
which  appeared	 in  the  Statesman  of	 23rd  April   1977.
Although, reports in newspapers do not constitute admissible
evidence of their truth, yet, I reproduce the extract  which
was  either attached to or its substance reproduced in	the,
plaints,  only	to  test whether,  even	 assuming  that	 its
contents  were to be proved, by admissible evidence,  to  be
given  in  due	course,	 all  the  allegations	will,  taken
together, constitute something actionable.  The report	said
:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	      "Advice to Nine States a Constitutional  duty,
	      says Shanti Bhushan.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	      Mr.  Shanti Bhushan, Union Law Minister,	said
	      on  Friday  night that a clear case  had	been
	      made out for dissolution of the Assemblies  in
	      nine  Congress-ruled  States  and	 holding  of
	      fresh elections, reports Samachar.
	      In  an interview in the, Spot-light  programme
	      of  All  India  Radio he said  that  the	most
	      important	 basic feature of  the	Constitution
	      was  democracy, which meant that a  Government
	      should function with the broad consent  of the
	      people  and only so long as it  enjoyed  their
	      confidence.   If	State Governments  chose  to
	      govern  the  people  after  having  lost	 the
	      confidence  of  the  people,  they  would	  be
	      undemocratic Governments, he said.
	      Under <a href="/doc/490234/" id="a_192">Article 355</a>, a duty had been cast on the
	      Union   Government   to  ensure	that   State

	      Mr.  Shanti  Bhushan  was	 asked	whether	 the

	      did  not	exercise its power at  this  crucial
	      juncture	to  test the legitimacy of  a  State
	      Government.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">	      He-replied  that after all whenever the  power
	      was conferred by the Constitution. it was	 not
	      done  simply  for the sake of  conferring	 it.
	      Obviously	 the Constitution  contemplated	 the
	      circumstances under which that power should be
	      exercised.  When those circumstances arose  it
	      was  obligatory on the part of the  Centre  to
	      exercise that power.</blockquote>
<p id="p_34">	      Mr.  Shanti Bhushan said he failed to see	 why
	      the State Governments objected to going to the
	      people to seek their mandate.  "If	  we recognise the
 real sovereignty and  supremacy
	      of  the people, there cannot be any  possible
	      objection".  If someone claimed a divine right
	      to rule whether the people wanted him or	not,
	      the in of course, there could be an  objection
	      to go to the people.
</p><p id="p_35">			 PREMATURE END
	      Explaining   the	 Constitutional	  provisions
	      relating	to premature dissolution  of  State.
	      Assemblies,   Mr.	 Shanti	 Bhushan  said	 two
	      articles	deal with this matter.	<a href="/doc/1034417/" id="a_193">Article	 172</a>
	      provided for the normal term which was earlier
	      five years.  But this had been extended to six
	      years by the Constitution 42nd <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_194">Amendment	Act</a>.
	      Then  <a href="/doc/1582504/" id="a_195">Article 174</a> gave the Governor the  power
	      to dissolve the Legislative Assembly from time
	      to time even during the normal period of	five
	      or  six years.  Normally this power was to  be
	      exercised	 with  the  aid and  advice  of	 the
	      Council of Ministers.
</p><p id="p_36">	      He  was asked whether it was  permissible	 for
	      the President to resort to <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_196">Article 356</a> if	 the
	      Council of Ministers failed to aid and, advise
	      the  Governor to dissolve the  Assembly  under
	      <a href="/doc/1582504/" id="a_197">Article 174.</a>
</p><p id="p_37">	      Mr.   Shanti  Bhushan  explained	that   under
	      <a href="/doc/490234/" id="a_198">Article 355</a> a duty had been, cast on the Union
	      Government  to ensure that the Governments  in
	      States were carried on in accordance with	 the
	      Constitution.  The most important provision in
	      the Constitution.	 "rather the most  important
	      basic   feature  of  the	 Constitution"	 was
	      democracy which meant that a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">	      22</span>
	      Government  should  function  with  the  broad
	      consent  of the people and only so long as  it
	      enjoyed the confidence of the people.
</p><p id="p_38">		      CONTINUED CONFIDENCE
	      Mr.  Shanti  Bhushan said that the  mere	fact
	      that at one time the Governments in the States
	      enjoyed  the confidence of the people did	 not
	      give  them  the right to	govern	unless	they
	      continued	 to  enjoy that	 confidence.   If  a
	      situation	 arose in which a serious doubt	 was
	      cast   upon   the	 Government   enjoying	 the
	      continued	 confidence of the people, then	 the
	      provision	 for  premature dissolution  of	 the
	      Assembly immediately came into operation.
	      The  provision not merely gives the power	 but
	      it casts a duty because this power is  coupled
	      with  duty,  namely,  the	 Assembly  must	  be
	      dissolved immediately and the Government	must
	      go  to  the  people  to  see  whether  it	 has
	      continued confidence of the people to  govern.
	      Even  after having lost the confidence of	 the
	      people,  if  the Government  chose  to  govern
	      people, it would be undemocratic.	 This  would
	      not  be in accordance with the  provisions  of
	      the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_39">	      This  was precisely the philosophy behind	 the
	      wide  powers  given  to  the  President  under
	      Articles	 355   and  356.    Obviously	some
	      authority had to be given the power to  ensure
	      that the functionaries under the	Constitution
	      were   working   in   accordance	 with	 the
	      Constitution.
</p><p id="p_40">	      As there were a number of States, obviously no
	      single  State  could  be	given  this   power.
</p><p id="p_41">	      Therefore,  this	power was entrusted  to	 the
	      Union   Government  to  see  that	 the   State
	      Governments were acting in accordance with the
	      Constitution,  which meant in accordance	with
	      democratic principles and conventions.
</p><p id="p_42">			    NOT WHOLLY IMMORAL
	      Answering another question, Mr. Shanti Bhusban
	      did   not	 agree,	 that  the  whole   of	 the
	      Constitution  42nd <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_199">Amendment Act</a> was  immoral.
	      But there were, serious objections to that Act
	      on the ground of ethics.	When this  amendment
	      was rushed through Parliament, the five  years
	      term of the members was over.  Their term	 had
	      really  expired  and  they did  not  have	 the
	      continued	 mandate to enact such an  important
	      Act as the 42nd Amendment.  The results of the
	      Lok  Sabha elections had also shown  that	 the
	      people  had not really given them the  mandate
	      to enact the amendment.
</p><p id="p_43">	      The other objection to the 42nd Amendment	 was
	      that during the Emergency important leaders of
	      the  opposition  parties were in	jail.	They
	      could not express their views.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">	       23</span>
<p id="p_44">	      Mr.   Shanti  Bhushan  said  that	  the	42nd
	      Amendment had been enacted.  As the  Ministers
	      had   taken   an	 oath  to   abide   by	 the
	      Constitution,   they  could  not	ignore	 the
	      provisions of the 42nd Amendment so long as it
	      remained.	 With the result it was not possible
	      to, have elections, in those States where	 the
	      State Governments had not lost the mandate  of
	      the people as was, reflected in the Lok  Sabha
	      elections".
</p><p id="p_45">I  have	 set out the two basic sources of complaint  in	 the
plaints	 and  the petitions in order  to  consider  whether,
assuming  such	statements had 'been made by  the  two	very
responsible and important Ministers of the Union Government,
they  could sustain suits for injunctions under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_200">Article	 131</a>
of  the	 Constitution  or writ petitions by  Members,  of  a
Legislative Assembly to be dissolved.
</p><p id="p_46">So  far as the letter of Shri Charan Singh is concerned,  it
certainly  does not contain even a reference to <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_201">Article	 356</a>
of  the	 Constitution.	 Nevertheless, the  speech  of	Shri
Shanti	Bhushan,  assuming that it was	correctly  reported,
does  mention Articles 355 and 356 of the  Constitution	 and
expounds  a  view  of  one of  the  basic  purposes  of	 the
Constitution  the observance of which could, in the  opinion
of the Law Minister, be secured by,', resort to <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_202">Art. 356</a>  of
the  Constitution.  The speech does express the view of	 the
Law  Minister  that  there was a duty cast  upon  the  Union
Government  by <a href="/doc/490234/" id="a_203">Article 355</a> of the Constitution to  secure  a
conformity  between the current opinion of  the,  electorate
and  the  composition of the legislatures in  the  different
States	where the Governments in power today  reflected	 the
opinions of the majority of electors in each State prevalent
only  at  a  time  when	 the  last  election  to  the  State
Legislative  Assembly was held.	 The question whether  these
State Governments retain the confidence of the electorate or
not  at	 present could only be answered	 decisively  by	 the
electors  themselves.	That  was the  exclusive  right	 and
privilege of the electors under a democratic  constitutional
scheme	and  the law.  According to the	 Law  Minister,	 the
elected representatives cannot set up a right to continue in
power now, despite an overwhelmingly adverse verdict of	 the
electorate  against  the  party to which  members  of  these
Government  belong.   In  his opinion, to  do  so  would  be
contrary  to  the basic norms of  democracy  underlying	 our
Constitution.

The  Union Government proposes to act under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_206">Article  356</a>  of
the Constitution to give electors
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">24</span>
in the various States a fresh chance of showing whether they
continue  to  have  confidence	in  the	 State	 Governments
concerned  and	their policies despite the evidence  to	 the
contrary provided by the very recent Lok Sabha elections.
One  purpose  of our Constitution and laws is  certainly  to
give  electors	a  periodic opportunity	 of  choosing  their
State's	  legislature  and,  thereby,  of  determining	 the
character of their State's Government also.  It	   is	 the
object	of  every  democratic  constitution  to	 give	such
opportunities.	      Hence, a policy devised to serve	that
and could not  be contrary to the basic structure or  scheme
of the Constitution.	 The  question whether	they  should
have  that  opportunity now or later may be  a	question  of
political  expediency  or  executive policy.  Can  it  be  a
question  of legal right also unless there is a	 prohibition
against	 the dissolution of a legislative assembly before  a
certain	  period  has  expired	?  If  there  had   been   a
constitutional	prohibition, so that the proposed action  of
the   Union   Government   could   have	  contravened	that
constitutional	interdict, we would; have been	obliged	 to,
interfere, but, can we do so when there is no constitutional
provision  which gives the legislature of a State the  right
to   continue	undissolved  despite   certain	 supervening
circumstances  which may, according to, one view,  make	 its
dissolution necessary ?
</p><p id="p_48">It may have been possible for this Court to act if facts and
the circumstances mentioned to support proposed action	were
so completely outside the purview of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_207">Art. 356</a> or so  clearly
in conflict with a constitutional provision that a  question
of  excess  of power could have apparently arisen.  If,	 for
example,  an  authoritative  statement,	 (on  behalf  of   a
Union,Government, was issued that a dissolution is  proposed
only  because  the Chief Minister or the  whole	 Council  of
Ministers of a State belongs to a particular caste or creed,
it could be urged that the proposed action would  contravene
the fundamental rights of Indian citizens of equality before
the  law  and absence of discrimination on  such  a  ground.
There is, however, no such allegation or its particulars  in
the plaints before us which may be capable of giving rise to
the  inference	that any  such	constitutionally  prohibited
action is intended by the Union Government.
The  choice  between  a dissolution  and  re-election  or  a
retention of the same memberships of the legislature or	 the
Government  for	 a  certain  period  could  be	matters	  of
political  expediency  and  strategy under  a	democratic
system.	 Under our system, quest of political power, through
formation  of  several	political  parties,  with  different
socioeconomic  policies	 and programmes and  ideologies,  is
legal.	 Hence it cannot be said that a mere attempt to	 get
more political power for a party, as a means of pursuing the
programme  of  that  party, as, opposed	 to  that  of  other
parties, is constitutionally prohibited	 or per se  illegal.
There  may  be moral or even political objections  to,	such
courses	 incertain circumstances.	   It may  be  urged
that  States should be permitted to function undisturbed  by
any  directions	 or advise by the Union	 Government  despite
their  differences  with it on matters of  socioeconomic  or
political policy on complexion.	 Rights
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">25</span>
were  asserted,	 on behalf of State legislators,  as  though
they  were legal rights to continue. as	 legislators  untill
the expiry of the; constitutionally fixed spans of lives  of
their  legislatures, barring cases of earlier  dissolution.
We are only concerned here with legal rights to dissolve and
legal obstacles to such dissolution.
</p><p id="p_49">It  could be argued, with considerable force,  on  political
and  moral  grounds, that electors should be given  a  fresh
opportunity  of pronouncing their verdict upon the  policies
and  programmes of the Governments in the States  when	very
convincing proof of wide ,divergence between their views and
those  of their Governments has become available.   The	 Law
Minister's  view is that, where there is  an  overwhelmingly
large  electoral  verdict in a State against  the  party  to
which  its  Government	belongs,  the  situation  not	only
justifies but makes resort to a fresh election or an  appeal
to  the	 political sovereign imperative.  This I  think,  is
largely a political and moral issue.  We are only  concerned
with its relationship to constitutional provisions.  If	 its
impact	on  the	 minds and feelings  of	 electors  or  those
officers who have to carry on the day to, day administration
is  such  that	it  will frustrate the	very  objects  of  a
Government under the Constitution or make it impossible	 for
the  Government in a State to function as it ought to  under
the Constitution, it may come to the conclusion that  action
under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_208">Article	356</a> of the Constitution is called  for.	  We
cannot forget that <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_209">article 356(1)</a> calls for an assessment of
a "situation".	We, cannot anticipate decisions or interdict
possible  actions in situations which may or may  not  arise
due  to	 all kinds of factors-economic,	 social,  moral	 and
political.
</p><p id="p_50">If the Union Government thinks that the circumstances of the
situation  demand  that the, State Governments must  seek  a
fresh  mandate to justify their moral rights in the eyes  of
the people to continue to exercise power in the interests of
their  electors,  or else the discontent of the	 masses	 may
have  its  repercussion	 not  only  on	the  law  and  order
situation  but	will also affect legal	responsibilities  or
duties	which the Union Government has towards a  particular
State  or  towards Indian citizens in general, all  of	whom
live  in  some	State or other, can we say  that  resort  to
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_210">Article 356</a> of the Constitution is not called for ? I  think
that it is impossible to substitute our judgment for that of
the Union Government on such a matter.
</p><p id="p_51">Even if it is possible to see a federal structure behind the
setting up, of separate executive, legislative, and judicial
organs	in,  the  State and to urge, as it  has	 been  urged
before	us, that so long as the State Governments and  their
legislatures  are not shown to have committed a	 dereliction
of their- constitutional duties or violations of any consti-
tutional provisions, they ought not to be interfered with by
the  Union  Government, it is also apparent, both  from	 the
mechanism  provided by <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_211">Article 356</a> of our  Constitution,  as
well  as  the manner in which it has been used	on  numerous
occasions   in	the  past,  since  the	inception   of	 our
Constitution,  that  the  Union	 Government  is	 capable  of
enforcing its own views on such matters against those of the
State  Government  as to how the  State	 Governments  should
function  and  who  should bold the reins of  power  in	 the
States	so  as	to enable the Constitution to  work  in	 the
manner the Union Government wants
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">26</span>
it  to	do  in a situation such as the one  now	 before	 us.
<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_212">Article 131</a> of the Constitution was, certainly not meant  to
enable	us  to sit as a Court of appeal on  such  a  dispute
between	 the Union Government and a State Government.	And,
our  Constitution is not an inflexible instrument  incapable
of meeting the needs of such a situation.
</p><p id="p_52">It may be that, under our Constitution, there is too great a
scope  for  struggle merely for seats of power so  that	 the
grand	purposes,   enshrined  in  the	 Preamble   to	 our
Constitution and the correct governmental policies needed by
the mass of our people to give reality to their dreams	tend
to be neglected in scrambles for political power.  The issue
before us, however, is not whether one party or another	 has
failed in the very objectives and purposes for which  people
give unto themselves Constitutions such as ours.  It is	 not
for  us	 to  decide  whether  a	 party	which  has  had	 its
opportunities in the past has adequately met the objects  of
lodging political and legal power in its hands, or,  whether
those  who  now wield power at the Centre will	do  so	more
wisely, more honestly, or more, effectively, from the  point
of  view  of the interests of the masses of  our  people  or
public good.  These are questions for the people  themselves
to answer.
</p><p id="p_53">I  think  that the two Union Ministers have  stated  certain
grounds	 for  inferring that the time has come to  give	 the
people	the  political sovereign a chance to  pronounce	 its
verdict	 on the fates of State Governments and	legislatures
in   the   nine	  States  also	in   a	 manner	  which	  is
constitutionally not open to objection.	 In so far as  arti-
cle  356 (1) may embrace matters of political and  executive
policy	and  expediency courts cannot interfere	 with  these
unless and until' it is shown what constitutional  provision
the  President is going to contravene of has contravened  on
admitted grounds of action under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_213">Article 356 (1)</a> for,  while
<a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_214">Article	 74(2)</a> disables Courts from inquiring into the	very
existence or nature or contents of ministerial advice to the
President, <a href="/doc/1243357/" id="a_215">Article 356(5)</a> makes it impossible for Courts  to
question  the  President's  satisfaction  "on  any  ground".
Hence, Court$, can only determine the validity of the action
on  whatever  may remain for them to consider  on  what	 are
admitted,  on  behalf  of the President, to  be	 grounds  of
Presidential   satisfaction.   Learned	counsel'   for	 the
plaintiffs and petitioners, when confronted with <a href="/doc/1243357/" id="a_216">Article 356
(5</a>),  said they would challenge its validity as a  provision
violating,  the	 basic structure of  the  Constitution.	 We,
however,  heard objections to the maintainability  of  suits
and  petitions even apart from the specific bar	 in  <a href="/doc/1243357/" id="a_217">Article
356(5).</a>	 And, I propose to deal principally with those other
objections.
</p><p id="p_54">This  Court has never abandoned its constitutional  function
as  the	 final	judge  of  constitutionality  of  all	acts
purported   to	 be  done  under  the	authority   of	 the
Constitution.	It  has not refused to	determine  questions
either	of  fact or of law so long as it  has  found  itself
possessed' of power to do it and the cause of justice to  be
capable of being vindicated by its actions.  But, it  cannot
assume unto itself powers the Constitution lodges  elsewhere
or  undertake tasks entrusted by the Constitution  to  other
departments of State which may be better equipped to perform
them.  The scrupulously discharged duties of all'  guardians
of the Constitution include the duty not to transgress the-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">27</span>
<p id="p_55">limitations  of	 their	Own  constitutionally  circumscribed
powers	by trespassing into what is properly the  domain  of
other constitutional organs.  Questions of political  wisdom
or executive policy only could not be subjected to  judicial
control.    No	 doubt	executive  policy   must   also	  be
subordinated  to constitutionally sanctioned  purposes.	  It
has its sphere and limitations.	 But, so long as it operates
within that sphere, its operations are immune from  judicial
interference.	This  is also a part of the  doctrine  of  a
rough  separation  of  powers under  the  Supremacy  of	 the
Constitution  repeatedly.propounded  by this  Court  and  to
which  the  Court unswervingly adheres even when  its  views
differ	or  change  on	the  correct  interpretation  of   a
particular constitutional provision.
</p><p id="p_56">Assuming, therefore, that the letter of Shri Charan Singh in
the  context  of  the reported speech of  the  Law  Minister
formed	the  basis of an absolutely correct  inference	that
action under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_218">Article 356</a> of, the Constitution would be taken
by  the President if the "advice" to the Chief Ministers  of
States contained in it is not accepted, the only question we
need determine here is whether such a use of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_219">Article 356</a>  of
the  Constitution  was,	 in  any  way,	unconstitutional  or
legally	 malafide.   Another way of putting the	 same  issue
would  be to ask whether the- purposes-stated by  the  Union
Law  Minister for the proposed action under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_220">Article  356</a>  of
the  Constitution, assuming that such a proposal  or  threat
could be found there, could be said to be extraneous to	 the
purposes of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_221">Article 356</a> of the Constitution.
Mr. R. K. Garg arguing for the petitioners from Punjab,	 has
put forward what appears to us to be, according to the	very
authority  cited  by  the learned counsel, on  the  mode  of
construing  our Constitution, a very good justification	 for
the  view  said	 to have been propounded by  the  Union	 Law
Minister.  Mr. Garg relied on a passage from the judgment of
Sikri, C.J., in <a href="/doc/257876/" id="a_222">H. H. Kesavananda Bharati Sripadagalavaru v.
State of Kerala</a> : (1)
	      "I  must interpret <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_223">Art. 368</a> in the setting  of
	      our  Constitution,  in the background  of	 our
	      history  and in the light of  our	 aspirations
	      and  hopes, and other relevant  circumstances.
	      No other constitution combines under its wings
	      such  diverse people, numbering now more	than
	      550  millions,  with different  languages	 and
	      religions and in different stages of  economic
	      development,  into  one nation, and  no  other
	      nation is faced with such vast  socio-economic
	      problems".
</p><p id="p_57">	      It was also said there (at p. 69) :
</p><p id="p_58">	      "I   need	 hardly	 observe  that	I   am	 not
	      interpreting   an	 ordinary  statute,  but   a
	      Constitution  which  apart from setting  up  a
	      machinery	 for  government, has  a  noble	 and
	      grand vision.  The vision was put in words  in
	      the  Preamble  and  carried  out	in  part  by
	      conferring  fundamental rights on the  people.
	      The vision was directed to be further  carried
	      out   by	 the   application   of	   directive
	      principles.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">28</span>
It  seems  to  me  that if "aspirations	 and  hopes  of	 the
people", "the noble and grand vision found in the  preamble"
and  the chapter on "Directive Principles of  State  Policy"
are  to	 be  taken  into account  in  deciding	whether	 the
provisions  of the Constitution are being carried out  by  a
particular  Government	or not, the  scope  of	interference
under	<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_224">Article	 356</a>  of  the  Constitution,  so  that	 the
provisions  of	the Constitution may  be  observed,  becomes
quite  wide  and sweeping.  So long as we are bound  by	 the
majority  view	in Kesavananda Bharati's case  (supra),	 the
purposes and the doctrines lying behind its provisions	also
become,	 if  one may so put it, more or less, parts  of	 the
Constitution.  Whether a particular view or proposed action,
in   a	particular  situation,	amounts	 to   enforcing	  or
subverting   the   constitution	 thus	becomes	  a   highly
controversial  political  issue on which the letter  of	 the
Constitution tends to be relegated to the background.
As I am, strictly speaking, only concerned with the law,  as
I  find	 it  in	 the Constitution, I  will  now	 proceed  to
interpret <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_225">Article 356</a> as I find it.  It reads :

emergency  under  <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_233">article  352</a>, which has to  be  grave	 and
imminent,  seem to be covered by the first part of the	duty
of the' Union towards a State mentioned in <a href="/doc/490234/" id="a_234">article 355</a>,	 but
the  second  part of that duty, mentioned  in  <a href="/doc/490234/" id="a_235">article	355</a>,
seems  to be of a somewhat different and broader  character.
The  second part seems to cover all steps which	 are  enough
"to  ensure" that the Govt. of every State is carried on  in
accordance  with the provisions of Constitution.  Its  sweep
seems quite wide.  It is evident that it is this part of the
duty of the union towards each State which. is sought to  be
covered	  by  a	 proclamation  under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_236">article	356.</a>	That
proclamation is not of a grave emergency.  In fact the	word
emergency is not used there.  It is a proclamation  intended
either	 to   safeguard	  against   the	  failure   of	 the
constitutional machinery in a state or to repair the effects
of a breakdown.	 It may be either a preventive or a curative
action.	  It is enough if "the President" which, in view  of
the amended <a href="/doc/1584119/" id="a_237">article 73(1)</a> really means the union council  of
Ministers,  concludes  that  "the Government  of  the  State
cannot	be carried on in accordance with the  provisions  of
the, Constitution." On the other hand, action under  <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_238">article
352</a> is, more properly, only defensive and protective  action
to be taken to avert or meet a grave and imminent danger.
What  is  the  Constitutional  machinery  whose	 failure  or
imminent  failure the President can deal with under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_239">article
356  ?</a>	Is it enough if a situation has arisen in which	 one
or more provisions of the Constitution cannot be observed  ?
Now what provisions of the Constitution, which are not being
observed  in  a	 State, or to what  extent  they  cannot  be
observed  are matters on which great differences of  opinion
are  possible.	 If  a	broad purpose, such  as	 that  of  a
democratic  Government,	 contained in the  Preamble  to	 our
Constitution which was used by this Court, as was done in H.
H. Kesavananda Bharti's case (supra), to infer what has been
called the "basic structure", was meant also to be served by
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_240">article	 356</a>, the scope of a "situation" in which  proclama-
tion  under it can be made would seem wide.  If	 the  "basic
structure"    embraces	 basic	 democratic    norms,	 the
Constitutional Machinery of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_241">article 356</a> could conceivably be
used by the Union Government for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">31</span>
securing  compliance with its view of such norms,  when,  in
its  opinion'  the State Government has	 failed	 to  observe
them.	The Union Government could say : "If, what we  think
is basic to, a democratic system is not done by you, we will
conclude that the Government of your State cannot be carried
on  by	you  in	 accordance  with  the	provisions  of	 the
Constitution.  In  that case we will take over	your  power,
under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_242">article 356</a>, and do that for the people of your State,
which you should yourself have done."<a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_243">Article 356 (1)</a> of	 the
Constitution,  at any rate, does not seem to us to stand  in
the way of such a view.
</p><p id="p_64">Again,	if the directive principles of State, Policy,  which
embrace	 a vast field of legislation for the welfare of	 the
masses	of.  our  people,  are	also  parts  of	 the   basic
structure, which has to be ensured or maintained by the	 use
of  the	 constitutional machinery, the failure of,  a  State
Government  or	its  legislature to carry  out	any  of	 the
Constitution's	 mandates  or  directives,  by	 appropriate
legislation, may, according to a possible view, be construed
as  a  failure	of  its	 duties	 to  carry  ,out  what	 the
Constitution requires.	Our difficulty is that the language,
of  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_244">article;  356</a>  is so wide and loose	 that  to  crib	 and
confine	 it  within  a	straight jacket	 will  not  be	just
interpreting  or  construing it but  will  be  ,constitution
making	 legislation  which,  again,  does   not,   strictly
speaking, lie in our domain.
</p><p id="p_65">The  above  mentioned possibilities seem  to  follow,  quite
conceivably  from the fairly broad language used in  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_245">article
356(1)</a>	and the rather loose meaning of the basic  structure
of  the Constitution which this Court seems to have  adopted
in  Kesavananda	 Bharati's case (supra).  This view  of	 the
"basic structure" seems, so to speak, to annex doctrines  to
provisions.  If that be so, it becomes impossible for us  to
say that the Union Government, even if it resorts to <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_246">article
356</a>  of the Constitution to enforce a political doctrine  or
theory, acts unconstitutionally, so long as that doctrine or
theory	is  covered  by	 the  underlying  purposes  of	 the
Constitution found in the Preamble which has been held to be
a part of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_66">We  have not sat here to determine whether the concept of  a
basic	structure,  found  in  Kesavananda  Bharati's	case
(supra),  requires  any	 clarification	or  a  more  precise
definition.   I may mention here that I gave  the  following
exposition of what I understood to be "the basic  structure"
of  our	 Constitution  of which,  according  to	 Kesavananda
Bharati's case (supra), the doctrine of the supremacy of the
Constitution was apart :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">	      "Neither	 of   the   three   constitutionally
	      separate organs of State can, according to the
	      basic scheme, of our Constitution today,	leap
	      outside	 the   boundaries   of	  its	 own
	      constitutionally	assigned sphere or orbit  of
	      authority into that of the other.	 This is the
	      logical  and natural meaning of the  Principle
	      of Supremacy of the Constitution". (gee : <a href="/doc/1240174/" id="a_247">Smt.
	      Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Rai Narain</a>) (1).
</blockquote><p id="p_67">Even  if  we  were to narrow down the  concept	of  a  basic
structure  to bring it in accordance with the concept  found
in the passage cited
(1)  [1976] 2 S.C.R. 347 at 539.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">32</span>
<p id="p_68">above, we could only strike down that executive policy which
could  fairly appear to be a clear deviation from  what	 the
basic  structure requires.  What would be, as the report  of
the speech of the Law Minister shows, fairly and  reasonably
viewed as a policy intended to strengthen or secure what  is
included in that basic structure could not be struck down or
controlled at all by this Court as that would be an  attempt
to control executive policy within a sphere which is its own
and  where its supremacy must be and has  been	consistently
upheld by this Court.
</p><p id="p_69">The  basic assumption underlying the views expressed  above,
is that each of the three organs of the State-The Executive,
the  Legislature  and  the Judiciary has its  own  orbit  of
authority and operation.  It must be left free by the  other
organs.	 to  operate within that sphere even if	 it  commits
errors	there.	 It is not for one of the  three  organs  of
State  either to correct or to point an accusing  finger  at
the other merely because it thinks that some error has	been
committed by the other when acting within the limits of	 its
own powers.  But, if either the Executive or the Legislature
exceeds	 the  scope of its powers, it places itself  in	 the
region where the effects of that excess should be capable of
removal	 by the Judiciary which ought to redress  the  wrong
done  when  properly  brought up before	 it.   A  scrupulous
adherence  to  this  scheme  is	 necessary  for	 the  smooth
operations  of our Constitutional mechanisms of	 checks	 and
balances.  It implies due respect for and confidence in each
organ of our Republic by the other two.

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">33</span>
<p id="p_72">there is no excess of power, which may be questioned  before
Courts,	 similarly,  the Union Government  cannot  interfere
with  the normal functions of the Government in a  State  on
the  plea  that there is a lack of  conformity	between	 the
legal rights of the State Government and the opinions of the
electorate  which  could affect only the moral rights  of  a
State  Government  to continue in power.  It  was  submitted
that such an allegedly moral ground does not give the  Union
Government  the legal right of action under <a href="/doc/76145/" id="a_249">article  256</a>  of
the Constitution.  This, it is urged by Mr. Niren De, raises
a constitutional issue of grave import.
</p><p id="p_73">In  some of the plaints, it is asserted that the moral	plea
sought	to  be given the colour of a legal right  of  action
under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_250">article 356(1</a>), on behalf of the people of the  State,
is  an	attempt to give a legal and constitutional  garb  to
what  is  only	a  matter  of  political  strategy.  it	  is
suggested, that the Union Government wants to take an  undue
advantage of the temporary gust of feeling which is believed
to  be	sweeping  the  country as a  result  of	 the  recent
overwhelming  victory of the Janata party and its  political
allies.	 In other words, both the question of the, extent of
State autonomy in a federal structure, and an alleged misuse
of  constitutional  power under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_251">article 356</a> of	the  Consti-
tutional, on grounds said to be extraneous to it, have	been
raised	on behalf of the States.  These	 considerations	 are
placed before us as aids to a proper construction of <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_252">article
356(1)</a> as well as matters which deserve careful scrutiny and
adjudication after ascertainment of correct facts.
We  are reluctant to embark on a discussion of the  abstract
principles  of federalism in the face of express  provisions
of  our Constitution.  Nevertheless, as the principles	have
been   mentioned  as  aids  to	the  construction   of	 the
Constitution whose basic structure may, no doubt, have to be
explored even when interpreting the language of a particular
provision  of the document which governs the destiny of	 the
nation, we cannot avoid saying something on this aspect too.
A  conspectus  of the provisions of  our  Constitution	will
indicate  that, whatever appearances of a federal  structure
our  constitution  may have, its operations  are  certainly,
judged	both by the contents of power which a number of	 its
provisions carry with them and the use that has been made of
them, more unitary than federal.  I mention the use that has
been made of the constitutional provisions because constitu-
tional practice and convention become so interlinked with or
attached  to  constitutional  provisions and  are  often  so
important  and	vital  for grasping  the  real	purpose	 and
function  of Constitutional provisions that the	 two  cannot
often  be  viewed apart.  And where the content	 ,of  powers
appears so vague and loose from the language of a provision,
as  it seems to us to be in <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_253">article 356(1</a>), for the  reasons
given  above, practice and convention may so crystallise  as
to  become more significant than the letter of the law.	  At
any  rate, they cannot be divorced from constitutional	law.
They  seem  to us to be relevant even in  understanding	 the
purpose,  the import, and the meaning of the words  used  in
<a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_254">article	 356(1).</a>  This will be apparent also from a  perusal
of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">34</span>
judgment  of  this  Court  in  Shamher	Singh  v.  State  of
Punjab(1).
</p><p id="p_74">The  two  conditions Dicey postulated for the  existence  of
federalism were : firstly, "a body of countries such as	 the
Cantons	 of  Switzerland, the Colonies of  America,  or	 the
Provinces  of Canada, so closely connected by  locality,  by
history, by race, or the like, as be capable of bearing,  in
the eyes of their inhabitants an impress of common  nationa-
lity";	and, secondly, absolutely essential to the  founding
of  a  federal system is the "existence of a  very  peculiar
state of sentiment among the inhabitants of the	 countries".
He pointed out that, without the desire to unite there could
be  no	basis for federalism.  But, if the desire  to  unite
goes  to  the extent of forming an integrated whole  in	 all
substantial  matters  of Government, it produces  a  unitary
rather	than  a	 federal constitution.	Hence,	he  said,  a
federal	 State	"Is  a	political  contrivance	intended  to
reconcile  national  unity  with the  maintenance  of  State
rights." The degree to which the State rights are separately
preserved   and	 safeguarded  gives  the  extent  to   which
expression is given to one of the two contradictory urges so
that  there  is	 a  union without  a  unity  in	 matters  of
government.   In  a sense, therefore, the  Indian  union  is
federal.   But,	 the extent of federalism in it	 is  largely
watered	 down by the needs of progress and development of  a
country	 which has to be nationally integrated,	 politically
and  economically coordinated, and socially,  intellectually
and  spiritually  up-lifted. In such a	system,	 the  States
cannot	stand in the way of legitimate	and  comprehensively
planned development of the country in the manner directed by
the  Central  Government.   The question  of  legitimacy  of
particular  actions of the Central Government taking  us  in
particular  directions	can often be tested  and  determined
only  by  the verdicts of the people  at  appropriate  times
rater  than by decisions of Courts.  For this reasons,	they
become,	 properly  speaking, matters for  political  debates
rather	than for legal discussion.  If the special needs  of
our   country,	 to  have  political   coherence,   national
integration,  and planned economic development of all  parts
of  the	 country,  so  as to build  a  welfare	State  where
"justice, social, economic and political" are to prevail and
rapid strides are to be taken towards fulfilling the of	 her
noble  aspirations, set out in the Preamble, strong  central
directions  seems  inevitable.	It is  the  country's  need.
That, at any rate, seems to be the basic assumption behind a
number of our Constitutional provisions.
Mr.   Granville	  Austin,  in  "The   Indian   Constitution-
Cornerstone,  of a Nation" (see p. 186) in the course of  an
account	 of  our Constitution making, points  out  that	 the
members of our Constituent assembly believed that India	 had
unique problems which bad not 'confronted other	 federations
in  history'.  Terms such as 'quasi-federal' and  'statutory
decentralization' were not found by the learned author to be
illuminating.	 The   concepts	 and  aspirations   of	 our
Constitution makers were different from those in American or
Australia.  Our Constitution could not certainly be said  to
embody	Dr. K. C. Where's notion of "Federalism" where	"The
general	 and  regional	governments of a  country  shall  be
independent each of the other within its sphere." Mr. Austin
thought	 that  our system, it, it could be  called  federal,
could  be described as "cooperative federalism".  This	term
was used by another author, Mr.
(1)  [1975] 1 S.C.R. p. 814.

<p id="p_75">A.H.   Birch   (see  :	Federalism,  Finance,	and   Social
Legislation  in Canada, Australia, and the United States  p.

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_18">	      ".  .  .	.  the	practice  of  administrative
	      cooperation   between  general  and   regional
	      governments,  the	 partial dependence  of	 the
	      regional	governments upon payments  from	 the
	      general  governments,  and the fact  that	 the
	      general governments, by the use of conditional
	      grants,  frequently  promote  developments  in
	      matters which are constitutionally assigned to
	      the regions".
</blockquote><p id="p_77">In  our country national planning involves disbursements  of
vast  amounts  of  money collected as  taxes  from  citizens
residing in all the States and placed at the disposal of the
Central	 Government for the benefits of the  States  without
even  the "conditional grants" mentioned above.	 Hence,	 the
manner	in  which State Governments function and  deal	with
sums placed at their disposal by the Union Government or how
they carry on the general administration may also be matters
of considerable concern to the Union Government.
Although  Dr.  Ambedkar	 thought that  our  Constitution  is
federal	 "inasmuch  as it establishes what may be  called  a
Dual  Polity,"	he also said, in the  Constituent  Assembly,
that our Constitution makers bad avoided the 'tight mould of
federalism'  in which the American Constitution was  forged.
Dr.  Ambedkar,	one  of	 the  principal	 architects  of	 our
Constitution, considered our Constitution to be both unitary
as well as federal according to the requirements of time and
circumstances'.
</p><p id="p_78">If then our Constitution creates a Central Government  which
is  amphibian", in the sense that it can move either on	 the
federal	 or  unitary plane, according to the  needs  of	 the
situation and circumstances of a case, the question which we
are driven back to consider is whether an assessment of	 the
"situation" in which the Union Government should move either
on  the federal or unitary plane are matters for  the  Union
Government  itself  or	for  this  Court  to  consider	 and
determine.  Each organ of the Republic, is expected to	know
the  limits  of	 its own powers.   The	judiciary  comes  in
generally  only when any question of ultra vires  action  is
involved,  because questions relating to vires appertain  to
its domain.
</p><p id="p_79">I may point out that there are various aspects of  relations
between	 the  Union  and the States  governed  by  different
provisions  of the Constitution.  I may here refer to  those
which	relate	to  giving  of	"direction"  by	 the   Union
Government  to	the State Governments  because	<a href="/doc/897579/" id="a_255">article	 365</a>
provides :

	      this constitution, it shall be lawful for	 the
	      President to hold that a situation has  arisen
	      in which the government of the State cannot be
	      carried  on in accordance with the  provisions
	      of this Constitution."
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">36</span>
<p id="p_80">Articles  256  and 257 mention a wide range of	subjects  on
which the Union Government may give executive directions  to
State  Governments.  <a href="/doc/1619608/" id="a_256">Article 73(1) (a)</a> of  the	Constitution
tells  us that the Executive power of the Union	 extends  to
all  matters on which "parliament has power to	make  laws."
<a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_257">Article	 248</a>  of the Constitution vests exclusively  in	 the
Parliament residuary powers of making laws on any matter not
enumerated in the Concurrent or State Lists.  <a href="/doc/76145/" id="a_258">Article 256</a> of
the  Constitution covers cases where the President may	want
to give directions in exercise of the executive power of the
Union to a State Government in relation to a matter  covered
by an existing law made by Parliament which applies to	that
State.	But, <a href="/doc/214887/" id="a_259">article 257(1)</a> imposes a wider obligation	upon
a  State  to  exercise its powers in such a way	 as  not  to
impede	the exercise of executive power of the Union  which,
as  would appear from <a href="/doc/883495/" id="a_260">Article 73</a> of the	 Constitution,	read
with <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_261">article 248</a> may cover even a subject on which there  is
no existing law but on which some legislation by  Parliament
is possible.It	 could,	  therefore,  be   argued   that,
although, the. Constitution itselfdoes	  not	lay    down
specifically  when  the	 power	of  dissolution	 should	  be
exercised  by  the Governor on the advice of  a	 Council  of
Ministers  in the State, yet if a direction on that  matter
was properly given bythe  Union	 Government to	a  State
Government,  there is a duty to carry it out.  The time	 for
the  dissolution of a State Assembly is not covered  by	 any
specific  provision of the Constitution or any law  made  on
the  subject.	It  is	possible,  however,  for  the  Union
Government, in exercise of its residuary executive power  to
consider  it a fit subject for the issue of  an	 appropriate
direction when it considers that the political situation  in
the  country is such that a fresh election is  necessary  in
the  interest  of political stability or  to  establish	 the
confidence of the people in the Govt. of a State.
Undoubtedly,  the  subject is one on which  appropriate	 and
healthy	 conventions should develop so that the power  under
<a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_262">article	  356(1)</a>  is  neither  exercised   capriciously	  or
arbitrarily  nor  fails	 to be exercised  when	a  political
situation  really calls for it.	 If the views of  the  Union
Government  and the State Government differ on the  subject,
there  is no reason why the Union Government should not	 aid
the  development  of  what  it considers  to  be  a  healthy
practice  or convention by appropriate advice or  direction,
and,  even to exercise its powers under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_263">article	 356(1)</a>	 for
this  purpose  when it considers the observance	 of  such  a
directive  to  be  so  essential  that	the   Constitutional
machinery   cannot function as it was meant to do unless  it
interferes.  This Court cannot, at any rate, interdict	such
use  of powers under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_264">article 356(1)</a> unless and until  resort
to the provision, in a particular situation, is shown to  be
so grossly perverse and unreasonable as to constitute patent
misuse	of  this provision an excess of	 power	on  admitted
facts.	On the allegations before us we cannot reach such  a
conclusion.   And, it is not for Courts to  formulate,	and,
much  less,  to enforce a convention however,  necessary  or
just  and  proper a convention to regulate the	exercise  of
such  an executive power may be.  That is a matter  entirely
within the Executive field, of operations,
It   is	  futile  to  urge  that  <a href="/doc/6135/" id="a_265">article  172(1)</a>   of	 the
Constitution, as amended, lays down an unalterable  duration
of six years for a legislative
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">37</span>
assembly from its first meeting because this article clearly
contains   the	exception  "unless  sooner  dissolved."	  As
observed  above,  it  is no where laid down  either  in	 the
Constitution or any law dealing with holding of elections to
a  legislative assembly what circumstances will justify	 its
dissolution  sooner  than the duration	it  would  otherwise
enjoy.
</p><p id="p_81">It was argued that the only authority empowered to  dissolve
a  legislative	assembly under <a href="/doc/1782245/" id="a_266">Article 174 (2)	(b)</a>  of	 the
Constitution  was the Governor of a State who had to act  on
the advice of the Council of Ministers in the State.  It was
submitted that the Union Government could not either advise,
or in the form of advice, direct the State Government to ask
the  Governor  to  dissolve the	 State	Assembly  under	 any
circumstances.	 Apparently, the principle  of	construction
relied	upon was a much used and easily	 misused  principle;
"expressio  unius  est exclusio alterius." We do  not  think
that such a principle could help the plaintiffs before us at
all  in	 as  much as <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_267">article 356</a> of  the  Constitution	very
clearly	 provides  for the assumption by the  President	 'to
'himself  all or any of the functions of the  Government  of
the  State  and	 all  or any of	 the  powers  vested  in  or
exercisable  by	 the Governor." <a href="/doc/1782245/" id="a_268">Article 174(2)	(b)</a>  of	 the
Constitution  expressly	 vests the power of  dissolving	 the
legislative assembly in the Governor even if that had to  be
on the advice of the Council of Ministers in the State,	 but
the power to give such advice would automatically, be  taken
over by the Union Government for the purposes of dissolution
of   the   State  Assembly  when   the	 President   assumes
governmental  powers by a proclamation under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_269">Article  356(1)</a>
of  the Constitution.  A dissolution by the President  after
the  proclamation would be as good as a dissolution  by	 the
Governor of a State whose powers; are taken 'over.
The  position of the Governor as the Constitutional head  of
State  as a unit of the Indian Union as well) as the  formal
channel	 of  communication between the Union and  the  State
Government,  who  is  appointed under  <a href="/doc/686327/" id="a_270">article	155</a>  of	 the
Constitution "by the President by Warrant under his hand and
seal,"	was also touched in the course of  arguments  before
us.   On  the one hand, as the Constitutional  head  of	 the
State. he is ordinarily bound, by reason of a constitutional
convention,  by	 the  advice of	 his  Council  of  Ministers
conveyed  to  him through the Chief  Minister  barring	very
exceptional circumstances among which' may be as pointed out
by  my learned brothers Bhagwati and Iyer, JJ., in  Shamsher
Singh's case, supra (p. 875) a situation in which an  appeal
to  the electorate by a dissolution is called for.   On	 the
other  hand,  as the defender of "the Constitution  and	 the
law" and the watch-dog of the interests of the whole country
and  well-being	 of the people of his State  in	 particular,
the, Governor is vested with certain discretionary powers in
the exercise of which he can act independently.	 One of	 his
independent  functions	is the making of the report  to	 the
Union Government on the strength of which Presidential power
under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_271">Article 356(1)</a> of the Constitution could be exercised.
In so far as he acts in the larger interests of the  people,
appointed  by the President" to defend the Constitution	 and
the  Law" he acts as an observer on behalf of the Union	 and
has to keep a watch on how the administrative machinery	 and
each organ of constitutional Government is working in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">38</span>
State.	 Unless he keeps such a watch over all	governmental
activities  and the State of public feelings about  them  he
cannot	satisfactorily discharge his function of making	 the
report	which  may  form  the  basis  of  the	Presidential
satisfaction  under  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_272">Article  356(1)</a>  of  the  Constitution.
Indeed, the usual practice is that the President acts  under
<a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_273">Article	 356(1)</a> of the Constitution only on  the  Governor's
report.	  But,	the,  use of the words	"or  otherwise"	 (in
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_274">article	 356</a>) show that Presidential satisfaction  could  be
based  on  other  material as well.   This  feature  of	 our
Constitution  indicates most strikingly the extent to  which
inroads	 have been made by it on the federal  principles  of
Government.
</p><p id="p_82">Mr. Setalvad in his Tagore Law Lectures, 1974, on "UNION AND
STATE RELATIONS" has observed, while dealing with Governor's
role (at p. 164-165) :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_20">	      "The powers of the President under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_275">Article 356</a>
	      have  been  frequently  exercised	 since	 the
	      commencement   of	  the	Constitution.	 The
	      occasions for its exercise emphasise not	only
	      the  importance  of the power  in	 maintaining
	      stable governments in the State, but also	 the
	      vital  role which the Governor has to play  in
	      enabling	the Union Executive to exercise	 the
	      powers  vested in it under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_276">Article  356.</a>	 The
	      Constitutional  machinery in a State may	fail
	      to function in numerous ways.  There may be  a
	      political	  deadlock;  for  example  where   a
	      Ministry	having resigned, the Governor  finds
	      it'   impossible	 to  form   an	 alternative
	      government;  or,	where for some	reason,	 the
	      party  having  a	majority  in  the   Assembly
	      declines to form a Ministry and the Governor's
	      attempts to find a coalition Ministry able  to
	      command	a   majority   have   failed.	 The
	      Government of a State can also be regarded  as
	      not  being carried on in accordance  with	 the
	      Constitution   in	 cases	where  a   Ministry,
	      although	properly constituted, acts  contrary
	      to the provisions of the Constitution or seeks
	      to use its powers for purposes not  authorised
	      by   the	Constitution  and   the	  Governor's
	      attempts	to call the Ministry to	 order	have
	      failed.  There could also be a failure of	 the
	      constitutional  machinery where  the  Ministry
	      fails to carry out the directives issued to it
	      validly by the Union Executive in the exercise
	      of  its powers under the Constitution.   The
	      very  statement  of some	of  the	 situations,
	      which may bring about the use of the machinery
	      provided	by  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_277">Article 356</a>	 shows	the  pivotal
	      position	 which	the  Governor  occupies	  in
	      respect  of  these situations  and  the  grave
	      responsibility of his duties in the matter  of
	      reporting to the President under Articles 355:
	      and 356 of the Constitution."
</blockquote><p id="p_83">The  question  was then mooted whether that was	 being	done
under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_278">article	356</a> of the Constitution did  not  amount  to
taking over by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">39</span>
President,  acting  on the advice of the  Union	 Council  of
Ministers,  of	powers for dissolving the  State  Assemblies
upon  facts and circumstances which, in the judgment of	 the
Union  Council of Ministers, constituted sufficient  grounds
for  a	dissolution  of	 the  State  Assembly,	whereas	 the
Constitution provides that this had to be done by the  State
Government  on the advice of the Council of Ministers  in  a
State.	Such an argument is really an argument in a  circle.
It assumes that the taking over by the President, advised by
the  Union  Council of Ministers, of the  functions  of	 the
Governor, advised by the State Council of Ministers, on this
matter,	 was  outside  the purview  of	<a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_279">Article	 356(1).</a>   A
situation  in  which,  according to the view  of  the  Union
Government,  the  State	 Council of  Ministers	had  wrongly
failed	to advise the State Governor to dissolve  the  State
Legislative Assembly, so that action under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_280">Article 3 5 6 ( 1
)</a>  has to be taken, would be exceptional in  which  articles
governing  the exercise of functions normally are  suspended
and  do	 not  operate  at all.	If  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_281">article  356(1)</a>  of	 the
Constitution  or any other article contained  any  provision
which amounted to a prohibition against assumption of powers
of  dissolution	 of  State Assemblies by  the  President  of
India, it would be a different matter, but that, as we	have
repeatedly  pointed out, is not the position here.   Indeed,
such  a provision, had it been there, would have  completely
nullified  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_282">article 356(1).</a>  Obviously, a proclamation  under
<a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_283">Article 356(1)</a> to be effective must suspend the operation of
<a href="/doc/1582504/" id="a_284">article 174.</a>  It is evident that one of the reasons, perhaps
the   main  reason  for	 bringing  about  this	 exceptional
situation in the cases now before us, is the refusal of	 the
State Chief Ministers to comply with the advice sent to them
which  they equate with a 'direction' given in	exercise  of
the executive powers of the Union Government.
If constitutionally correct practises could also be  pointed
out and enforced by the Union Government so that  provisions
of our Constitution may operate in the manner in which	they
were intended to do and none of their objects is frustrated,
it  may be useful to glance at the convention which  governs
exercise  of the Crown's "prerogative" power of	 dissolution
of  Parliament	in  England.   Dicey  in  his  law  of	 the
Constitution 10th Edn., (at p. 432) observed
	      "The prerogative, in short, of dissolution may
	      constitutionally be so employed as to override
	      the will of the representative body, or as  it
	      is  popularly called.  "The People's House  of
	      Parliament."  This looks at first	 sight	like
	      saying  that in certain cases the	 prerogative
	      can be so used as to set at nought the will of
	      the  nation.  But in reality it is far  other-
</p><p id="p_84">	      wise.   The discretionary power of  the  Crown
	      occasionally   may   be,	and   according	  to
	      constitutional  precedents sometimes ought  to
	      be, used to strip an existing House of Commons
	      of  its  authority.  But the  reason  why	 the
	      House can in accordance with the	Constitution
	      be deprived of power and of existence is	that
	      an occasion has arisen on which there is	fair
	      reason  to  suppose that the  opinion  of	 the
	      House  is not the opinion of the electors.   A
	      dissolution  is in its essence an appeal	from
	      the  legal  to  the  political  sovereign.   A
	      disso-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">	      40</span>
<p id="p_85">	      lution  is allowable, or	necessary,  whenever
	      the  wishes  of the legislature  are,  or	 may
	      fairly  be presumed to be different  from	 the
	      wishes of the nation".
</p><p id="p_86">It was pointed out by Diecy that the conventional use of the
'Prerogative"  of  the Crown to dissolve  Parliament  in  an
exceptional situation, even when the Government in power had
the  support of a majority behind it, was  established.	  He
gave  two instances; one of a dissolution of  Parliament  in
1784 and another in 1834.
</p><p id="p_87">Presumably, two instances, with a gap of fifty years between
them,  were  considered	 enough	 by  Dicey  to	establish  a
convention  governing exceptional situations.  A perusal  of
other authorities, such as Anson on "The Law &amp; Custom of the
Constitution"  or  Erskine May's  "Parliamentary  Practice",
leads us to no different- result.  Dicey's statement reveals
:  firstly,  there is, according to  British  convention,  a
"right"	 of  a	Government, which  no  longer  commands	 the
support	 of a majority in the House of Commons, to demand  a
dissolution  or to force an appeal to the electorate or	 the
"Political   sovereign";   and,	 secondly,   there   is	  an
"overriding"  discretion in the Crown even to disregard	 the
advice	of  the Prime Minister, the spokesman of  the  whole
body  of Ministers,  with a majority in	 the  Lower  House
behind	him,  and to force a dissolution in  an	 exceptional
situation.
</p><p id="p_88">A recent study of "The Theory and Practice of Dissolution of
Parliament", with particular reference to the experiences of
United	Kingdom and Greece, by Dr. B. S. Markesinis, in	 the
Cambridge "International and Comparative Law" series (1972),
contains  a detailed discussion of views of various  authors
and  accounts  of political situations which had  arisen  in
more  recent times with regard to dissolutions.	 This  study
brings	out  the  grave responsibility	of  the	 Crown	when
assessing   what   Prof.    Laski   called   the   "Critical
circumstances in which the Crown may exercise its discretion
to  force a general election" which may result in "a  direct
confrontation  between	the monarch and his people"  if	 the
King acts contrary to the advice of the Government supported
by  a  majority in the House of Commons.  After	 an  illumi-
nating discussion of the views of Constitutional lawyers and
experts, such as Keith, Jennings, Laski, Hubert, and Morgan,
Dr. Markesinis refers to an impressive letter of the British
Prime Minister Mr. Asquith to the King written on 31st July,
1914.  That letter contained the following passage
	      "Sovereign   undoubtedly	has  the  power	  of
	      changing	his advisers but it is	relevant  to
	      point out that there has been during the	last
	      130 years, one occasion only on which the King
	      has   dismissed  the  Ministry   which   still
	      possessed	 the  confidence  of  the  House  of
	      Commons, (be continues :) Nothing can be	more
	      important,  in the best interest of the  Crown
	      and the Country, than that a practice, so long
	      established   and	  so   well   justified	  by
	      experience, should remain unimpaired. it frees
	      the  occupant of the throne from all  personal
	      responsibility  for the acts of the  executive
	      and the legislature."
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">41</span>
<p id="p_89">The  King expressed his gratitude to the Prime Minister	 for
advising  him  against being "dragged into  arena  of  party
politics"  whether the King "wished it or not" and acted  on
the Prime Minister's advice.
</p><p id="p_90">In so far as growth of healthy conventions on such a subject
are  essential	for  the  satisfactory	operations  of	 the
machinery  of  democratic Government, this is  a  matter  on
which  there  could  and  should be  a	broad  agreement  or
consensus  between all parties interested in a	satisfactory
working of the democratic system in this country.  It is not
a matter on which the Court can give its opinion as to what
the  proper precedent or view to follow or course of  action
to pursue in a particular situation is.	 All that this Court
can  do is to consider whether an action proposed on such  a
matter	on certain grounds, would fall under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_285">article  356(1)</a>
of  the Constitution if the Union Government and  the  State
Governments differ on the question whether, in a  particular
situation, the dissolution of the State Assembly should take
place  or  not.	  The  most that one could  say	 is  that  a
dissolution  against the wishes of the majority in  a  State
Assembly is a grave and serious matter.	 Perhaps it could be
observed  by us that it should be resorted to under  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_286">Article
356(1)</a> of the Constitution only when "a critical  situation"
has arisen.  As the study of Dr. Aarkesinis shows it is	 not
always	necessary that, under a multiple party	system,	 the
mere  defeat of a State Government in a State Assembly	must
necessarily create a situation in which a dissolution of the
State Assembly is obligatory.  If an alternate Government is
capable	 of  being formed which commands the  support  of  a
majority  in the State Assembly, it may not be ordered	even
when  a	 Government  in	 power	is  defeated  in  the  State
Assembly.  The position may, however, be very different when
a  State  Government has a majority in	the  State  Assembly
behind it but the question is whether the State Assembly and
the State Government for the time being have been so totally
and  emphatically  rejected by 'he people that	a  "critical
situation"  has	 arisen	 or is bound  to  arise	 unless	 the
political  sovereign"  is given an opportunity of  giving  a
fresh  verdict.	 A decision on such a  question	 undoubtedly
lies in the Executive realm.
</p><p id="p_91">It  may be that, if the need to an appeal to the  electorate
is put forward only as a thin disguise for punishing a State
Government  by repeated dissolutions within  short  periods,
the  use of <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_287">article 356(1)</a> for such a purpose may appear  to
be plainly outrageous and extraneous.  In such	hypothetical
and  very exceptional circumstances the action of the  Union
Government  may appear to be mala fide and in excess of	 the
power  under  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_288">article  356(1)</a>  of  the	Constitution.	But,
nothing,  like	that  is alleged in any of  the	 plaints  or
petitions.   On	 the other band, it seems  that	 the  advice
given to the Chief Ministers of different States is based on
a  matter  of  a uniform general policy	 resulting  from  an
estimate of what, in the opinion of the Union Government, is
a  critical juncture in the history of the whole  nation  so
that  the people in the States must be given an	 opportunity
of  showing whether the party in power in the States  should
or should not pursue policies which may be at variance	with
those  of the Union Government.	 No fact is alleged  showing
any  personal animus of any member of the  Union  Government
against a State Government or a State Assembly.	 As
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">42</span>
the  question  of the proper time for a dissolution  of	 the
State Assembly is riot a matter extraneous to <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_289">article 356(1)</a>
of  the	 Constitution, the most ',.hat can be said  is	that
questions raised do not go beyond sufficiency of grounds for
resorting to <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_290">article 356(1)</a> of the Constitution.
In   our  country,  the	 power	of  dissolving	 the   State
Legislature has been exercised by the Union Government or by
the  Governor  carrying	 out the  directions  of  the  Union
Government after a proclamation under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_291">article 356(1)</a> of	 the
Constitution  on  more than two dozen  occasions  since	 the
commencement  of  the  Constitution.  On  several  of  these
occasions,  Presidential Proclamations under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_292">article  356(1)</a>
were  assailed	on various grounds before High	Courts.	  On
each occasion the attack failed.  The cases cited before  us
were : <a href="/doc/585015/" id="a_293">K. K. Aboo v. Union of India &amp; Ors</a>.(1) <a href="/doc/1738995/" id="a_294">Rao  Birinder
Singh  v.  The	Union  of  India  &amp;  Ors</a>.  (2),	 In  Re	  A.
Sreeamulu(3) and <a href="/doc/1523622/" id="a_295">Bijayananda Patnaik &amp; Ors. v.	  President
of India &amp; Ors</a>.(4).
</p><p id="p_92">In  no	case  brought to our notice was	 the  power  of	 the
President to dissolve a State Assembly, either by means of a
Proclamation  under  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_296">article  356(1)</a>  itself  or  after	 it,
challenged  on	the  ground that it  falls  outside  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_297">article
356(1).</a>	  It  was urged before us that the sole	 purpose  of
'the	intended   Proclamations   being   procurement	  of
dissolutions  of the State Legislatures with the  object  of
gaining	 political  victories was both extraneous  and	mala
fide.  It seems to us that the assertions that the  exercise
of  power was mala fide in fact and in law were made on	 the
assumption  that  the whole object of the  exercise  of	 the
power is only to gain a political victory.
</p><p id="p_93">As  we	have  tried to indicate above,	attempts  to  secure
political victories, by appeals to the electorate, are parts
of the recognised rules of a democratic system of government
permitting  contests between rival parties so as to  achieve
certain other objectives.  If such a contest with the desire
for  achieving	a  political victory  in  order	 to  enforce
certain programmes, believed by the members of a party to be
beneficial  for	 the  people  in a State,  as  a  method  of
achieving the objects set out in the Preamble, are not	only
legal	and   permissible  under  the	Constitution,	but,
obviously, constitute the only possible legitimate and legal
means of attaining the power to enforce policies believed to
be  correct  by	 various parties,  according  to  their	 own
lights, it could not possibly be asserted that procuring the
dissolution of a State Legislative Assembly, with the object
of gaining a political victory, is, in itself, an extraneous
object which could not fall at ail under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_298">article 356</a> of	 the
Constitution.  In order to apply the doctrine that something
cannot	be  done  indirectly because it could  not  be	done
directly,  it  must  first be established  either  that	 the
object	or the means are legally prohibited.  In  the  cases
before	us,  it	 does not appear to us that  the  object  of
gaining	 a political victory, set out in the plaints is,  by
itself, legally prohibited.  Nor is there anything in law to
prohibit  a  recourse  to the means adopted.   There  is  no
assertion in the plaints or the petitions
(1)  A.I.R. 1965 Ker. 229.
</p><p id="p_94">(2)  A.I.R. 1968 Punj. 441.

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">43</span>
<p id="p_97">that  anything	is  being  done	 or  attempted	by   legally
prohibited means for a legally prohibited purpose.  All that
is  suggested is that it is morally represensible to try  to
obtain an electoral victory in the States by dissolving	 the
Assemblies  so as to get rid of the Congress Governments  in
power  there.  On such a question of moral worth  of  either
the  ends or the means adopted, this Court  cannot  possibly
sit  in	 judgment.  It is enough for our purposes  that	 the
plaints	  and  the  petitions  do  not	 disclose   anything
extraneous  to	the  purpose  of  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_299">Article  356	(1)</a>  of	 the
Constitution  in  the  eyes  of	 law.	The  sufficiency  or
adequacy  of the grounds for action under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_300">article 356(1)</a>  of
the  Constitution is quite another matter.  We do not  think
that we can go into that at all here.
</p><p id="p_98">We find that in the plaint of the State of Himachal  Pradesh
the  term "prerogative' has been used for the power  of	 the
State  Governor	 to dissolve a Legislative  Assembly,  under
<a href="/doc/1582504/" id="a_301">Article	 174</a>,  as  though  there was  a	 violation  of	that
"prerogative"  by some paramount "prerogative"	asserted  by
the  Union  Government.	  I  do	 not  think  that  the	term
"prerogative" can be correctly used, in its technical sense,
with   reference   to	any  power   exercised	 under	 our
Constitution.  In English law the term "prerogative" is used
for  "the residue of discretionary power left at any  moment
in  the	 hands of the Crown whether such power	be  in	fact
exercised  by the King himself or by his Ministers". (See  :
Keir &amp; Lawson's cases in Constitution Law, 5th Edn. p. 151).
Dicey  said : "Every act which the executive Government	 can
lawfully  do without the authority of the Act of  Parliament
is done in virtue of ibis prerogative". (Dicey : Law of	 the
Constitution,  10th  Edn.,  p. 425).   It  is,	however,  an
established principle of British Constitutional law that  no
claim to prerogative could survive the passing of a  statute
covering that very subject because the so-called prerogative
merges	in  the statute (Attorney General  v.  Dr.  Keyser's
Royal Hotel(1).	 It cannot conflict with statute.  Under our
Constitution  there  is no "prerogative" in  that  technical
sense.	 All  constitutional  powers are  regulated  by	 our
written Constitution.  There may be room for the development
of conventions on a matter not fully covered as to the	mode
of exercise of a discretion or power.  But, that is a matter
distinct  from "prerogative".  Under our  Constitution,	 the
residue	 of  that power, which is  neither  legislative	 nor
judicial,  is covered by the caption :	"Executive".   Thus,
the  equivalent	 of most "prerogative"	powers	would  fall,
under  our  law, under the heading  of	"executive"  powers.
Inasmuch  as the term "prerogative" is sometimes used  in  a
wider  nontechnical  sense, as something  which	 gives	pre-
eminence  or an overriding attribute to a power, it  may  be
said  that  such a power is lodged in the  Union  Government
under  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_302">Article	356(1)</a> of the Constitution  on	all  matters
covered by that provision.  The only question in such  cases
is  whether  the  matter  in relation  to  which  the  Union
Government  is proceeding or has acted is or is	 not  within

lies within that sphere, the Courts cannot interfere on	 the
ground, at any rate,, that it is extraneous.

Court it has been held that sufficiency of grounds on  which
the  order, is based could not be questioned.  Some  of	 the
dicta  found  there seem to lay down that  the	exercise  of
power to issue proclamations is not justiciable at all under
any circumstances.  This Court has not gone so far us  that.
If  it is actually stated on behalf of the Union  Government
that an action was taken on a particular ground which really
falls completely outside the purview of <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_305">Article 356(1</a>),	 the
proclamation will be vitiated, not because the	satisfaction
was  challenged	 or  called in question on  any	 ground	 but
because	 it  was admitted to be on matters  outside  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_306">Article
356(1).</a>
</p><p id="p_100">A challenge to the exercise of power to issue a proclamation
under-,	 <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_307">Article 352</a> of the Constitution would be even	more
difficult  to entertain than to one under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_308">Article 356(1)</a>  as
all these considerations would then arise which Courts	take
into  account when the Executive, which alone can  have	 all
the necessary information and means to judge such an  issue,
tells Courts that the nation is faced with a grave  national
Emergency  during which its very existence or stability	 may
be  at	stake.	That was the principle	which  governed	 the
decision of the House of Lords in Liversidge v. Anderson(1).
The  principle	is summed up in the salutary maxim  :  Salus
Populi	Supreme Lex.  And, it was that principle which	this
Court,	deprived  of the power to examine or  question-	 any
materials on which such declarations may be based, acted  in

A reference was made by both sides to Bhagat Singh and	Ors.
v.The King-Emperor,(3), where the Privy Council	 interpreted
the provisions of section 72 of the Government of India Act,
which authorised the Governor-General in cases of  Emergency
to promulgate ordinances "for the peace and good  Government
of  British India or any put thereof which was not  to	last
beyond	six months".  In that case, an, attempt was made  to
question  the existence of a State of  Emergency.,  Viscount
Dunedin, observed (at p. 172)
	      "A  state of emergency is something that	does
	      not  permit  of  any  exact  definition  :  It
	      cannotes	a  state  of  matters  calling	 for
	      drastic action, which is to be judged as	such
	      by  some	one.  It is more than  obvious	that
	      someone  must be the Governor-General, and  he
	      alone.   Any other view would  render  utterly
	      inapt the whole provision.  Emergency  demands
	      immediate	  action,   and	  that	 action	  is
	      prescribed  to  be  taken	 by  the   Governor-
</p><p id="p_101">	      General'.
</p><p id="p_102">The  power  of	the Governor-General was  described  as	 "an
absolute;  power  "  in Bhagat	Singh's	 case  (supra),	 but
learned counsel for the plaintiffs relied on the observation
there  that  "it  is only to be used  in  extreme  cases  of
necessity where the good Government of India'

demands	 it".  We do not think that much assistance  can  be
derived	 from  a provision of the Government of	 India	Act,
1935,  which was really the precurser of <a href="/doc/1090693/" id="a_311">Article 123</a> of	 our
Constitution and meant for use in a different context in  an
Imperialistic  era.   Nevertheless,  it	 shows	that.	even
without a provision ousting the jurisdiction of the  Courts,
the  subjective	 satisfaction of  the  Governor-General	 was
held.  to  be  unquestionable.	 Considerations	 which	have
arisen before us while considering the use and the ambit  of
<a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_312">article 356(1)</a> of our Constitution were not before the Privy
Council at all in that case.
</p><p id="p_105"><a href="/doc/892009/" id="a_313">King Emperor v. Benorilal Sarnia &amp; Ors</a>.(1), also relating to
the,  ordinance making powers of the Governor-General  under
section 72 of the Government of India Act, 1935, was  cited.
In  that  case, Bhagat Singh's case  (supra)  was  commented
upon.  It was observed (at p. 62)
	      "The definition of emergency in Bhagat Singh's
	      case does not purport to be exhaustive, but it
	      does  say that it connotes a state of  matters
	      calling  for  drastic  action,  and  that	  it
	      demands immediate action.	 Emergency does	 not
	      mean  emergency at large.	 Under s. 72 of
	      the Government of India Act the emergency with
	      which  the Governor-General is dealing  should
	      be  an existing emergency and should call	 for
	      the particular kind of immediate action  which
	      be  proposes to take.  If the particular	kind
	      of  emergency which a  the  Governor-General's
	      opinion justifies a particular kind of action.
	      is  in  itself  wholly  in  prospect  and	 not
	      present, then although there may be present an
	      emergency	 of some other kind, that would	 not
	      justify,	under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_314"> S. 72</a>,  the  ordinance  being
	      made.    The   existence	of   the   emergency
	      requiring	 immediate  action  is,	 under	that
	      section,	the basis to a	condition  precedent
	      which must be fulfilled by himself alone".
This  shows that the Court could inquire into the  existence
of a condition precedent to the use of emergency powers.
A  reference  was also made to the  following  passage	from
Padfield &amp; Ors. v. Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries &amp; Food
and Ors.(2) at p. 1006)
	      "It is said that the decision of the  Minister
	      is administrative and not judicial.  But	that
	      does  not	 mean that he can do as,  he  likes,
	      regardless  of  right or wrong.  Nor  does  it
	      mean that the courts are powerless to  correct
	      him.    Good  administration   requires	that
	      complaints  should  be investigated  and	that
	      grievances    should   be	  remedied.	When
	      Parliament has set up machinery for that	very
	      purpose,	it is not for the Minister to  brush
	      it on one side.  He should not refuse to	have
	      a complaint investigated without good reason".
Cases before us are not those of a grave national  emergency
of  the	 kind. covered by <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_315">article 352</a> of  the  Constitution.

<p id="p_107">analogous   principles	seem  to  govern  the  exercise	  of

highest	 executive authorities of the Indian Union  who	 are
expected  to  act with the utmost sense	 of  responsibility.
Such  a	 consideration,	 combined  with	 the  existence	  of
Parliamentary  control	on the exercise of  such  powers  by
ministers responsible directly to Parliament, was taken into
account,  in  Liversidge's  case (supra),  to  abstain	from
judicial interference.
</p><p id="p_108">Courts	have consistently held issues raising  questions  of
mere sufficiency of grounds of executive action, such as the
one under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_317">Article 356(1)</a> no doubt is to be  non-justiciable.
The  amended  <a href="/doc/1243357/" id="a_318">article 356(5)</a> of the  Constitution  indicates
that  the  Constitution makers did not wan+  such  an  issue
raising	 a  mere question of sufficiency of  grounds  to  be
justiciable.	To  the	 same  effect  are  the	  provisions
contained  in <a href="/doc/1937609/" id="a_319">Article 352(5</a><a href="/doc/1850059/" id="a_320">), 360(5).</a>	Similarly,  Articles
123(4),	 213(4), 239B(4) bar the jurisdiction of  Courts  to
examine	 matters which lie within the executive	 discretion.
Such  discretion  is governed by a large element  of  policy
which  is not amenable to the jurisdiction of courts  except
in  cases of patent or indubitable mala fides or  excess  of
power.	 Its  exercise	rests on  materials  which  are	 not
examinable  by Courts.	Indeed, it is difficult	 to  imagine
how  the  grounds of action under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_321">article  356(1)</a>  could  be
examined  when	<a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_322">article 74(2)</a> lays down that  "the  question
whether	 any,  and if so, what advice was  tendered  by	 the
Ministers  to the President, shall not be inquired  into  in
any Court."
</p><p id="p_109">It is true that, as indicated above, the advice tendered  by
the Ministers to the President cannot be inquired into.	  It
is also clear beyond doubt that the amended <a href="/doc/1951021/" id="a_323">article 74(1)</a> of
the  Constitution,  whose validity has not  been  challenged
before us by any party, makes it obligatory on the President
to  act in accordance with the advice tendered by the  Union
Council	 of  Ministers, to him through the  Prime  Minister.
Nevertheless,  if  all	the grounds of	action	taken  under
<a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_324">article	 356(1)</a>	 of the Constitution are  disclosed  to	 the
public	by  the Union Government and its own  disclosure  of
grounds	  reveals   that  a  constitutionally	or   legally
prohibited or extraneous or collateral purpose is sought  to
be  achieved  by  a proclamation under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_325">article	356</a>  of	 the
Constitution,  this Court will not shirk its duty to act  in
the manner in which the law may then oblige it to act.	But,
when we find that allegations made in the plaints and in the
petitions  before  us  relate, in  substance,  only  to	 the
sufficiency of the grounds of action under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_326">article 356(1)</a> of
the Constitution, and go no further, we cannot proceed	fur-
ther with the consideration of the plaints under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_327">Article 131</a>
or the petitions under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_328">Article 32</a> of the Constitution.
I would not like to leave certain other matters also  argued
before us untouched in this fairly comprehensive  expression
of our views.  It was urged that the power of dissolution of
a State Legislative Assembly, even if it could be assumed by
the  President	under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_329">Article 356(1)</a>  of  the  Constitution,
after  a  failure  of the State Government to  carry  out  a
direction of the Union Government on the subject, could	 no+
be  exercised  unless and until the matter bad	been  placed
before	both  the Houses of Parliament so that it  bad	been
subjected  to  such control as either of the two  Houses  of
Parliament may chose to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">47</span>
exercise  over it.  Proclamations under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_330">article	 356(1)</a>	 are
bound to be placed under <a href="/doc/1133729/" id="a_331">article 356(3)</a> of the	Constitution
before	each house of Parliament.   Unfortunately,  however,
for  this  line of argument, there is not  only	 nothing  in
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_332">article	 356</a>  to  make a consideration by  either  House  of
Parliament  a  condition precedent to the  exercise  of	 the
power of dissolution of a State Legislative Assembly by	 the
President  under  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_333">article 356(1</a>), but, on  the	other  hand,
<a href="/doc/1133729/" id="a_334">article 356(3).</a> makes it clear that the only effect of	even
a  failure  or	refusal by either  House  of  Parliament  to
approve the proclamation is that it ceases to operate  after
two  months.  Obviously, this means that it operates for  at
least  two  months.  Hence, whatever is done  in  these	 two
months	cannot be held to be illegal for 'hat reason  alone.
The  interpretation  placed  before  us	 for  acceptance  is
directly  opposed to the language of the provisions  of	 the
Constitution.	It  has,  therefore, to be  rejected  by  us
outright  as  quite unreasonable and" unacceptable.   It  is
true  that  the exercise of power under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_335">article 356</a>  of	 the
Constitution  is  subject to  Parliamentary  control.	This
means that it is subject to such control as the two  Houses,
out  of	 which the Council of States really  represents	 the
State Assemblies, may be able to exercise during the  period
for  which  the proclamation lasts.  But, the  existence  of
such Parliamentary control, as a safeguard, cannot  possibly
nullify	 the legality of what is done in the  period  during
which the Proclamation lasts.
</p><p id="p_110">It  was	 also contended by Mr. R. K. Garg that,	 unless	 the
Parliament acts legislatively for the State Legislature, the
incurring  of  any expenditure, by the Governor	 or  anybody
else  after a Presidential Proclamation under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_336">article	356</a>,
would  not be permissible in view of <a href="/doc/1497987/" id="a_337">Article 357(1)  (c)</a>  of
the Constitution.  After making such an assumption, we	were
asked to import an implied prohibition against a dissolution
of a State Legislative Assembly unless and until both Houses
of Parliament bad discussed and approved of it.

under  <a href="/doc/1330132/" id="a_343">Article	356(1) (a)</a> of the Constitution.	  It  really
governs the position when the legislative ,powers of a State

may  or may not contain also a declaration  contemplated  by

the question of incurring expenditure under the authority of

from   the  Consolidated  Found	 awaiting  a   sanction	  by

</p><p id="p_112">(b)  of	 the  Constitution  and the  Parliament	 is  not  in

there is a prolonged presidential rule requiring the vesting
of  the functions of the State legislature in Parliament  so
that  the  President  may be able to  authorise	 expense  in
anticipation of Parliamentary sanction when the House of the

under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_357">Article 131</a> is a peculiar one meant for special  kinds
of disputes in which States, as such, ought to be interested
and not merely Governments of States which may come and	 go.
It  was pointed out that, if the Union Government sought  to
deprive	 a State of any constitutional right it would  be  a
different  matter  which  could	 be  taken  up	by  a  State
Government  on behalf of the State or its people.   But,  it
was  submitted, there is no right given to any State by	 the
Constitution  that  its Government or  Legislative  Assembly
would  continue	 undissolved for any  period.	The  dispute
before us relates to the time at which and the authority  by
which  the  power of dissolution could be exercised  in	 the
situation  which  confronted the people in the	nine  States
concerned.

of India &amp; Anr</a>.(1) and the United Provinces v. The Governor-
General	 in Council.(2) It seems to me that the decision  of
this  Court  in State of Bihar and Union of India  and	Anr.
(supra)	 was largely based upon the assumption that  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_359">Article
131</a>  was  meant	 to cover the same area as  s.	204  of	 the
Government  of India Act.  Moreover, the learned  Additional
Solicitor General, appearing on behalf of the Union, did not
press	the  argument  that  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_360">article  131</a>  is  confined	  to
declaratory decrees in view of the fact that (as Mr. Seervai
pointed	 out  in the Constitutional Law of India,  2nd	Edn.
Vol.  11  at p. 1385) <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_361">article 142 (1)</a>  of  the	Constitution
provides for enforcement of decrees of this Court.  The view
expressed  in  the Bihar case (supra) seemed  to  have	been
affected  considerably	by the fact that there was  no	pro-
vision	in  the	 Government of India Act  of  1935  for	 the
enforcement of the decrees of the Federal Court, but <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_362">Article
142(1)</a> seems to have been overlooked in that case.
<a href="/doc/1415462/" id="a_363">Article	 300</a> of the Constitution provides, inter alia,	that
"the Government of a State may sue or be sued by the name of
the State".  From this, Mr. Niren De wanted us to infer that
there  was  no	distinction between a State  and  the  State
Government  as	juristic entities.  Even if  there  be	some
grounds for making a distinction between a State's interests
and rights and those of its Government or its members, I  do
not  think that we need take a too restrictive or  a  hyper-
technical view of the State's rights to sue for any  rights,
actual	or  fancied, which the State Government	 chooses  to
take  up  on behalf of the State concerned in a	 suit  under
<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_364">Article	 131.</a>  Moreover as we have decided not to grant	 any
reliefs	 after	having heard detailed  arguments  and  fully
considered the merits of contentions advanced by both sides,
I do not think that we need determine, on this occasion, the
precise scope of a suit under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_365">Article 131.</a>  I prefer to base
my judgment on other grounds.

Petitions in limine.  Afterall, we had not proceeded  beyond
the  stage  of hearing certain	preliminary  objections	 put
forward by Mr. Soli Sorabji, Additional Solicitor General to
the  maintainability of the suits and petitions	 before	 us.

already recorded.  The parties will bear their own costs.
CHANDRACHUD, J.-The Lok Sabha in which the Congress (R)	 had
an  overwhelming majority was dissolved on January 18,	1977
though	under the Constitution (42nd <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_366">Amendment) Act</a>, it	 had
another year to run out its extended term.  Fresh  elections
were held to the Lok Sabha in March 1977 in which the ruling
party  lost its majority and went out of power which it	 had
exercised since Independence.  On March 24, 1977 the  Janata
party which secured the verdict of the electorate formed the
new  government	 at the Centre.	 This  is  an  unprecedented
event  since,  for  the first time in the  history  of	this
country,  the ruling party at the Centre is not in power  in
any  of the federating States.	On the date that the  Janata
party took office, the Congress (R) was in power in  various
States	including Bihar.  Haryana, Himachal Pradesh,  Madhya
Pradesh, Orissa, Punjab.  Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and	West
Bengal.
</p><p id="p_126">On  April 18, 1977 Shri Charan Singh, Union  Home  Minister,
addressed  a letter to the Chief Ministers of  these  States
"earnestly commending" for their consideration that they may
advise the Governors of their respective States "to dissolve
the  State Assembly in exercise of the power  under  <a href="/doc/1782245/" id="a_367">Article
174(2)(b)</a>  and	seek a fresh mandate from  the	electorate."

be "consistent with constitutional precedents and democratic
practices."

nine Congress-ruled States and holding of fresh	 elections",
since  "a serious doubt had been cast on their enjoying	 the
peoples' confidence, their party having been rejected in the
recent	Lok  Sabha elections".	A report of  this  interview
appeared in various newspapers including the 'Statesman'  of

</p><p id="p_130">In  substance, the suits and writ petitions have been  filed
to obtain a declaration that the directive contained in	 the

legally or, constitutionally obliged to comply with it, that

Petitioners  complain of the deprivation of their  right  of
property   :since,   if	 the  Legislative   Assemblies	 are

Minister's directive.
</p><p id="p_131">The  learned  Additional  Solicitor-General  has  raised   a
preliminary  objection to the maintainability of  the  suits
which  may  first  be disposed of.  <a href="/doc/271860/" id="a_371">Article  131(a)</a>  of	 the
Constitution  confers on the Supreme Court, subject  to	 the
other  provisions  of the Constitution,	 exclusive  original
jurisdiction in any dispute between the Government of  India
and  one  or more States, if and in so far  as	the  dispute
involves any question (whether of law or fact) on which	 the
existence  or extent of a legal right depends.	It is  urged
by  the	 Additional  Solicitor	General	 that  the   dispute
involved  in  the suits filed by the State,  Governments  is
outside	 the scope of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_372">art. 131</a> since the dispute is not	 be-
tween  the  Government of India and State as such,  but	 the
dispute	 is between the Government of India on the one	hand
and  each of the nine State Governments on the	other.	 The
dispute relates to the question whether the State Assemblies
should	be  dissolved, and that, according to  the  counsel,
does  not  involve any question, on which the  existence  or
extent	of  a  legal right  depends.   Whether	the.   State
Assemblies  should  be	dissolved  or not  is  a  matter  of
political expediency and though the Government for the	time
being  in  power  in  a	 State	may  be	 interested  in	 the
continuance of the Legislative Assembly 'for the full  term,
the  State  has no legal right to ensure  such	continuance.
Indeed, it is urged, the State, apart from the State Govern-
ment,  is  not	even interested in the	question  whether  a
particular  Legislative	 Assembly should or  should  not  be
dissolved  because the State as a constitutional  entity  is
never  interested in the complexion of the Government.	 The
argument, in other words, is that Legislative Assemblies may
come  and go but the State lives for ever and therefore	 the
dispute is outside the purview of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_373">Art. 131.</a>
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">53</span>
<p id="p_132">The preliminary objection is based on an unpragmatic view of
the functioning of the-Constitution and has therefore to be:
rejected.   <a href="/doc/579323/" id="a_374">Article  367</a>  of the  Constitution	applies	 the
<a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_375">General	 Clauses  Act</a>, 1897 for the  interpretation  of	 the
Constitution but nothing contained in. <a href="/doc/1063385/" id="a_376">section 3(58)</a> of that
Act,  which  defines  "State" or  in  <a href="/doc/1063385/" id="a_377">section  3(60)</a>  which,
defines	 "State	 Government" helps  determine  the  question
whether	 suits	of the present nature are,  foreign  to	 the
scope  of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_378">art. 131.</a>  The work-a-day definitions	 of  "State"
and "State Government" contained in the <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_379">General Clauses	 Act</a>
neither touch upon the problem of alleged dichotomy  between
a  State  and its government nor do they,  even	 if  applied
literally, throw any useful light on. the question whether a
dispute	 regarding the dissolution of a State  Assembly	 can
legitimately  be  propounded or defended by the State  as  a
perpetual political entity.  Truly, the definitions say	 no,
more than this : "State" means a State specified in the	 1st
Schedule  of the Constitution and "State  Government"  means
"The  Governor".  All of the six States who have  filed	 the
suits  in this Court are included in the 1st Schedule.	 And
though	there  is a point that turns on the non-use  of	 the
expression  "State Government" in <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_380">art. 131</a>, a point which  I
will consider presently, the fact remains that there is	 no
occasion for applying the dictionary of the, <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_381">General Clauses
Act</a>, <a href="/doc/174566148/" id="a_382">section 3(60)</a>, to the interpretation of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_383">art. 13 1.</a>
The absence of the expression "State Government" and the use
in its place of the expression "State" in <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_384">art. 131</a>, is	said
to furnish intrinsic evidence that for a suit to fall  under
that Article, the dispute must arise between the  Government
of  India and a State, not between the Government  of  India
and  the Government of a State.	 The intrinsic evidence,  it
is  argued, assumes greater credibility in the context	that
the article does employ the expression "Government of India"
when	what	was   meant   was   the	   government,	  as
contradistinguisbed  from  the State.  The presence  of	 the
particular expressions in <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_385">art. 131</a> does not, in my  opinion,
support	 the inference, suggested on behalf of the Union  of
India.	The use of the phrase "Government of India" in	<a href="/doc/271860/" id="a_386">art.
131 (a)</a> and <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_387">(b)</a> does not mean that one party to the  dispute
has  to,  be  the  Government of  the  day  at	the  Centre.
"Government  of	 India" means "Union of	 India"	 because  if
there  be  merit  in  the  logic  that	<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_388">art.  131</a>  does	 not
comprehend  disputes in which the Government of a. State  as
contrasted  with  the State itself is  interested,  it	must
follow	that correspondingly, the "Government of India"	 too
cannot	mean the Government for the time being in  power  at
the  centre.  The true construction of <a href="/doc/271860/" id="a_389">art. 131(a</a>), true  in
substance and true pragmatically, is that dispute must arise
between the Union of India and a State.
</p><p id="p_133">This  may  sound  paradoxical  because	if  the	 preliminary
objection is unsustainable, it would be easier to. say	that
the  expression "Government of India" means  "Government  in
office"	 and  the expression "State' means the	State  as  a
polity	and not "the Government in Office'.  But  convenient
interpretations	 are apt to blur the significance of  issues
involved for interpretations.  Therefore, the effort has  to
be to accept what the words truly mean and to, work out	 the
Constitutional	scheme	as it may reasonably be	 assumed  to
have been conceived.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">54</span>
<p id="p_134">The  dispute between the Union of India and a  State  cannot
but be a dispute which arises out of the differences between
the Government in office at the Centre and the Government in
office	in the State.  'In office' means 'in power' but	 the
use  of the latter expression may prudently be avoided	with
the  realization  of what goes with power.  But there  is  a
further	 prerequisite  which narrows down the ambit  of	 the
class  of  disputes  which  fall  within  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_390">Art.	131.</a>	That
requirement  is	 that the dispute must involve	a  question,
whether of law or fact, on which the existence or extent  of
a  legal  right	 depends.  It is  this	qualification  which
affords the true guide for determining whether a  particular
dispute	 is  comprehended within <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_391">art.  131.</a>   Mere  wrangles
between	 governments  have no place in the  scheme  of	that
article.   They have to be resolved elsewhere and  by  means
less  solemn  and sacrosanct than a court  proceeding.	 The
purpose of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_392">art. 131</a> is to afford a forum for the  resolution
of disputes which depend for their decision on the existence
or extent of a legal right.  It is only when a legal, not  a
mere political, issue arises touching upon the existence  or
extent of a legal right that <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_393">art. 131</a> is attracted.
It  seems to me impossible to hold that the suits  filed  by
the  six States do not raise a dispute involving a  question
depending  upon	 the existence or extent of a  legal  right.
The  plaintiffs, by their suits, directly  and	specifically
question the constitutional right and authority of the Union
Government  to	issue a directive to the  State	 Governments
commending that the Chief Ministers should tender a  certain
advice to their Governors.  The plaintiffs also question the
constitutional right of the Union Government to dissolve the
State  Assemblies  on  the grounds  mentioned  in  the	Home
Minister's letter to the Chief Ministers.  Thus a legal, not
a  political, issue arising out of the existence and  extent
of  a  legal right squarely arises and the suits  cannot  be
thrown out as falling outside the purview of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_394">art. 131.</a>
The   error  of	 the  preliminary  objection  lies  in	 the
assumption that it is necessary for attracting <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_395">art. 131</a> that
the  plaintiff	must assert a legal right in  itself.	That
article contains no such restriction and it is sufficient in
order  that  its  provisions may apply	that  the  plaintiff
questions the legal or constitutional right asserted by	 the
defendant, be it the Government of India or any other State.
Such  a challenge brings the suit within the terms  of	<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_396">art.
131</a>  for, the question for the decision of the Court is	 not
whether	 this  or that particular  legislative	Assembly  is
entitled to continue in office but whether the Government of
India,	which asserts the constitutional right	to  dissolve
the  Assembly  on the grounds alleged,	possesses  any	such
right.
</p><p id="p_135">I find it difficult to accept that the State as a polity  is
not  entitled  to  raise a dispute of  this  nature.   In  a
federation, whether classical or quasi-classical, the States
are  vitally interested in the definition of the  powers  of
the  Federal  Government on one hand and their	own  on	 the
other.	 A  dispute bearing upon the  delineation  of  those
powers is precisely the one in which the federating  States,
no less than the Federal Government itself, are	 interested.
The States, therefore, have the locus
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">55</span>
and the interest to contest and seek an adjudication of	 the
claim  set  up	by  the	 Union	Government.   The  bond	  of
constitutional	obligation between the Government  of  India
and the States sustains that locus.
</p><p id="p_136">The expression "legal right" which occurs in <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_397">art. 131</a> has to
be understood in its proper perspective.  In a strict sense,
legal rights are correlative of legal duties and are defined
as   interests	 which	 the  law   protects   by   imposing
corresponding duties on others.	 But in a generic sense, the
word  "right"  is used to mean an immunity  from  the  legal
power  of  another immunity is exemption from the  power  of
another	 in  the same way as liberty is exemption  from	 the
right of another.  Immunity, in shirt, is no-subjection."(1)
R.W.M. Dias says in his "Jurisprudence" (1976 Ed.  pp.-33-4)
that  the  word "right" has undergone successive  shifts  in
meaning	 and  connotes four different ideas  concerning	 the
activity,   or	potential  activity,  of  one  person	with
reference   to	 another.    One   of	these	four   jural
relationships, according to the learned author, is the	"you
cannot"	 relationship, which is the same thing as the  right
of  immunity  which  "denotes  freedom	from  the  power  of
another" (p. 58).  Paton's book on Jurisprudence (3rd Ed. p.
</p><p id="p_137">256)  contains	a similar exposition of legal  rights.	 The
legal right of the States consists in their immunity, in the
sense  of  freedom from the power of the  Union	 Government.
They  are  entitled, under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_398">art. 131</a>, to	 assert	 that  right
either by contending in the absolute that the Centre has  no
power  to  dissolve the Legislative Assemblies or  with	 the
qualification  that such a power cannot be exercised on	 the
ground stated.
</p><p id="p_138">It  is true that the State, like the British Monarch,  never
dies.  A Legislative Assembly may be dissolved, a Council of
Ministers  may go out of power, the President's rule may  be
introduced or imposed, or an emergency may be declared which
can   conceivably  affect  the	States'	 power	in   matters
legislative   and  executive.	The  State  survives   these
upheavals.   But it is constitutionally unsound to say	that
the  State, as a political entity, has no legal interest  in
such  cataclysmic  events and no legal rights to  assert  in
relation  thereto.   Were it so, which then are,  the  legal
rights	 which	 the  State,  as  distinguished	  from	 its
Government,  can  agitate under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_399">Art. 131 ?</a> Whatever  be	 the
nature of the claim, the argument can always be put  forward
that the Government, not the State, is interested in  making
that  claim.   Such a rigid interpretation of the  scope  of
<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_400">art.  131</a>  will	 virtually reduce it to	 a  dead-letter	 and
destroy	 a precious safeguard against the use  of  arbitrary
power.	  The  interpretation  canvassed  by   the   learned
Additional Solicitor-General must therefore, be avoided,  in
so  far as the language of the article permits it, which  in
my opinion it does.
</p><p id="p_139">The  debates of the Constituent Assembly (Vol. 8,  pp.	588-

<p id="p_141">first issue which related to the question whether the  suits

judgment  in  that case is that it said	 that  the  disputes
under  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_404">art. 131</a> should be; "in respect of legal	 rights	 and
not  disputes of a political character" and that  though  it

is  certain  that the legal right which is  the	 subject  of
dispute	 must arise in the context of the  Constitution	 and
the Federalism it sets up" (p. 529).  These observations  do
not affect the constitution which I have placed on <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_406">art. 131.</a>
1 have endeavoured to show that it is competent to the State
Governments to bring suits of the present nature under	that
article	 and that by these suits, the State Governments	 are
raising a legal, not a political issue.	 Their assertion  is
that   the  Government	of  India  does	 not   possess	 the
constitutional power claimed by it and therefore, this Court
should	declare that they are- immune from the	exercise  of
that  power.   The  States  assert  their  legal  right,  of
immunity which, as explained above, denotes freedom from the
power of another.
</p><p id="p_142">The  preliminary objection raised by the learned  Additional
Solicitor  General to the maintainability of the suits	must
therefore be rejected.
</p><p id="p_143">The writ petitions have, however, no cause of action such as
can   sustain  their  petitions	 for  the   enforcement	  of
fundamental rights under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_407">art. 32</a> of the Constitution.	They
contend that the threatened dissolution of the,	 Legislative

them  of  their right to draw the salary to which  they	 are
entitled  as such members.  That, according to them,  is  an
infringement  of  <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_408">art. 19(1) (f)</a> of the	 Constitution  which
guarantees  to all citizens the right to acquire,  hold	 and

fundamental  rights  on hypothetical considerations  are  to
entertained   by  this	Court  under  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_409">art.  32.</a>	   But	 the
proclamation   having  since  been  issued,  it	  would	  be
hypertechnical	to dismiss the writ petitions on the  ground
that there was no invasion of the petitioners' rights on the
date when the petitions were filed in this Court.
But  the  violation  of the fundamental	 right	to  property
complained of by the petitioners is indirect and remote, not
direct	or  proximate.	By the proclamation  issued  by	 the
President  under  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_410">art.	356(1)</a>	of  the	 Constitution,	 the
Legislative  Assemblies	 of nine States were  dissolved	 and
what  is commonly known as the President's rule was  imposed
on  those States.  As a result, the writ petitioners  ceased
to,  be	 members of the.  Legislative Assembles.  And  as  a
result	of their ceasing to be such members, their right  to
draw salary, which they could only draw if they were members
of  the Assemblies, came to an end.  Though  the  petitioner
cannot	be  denied  relief on the ground  that	it  was	 not
intended  by  issuing the proclamation to  deprive  them  of
their  salary,	Yet  the writ Petitions	 are  liable  to  be
dismissed  on  the  ground that the injury  to	the  alleged
fundamental right of the petitioners is too indirect
and remote.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">57</span>
<p id="p_145">Nevertheless,  I  would like to deal  with  'lie  contention
raised	by Mr. R. K. Garg on behalf of the writ	 petitioners
that  the  proclamation issued by the President	 under	<a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_411">Art.
356(1)</a> of the Constitution cannot have any force and  cannot
be  acted  upon without the approval of both Houses  of	 the
Parliament.    This  contention	 is   wholly   misconceived.
<a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_412">Article	  356(1)</a>   empowers  the  President   to   issue   a
proclamation  if, on receipt of a report from the,  Governor
of  a State or otherwise, he is, satisfied that a  situation
has  arisen in which the government of the State  cannot  be
carried	 on  in	 accordance  with  the	provisions  of	 the
Constitution.	<a href="/doc/1133729/" id="a_413">Article	 356(3)</a>	 enjoins  that	every	such
proclamation  shall be laid before each House of  Parliament
and  shall,  except where, it is a proclamation	 revoking  a
previous proclamation, cease to operate at the expiration of
two  months unless before the expiration of that  period  it
has   been  approved  by  resolutions  of  both	 Houses	  of
Parliament.   It,  is  impossible to hold in  view  of	this
express	 provision  that the proclamation can  have  neither
force  nor validity until it is approved by the	 Parliament.
The  scheme  of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_414">art. 356</a> is that  the;	proclamation  issued
under it will remain in operation for a period of two months
in any event.  If it is approved by resolutions of both	 the
Houses	of Parliament before the expiration of	two  months,
its operation is extended for the period mentioned in clause
(4) of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_415">art. 356.</a>  But whether or not it is so approved,	 the
proclamation has an assured life for a period of two  months
and its validity during that period cannot be, whittled down
by reading into <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_416">art. 356</a> a condition precedent in the nature
of parliamentary approval which, plainly, is not to be found
therein.  The proviso to clause (3) of art.. 356 makes	this
position clearer still.	 If the proclamation is issued at  a
time  when  the Lok Sabha is dissolved	or  its	 dissolution
takes  place during the period of two months, and the  Rajya
Sabha,	but not the Lok Sabha, approves of the	proclamation
within two months, it ceases to operate at the expiration of
thirty	days  from the date on which the  reconstituted	 Lok
Sabha  first  sits.  If before the expiry of  the  aforesaid
period	of thirty days, the Lok Sabha too approves  it,	 its
life  will  be extended for the period mentioned  in  clause
(4).  In other words', the prior approval of the  Parliament
or ally of its two Houses is not necessary to give  validity
to the proclamation.  What would happen if the	proclamation
is disapproved by either or both Houses of Parliament within
two months does not arise for decision in these proceedings,
and though, it would appear as a matter of constitutionality
that  the proclamation can nevertheless remain in  operation
for a period of two months, it is reasonable to suppose that
faced  with  such disapproval, a mature	 political  judgment
would lean in favour of the revocation of the  proclamation.
Such constitutional crises cannot furnish a safe clue to the
interpretation of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_146">The contrast between the provisions of arts. 356 and 123  is
illuminating.	<a href="/doc/1090693/" id="a_417">Article 123</a> which empowers the President  to
promulgate ordinances provides by clause (2) that every such
ordinance  shall cease to operate at the expiration  of	 six
weeks from the reassembly of Parliament; if, however, before
the   expiry   of  the	six   week's   period,	 resolutions
disapproving the proclamation are passed by both Houses,  it
ceases	to operate upon the passing of the second  of  those
resolutions.   Thus,  whereas a proclamation issued  by	 the
President under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_418">Art. 356</a>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">58</span>
continues  in  operation for a period of two months  in	 any
event, an. ordinance issued by the same dignitary ceases  to
operate	 no  sooner than the second of the  two	 resolutions
disapproving is passed by a House of Parliament.
The reason for this distinction is evident from the language
and context of the respective provisions.  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_419">Article 356</a> which
occurs	in  the	 Chapter called	 "Emergency  Provisions"  is
intended  to  be resorted to in that  exceptional  class  of
situations,  which  though have been  occurring	 too  often,
where  the government of the State cannot be carried  on  in
accordance  with  the provisions of the	 Constitution.	 The
breakdown   of	 the  Constitution  in	 the   affairs	 and
administration of the State is the occasion for the exercise
of  the	 emergency  provision contained in  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_420">art.  356.</a>	 The
framers	 of  the Constitution perhaps intended that  such  a
serious situation can be dealt with effectively, only if the
President  is  empowered to issue a  proclamation  and	that
proclamation is given a minimum life of two months,  whether
the  Parliament approves it or not.  On the other hand,	 the
power  to  issue an ordinance is limited to  occasions	when
neither	 of  the  two Houses of Parliament  is	in  session.
Since that power is co-related partly to both Houses of Par-
liament being in recess, if was provided that the  ordinance
shall  lapse on the expiry of six weeks from the  reassembly
of  Parliament, and if it is disapproved by both the  Houses
within	that period, upon the passing of the second  of	 the
two resolutions.
</p><p id="p_147">Mr.  Garg  expressed  a	 grave concern	for  the  future  of
democracy,  if this be the true interpretation of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_421">art.	356.</a>
That  argument	does  not  appeal to  me  because  the	same
Constitution under which the people of this country resolved
to constitute India into a Sovereign "Democratic"  Republic,
gave  to it a law of laws containing empowerment  to  detain
its citizens, to pass ordinances and to declare emergencies.
A  declaration	of emergency brings in its trail a  host  of
consequences  calculated  to  impair  both  the	  democratic
foundation  and the federal structure of  our  Constitution.
The  executive power of the Union then extends to giving  of
directions  to	any  State as to the  manner  in  which	 the
executive  power thereof is to be exercised; the power	of
Parliament to make laws extends to matters not enumerated in
the  Union List; the restraints of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_422">Art. 19</a> on the  power  of
the  State to make any law or to take any  executive  action
are  removed; and it is a well-known fact of recent  history
that  the  right to move tiny Court for the  enforcement  of
fundamental rights can be suspended.  If the power to  apply
such  drastic remedies and to pass such draconian laws is  a
part  of the democratic functioning of the Constitution,  it
is  small  wonder  that	 not  only  does  the	Presidential
proclamation  under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_423">art. 356</a> not require the prior  approval
of  the	 Parliament but it has full force and effect  for  a
minimum period of two months, approvals or no approval.	 The
reason of this rule is that there may be situations in which
it  is imperative to act expeditiously and recourse  to	 the
parliamentary process may, by reason of the delay  involved,
impair rather than strengthen the functioning of  democracy-
The  Constitution ha-, therefore provided  safety-valves  to
meet extra ordinary situations.	 They have an impe-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">59</span>
<p id="p_148">rious garb and a repressive content but they are designed to
save, not destroy, democracy.  The fault, if any, is not  in
the making of the Constitution but in the working of it.
It is undoubtedly true that within this impregnable duration
of two months 'the President, acting of course on the advice
of  the Council of Ministers, may take various	steps  under
clauses	 (a)  to  (c) of <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_424">art.  356(1)</a>  which,  though  taken
without	 the approval of the Parliament, may be	 irrevocable
and   cannot  be  retraced.   One  such	 step  can  be	 the
dissolution  of	 a State Assembly and the holding  of  fresh
elections thereto.  But here too, as on the last point which
I  have just discussed, the answer is that the	Constitution
expressly confers vast and varied powers on the President if
he arrives at a certain satisfaction.  The declaration of  a
financial  emergency under <a href="/doc/459380/" id="a_425">art. 360(1)</a> carries with  it	 the power to issu
e directions for reducing the salaries of per-
sons  serving in connection with the affairs of	 the  Union,
including-the  Judges  of  the Supreme Court  and  the	High
Court.	Clause (2) of <a href="/doc/1850059/" id="a_426">art. 360</a> makes clause (2) of <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_427">art.	 352</a>
applicable  to proclamations of financial  emergencies	with
the  result, that anything done or any action  taken  during
the  period  of	 two  months  after  the  issuance  of	 the
proclamation,  remains inviolable for that period.  That  in
fact, is the common thread which runs through arts. 352, 356
and 360.  The suspension of the right to move any Court	 for
the  enforcement of fundamental rights, the lifting  of	 the
prohibition  of	 <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_428">art. 19</a> as against the making of  laws	 and
taking	executive  action, the assumption  of  powers  under
clauses (a), (b) and (c) of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_429">art. 356</a> have full effect  while
the proclamations are in operation during the minimum period
of  two	 months.  Action taken during those two	 months,  if
irrevocable, remains unremedied.
</p><p id="p_149">There is also no substance in the contention that by issuing
a  proclamation under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_430">art. 356</a>, the President cannot  assume
the  power to dissolve a State Assembly.  By clause  (a)  of
<a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_431">art.  356(1</a>),  the President may by Proclamation  assume  to
himself all or any of the functions of the Government of the
State and "all or any of the powers vested in or exercisable
by  the Governor." <a href="/doc/1782245/" id="a_432">Article 174(2) (b)</a> empowers the  Governor
to  "dissolve the Legislative Assembly" from time  to  time.
It seems to me incapable of any serious controversy that  by
reason	of the provisions contained in <a href="/doc/1330132/" id="a_433">art. 356(1) (a</a>),	 the
President      can   exercise  the  power  vested   in	 and
exercisable by theGovernor   under  <a href="/doc/1782245/" id="a_434">art.  174(2)  (b)</a>	to
dissolve the Legislative Assembly ofthe State.
That leaves for consideration an argument advanced on behalf
of the State Governments by Shri Niren De, Shri Gokhale	 and
the   learned  Advocate	 of  Himachal  Pradesh.	  Shri	 Ram
Panjwani,  supporting Shri Gokhale, cited texts	 to  support
that  argument.	  The  core  of the  argument  is  that	 the
Constitutional	power to dissolve a legislative assembly  is
being utilised by the President for an indirect and  oblique
purpose,  that	there  is no  justification  whatsoever	 for
dissolving  the nine State Assemblies and that	the  reasons
contained  in  the  Home  Minister's  letter  to  the  Chief
Ministers are wholly inadequate and irrelevant for
5-722SCI/77
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">60</span>
taking the proposed action.  Several other alternatives,  it
is  urged, are open to the Government of India to adopt	 for
meeting the situation complained of by the Home Minister but
instead of doing so, they have decided to act drastically by
threatening   the  dissolution	of  ,the  nine	 Legislative
Assemblies  in which the Congress (R) has a majority.	Such
naked	abuse  of  power,  which  is  being  exercised	 for
liquidating the Congress (R) governments which are in  power
in  the nine states must, it is stressed, be struck down  as
unconstitutional.   Mr. Gokhale even argued that clause	 (5)
of  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_435">Article 356</a> which was introduced by the 38th  Amendment,
giving	finality  to the satisfaction of the  President	 and
putting it beyond the reach of Courts, is no bar to striking
down  a mala fide exercise of power.  An order	which  lacks
bona  fides  has no existence in the eye of  law,  says	 the
counsel,  and  courts ought not to perpetuate  injustice  by
refusing  to  interfere with such orders.   These  arguments
have a familiar, though strange, echo but that is beside the
point.	 There is no gain saying that the various points  of
view  presented	 by  the learned  counsel  require  a  close
attention.
</p><p id="p_150"> I  would like to begin with the assumption, though that  is
controverted  by the Additional Solicitor-General, that	 the
proposed proclamation is likely to be founded solely on	 the
reasons contained in the Home Minister's letter.  Even then,
I  find	 it hard to conclude that those reasons	 are  wholly
extraneous to or irrelevant for the exercise of the power to
issue  a  proclamation under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_436">art. 356</a> of  the  Constitution.
The  sine  qua	non of the exercise of	that  power  is	 the
satisfaction of the President that a situation has arisen in
which  the government of the State cannot be carried  on  in
accordance  with  the provisions of the	 Constitution.	 The
reasons	 contained in the Home Minister's letter may not  be
such as to necessarily lead to the conclusion that there  is
a break-down of constitutional machinery in the nine States.
But  the  test of proof by preponderance  of  probabilities,
leave alone the test of circumstances being consistent	with
a  sole hypothesis, is entirely out of place in	 considering
the constitutional validity of a Presidential  proclamation.
It is for the President to judge whether a situation of	 the
particular description has arisen necessitating the issuance
of a proclamation for assumption of all or any of the powers
mentioned in clause (a), (b) and (e) of <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_437">art. 356(1).</a>  He  is
expected  and  ought to judge fairly but we  cannot  sit  in
judgment  over his satisfaction for determining whether	 any
other view of the situation is not reasonably possible.	  So
long  as  the reasons, if any are disclosed, given  for	 the
action	proposed or taken, bear a reasonable nexus with	 the
exercise  of the particular power, the satisfaction  of	 the
President  must be treated as conclusive.  It will then	 not
be  open  to judicial scrutiny.	 It,  however,	the  reasons
given  are  wholly  extraneous	to  the	 formation  of	 the
satisfaction,  the proclamation would be open to the  attack
that it is vitiated by legal mala fides.
</p><p id="p_151">Such is not the case here.  The Home Minister's letter shows
that (i) an unprecedented political situation had arisen  by
the virtual rejection, in the recent Lok Sabha elections, of
candidates belonging to the ruling party in various  states;
</p><p id="p_152">(ii)  the  resultant climate of uncertainty was such  as  to
cause grave concern; (iii) the situation had created a sense
of  diffidence at different levels of  administration;	(iv)
people at
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">61</span>
large  did  not appreciate the propriety of  continuance  in
power  of  a party which was unmistakably  rejected  by	 the
electorate;  and (v) the climate of uncertainty,  diffidence
and disrespect had given rise to serious threats to law	 and
order.	 It is on the basis of these reasons that  the	Home
Minister  concluded  that a fresh appeal  to  the  political
sovereign   was	  not  only  permissible  but	had   become
obligatory.  These grounds, cannot with any show of  reason,
be dismissed as bearing no rational nexus with the necessity
for  issuing  a proclamation with a view to  dissolving	 the
Legislative Assemblies of the nine States.
Probing	 at any greater depth into the reasons given by	 the
Home  Minister	is to enter a field from which	Judges	must
scrupulously  keep  away.  That field is  reserved  for	 the
Politician  and the courts must avoid trespassing  into	 it.
That  is  not  always  an easy	task  because  the  line  of
demarcation that separates 'he functions of this Court	from
those  of  the	Government  tend  to  become  blurred,	when
constitutional	problems  raise issues concerning  the	high
policies  of  the  executive.	In  the	 United	 States,  De
Toqueville  noted as early as in 1832 that sooner  or  later
every  political question becomes a judicial question.	 Leo
Preffer therefore thought that though when the Supreme Court
decided	 Constitutional questions it had the trappings of  a
Court  of  Law,	 "it  is supreme, but it  is  not  really  a
Court"(1).  This is a wanting well worth remembering but  it
must  not deter the courts from discharging their  functions
if  they  find	that  a constitutional	power  meant  to  be
exercised  for	preserving  democracy  is  being  used	 for
destroying  it.	 The Home Minister's letter is	clearly	 and
indubitably  on	 the  safe side of the line  and  I  see  no
justification either for questioning the ,bona fides of	 the
case  made  out	 by him in the letter or  for  doubting	 the
authenticity  of  the  facts stated  therein.	As  said  by
Justice Harlan F. Stone in his oft-quoted dissenting opinion
: "Courts are not the only agency of Government that must be
assumed to have capacity to govern" (2).
</p><p id="p_153">I  need	 not therefore enter into the question	whether	 the
Government  of India has reasons apart from those stated  in
the  Home  Minister's letter for advising the  President  to
issue the proclamation.	 It they have, so far so good.	They
may not choose to disclose them but it they do, as they have
done  now, they cannot prevent a judicial  scrutiny  thereof
for  the limited purpose of seeing whether the reasons	bear
any rational nexus with the action proposed.  I am  inclined
to  the opinion that the Government cannot claim the  credit
at  the people's bar for fairness in disclosing the  reasons
for  the proposed action and at the same time deny  to	this
Court the limited power of finding whether the reasons	bear
the necessary nexus or are wholly extraneous to the proposed
action.	  The argument that "if the Minister need  not	give
reasons,  what	does it matter if he gives bad	ones"  over-
looks that bad reasons can destroy a possible nexus and	 may
vitiate	 the  order  on	 the  ground  of  mala	fides.	 The
argument,  be  it  stated,  was	 not  made  by	the  learned
Additional Solicitor-General but it is interesting to

<p id="p_154">know how it was repelled by Lord Denning M.R. in Padfield v.
Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food(1).
It  is	also  unnecessary to consider  the  implications  of
clause	(5)  of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_438">art. 356</a> which was introduced by  the  38th-
Amendment,  making the satisfaction of the  President  final
and  conclusive, not open to be questioned in any court,  on
any ground.  I have upheld the validity of the	proclamation
on  the view that the reasons that are cited in its  support
bear a nexus with it.
</p><p id="p_155"> A  large number of decisions were cited on either  side  on
the  question  whether the Presidents satisfaction  on	such
issues	is justiciable.	 The learned  Additional  Solicitor-
General relied upon the decisions of this Court, the Federal
Court, the Privy Council and of various High Courts to	show
that  apart  from clause (5) of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_439">art.  356</a>,  the	 President's
satisfaction  is conclusive and the Courts have no power  to
go  behind it. These decisions have been discussed fully  in
his  judgment by my Lord the Chief Justice.  In the  view  I
have taken, I prefer to express no opinion on this  question
except	to  state  that though the question  is	 treated  as
"well-settled", the Privy Council in Stephen Kalong  Ninskan
v. Government of Malaysia(1) said :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_26">	      "Whether	 a  proclamation  under,   statutory
	      powers  by the Supreme Head of the  Federation
	      can be challenged before the courts on some or
	      any  grounds is a constitutional	question  of
	      far-reaching importance which, on the  present
	      state  of the authorities,  remains  unsettled
	      and debatable."
</blockquote><p id="p_156">It  would appear that in this branch of constitutional	law,
which  cannot  be entirely divorced from  considerations  of
political policies, only one proposition may be said to	 be.
well-settled  : "No question in this branch of law is  well-
settled".   The	 'political  question'	is  an	open  sesame
expression  that  can  become  a  password  for	 gaining  or
preventing  admission into forbidden fields.  And it  is  an
accepted  fact	of constitutional  interpretation  that	 the
content	 of  justiciability  changes according	to  how	 the
judge's	 value preferences respond to the  multi-dimensional
problems-  of  the  day.   An awareness	 of  history  is  an
integral  part of those preferences.  In the last  analysis,
the  people for whom the Constitution is meant,	 should	 not
turn  their faces away from it in disillusionment  for	fear
that justice is a will-o'-the-wisp.
</p><p id="p_157">These then are my reasons in support of the unanimous  order
which the Court passed on April, 29, 1977.
</p><p id="p_158">BHAGWATI,  J.-Two main questions arise for consideration  in

<p id="p_160">prepared by the learned Chief Justice and it would be futile
exercise  on our part to reiterate them.  Hence	 we  proceed
straight   to	consider  the  questions  that	 arise	 for
determination.	These questions are of great  constitutional
significance.
</p><p id="p_161">We will first examine the question of maintainability of the
suits and the writ petitions.  The writ petitions have	been
filed by three legislators from the State of Punjab  seeking
enforcement of the fundamental right to property  guaranteed
to them under Articles 19(1) (f) and 31.  They complain that
if  the	 Legislative  Assembly of the  State  of  Punjab  is
dissolved by the President acting under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_443">Article 356</a>,  clause
(1), as threatened by the Government of India, they would be
deprived of their right to receive salary as members of	 the
Legislative  Assembly and the fight to receive salary  being
property,  there  would be  unconstitutional  infraction  of
their right to property under Articles 19 (1) (f) and 31 and
hence they are entitled to move this Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_444">Article  32</a>
for preventing such threatened infraction.  This  contention
is clearly unsustainable.  Of course, there can be no doubt,
and  indeed  it	 must be said in  fairness  to	the  learned
Additional Solicitor General who argued the case with  great
ability,  that he did not contend to the contrary,  that  if
there is a threatened violation of a fundamental right,	 the
person	concerned is entitled to approach this	Court  under
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_445">Article	 32</a>  and claim relief by way of injunction as  in  a
quia  timet action.  But the difficulty here in the  way  of
the  petitioners is that it is not possible to say  that  by
the threatened dissolution of the Legislative Assembly,	 any
fundamental right of the petitioners would be infringed.  It
is  only  where there is direct invasion  of  a	 fundamental
right or imminent danger of such invasion that a  petitioner
can  seek  relief  under  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_446">Article 32.</a>	The  impact  on	 the
fundamental  right  must  be direct and	 immediate  and	 not
indirect  or remote.  Merely because, by the dissolution  of
the Legislative Assembly, the petitioners would cease to  be
members	 and that would incidentally result in their  losing
their  salary, it cannot be said that the dissolution  would
infringe  their	 right	to  property.	That  would  be	 the
indirect   effect  of  the  dissolution	 but  that  is	 not
sufficient to constitute infraction of the fundamental right
to  property.	If  the argument  of  the  petitioners	were
correct,  even a civil servant dismissed in violation  of  a
legal or constitutional provision by the Government of India
or  a State Government or even an authority  falling  within
the definition of 'State' in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_447">Article 12</a> would be entitled to
complain  that	by  reason of the  dismissal,  be  has	been
deprived of his right to salary and hence it is competent to
him to approach this Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_448">Article 32</a> challenging	 his
dismissal  as invalid on ground of violation of Articles  19
(1) (f) and 3 1. This surely could never have been  intended
by  the	 constitution-makers.	The  direct  impact  of	 the
dissolution  of the Legislative Assembly would be, that	 the
petitioners  would cease to be members and obviously no	 one
has  a	fundamental  right  to continue as  a  member  of  a
legislative  assembly.	It is true that if  the	 petitioners
cease  to be the members of the Legislative  Assembly,	they
would lose their right to receive salary, but that would  be
the result of their ceasing to be the members of the  Legis-
lative	Assembly  and  not the direct  consequences  of	 the
dissolution of the Legislative Assembly.  We are. therefore.
of   the  view	that  the  threatened  dissolution  of	 the
Legislative Assembly does not involve
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">64</span>
any  infraction' of the fundamental right guaranteed to	 the
petitioners  under Articles 19 (1) (f) and 31 and  since  no
other  fundamental  right  has	been  relied  upon  by	 the
petitioners,  it must be held that they are not entitled  to
maintain the writ petitions under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_449">Article 32.</a>
That  takes  us to the question of  maintainability  of	 the
suits.	There are six suits before us filed by the States of
Rajasthan,  Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Bihar, Himachal  Pradesh
and  Orissa.   Each  of these suits  has  been	filed  under
<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_450">Article	 131</a>  of  the Constitution.   This  Article  confers
original jurisdiction on the Supreme Court, to the exclusion
of  all	 other courts, in respect of certain  categories  of
suits and is in the following terms
	      "131.   Subject  to  the	provisions  of	this
	      Constitution, the Supreme Court shall, to	 the
	      exclusion	 of any other court,  have  original
	      jurisdiction in any dispute-
</p><p id="p_162">	      (a)   between  the Government of India and  or
	      more States; or
</p><p id="p_163">	      (b)   between the Government of India and	 any
	      State  or States on one side and one  or	more
	      other States on the other, or
</p><p id="p_164">	      (c)   between two or more States,
	      if  and in so far as the dispute involves	 any
	      question (whether of law or fact) on which the
	      existence or extent of a legal right depends.
	      Provided that the said jurisdiction shall	 not
	      extend to a dispute arising out of any treaty,
	      agreement,  covenant,  engagement,  sanad	  or
	      other  similar instrument which,	having	been
	      entered	into   or   executed   before	 the
	      commencement of the Constitution, continues in
	      operation	 after such commencement,  or  which
	      provides that the said jurisdiction shall	 not
	      extend to such a dispute."
</p><p id="p_165">There  are  two limitations in regard to the nature  of	 the
suit  which  can be entertained by the Supreme	Court  under
this Article.  One is in regard to parties and the other  is
in regard to the subject matter.  The Article provides in so
many terms in clauses (a), (b) and (c) that the dispute must
be  between the Government of India and one or more  States,
or  between the Government of India and any other  State  or
States	on  one	 side and one or more other  States  on	 the
other,	or  between  two  or  more  States.   It  does	 not
contemplate any private,, party being arrayed as a disputant
on  one	 side or the other.  The par-, ties to	the  dispute
must  fall  within one or the other  category  specified  in
clauses	 (a),  (b)  and	 (c).  That  was  established  by  a
decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/895521/" id="a_451">State of Bihar v. Union of India &amp;
Anr</a>.(1)	 where	this Court pointed out : " a  dispute  which
falls within the ambit of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_452">Article 131</a> can only be determined
in the forum mentioned therein,
(1) [1970]2 S.C.R. 522
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">65</span>
namely,	 the Supreme Court of India, provided there has	 not
been impleaded in any said dispute any private party, be  it
a  citizen  or a firm or a corporation along  with  a  State
either	jointly or in the alternative.	A dispute  in  which
such  a private party is involved must be brought  before  a
court,	other than this court, having jurisdiction over	 the
matter."  This is the limitation as to parties.	  The  other
limitation as to subject-matter flows from the words "if and
in  so far as the dispute involves any question (whether  of
law  or	 fact) on which the existence or extent of  a  legal
right  depends."  These	 words	clearly	 indicate  that	 the
dispute	 must  be one relating to a legal right	 and  not  a
dispute	 on the political plans not based on a legal  right,
for instance, to take an example given by Mr. Seervai in his
well  known  work on 'Constitutional Law of India'  at	page
1385 : "a claim that a State 'project should be included  in
the  Five-Year Plan." The dispute must,	 therefore,  involve
assertion or vindication of a legal right of the  Government
of  India  or a State.	It is not necessary that  the  right
must  be a constitutional right.  All that is  necessary  is
that it must be a legal right.	It is true that in the <a href="/doc/895521/" id="a_453">State
of Bihar v. Union of India &amp; Anr</a>. (supra) this Court,  while
discussing the scope of the dispute which may be  determined
by the Supreme Court under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_454">Article 131</a>, happened to make  an
observation that "this much is certain that the legal  right
which is the subject of dispute must arise in the context of
the  Constitution and the federalism it sets up."  But	this
observation, in so far as it suggests that the legal  right
must  be one which arises under the Constitution, goes	much
further than what the language of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_455">Article 131</a> warrants.	 The
Article speaks only of 'legal right' and does not qualify it
by  any other words.  It may be noted that the provision  in
the  corresponding  section 204 of the Government  of  India
Act,  1935  was	 significantly different.   It	contained  a
proviso	 that  the  dispute  must  inter  alia	concern	 the
interpretation	of the Government of India Act, 1935 "or  of
an  Order  in Council made thereunder or the extent  of	 the
legislative or executive authority vested in the  Federation
by  virtue  of the Instrument of Accession of  that  State."
This provision has been deliberately and designedly  omitted
in <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_456">Article 131</a> and now any legal right can be enforced by  a
suit  in  the Supreme Court provided the  parties  fill	 the
character  specified  in  clauses (a),	(b)  and  (c).	 The
question  which	 therefore  requires  to  be  considered  in
determining the maintainability of the suits is whether	 any
legal right of the States is sought to be vindicated in	 the
suits.	 We  shall  presently consider	this  question,	 but
before we do so, we must point out one other error in which,
with  the greatest respect, the learned Judges	who  decided
the case of <a href="/doc/895521/" id="a_457">State of Bihar v. Union of India &amp; Anr</a>.  (supra)
seem to have fallen.  They held that in a suit under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_458">Article
131</a> one only order which the Supreme Court. could make was a
declaration  adjudicating on the legal right claimed in	 the
suit and once such a declaration was given., the function of
the Supreme Court under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_459">Article 131</a> was at an end.  If	this
conclusion  were correct, then obviously the  present  suits
seeking	 permanent injunction restraining the Government  of
India from issuing a proclamation under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_460">Article 356</a>,  clause
(1) could not lie and equally no interim injunction could be
granted	 by this Court but the learned Additional  Solicitor
General, with his usual candour, and fairness, conceded that
he  was not in a position to support this view.	  This	view
seems to be erroneous and for two very good reasons.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">66</span>
<p id="p_166">In the first place, it overlooks the fact that whereas	sub-
section (2) of section- 204 of the Government of India	Act,
1935  provided	that the Federal Court, in exercise  of	 its
original  jurisdiction,	 shall not pronounce  any  judgment,
other  than  a	declaratory  judgment,	no  such   provision
limiting  the  power of the Supreme Court in regard  to	 the
relief	to  be granted is to be found in <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_461">Article  131.</a> The
power  of the Supreme Court to grant relief in a suit  under
<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_462">Article	  131</a>  is  not	restricted  only   to	'declaratory
judgment'.   Secondly, as pointed out by Mr. Seervai in	 his
book  at  page	1385,  "when  a	 court	is  given  exclusive
jurisdiction in respect of a dispute between the parties, it
is  reasonable to hold that the court has power	 to  resolve
the  whole dispute", unless its power is limited by  express
words  or  by  necessary  implication.	 There	is  no	such
limitation in <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_463">Article 131</a> and hence it is not correct to say
that the Supreme Court can only give a declaratory  judgment
in  a suit under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_464">Article 131.</a>  The Supreme Court would	have
power to give whatever reliefs are necessary for enforcement
of  the legal right claimed in the suit if such legal  right
is established.
</p><p id="p_167"> Turning now to the question whether the present suits	seek
to enforce any legal right of the State, it. is necessary to
have  a look at a few provisions of the Constitution.	Save
for  the purpose of Part III 'State' is not defined  in	 the
Constitution,  but by reason of <a href="/doc/579323/" id="a_465">Article 367</a>, clause (1),  it
must  be  given	 the same meaning which	 it  has  under	 the
<a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_466">General	 Clauses Act</a>, 1897.  <a href="/doc/174566148/" id="a_467">Section 3</a>, clause (56)  of	 the
<a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_468">General	 Clauses Act</a>, 1897 defines 'State', inter  alia,  to
mean  "a  State	 specified  in the  first  Schedule  to	 the
Constitution".	 The  States of Rajasthan,  Madhya  Pradesh,
Punjab,	 Bihar,	 Himachal  Pradesh  and	 Orissa	 are  States
specified  in the First Schedule and hence they	 are  States
within	the meaning of the Constitution.  <a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_469">Article 1</a>,  clause
(1) declares that India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of
States and a State is consequently a constituent part of the
Union  of  India.   Part VI  of	 the  Constitution  contains
provisions  regarding  the States.  <a href="/doc/1606546/" id="a_470">Article  153</a>  says	that
there  shall be a Governor for each State and under  <a href="/doc/1995256/" id="a_471">Article
154</a>  the  executive  power of the State	 is  vested  in	 the
Governor and has to be, exercised by him either directly  or
through	 officers subordinate to him in accordance with	 the
Constitution.	<a href="/doc/674146/" id="a_472">Article	 163</a>  provides	for  a	Council	  of
Ministers  with	 a  Chief Minister at the head	to  aid	 and
advise the Governor in the exercise of his functions  except
in  respect of. a limited area where he is by or  under	 the
Constitution  required to exercise his functions or  any  of
them  in his discretion.  There is no express  provision  in
the Constitution requiring the Governor to act in accordance
with  the advice of the Council of Ministers as there is  in
the  newly amended <a href="/doc/127060/" id="a_473">Article 74</a>, clause (1) in regard  to	 the
President,  but	 it is now well settled as a result  of	 the
decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1382698/" id="a_474">Shamsher Singh &amp; Anr. v. State  of
Punjab</a>(1) that except in the narrow minimal area covered  by
Articles  163 (2), 371A(1) (b) and (d), 371A(2) (b) and	 (f)
and sixth Schedule, Para 9(2), the Governor also is bound to
act  according	to the advice of the Council  of  Ministers.
This is broadly the scheme of the provisions in regard to
(1)  [1975] S.C.R. 814.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">67</span>
<p id="p_168">the  exercise  of the executive power of  the  States.	 The
legislative  power  of	the  State  is	exercisable  by	 the
Legislature under <a href="/doc/1555093/" id="a_475">Article 168</a> and according to that Article,
the  Legislature of the State is to consist of the  Governor
and the Legislative Assembly, together with the	 Legislative
Council	 in some of the States.	 <a href="/doc/1034417/" id="a_476">Article 172</a>  provides	that
every  Legislative  Assembly  of  a  State,  unless   sooner
dissolved,  shall  continue  for six  years  from  the	date
appointed  for its first meeting.  Originally the  term	 was
five  years, but it was extended to six years by the  Forty-
Second Constitution Amendment Act.  <a href="/doc/860592/" id="a_477">Article 213</a> deals with a
situation  where  the  Legislature is  not  in	session	 and
provides  that in such a case the Governor may legislate  by
promulgating   ordinances   when  he   is   satisfied	that
circumstances  exist  which render it necessary for  him  to
take immediate action.	It will thus be seen that under	 the
provisions  of the Constitution the executive power  of	 the
State is exercisable by the Governor aided and advised by a
Council	 of  Ministers	and the Legislative  power,  by	 the
Legislature  of the State and in an emergent situation	when
the Legislature is not in session, by the Governor.
Now,  in  order	 to determine whose  legal  right  would  be
violated by the threatened action under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_478">Article 356</a>,  clause
(1),  we  must proceed on the assumption that  such  action,
when taken, would be constitutionally invalid, because if it
were  valid,  there would be no cause  for  complaint.	 The
question   is	:  who	would  have  cause  of	 action	  if
unconstitutional action were taken under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_479">Article 356</a>, clause
(1)  ?	If the executive power of the State  vested  in	 the
Governor were taken away by the President or the legislative
power  of the State were exercisable not by the	 Legislature
of the State or the Governor, but by or under the  authority
of Parliament or the Legislature of the State were  &amp;solved-
all  these  being actions which can be taken  under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_480">Article
356</a>,  clause (1)-who would be aggrieved ? Can the State	 say
that  its legal right is infringed ? We believe it can.	  Is
it  not the right of the State under the  Constitution	that
its  executive	power shall be exercisable by  the  Governor
except	when  any functions of the State Government  or	 any
powers of the Governor are assumed by the President by valid
exercise of power under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_481">Article 356</a>, clause (1) ? Is it	 not
competent  to the State to insist that it shall continue  to
have  its  legislature for making its laws, until  its	term
expires	  or  it  is  validly  dissolved?   Is	it   not   a
constitutional	right  of the State that its laws  shall  be
made  by its legislature, unless the President declares,  in
exercise  of the power under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_482">Article 356</a>, clause  (1),	that
the  powers  of	 the  legislature  of  the  State  shall  be
exercisable by or under the authority of Parliament ?  These
rights of the State under the Constitution. would  certainly
be affected by invalid exercise of power under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_483">Article	356</a>,
clause (1).
</p><p id="p_169">The  learned Additional Solicitor General or behalf  of	 the
Government of India contended that the expression 'State' in
<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_484">Article	 131</a> is not synonymous with 'State  Government'	 and
there is intrinsic evidence in the Article that the two	 are
distinct.   When the functions of the State  Government	 are
unconstitutionally  assumed  by the President,	it is  the
State Government which would be aggrieved and not the State.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">68</span>
<p id="p_170">There  is  no  legal right in a State to be  governed  by  a
particular Council of Ministers.  So also when a Legislative
Assembly  is  dissolved, it is the individual right  of	 the
members	 which	may  be affected and not the  right  of	 the
State.	  Discussion  of  a  Legislative  Assembly  is	 not
tantamount  to dissolution of the State, so as to give	rise
to  a cause of action in the State.  The learned  Additional
Solicitor General fairly conceded that if the office of	 the
Governor or the Legislative Assembly of the State were to be
abolished  altogether, it might affect a legal right of	 the
State, because the State is entitled to have a Governor	 and
a  Legislative	Assembly  under the  Constitution,  but	 his
argument was that mere assumption of the powers of the State
Government  or	taking away the power to make laws  for	 the
State  from the Legislature and making it exercisable by  or
under  the  authority of Parliament or	dissolution  of	 the
Legislative Assembly would not affect any legal right of the
State.	 This contention is not well founded and  cannot  be
sustained.
</p><p id="p_171">It  is true that there is a distinction between 'State'	 and
'State Government' and this distinction is also evident from
the language of' <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_485">Article 131 '</a>and, therefore, what has to be
seen  for  the purpose of determining the  applicability  of
that  Article  is whether any legal right of the  State,  as
distinct  from	the State Government,  is  infringed.	Now,
undoubtedly,  a State has no legal right to insist  that  it
shall  have a particular Council of Ministers or  particular
persons as members of the Legislative Assembly.	 But a State
has certainly a right under the Constitution to say that its
executive and legislative powers shall be exercisable in the
manner provided in the Constitution.  If a legal right of  a
State  can be said to have been infringed when its  Legisla-
tive  Assembly is abolished, it is difficult to see how	 any
other conclusion can follow when the Legislative Assembly is
not  abolished	but suspended or dissolved.  In	 the  former
case,  the  State  is  unconstitutionally  deprived  of	 its
legislative organ and its legislative power is given over to
another	 authority  : in the  letter,  the  constitutionally
appointed  organ  remains but it is made ineffectual  for  a
period	  during    which   the	  legislative	 power	  is
unconstitutionally vested in another authority.	 'We fail to
see any difference in the two situations so far as the State
is  concerned.	 The  position	is  the	 same  whether	 the
constitutionally appointed organ for exercise of legislative
power  is amputated or paralysed.  If one affects the  legal
right of the State, equally the other does.  It may be	that
if a Legislative Assembly is suspended or dissolved and	 the
legislative  power of the State become,,, exercisable by  or
under the authority of Parliament by reason of	Presidential
action under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_486">Article 356</a>, clause (1), the individual  rights
(A the members of the Legislative Assembly may be  affected,
but  that  does not mean that the legal right of  the  State
would  also  not  thereby  be  infringed.   Unconstitutional
exercise of power by the President under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_487">Article 356</a>, clause
(1)  may injuriously affect rights of several  persons.	  It
may  infringe not only the individual rights of the  members
of  the	 Legislative Assembly, but also	 the  constitutional
right  of the State to insist that the federal basis of	 the
political structure set up by the constitution shall not  be
violated  by an unconstitutional assault under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_488">Article	356</a>,
clause (1), we are, therefore, of the view,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">69</span>
that:the present suits seek to enforce a legal right of	 the
States	arising under the Constitution and the suits  cannot
be thrown out in limine as being outside the scope and ambit
of  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_489">Article 131.</a>  We must proceed, to consider the suits  on
merits.
</p><p id="p_172">The   important	 and  serious  question	 which	arises	 for
consideration on merits is as to what is the scope and ambit
of  the	 power	under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_490">Article 356</a>,  clause  (1).   Can	 the
President  in  exercise	 of  this  power  dissolve  a  State
Legislature,  and if so, are there any limitations  on	this
power ?,To answer this question, it is necessary to  examine
the scheme and language of different clauses of <a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_491">Article 3</a><a href="/doc/1408921/" id="a_492">,56</a>
and  the object and purpose for which it has  been  enacted.
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_493">Article 356</a> occurs in Part XVIII which contains a fasciculus
of  articles from <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_494">Article 352</a> to 360 dealing with  emergency
provisions.  One of us (Bhagwati, J.) has occasion to  point
out  in	 <a href="/doc/1735815/" id="a_495">Additional District Magistrate, Jabalpur v.  S.  S.
Shukla</a>(1) that there are three types of emergency which	 may
cause  crisis in the life of a nation.	The first  is  where
the security of the country is threatened by war or external
aggression  :  the  second arises on account  of  threat  or
presence  of internal disturbance calculated to disrupt	 the
life of the country and jeopardize the existence of  consti-
tutional  Government and the third is occasioned when  there
is  break  down	 or  potential break  down  of	the  economy
threatening  the  financial  stability	or  credit  of	 the
country.  The first two types of emergency are dealt with in
<a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_496">Article	 352</a>, while the third type is dealt with in  Article
</p><p id="p_173">360.  <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_497">Article 352</a>, clause (1) provides that if the President
is  satisfied  that  a grave emergency	exists	whereby	 the
security  of  India  or	 of any part  of  its  territory  is
threatened,  whether  by  war  or  external  aggression	  or
internal  disturbance,	be  may,  by  proclamation,  make  a
declaration  to that effect and clause (2) of  that  Article
requires  that such Proclamation shall be laid	before	each
House  of Parliament and "it shall cease to operate  at	 the
expiration  of	two months unless before the  expiration  of
that  period  it has been approved by  resolutions  of	both
Houses of Parliament".	The constitutional implications of a
declaration of emergency under <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_498">Article 352</a>, clause (1) are
vast  and they are provided in Articles 250, 353,  354,	 358
and  359.  The	emergency being	 an  exceptional  situation,
arising out of a, national crisis, certain wide and sweeping
power-,	 have been conferred on the Central  Government	 and
Parliament  with a view to combat the situation and  restore
normal conditions.  One such power is that given by  <a href="/doc/497125/" id="a_499">Article
250</a> which provides that while a Proclamation of Emergency is
in  operation, Parliament shall have the power to make	laws
for  the  whole or any part of the territory of	 India	with
respect to any of the matters enumerated in the State  List.
The  effect of this provision is that the federal  structure
based  on separation of powers is put out of action for	 the
time  being.   Another	power  of a  similar  kind  is	that
conferred  by  <a href="/doc/818031/" id="a_500">Article 353</a> which says that during  the	time
that  Proclamation of Emergency is in force.  the  executive
power  of the Union shall extend to the giving of  direction
to  any State as to the manner in which the executive  power
thereof	 is to be exercised.  This provision also  derogates
from  the  federal principle which forms the  basis  of	 the
Constitution.	 This  departure  from	the   constitutional
principle  of  federalism is permitted by  the	Constitution
because of the extraordi-

<p id="p_175">nary  situation	 arising  out of  threat  to  the  continued
existence of constitutional democratic Government.  Then  we
come  to <a href="/doc/490234/" id="a_501">Article, 355</a> which enjoins a duty on the  Union  to
protect every State against external aggression and internal
disturbance and to ensure that the government of every State

Constitution.	<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_502">Article 356</a> contains provisions for  dealing
with another kind of emergent situation arising from failure
of  constitutional  machinery in the States and, so  far  as
material, reads as follows
	      "356.  (1)  If the President on receipt  of  a

	      otherwise,  is satisfied that a situation	 has

	      questioned in any court on any ground."
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">71</span>
<p id="p_183">Since some reliance was placed on behalf of the	 petitioners
in  the writ petitions on <a href="/doc/1300179/" id="a_503">Article 357</a>, clause (1), we  shall
reproduce the relevant part of that clause in these terms :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_27">	      357. (1) Where by a Proclamation issued  under
	      clause (1) of   <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_504">article  356</a>,  it	  has	been
	      declared that the powers of the	  Legislature
	      of the State shall be exercisable by or  under
	      the   authority  of  Parliament, it  shall  be
	      competent-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_28">	      (c)  for the President to authorise the  House
	      of  the People is not in	session	 expenditure
	      from  the	 Consolidated  Fund  of	 the   State
	      pending  the sanction of such  expenditure  by
	      Parliament."
</blockquote><p id="p_184">Now  it	 is obvious on a plain natural construction  of	 the
language. of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_505">Article 356</a>, clause (1) that the President	 can
take  action  under  this clause only if, on  receipt  of  a
report	made by the Governor of a State or otherwise  he  is
satisfied   that  a  situation	has  arisen  in	 which	 the
Government  of the State cannot be carried on in  accordance
with  the provisions of the Constitution.  The	satisfaction
of  the President that a situation has arisen in  which	 the
government  of a State. cannot be carried on  in  accordance
with  the  provision of" the- Constitution  is	a  condition
precedent  which must be fulfilled before the President	 can
take action  under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_506">Article 356</a>, clause	 (1).	When  this
condition  precedent  is satisfied, the President  may	take
action under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_507">Article 356</a>, clause (1) and exercise all or any
of  the powers specified in subclauses (a), (b) and  (c)  of
that  clause.	The  exercise of these	powers	plainly	 and
unmistakably  strikes at the root of the  federal  principle
because it vests the executive power of the state which,  in
the  federal  structure	 set  up  by  the  Constitution,  is
exercisable  by the Governor with the aid and advice of	 his
Council	 of Ministers, in the President and takes  away	 the
powers	of  the	 Legislature of the State  and	they  become
exercisable  by or under the authority of  Parliament.	 The
administration	of the State is for all purposes taken	over
by  the President which means in effect and  substance-	 the
Central Government since by reason of <a href="/doc/127060/" id="a_508">Article 74</a>, clause (1)
and even otherwise, the President is bound by the advice  of
his  Council of Ministers and the legislative power  of	 the
State is also transferred to the Parliament.  The  President
can also dissolve the Legislative Assembly of  the  State,
because	 when  he assumes to himself all the powers  of	 the
Governor under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_509">Article 356</a>, clause (1) sub-clause (a) one of
the powers assumed by him would be the power to dissolve the
Legislative  Assembly  under <a href="/doc/1782245/" id="a_510">Article 174 (2) (b).</a>   It	will
thus be seen that <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_511">Article 356</a>, clause (1) authorises serious
inroad	into  the  principle of federalism  enacted  in	 the
Constitution   and  that  is  permitted	 because,   in	 the
'subjective  satisfaction of the President, a situation	 has
arisen	in  which  the government of  the  State  cannot  be
carried	 on  in	 accordance  with  the	provisions  of	 the
Constitution.  It is the duty of the Union under <a href="/doc/490234/" id="a_512">Article 355</a>
to ensure that the government of the State is carried on  in
accordance  with  the provisions of the	 Constitution,	and,
therefore,  when  the President finds that a  situation	 has
arisen	in  which  the Government of  the  State  cannot  be
carried on, he can act under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_513">Art. 356</a> Cl. (1) indeed it
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">72</span>
would be his constitutional obligation to do so and put	 the
federal	 mechanism  out of action so far as  that  State  is
concerned.   This is indeed a very drastic power  which,  if
misused	  or   abused,	can   destroy	the   Constitutional
equilibrium  between  the  Union and  the  States and  its
potential for harm was recognised even by the  constitution-
makers.	  Dr.  Ambedkar	 pointed out  in  his  speech  while
winding up the debate on this Article :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_29">	      "I may say that I do not altogether deny that
	      there is a possibility of these articles being
	      abused or employed for political purposes. But
	      the  objection  applies to every part  of	 the
	      Constitutionwhich	  gives	 power	to   the
	      Centre to over-ride the Provinces. In fact  I
	      share   the   sentiments	 expressed   by	  my
	      honourable friend Mr. Gupta yesterday that the
	      proper  thing we ought to expect is that	such
	      articles	will never be called into  operation
	      and that they would remain a dead letter.	  If
	      at all they are brought into operation, I hope
	      the  President,  who  is	endowed	 with  these
	      powers,  will take proper	 precautions  before
	      actually suspending the administration of	 the
	      provinces."
</blockquote><p id="p_185">But despite the lurking danger in article, the constitution-
makers	thought	 that there was no alternative	in  case  of
break  down  of constitutional machinery in the	 States	 and
hence  they  adopted  this  article,  even  though  it	 was
analogous  to  the  hated <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_514">section 93</a>  which  disfigured	 the
Government of India Act, 1935 symbolising British  dominance
over  nationalist  aspirations.	  The	constitution-makers,
conscious  as they were of the serious consequences  flowing
from  the exercise of this power, limited it by hedging	 its
exercise  with	the condition that the President  should  be
satisfied that the Government of the State cannot be carried
on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution
Now, when On the satisfaction of the condition limiting	 the
exercise  of  the  power, a proclamation is  issued  by	 the
President  under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_515">Article 356</a>, clause (1), it can be  revoked
or  varied  at any time by a Subsequent	 proclamation  under
clause	(2) of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_516">Article 356.</a>  Clause (3) of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_517">Article 356</a>,	 Eke
clause (2) of <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_518">Article 352</a>, require&amp; that every	Proclamation
issued	under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_519">Article 356</a>, clause (1) shall be	laid  before
each  House of Parliament and it shall cease to	 operate  at
the expiration of two months unless before the expiration of
that  period,  it has been approved by	resolution  of	both
Houses	of  Parliament.	 The learned  counsel  appearing  on
behalf	 of the petitioners in the writ	 petitions contended
that it is clear from the provision enacted in <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_520">Article	356</a>,
clause (3) that the exercise of power by the President under
cause  (1)  is	subject to the control	of  both  Houses  of
Parliament.  The Proclamation issued by the President  under
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_521">Article	 356</a>, clause (1) would cease to be in force  at	 the
expiration  of	two  months unless it is  approved  by	both
Houses	of  Parliament,	 and,  therefore,  no  irretrievable
action	such as dissolution of the legislative	Assembly  of
the State can be taken by the President before the  approval
of  both  the Houses of Parliament is given to	the  Procla-
mation.	  Otherwise  the  parliamentary	 control  would	  be
defeated and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">73</span>
it would be possible for the Central Government to  present
a fait accompli to the two Houses of Parliament and  neither
House would be able to remedy the mischief done, even if  it
disapproved  the  Proclamation' Moreover,  either  House  of
Parliament  may disapprove the Proclamation even before	 the
expiry	of two months and where that happens, the  President
would  be  bound  to revoke  the  Proclamation	immediately,
because the proclamation cannot continue in defiance of, the
will  of either House of Parliament "without destroying	 the
collective responsibility of the Council of Ministers to the
House.	 ". It was also urged that during the period of	 two
months,	 no  power  can	 be  exercised	in  virtue  of	 the
Proclamation which would-bring about a final and irrevocable
consequence,  if  the President has reason to  believe	that
either	House of Parliament may not approve it, or also	 the
control of both Houses of Parliament would be completely set
at   naught  and  the  executive  would	 be  able  to	take
irreversible  action  like dissolution	of  the	 Legislative
Assembly  by passing both Houses of Parliament and  ignoring
their wishes altogether.  That would be plainly contrary  to
the basic principles of democratic Government.	Reliance was
also  placed on <a href="/doc/1300179/" id="a_522">Article 357</a>, Clause (1), sub-clause (c)	 and
it was pointed out that whereby a Proclamation issued  under
clause	(1)  it	 has been declared that the  powers  of	 the
Legislature  of the State shall be exercisable by  or  under
the  authority	of  Parliament, no expenditure	out  of	 the
Consolidated  Fund  of	the State can  be  incurred  without
appropriation made by Parliament, but when the House of	 the
People	is  not	 in session, the President  can	 incur	such
expenditure pending sanction by Parliament.  This means that
if  the	 House of the People is in session at  the  time  of
issue  of the Proclamation or as soon as it assembles  after
the   issue  of	 the  Proclamation,  the   President   would
immediately  have  to  go  to  Parliament  for	sanction  of
expenditure  and  if  Parliament  does	not  sanction,	 the
expenditure  would be unauthorised and the  President  would
not  be	 able  to exercise his	functions.   There  is	thus
effective Parliamentary control over the President, that is,
the  Central Government, through the purse and hence  during
the  period  of two months, the President  cannot  take	 any
action involving expenditure out of the Consolidated Fund of
the  State unless he is assured that such expenditure  would
be sanctioned by Parliament.  The suggestion was chat  since
the ruling party at the Centre has no majority in the  Rajya
Sabha, the President cannot issue a Proclamation authorising
him to discharge functions involving expenditure out of	 the
Consolidated  Fund of the State.  These arguments  urged  on
behalf	of the petitioners raise a question of	construction
of clause (1) to (3) of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_523">Article 356.</a>
</p><p id="p_186">Now,  if  we look at the language of clauses (1) to  (3)  of
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_524">Article 356</a> it is clear that once a Proclamation is  validly
issued	by the President under clause (1), it has  immediate
force and effect and its efficiency is not made	 dependent
on  the approval of both Houses of Parliament.	There is  no
provision  in'	any clause of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_525">Article 356</a> or  in  any  other
Article of the Constitution that the President shall have no
power  to issue a Proclamation under clause (1) when  either
or  both  Houses  of Parliament are-in	session.,  The	only
limitation on the exercise of the power of the President  to
issue a proclamation is that he should be satisfied that the
Government of the State cannot be carried on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">74</span>
in  accordance	with  the provisions  of  the  Constitution.
Where  the  President is so satisfied, and, as	pointed	 out
above,	the President means the Central Government,  he	 can
issue a	 proclamation even when either or both	Houses	of
Parliament  are	 in session.  The President  is	 given	this
power because immediate action may have to be taken when  an
exceptional situation has arisen on account of break down of
constitutional	machinery in the State.	 It is an  emergency
power  and  it has necessarily to be vested in	the  Central
Government  because  quick  and	 immediate  action  may	  be
necessary  to avert or combat constitutional break  down  in
the  State and moreover a constitutional obligation is	laid
on the Union to ensure, that the, Government of every  State
is  carried  on	 in accordance with the	 provisions  of	 the
Constitution.	 Any   delay  in  taking   action   may	  in
conceiveable cases frustrate the very object and purpose  of
conferment  of this power on the President.  Promptness	 may
be  the	 essence of effectiveness in such cases	 and  public
interest  may  suffer  on account of  tardiness	 in  action.
Hence  the  power conferred on the President  under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_526">Article
356</a>,  clause  (1) is not limited by the	 condition  that  it
cannot	be  exercised  when  either  or	 both  1-louses	  of
Parliament are in session.  Then again, clause (3) of  Arti-
cle 356 provides that a proclamation issued under clause (1)
shall  cease  to operate at the expiration  of	two  months,
unless	before	the expiration of that period  it  has	been
approved by resolutions of both Houses of Parliament.	This
means that it shall continue to operate for a period of	 two
months,	 unless sooner revoked.	 It is only for the  purpose
of its extension beyond two months that the approval of both
Houses	of Parliament is required by clause (3)	 of  Article
</p><p id="p_187">356.   If no such approval is forthcoming  the	proclamation
cannot	continue  after the expiration of  two	months,	 but
until  then  it certainly continues and has full  force	 and
effect.	 It may be noted that clause (3) of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_527">Article 356</a> does
not  say  that the proclamation shall be operative  only  on
approval  by both Houses of Parliament, nor does it  provide
that it shall cease to operate even before the expiry of two
months, if disapproved by either House of Parliament, it  is
interesting to compare the language of Clause (3) of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_528">Article
356</a>   with  that  of  <a href="/doc/1090693/" id="a_529">Article,	123.</a>  clause  (2)  in	this
connection,  <a href="/doc/1090693/" id="a_530">Article  123</a>, clause (1) confers power  on	 the
President  to  promulgate  an  ordinance  during  recess  of
Parliament  when  be is satisfied that	circumstances  exist
which  render it necessary for him to take immediate  action
and clause (2) of that Article provides that such  ordinance
"shall cease to operate at the expiration of six weeks	from
the reassembly of Parliament, or if before the expiration of
that  period resolutions disapproving it are passed by	both
Houses,	  upon	 the  passing  of  the	 second	  of   those
resolutions".  The ordinance would continue to operate until
the   expiration  of  six  weeks  from	the  reassembly	  of
Parliament  unless before that date is disapproved  by	both
Houses	of  Parliament.	 But when we come to clause  (3)  of
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_531">Article	 356</a>, we find that a different scheme in  regard  to
the  life  of  a proclamation issued  under  clause  (1)  is
adopted in that clause.	 Clause (3) of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_532">Article 356</a> does	 not
confer power,,on the two Houses of Parliament to put an	 end
to the proclamation by disapproval before the expiration  of
the  Period of two months and it is only if the life of	 the
proclamation  is  to he extended beyond the  period  of	 two
months that is required to be approved by both
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">75</span>
Houses	 of  Parliament,  it  is,  therefore,	clear	that
disapproval by the either House of the Parliament before the
expiration of two months has no constitutional relevance  to
the  life  of the Proclamation and  the	 proclamation  would
continue  in force for a period of two months ,despite	such
disapproval.
</p><p id="p_188">It  would  be  clear  from  this  discussion  that  when   a
proclamation  is  validly  issued  by  the  President  under
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_533">Article 356</a>, clause (1), it has immediate force and  effect,
the moment it is issued and where, by the proclamation,	 the
President has assumed to himself the powers of the  Governor
under  sub-clause  (a),	 he is entitled	 to  exercise  those
powers as fully and effectually as the Governor, during	 the
period of two months when the Proclamation is in  operation.
There  is  no  limitation  imposed by  any  Article  of	 the
Constitution  that  these  powers ,of the  Governor  can  be
exercised   by	the  President	only  when  they   have	  no
irreversible   consequence   and  where	  they	 have	such
consequence, they cannot be exercised until the proclamation
is  approved  by  both Houses  of  Parliament.	 Whilst	 the
proclamation  is in force during the period of	two  months,
the, President can exercise all the powers of the  Governor
assumed	 by  him and the Court cannot read  any	 limitation
which  would have the effect of cutting down the  width	 and
amplitude of such powers by confining their exercise only to
those cases where no irretrievable consequence would  ensure
which  would  be  beyond  repair.  When	 any  power  of	 the
Governor is assumed by the President under the Proclamation,
the   President	 can,  during  the  two	 months	  when	 the
proclamation is in force, do, whatever the Governor could in
exercise  of such power, and it would be immaterial  whether
the  consequence  of  exercise of such power  is  final	 and
irrevocable  or not.  To hold otherwise would be, to  refuse
to give full effect to the proclamation which as pointed out
above,	continues  to  operate with full  force	 and  vigour
during	the  period of two months.  It	would  be  rewriting
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_534">Article 356</a> and making approval of both Houses of Parliament
a  condition  precedent	 to the coming	into  force  of	 the
proclamation  so far as the particular power  is  concerned.
Now  one of the powers of the Governor which can be  assumed
by  the	 President under the proclamation is  the  power  to
dissolve  the Legislative Assembly ,of the State under	<a href="/doc/1782245/" id="a_535">Art.
174(2)	(b)</a> and, therefore, the President also can  dissolve
the  Legislative  Assembly  during the time  that  the	pro-
clamation  is  in  force.  It is difficult to  see  bow	 the
exercise  of  this  power  by  the  President  can  be	made
conditional  on the approval of the proclamation by the	 two
Houses	of Parliament.	If the proclamation has	 full  force
and  effect  during the period of two  months  even  without
approval  by  the two Houses of	 Parliament,  the  President
certainly can exercise the power of the Governor to dissolve
the  Legislative Assembly of the State without	waiting	 for
the   approval	of  the	 proclamation  by  both	 Houses	  of
Parliament.   It is true that once the Legislative  Assembly
is  dissolved  by  the President in exercise  of  the  power
assumed	  by  him  under  the  proclamation,  it  would	  be
impossible   to	  restore  the	status	quo  ante   if	 the
proclamation  is not approved by both Houses of	 Parliament,
but  that  is the inevitable consequence  flowing  from	 the
exercise,  of  the  power which	 the  President	 undoubtedly
Possesses during the time that the Proclamation is in force.
This  is  clearly  a  necessary	 power	because	 there	 may
conceivably be
6--722SCI/77
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">76</span>
cases where the exercise of the power of dissolution of	 the
Legislative  Assembly  may  become imperative  in  order  to
remedy the situation arising on account of break down of the
constitutional	machinery  in  the  State  and	failure	  to
exercise this power promptly may frustrate the basic  object
and  purpose of a proclamation.......... under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_536">Article	356</a>,
clause (1).  It is, therefore, not possible to accede to the
argument  of  the petitioners, in the  writ  petitions	that
during	the  period  of two months before  approval  of	 the
proclamation   by   the	 two  Houses   of   Parliament,	  no
irreversible action, such as dissolution of the	 Legislative
assembly  of the State, can be taken by the President.	 The
power  to  dissolve the Legislative Assembly  of  the  State
cannot	also be denied to the President on the	ground	that
the  proclamation  may not be approved by one or  the  other
House of Parliament.  In the first place, the existence of a
constitutional power or the validity of its exercise  cannot
be  determined by reference to a possible contingency.	 The
Court  cannot enter the realm of conjecture and surmise	 and
speculate as to what would be the position at the expiration
of  two months whether the proclamation will be approved  by
both Houses of Parliament or not.  Secondly, it is  entirely
immaterial  whether or not the proclamation is	approved  by
both  Houses  of Parliament, because even if it	 is  not  so
approved, it would continue to be in full force, and  effect
for  a period of two months, unless sooner revoked.   It  is
also  difficult to appreciate how <a href="/doc/1300179/" id="a_537">Article 357</a>,	clause	(1),
subclause  (c)	can  possibly assist  the  argument  of	 the
petitioners.   That sub-clause provides that when the  House
of the People is not in session, the President can authorise
expenditure  out  of  the Consolidated	Fund  of  the  State
pending	 receipt  of  sanction of such	expenditure  by	 the
Parliament   and  consequently,	 it  is	 possible  that	  if
Parliament  does  not  sanction	 such  expenditure,  serious
difficulty  might arise.  But that is merely  a	 theoretical
possibility  which  in practical reality of  politics  would
hardly arise and it need not deflect us from placing on	 the
language  of  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_538">Article 356</a> the  only  correct  interpretation
which  its  language  bears.  When the	President  issues  a
proclamation  on  the advice of the Central  Government,  it
stands	to reason that the House of the People in which	 the
Central	  Government   enjoys	majority   would    sanction
expenditure  out of the Consolidated Fund of the State.	  We
are,  therefore, of the view that even during the period  of
two  months,  without the approval of the  proclamation	 by,
both  Houses of Parliament, the President can  dissolve	 the
Legislative  Assembly of the State in exercise of the  power
of  the	 Governor under <a href="/doc/1782245/" id="a_539">Article 174(2) (b)</a>  assumed  by	 him
under the proclamation.
</p><p id="p_189">This is the correct constitutional interpretation of  clause
(1)  and (3) of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_540">Article 356</a> guided by the language of  these
clauses and the context and setting in which they occur.  It
might  appear  at  first  blush	 that  this   constitutional
interpretation would completely eliminate the  Parliamentary
central	 over  the issue of proclamation  and  exercise	 of
powers under it and the Central Government would be free  to
take  over the administration of the State and	paralyse  or
even  dissolve the Legislative Assembly, even if  it  should
appear	that one or the other House of Parliament might	 not
approve it.  But 'this apprehension
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">77</span>
need not cause any undue anxiety, for it is based  primarily
on  the	 possibility of abuse of the Power  conferred  under
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_541">Article 356</a>, clause (1).  It must be remembered that  merely
because	 power may sometime be abused, it is no	 ground	 for
denying	 the existence of the power.  The wisdom of man	 has
not  yet  been able to conceive of a government	 with  power
sufficient  to	answer all its legitimate needs and  at	 the
same  time incapable of mischief.  In the last	analysis,  a
great deal must depend on the wisdom and honesty,  integrity
and  character of those who are in charge of  administration
and  the existence of enlightened and alert public  opinion.
Moreover,  it  is  apparent  that  a  piquant  situation  of
considerable complexity and extra-ordinary consequences	 may
arise  if  either  House of Parliament	disapproves  of	 the
proclamation and, therefore, political and pragmatic  wisdom
of  the highest order and circumspection of  utmost  anxiety
would  necessarily  inform  the	 Central  Government  before
exercising  the	 weighty  power conferred  by  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_542">Article	356</a>,
clause	(1).  Further more, it must be remembered  that	 the
principle  of cabinet responsibility to Parliament  lies  at
the  core of our democratic structure of Government and	 the
Central	 Government  is accountable for all its	 actions  to
Parliament which consists of elected representatives of	 the
people and if any action is taken by the Central  Government
which  is  improper  or unjustified  by	 moral,	 ethical  or
political  norms,  Parliament would certainly  be  there  to
bring  them  to book.  The Political  control  exercised  by
Parliament would always be a salutary check against improper
exercise  of power or its misuse or abuse by the  executive.
And  lastly the powers conferred on the President, that	 is,
the Central Government, being a limited power, its  exercise
would,	within	the  narrow minimal  area,  which  we  shall
indicate  later,  be  subject to  judicial  review  ability.
These  are the safeguards which must alley the	apprehension
that   the   Central  Government  may  act  want   only	  or
capriciously  in issuing a proclamation under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_543">Article	356</a>,
clause	(1)  by	 passing  and ignoring	the  two  Houses  of
Parliament.
</p><p id="p_190">That  takes us to the next question whether  any  injunction
can  be	 granted against the Union of India  restraining  it
from  issuing a proclamation and dissolving the	 Legislative
Assemblies  of the States under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_544">Art. 356</a>, cl. (1), for	that
is  the primary relief claimed by the States in	 the  suits.
This  question	has  been argued on a  demurrer	 as  if	 the
averments  made	 in  the plaints  were	correct.   We  shall
presently  consider this question, but before that,  we	 may
dispose	 of  a	short  point in	 regard	 to  what  has	been
described  as  a  'directive'  by  Shri	 Charan	 Singh	Home
Minister  to the Central Government, to the Chief  Ministers
of the States concerned in the, suits (hereinafter  referred
to  as the Plaintiff States).  Each of the plaintiff  states
has sought a declaration that the 'directive' of Shri Charan
Singh  is  'Unconstitutional, illegal and  ultra  vires	 the
Constitution"  and  an injunction restraining the  Union  of
India  from giving effect to this 'directive'.	We  fail  to
see how such declaration or injunction can be granted by the
Court.	The 'directive' of Shri Charan Singh is nothing	 but
an  advice  or	suggestion to the  Chief  Minister  of	each
plaintiff State to recommend to the Governor dissolution  of
the  Legislative  Assembly of the concerned State.   It	 has
been  wrongly  described  as  a	 'directive'.	It  has	  no
constitutional	authority behind it.  It is always  open  to
the Home
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">78</span>
Minister  of  the  Central  Government	to  give  advice  or
suggestion  to the Chief Minister of a State and  the  Chief
Minister  may  accept or reject such  advice  or  suggestion
according as he thinks fit.  The advice or suggestion has no
binding	  effect  on  the  Chief  Minister  and	  no   legal
consequence  flow from it.  Hence it is not possible to	 say
that  the  'directive'	issued	by  Shri  Charan  Singh	 was
unconstitutional, illegal or ultra vires.  There is also no,
question  of  giving  effect  to  the  'directive'  and	  no
injunction  can,  therefore,  be  granted  restraining	 its
implementation.	  The  'directive',  if	 not  accepted	 and
carried	 but would certainly be a precursor to action  under
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_545">Art.  356</a>,  cl.	 (1)  and, therefore,  may  be	regarded  as
indicative of a threat, but standing- by itself, it does not
give  rise  to	any  cause  of	action	in  the	 State	 for
declaration  or	 injunction.  Turning to the  relief  sought
against the threatened exercise of power under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_546">Art. 356</a>, cl.
(1)  we	 find  that what is prayed for	in  this  relief  is
'permanent injunction restraining the defendent from  taking
recourse under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_547">Art. 356</a> of the Constitution of India to
dissolve    the	  Legislative	Assembly   of	the    State
and  from taking any steps from holding fresh  elections  to
the  State  Assembly  before  March,  1978."  It  is  indeed
difficult  to  appreciate,  how such  a	 wide  and  sweeping
injunction  can	 be granted by this  Court  restraining	 the
Union  of India from exercising altogether its powers  under
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_548">Art. 356</a>, cl. (1).  How can the Union of India be  prevented
by   this   Court  from	  discharging	its   constitutional
obligations to the State.  We have already pointed out	that
there  is  a constitutional duty enjoined on  the  Union  of
India  to  ensure  that the Government	of  every  State  is
carried	 on  in	 accordance  with  the	provisions  of	 the
Constitution   and   there  is	equally	  a   constitutional
obligation on the President that is, the Central Government,
to, take action under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_549">Art. 356</a>, Cl. (1), if he finds that  a
situation  has	arisen	where the Government  of  the  State
cannot	be carried on in accordance with the  provisions  of
the  Constitution.   Can this Court issue  a  blanket  order
against	 the Union of India that whatever be  the  situation
which  may develop in the State and howsoever  necessary  it
may become to exercise the power under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_550">Art. 356</a> cl. (1), the
Union  of  India shall not take recourse, to that  power  to
dissolve  the  Legislative Assembly of the  State  and	hold
fresh  elections, to the State Legislative  Assembly  before
March,	1978.  That would clearly obstruct its discharge  of
the constitutional obligations by the Central Government and
no  such injunction can be issued by this Court.   Realising
this difficulty in their way, the plaintiff-States sought to
limit  the relief of injunction by confining it only to	 the
ground	set out in the 'directive' of Shri Charan Singh	 and
in the statement made by Shri Shanti Bhushan, Law  Minister,
at a talk on the All India Radio given by him.	That ground,
according  to  the  plaintiff-States,  was  that  since	 the
Congress which was the ruling party in these States suffered
a  massive defeat at the General Elections to the Lok  Sabha
held  in  March 1977, the Legislative  Assemblies  of  these
States	no  longer  reflected the wishes  or  views  of	 the
electorate  and	 hence	a  fresh  appeal  to  the  political
sovereign  had	become	necessary  and	obligatory  and	 the
Legislative Assemblies of these States should, therefore, be
dissolved with a view to obtaining a fresh mandate from	 the
electorate.   It was contended on behalf of  the  Plaintiff-
States	that  this  was the only  ground  on  which  Central
Government  proposed to take action under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_551">Art. 356</a>, cl.	 (1)
and since this ground was wholly extraneous and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">79</span>
irrelevant  to the basic condition for taking  action  under
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_552">Art.   356</a>,   cl.   (1),   the	 Central   Government	 was
constitutionally  not  entitled to take. action	 under	this
clause	and  if any such action were taken  by	the  Central
Government,   it  would	 be  outside  the  limits   of	 its
constitutional authority.  The learned Additional  Solicitor
General	 combated  this	 contention  by	 giving	 a  two-fold
answer.	 First, he contended that it was not correct to	 say
that  the points of view expressed by Shri Charan Singh	 and
Shri Shanti Bhushan constituted the only material or  ground
for  the possible action under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_553">Art. 356</a>, cl. (1). He  urged
that the points of view of these two ministers could not  be
equated with the advice which the Council of Ministers might
give  to the President under <a href="/doc/127060/" id="a_554">Art. 74</a>, cl. (1) in  regard  to
the  dissolution  of  the  Legislative	Assemblies  of	 the
Plaintiff-States.  The exercise of power under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_555">Art. 356</a>, cl.
(1),  it  was said, depends on a wide range,  of  situations
depending  upon varied and diverse considerations and it  is
not possible to say what grounds might ultimately weigh with
the  Council  of  Ministers in giving their  advice  to	 the
President under <a href="/doc/127060/" id="a_556">Art. 74</a>, cl. (1).  Secondly he urged that in
any event the ground that the, Legislative Assemblies of the
Plaintiff-States  had  ceased  to reflect the  will  of	 the
electorate and, therefore, in order to ascertain the will of
the  people, and give effect to it, it was appropriate	that
the Legislative Assemblies should be dissolved and  election
should be held, was a ground which had reasonable nexus with
the basic condition for invoking the exercise of power under
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_557">Art.  356</a>,  cl.	 (1) and it was a  legitimate  and  relevant
ground which could be taken into account in arriving at	 the
satisfaction  that  the Government of the  State  cannot  be
carried	 on  in accordance with the provisions of  the	Con-
stitution.  These were the rival contentions of the  parties
which we must now proceed to consider.
</p><p id="p_191">But  before we do so, we must at the threshold refer to	 one
other  argument of the learned Additional Solicitor  General
which  sought  to exclude the jurisdiction of the  Court  in
relation to a question of this kind.  He contended that	 the
question  whether  in. a particular State  a  situation	 has
arisen	where the Government of the State cannot be  carried
on  in	accordance with the provisions of  the	Constitution
and,  therefore. action should be taken under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_558">Art. 356</a>,	 cl.
(1)  is	 essentially a political question entrusted  by	 the
Constitution  to the Union executive and on that account  it
is  not justiciable before the Court.  He urged that  having
regard	to  the political nature of the problem, it  is	 not
amenable to judicial determination and hence the Court	must
abstain	 from  inquiring into, it.  We do not think  we	 can
accept	this  argument.	  Of course, it is true	 that  if  a
question  brought  before the Court is	purely	a  political
question  not involving determination of any legal  or	con-
stitutional  right  or	obligation,  the  Court	 would	 not
entertain  it,	since  the  Court  is  concerned  only	with
adjudication  of legal rights and liabilities.	 But  merely
because	 a  question  has a political  complexion,  that  by
itself	is  no	ground	why the	 Court	should	shrink	from
performing  its duty under the Constitution if it raises  an
issue of constitutional determination.	Every constitutional
question   concerns   the   allocation	 and   exercise	  of
governmental  power  and  no  constitutional  question	can,
therefore, fail to be political.  A constitution is a matter
of purest politics, a structure of power and as pointed	 out
by Charles Black in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">80</span>
Perspectives  in  Constitutional law'  "constitutional	law'
symbolizes  an	intersection of law  and  politics,  wherein
issues of political power are acted on by persons trained in
the  legal  tradition,	working	 in  judicial  institutions,
following the procedures of law, thinking as lawyers think".
It was pointed out by Mr. Justice Brennan in the Opinion  of
the  Court  delivered by him in Baker v. Carr,(1)  an  apoch
making	decision  in American constitutional  history,	that
"the  mere  fact  that	the  suit  seeks  protection,  of  a
political  right does not mean that it presents a  political
question."  This was put in more emphatic terms in Nixon  v.
Herndon(2) by saying that such an objection "is little	more
than  a play upon words".  The, decision in Baker  v.  Carr,
(Supra)	 was  indeed  a striking advance  in  the  field  of
constitutional law in the United States.  Even before  Baker
v. Carr., the courts in the United States were dealing	with
a  host of questions 'political' in ordinary  comprehension.
Even  the  desegregation decision of the  Supreme  Court  in
Brown  v.  Board  of Education(3) had  a  clearly  political
complexion.  The Supreme Court also entertained questions in
regard	to  the	 political  right  of  voting  and  felt  no
hesitation about relieving against racial discrimination  in
voting	and in Gomillion v. Lightfoot(4), it did  this	even
when the racial discrimination was covert, being achieved by
so  redrawing a municipal boundary as to  exclude  virtually
all Negroes, and no whites, from the city franchise.  It  is
true that in Colegrove v. Green(5) the Supreme Court refused
relief	against	 Congressional	districting  inequities	  in
illinois,  but only three out of seven Justices who  sat  in
that case based their decision on the ground that the  ques-
tion presented before them was political and non-justiciable
and  this view was in effect and substance reversed  by	 the
Supreme Court in Baker v. Carr.	 The Supreme Court in  Baker
v.  Carr,  held	 that it was within the	 competence  of	 the
federal Courts to entertain an action challenging a  statute
apportioning legislative districts as contrary to the  equal
protection clause.  This case clearly decided a	 controversy
which  was political in character, namely,  apportioning  of
legislative districts but it did so because a constitutional
question-of  violation	of the equal protection	 clause	 was
directly   involved  and  that	question  was  plainly	 and
indubitably   within  the  jurisdiction	 of  the  Court	  to
decide.It  will,  therefore,be seen that  merely  because  a
question  has a political colour, the Court cannot fold	 its
hands in despair and declare as a question arises whether an
authority under the constitution has acted within the limits
of its power or exceeded it, it can certainly be  decided by
the Court.  Indeed it would be its constitutional obligation
to do so.  It is necessary to assert in the clearest  terms,
particularly  in  the context of recent	 history,  that	 the
Constitution is Suprema lex, the paramount law of the  land,
and there is no department or branch of government above  or
beyond	it.  Every organ of government, be it the  executive
or  the legislature or the judiciary, derives its  authority
from the Constitution and it has to act
(1)  369 U.S. 186.
</p><p id="p_192">(2)  273 U.S. 536.
</p><p id="p_193">(3)  347 U.S. 483.

</p><p id="p_195">(5 ) 328 U.S. 549.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_68">81</span>
<p id="p_196">within the limits of its authority.  No one howsoever highly
placed	and no authority howsoever lofty can claim  that  it
shall be the sole judge of the extent of its power under the
Constitution or whether its action is within the confines of
such  power laid down the Constitution.	 This Court  is	 the
ultimate  interpreter of the Constitution and to this  Court
is  assigned  the delicate task of determining what  is	 the
power conferred on each branch of government, whether it  is
limited,  and  if so, what are the limits  and	whether	 any
action	of that branch transgresses such limits.  It is	 for
this  Court  to	 uphold the ,constitutional  values  and  to
enforce the constitutional limitations.	 That is the essence
of  the	 rule  of law.	To quote the words  of	Mr.  Justice
Brennan in Baker v. Carr, "Deciding whether a matter has  in
any  measure been committed by the Constitution	 to  another
branch	of government or whether the action of that  branch
exceeds	 whatever authority has been committed, is itself  a
delicate exercise in constitutional interpretation and is  a
responsibility of this Court as ultimate interpreter of	 the
Constitution".	 Where	there  is  manifestly	unauthorised
exercise of power under the Constitution, it is the duty  of
the Court to intervene.	 Let it not be forgotten, that	to
this  Court as much as to other branches of  government,  is
committed  the	conservation and furtherance  of  democratic
values.	 The Court's task is to identify those values in the
constitutional plan and to work them into life in the  cases
that  reach  the Court.	 "Tact and wise restraint  ought  to
tamper	 any  power  but  courage  and	the  acceptance	  of
responsibility have their place too".  The Court cannot	 and
should	not shirk this responsibility, because it has  sworn
the  oath  of  alligance to the	 Constitution  and  is	also
accountable to the people of this Country.  There are indeed
numerous decisions of this Court where constitutional issues
have  been adjudicated upon though enmeshed in questions  of
religious  tenets, social practices, economic doctrines	 or
educational   policies.	  The  Court  has  in  these   cases
adjudicated  not  upon the social, religious,  economic	 ,or
other  issues,	but solely on the  constitutional  questions
brought	 before it and in doing so, the Court has  not	been
deterred by the fact that these constitutional questions may
have such other overtones or facets.  We cannot,  therefore,
decline	 to  examine  whether there  is	 any  constitutional
violation involved in the President doing what he  threatens
to  do,	 merely on the facile ground that  the	question  is
political in tone, colour or complexion.
</p><p id="p_197">But  when  we  say  this, we must make	it  clear  that	 the
constitutional	jurisdiction of this Court is confined	only
to  saying whether the limits on the power conferred by	 the
Constitution have been observed or there is transgression of
such  limits.	Here  the only limit on	 the  Power  of	 the
President  under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_559">Art. 356</a>, cl. (1) is	that  the  President
should	be satisfied that a situation has arisen  where	 the
Government  of the State cannot be carried on in  accordance
with the provisions of the Constitution.  The  satisfaction
of  the President is a subjective one and ,cannot be  tested
by reference to any objective tests.  It is deliberately and
advisedly subjective because the matter in respect to  which
he is to be satisfied is of such a nature that its  decision
must  necessarily  be  left  to	 the  executive	 branch	  of
Government.   There may be a wide range of situations  which
may arise and their political implications and consequences
may have to be evaluated in order to decide whether
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_69">82</span>
the  situation	is  such that the Government  of  the  State
cannot	be carried on in accordance with the  provisions  of
the  Constitution.  It is not a decision which can be  based
on what the Supreme Court of United States has described  as
"judicially discoverable and manageable standards." It would
largely	 be  a	political judgment based  on  assessment  of
diverse	 and  varied  factors,	fast  changing	 situations,
potential  consequences,  public reaction,  motivations	 and
responses   of	different  classes  of	people	 and   their
anticipated   future   behaviour  and  a   host	  of   other
considerations, in the light of experience of public affairs
and  pragmatic	management  of	complex	 and  often  curious
adjustments  that  go to make up  the  highly  sophisticated
mechanism  of  a modern democratic government.	 It  cannot,
therefore,  by its very nature be a fit subject	 matter	 for
judicial   determination  and  hence  it  is  left  to	 the
subjective  satisfaction of the Central Government which  is
best  in a position to decide it.  The Court cannot  in	 the
circumstances,	go  into  the  question	 of  correctness  or
adequacy  of  the  facts  and  circumstances  on  which	 the
satisfaction of the Central Government is based.  That would
be  a dangerous exercise for the Court, both because  it  is
not a fit instrument for determining a question of this kind
and also because the Court would thereby usurp the  function
of  the	 Central  Government  and in  doing  so,  enter	 the
'Political thicket', which it must avoid if it is to  retain
its  legitimacy	 with the people.  In fact it would  not  be
possible  for  the Court to undertake this  exercise,  apart
from total lack of jurisdiction to do so, since by reason of
<a href="/doc/127060/" id="a_560">Art.  74</a>  cl. (2), the question whether any and if  so	what
advice was tendered by the Ministers to the President cannot
be  enquired  into by the Court, and  moreover,	 "the  steps
taken  by  the	responsible Government	may  be	 founded  on
information  and  apprehensions which are not known  to	 and
cannot	always be made, known to, those who seek  to  impugn
what  has been done.,' (Vide Ningkan v. Government of  Malay
sica (1).  But one thing is certain that if the satisfaction
is mala fide or is based on wholly extraneous and irrelevant
grounds,  the Court would have jurisdiction to	examine	 it,
because	 in that case there would be no satisfaction of	 the
President in regard to the matter which he is required to be
satisfied.  The satisfaction of the President is a condition
precedent  to the exercise of power under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_561">Art. 356</a>, cl.	 (1)
and if it can be shown that there is no satisfaction of	 the
President  at  all,  the  exercise of  the  power  would  be
constitutionally invalid.  Of course by reason of cl. (5) of
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_562">Art.  356</a>,  the satisfaction of the President is  final	 and
conclusive  and	 cannot be assailed on any ground  but	this
immunity from attack cannot apply where the challenge is not
that  the satisfaction is improper or unjustified, but	that
there is, no satisfaction at all.  In such a case it is	 not
the  satisfaction  arrived  at by  the	President  which  is
challenged,  but the existence of the  satisfaction  itself.
Take,  for  example, a case where the  President  gives	 the
reason	for taking action under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_563">Art. 356</a>, cl. (1)  and	says
that he is doing so, because the Chief Minister of the State
is below five feet in height and, therefore, in his  opinion
a  situation  has arisen where the Government of  the  State
cannot	be carried on in accordance with the  provisions  of
the  Constitution.   Can the so called satisfaction  of	 the
President  in  such a case not be challenged on	 the  ground
that it is absurd or perverse or mala fide or based on
(1)  [1970] A.C. 379.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_70">83</span>
<p id="p_198">a wholly extraneous and irrelevant ground and is, therefore,
no satisfaction at all.	 It must of course be concerned that
in  most cases it would be difficult, if not impossible,  to
challenge  the	exercise of power under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_564">Art. 356</a>, cl.  (1  )
even   on  this	 limited  ground,  because  the	 facts	 and
circumstances  on which the satisfaction is based would	 not
be  known,  but where it is possible, the existence  of	 the
satisfaction can always be challenged on the ground that  it
is  mala fide or based on wholly extraneous  and  irrelevant
grounds.  This proposition derives support from the decision
of  the	 Judicial  Committee of the Privy  Council  in	King
Emperor	 v. Banwari Lal Sarma(1) where Viscount Simon,	L.C.
agreed that the Governor General in declaring that emergency
exists	must  act  bona	 fide and  in  accordance  with	 his
statutory powers.  This is the narrow minimal area in  which
the exercise of power under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_565">Art. 356</a>, cl. (1) is subject  to
judicial  review and apart from it, it cannot rest with	 the
Court  to challenge the satisfaction of the  President	that
the situation contemplated in that clause exists.
Let  us now turn to the facts and examine them in the  light
of  the principle discussed.  It would seem from  the  above
discussion  that if it can be established affirmatively	 (1)
that  the proposed action of the President under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_566">Art.	356</a>,
Cl.  (1)  would	 be  based only	 on  the  (,round  that	 the
Legislative  Assemblies of the Plaintiff-States have  ceased
to  reflect  the  will of the electorate  and  they  should,
therefore, be dissolved with a view to giving an opportunity
to  the people to elect their true representatives  and	 (2)
that this ground is wholly extraneous and irrelevant to	 the
question which the President has to consider for the purpose
of  arriving at the requisite satisfaction,  the  Plaintiff-
States might have a case for injunction against the Union of
India.	 But  we  are  afraid  that  neither  of  these	 two
propositions  can be said to be established in	the  present
suits.
</p><p id="p_199">Re  :  Proposition 1 : It is not possible to accede  to	 the
argument  of the Plaintiff-StaLes that the ground  that	 the
Legislative Assemblies of the Plaintiff-States have lost the
mandate of the people and no longer reflect the will of	 the
electorate  is the only ground on which the President  would
act,  in  case he decides to exercise the power	 under	<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_567">Art.
356</a>, Cl. (1), which, subsequent to, the making of our  order
on  29th April, 1977, he has in fact done.  It is true	that
this  ground is mentioned in the 'directive' of Shri  Charan
Singh and the statement of Shri Shanti Bhushan, but it would
be  hazardous  in the extreme to proceed on  the  assumption
that  this  would be the only ground before the	 Council  of
Ministers  when it considers whether or not to	take  action
under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_568">Art. 356</a>, Cl. (1).  There may be other grounds  before
the Council of Ministers which may not have been articulated
by  Shri Charan Singh and Shri Shanti Bhushan.	It  is	also
possible  that in a rapidly changing situation, new  grounds
may  emerge by the time the Council of	Ministers  considers
the  question and these grounds may persuade the Council  of
Ministers to decide to take action under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_569">Art. 356</a>, Cl.	(1).
The Court cannot equate the points of view expressed by Shri
Charan Singh and Shri Shanti Bhushan with the advice of	 the
Council of Ministers nor can the Court speculate as to	what
would be

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_71">84</span>
<p id="p_200">the grounds which would ultimately weigh with the Council of
Ministers.   Moreover, it may be noted that this is not	 the
only  ground referred to in the 'directive' of	Shri  Charan
Singh.	He has also after referring to the virtual rejection
in  the Lok Sabha elections, of the candidates belonging  to
the ruling party in the Plaintiff-States, pointed out
	      The   resultant  climate	of  uncertainty	  is
	      causing grave concern to us.  We have  reasons
	      to  believe that this has created a  sense  of
	      diffidence    at	  different    levels	  of
	      Administration.	People at large do  not	 any
	      longer appreciate the propriety of continuance
	      in  power of a party which has been  unmistak-
	      ably rejected by the electorate.	The  climate
	      of uncertainty, diffidence and disrespect	 has
	      already  given rise to serious threats to	 law
	      and order."
</p><p id="p_201">The  premise  on  which the  entire  superstructure  of	 the
argument of the Plaintiff-States is based is thus wanting.
Re  :  Proposition 2 : It is not necessary to  consider	 the
question arising under this proposition on the view taken by
us  in	regard	to  the first  proposition,  but  since	 the
question  was argued before us in some detail, we  think  it
proper	to express our opinion upon it.	 The question  is  :
can the ground that the Legislative Assembly of a State	 has
ceased	to reflect the will of the electorate and  that	 the
Legislative Assembly and the electorate are at variance with
each  other be said to be wholly extraneous  and  irrelevant
for  the  purpose of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_570">Art. 356.</a>	Cl. (1) ? Has it  any  nexus
with the matter in regard to which the President is required
to  be satisfied under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_571">Art. 356</a>, Cl. (1) ? Does it  bear  at
all  on	 the  carrying of the Government  of  the  State  in
accordance with the provisions of the Constitution ? Now, we
have no doubt at all that merely because the ruling party in
a State suffers defeat in the elections to the Lok Sabha  or
for the matter of that, in the panchayat elections, that  by
itself	can be no ground for saying that the  Government  of
the  State  cannot  be carried on  in  accordance  with	 the
provisions of the Constitution.	 The Federal structure under
our  constitution clearly postulates that there may  be	 one
party  in power in the State and another at the Centre.	  It
is  also not an unusual phenomenon that the same  electorate
may  elect  a  majority	 of members  of	 one  party  to	 the
Legislative  Assembly,	while at the same  time	 electing  a
majority  of  members  of another party to  the	 Lok  Sabha.
Moreover,  the	Legislative Assembly, once  elected,  is  to
continue  for  a  specific  term  and  mere  defeat  at	 the
elections  to the Lok Sabha prior to the expiration  of	 the
term  without  anything	 more would be	no  ground  for	 its
dissolution.  The defeat would not necessarily in all  cases
indicate  that	the electorate is no longer  supporting	 the
ruling party because the issues may be different.  But	even
if it were indicative of a definite shift in the opinion  of
the  electorate,  that	by itself would	 be  no	 ground	 for
dissolution,  because  the  Constitution  contemplates	that
ordinarily the will of the electorate shall be expressed  at
the end of the term of the Legislative Assembly and a change
in  the electorate's will in between would not be  relevant.
It may be noted that the Constitution does not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_72">85</span>
provide for a right of recall, individual or collective.  If
such a provision were there it might have perhaps  justified
the argument that the ruling party in the State having	lost
in  the elections to the Lok Sabha, the continuance  of	 the
Legislative  Assembly  would not be in accordance  With	 the
provisions of the Constitution.	 To dissolve the Legislative
a  provision, the defeat of the ruling party in a  State  at
the  Lok Sabha elections cannot by itself, without  anything
more, support the inference that the Government of the State
cannot	be carried on in accordance with the  provisions  of
the  Constitution.   To dissolve  the  Legislative  Assembly
solely	on such ground would be an indirect exercise of	 the
right of recall of all the members by the President  without
there  being  any provision in the Constitution	 for  recall
even  by  the electorate.  The situation here  is,  however,
wholly different.  This is not a case where just an ordinary
defeat	has been suffered by the ruling party in a State  at
the elections to the Lok Sabha.	 There has been a total rout
of candidates belonging to the ruling party.  In some of the
Plaintiff  States,  the ruling party has not  been  able  to
secure a single seat.  Never in the history of this  country
has such a clear and unequivocal verdict being given by	 the
people,	 never a more massive vote of no-confidence  in	 the
ruling	party.	When there is such crushing defeat  suffered
by the ruling party and the people have expressed themselves
categorically  against	its policies, it is  symptomatic  of
complete  alienation between the Government and the  people.
It is axiomatic that no Government can function	 efficiently
and  effectively  in accordance with the Constitution  in  a
democratic set up unless it enjoys the goodwill and  support
of the people.	Where there is a wall of estrangement  which
divides	 the  Government  from	the  people,  and  there  is
resentment and antipathy in the hearts of the people against
the  Government, it is not at all unlikely that it may	lead
to instability and even the administration may be paralysed.
The consent of the people is the basis of democratic form of
Government  and when that is withdrawn so entirely  and	 un-
equivocally  as	 to  leave  no	room  for  doubt  about	 the
intensity  of public feeling against the ruling	 party,	 the
moral  authority  of  the  Government  would  be   seriously
undermined  and a situation may arise where the	 people	 may
cease	to  give  respect  and	obedience  to	governmental
authority  and even conflict and confrontation	may  develop
between the Government and the people leading to collapse of
administration.	 These are all consequences which cannot  be
said  to be unlikely to arise from such an unusual state  of
affairs	 and they may make it impossible for the  Government
of  the	 State	to  be carried on  in  accordance  with	 the
provisions  of	the Constitution, Whether the  situation  is
fraught	 with such consequences or not is entirely a  matter
of   political	 judgment  for	the  executive	 branch	  of
Government.   But it cannot be said that ,such	consequences
can never ensue and that the ground that on account of total
and  massive  defeat of the ruling party in  the  Lok  Sabha
elections, the Legislative Assembly of the State has  ceased
to  reflect  the will of the people and	 there	is  complete
alienation  between the Legislative Assembly and the  people
is  wholly extraneous or irrelevant to the purpose  of	<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_572">Art.
356</a>,  Cl. (1).	We hold that on the facts and  circumstances
of the present case this ground is clearly a relevant ground
having	reasonable nexus with the matter in regard to  which
the  President	is required to be  satisfied  before  taking
action under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_573">Art. 356.</a>	Cl. (1).

<p id="p_202">These are the reasons which have prevailed with us in making
our  order dated 29th April, 1977 dismissing the  Suits	 and
Writ   Petitions  and  rejecting  the  prayer  for   interim
injunction.
</p><p id="p_203">GOSWAMI,  J.-We	 already dismissed the suits  and  the	writ
petitions on April 29,1977, and accordingly rejected  the
prayers for interim injunctions. We  promised to give  our
reasons later and the same may now be stated.
The facts of all these matters appear in the judgment of the
learned Chief Justice and need not be repeated.
The  fundamental  questions  'involved in  these  suits	 are
these,
	      (1)   Do	the suits lie under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_574">Article  131</a>  of
	      the Constitution		   of India ?

</p><p id="p_206">	      (3)   If	the suits lie, is there a case,	 for
	      permanent injunction and,. as an	intermediate
	      step, for an interim temporary injunction ?
</p><pre id="pre_2">	      (4)   Have    the	  writ	  petitioners	 any
	      fundamental    rights   to   maintain    their
	      applications   under   <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_576">Article   32</a>   of	 the
	      Constitution?'
</pre><p id="p_207">In these suits as well as in the Writ Petitions the  central
issue  that  is involved is the constitutional	right  of  a
Council	 of  Ministers to function as the  Government  of  a
State and of a Legislative Assembly to continue until expiry
of its term provided for in the Constitution.
The suits are filed under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_577">Article 131</a> of the,  Constitution.
<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_578">Article 131</a> gives this Court exclusive original jurisdiction
in any dispute-

</blockquote><p id="p_208">Although the expression used in <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_579">Article 131</a> is any  dispute,
the  width  of the expression is limited by the	 words	that
follow	in  respect  of the nature of dispute  that  can  be
entertained by this Court in its original jurisdiction.	  It
is only a dispute which involves any question of law or fact
on  which the, existence or extent of a legal right  of	 the
contending party depends that can be the subject matter of a
suit under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_580">Article 131.</a>	 The dispute should be in respect of
legal  rights and not disputes of political character.	 The
Article, thus, refers to the parties that may be arrayed  in
the  litigation	 as  well as to the subject  matter  of	 the
dispute. (<a href="/doc/895521/" id="a_581">See State of Bihar v. Union of India &amp; Anr</a>.).(1)
(1)[1970]   2 S.C.R. 522.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_74">87</span>
<p id="p_209">The  suits  are,  in  form, being filed	 by  the  States  of
Rajasthan,  Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Bihar, Himachal  Pradesh
and  Orissa.   But is the dispute  sought  for	adjudication
within the scope or ambit of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_582">Article 131 ?</a> That is the first
question.
</p><p id="p_210">In a parliamentary form of Government when one Government is
replaced by another, the State's continuity is not  snapped.
There may come a moment in the life of a Government when  it
may  cease  to be truly representative of  the	people	and,
therefore,  the. interest of the State as a polity or  legal
entity	and  that  of the Government  established  on  party
system	may  cease to be identical.  In	 such  a  situation,
factual	 or  imminent, a suit by a State Government  in	 the
name  of the State against the Union Government's action  in
defence,  of the former's legitimate existence and right  of
continuance will not relate to the legal right of the State.
The  judgment,	whether in truth and  reality  a  particular
situation exists or is portentously imminent, may be correct
or  incorrect,	but it is a political  issue.	The  Court's
jurisdiction is not political but entirely judicial.
The  right  of	a  particular State to	sue  is	 not  always
equivalent  to the right of the Council of Ministers in	 all
matters.   Even	 if  a	Government  goes  the  State  lives.
Whether	 a  particular	Council	 of  Ministers	can  survive
threats	 to their existence depends no doubt immediately  on
its  ability to enjoy the confidence of the majority in	 the
Legislature, but also, in the last resort, in its ability to
enjoy  the  confidence	of  the	 political  sovereign,	 the
electorate.  The questions affecting the latter domain	are.
of  highly political complexion and appertain  to  political
rights	of  the Government and not to legal  rights  of	 the
State.	  The	rights	agitated  by  the   plaintiffs	 are
principally of the Governments concerned who are  interested
in continuing the legislatures whose confidence they  enjoy.
On the other hand, it is claimed by the Home Minister in his
letter that these Legislatures have lost the mandate of	 the
people	and  that there is clear evidence ,of  their  having
lost the confidence of the people as a result of the verdict
in the recent general election to the Parliament.  The Court
is  not concerned whether this is a (correct  assessment  or
not.   The  Union Government is entitled to  take  political
decisions.   However,  even if a political decision  of	 the
Government  of India affects legal rights of the State as  a
legal entity, the existence and extent of that right will be
triable	 under	<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_583">Article	 131.</a>  The question  is,  are  legal
rights of the State involved in the dispute ?
<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_584">Article 131</a> speaks of a legal right.  That legal right	must
he that ,of the State.	The dispute about a legal right, its
existence  or extent, must be capable of  agitation  between
the  Government of India and the States.  The  character  of
the dispute within the scope of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_585">Article 131</a> that emerges  is
with  regard to, a legal right which the States may be	able
to claim against the Government.  For example, the State  as
a  party  must	affirm a legal right of its  own  which	 the
Government  of India has denied or is interested in  denying
giving	rise  to  a cause of action.   For  the	 purpose  of
deciding whether <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_586">Article 131</a> is attracted the subject matter
of the dispute, therefore, assumes great importance.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">88</span>
<p id="p_211">Part  VI  deals with the States.  The word  "State"  is	 not
defined	 for  the  purpose of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_587">Article 131</a>  in  Part  V.	 The
"State"	 is,  however,	defined under  <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_588">Article	12</a>  for	 the
purpose Part III (Fundamental Rights).	This	 is	 the
definition also for Part IV (Directive principles of  State,
Policy).   Under  <a href="/doc/216211/" id="a_589">Article  367(1</a>),  the	 provisions  of	 the
<a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_590">General	  Clauses   Act</a>,   1897,  are	a   applicable	 for
interpretation	of the constitution.  <a href="/doc/174566148/" id="a_591">Section 3(58)</a>  of	 the
General Clauses Act defines State, after the commencement of
the  Constitution (Seventh Amendment), Act, 1956, to mean  a
State  specified in the First Schedule to  the	Constitution
and shall include a Union Territory.  The First Schedule  to
the   Constitution   describes	22  States   and   9   Union
Territories.   The  State Government is	 separately  defined
under section 3(60) of the General Clauses Act-thus  keeping
the distinction.  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_592">Article 131</a> of the Constitution relates to
legal  rights  of the State or of the Government  of  India.
Any   violation	 of  the  provisions  of  the	Constitution
impinging  on the rights of the States or of the  Government
of India will be justiciable under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_593">Article 131.</a>	  Similarly,
boundary  disputes or disputes relating to rival  claims  to
receipts from taxes and other duties between two States	 are
cognizable by this Court, to refer only to a few  instances.
Now  in these above mentioned cases the rights of the  State
as  a legal entity distinguished from the Government,  being
the  executive	agent,	will  be  involved.   Even  if	 one
Government is replaced by another Government, such a dispute
will not abate or disappear since the State endures and	 the
cause of action survives.
</p><p id="p_212">Keeping	 in  view the, above concept, we will  undertake  to
examine the nature of the dispute which is involved in these
suits.	 Shortly stated the States apprehend a grave  threat
to  the assumption of the executive functions of, the  State
by  the	 President  on non compliance with  the	 advice	 or
direction contained in the letter of the Home Minister.	  It
is true that the threat to an illegal action also  furnishes
a cause of action for a suit or proceeding.
</p><p id="p_213">     Under  <a href="/doc/6135/" id="a_594">Article 172(1)</a> all the State Assemblies,  except
Orissa,	  will	continue,  if not dissolved earlier,  for  a
period	of six years from the date appointed for  its  first
meeting and in that view in the normal course will continue
for  some  more months.	 The Legislative  Assembly  of'	 the
State of Orissa, on the other hand, having held its election
in 1974, will in the normal course continue till 1980 unless
earlier dissolved.     The States apprehend that this normal
life of the Legislatures is going to be snapped resulting in
the,  annihilation of their legal and constitutional  rights
under  <a href="/doc/6135/" id="a_595">Article 172(1).</a> That furnishes a cause of action	 for
the   suits  for  permanent  injunction	 according  to	 the
plaintiffs.
</p><p id="p_214">The  dispute  is this : The Home,  Minister,  Government  of
India,	is asking the Chief Ministers of the Governments  of
the   States  to  advise  the  Governors  to  dissolve	 the
Legislative  Assemblies.   The Chief Ministers	declined  to
accept the advice and filed the suits.	What is the,  nature
of this dispute ?  On the one hand there is the claim
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">89</span>
of  a right to continue the present Government of the  State
and necessarily to continue the Legislative Assembly and  on
the other the right to take action under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_596">Article 356</a> by	 the
President  to  assume  functions of  the  State	 Government.
'This dispute involves a major issue of great constitutional
importance   and   the	aggrieved  party  may	have   other
appropriate.  forum  to	 complain  against  any	 substantial
injury Even so, it is not a dispute between the State on the
one hand and the Government of India on the other.  It is  a
real  dispute  between the Government of the State  and	 the
Government of India.  It is, no doubt a question of life and
death for the State Government but not so for the State as a
legal  entity.	Even after the dissolution of  the  Assembly
the  State will continue to have a Government for  the	time
being  as  provided  for  in  the  Constitution	 in  such  a
(contingency.
</p><p id="p_215">A Legislature of the State under <a href="/doc/1555093/" id="a_597">Article 168</a> consists of the
Governor  and the Legislative Assembly or where there  is  a
Legislative  Council  both the, Houses.	 This also  has	 its
significance  in  comprehending the nature of  the  dispute.
The members constituting the State Legislature of which the
Council	 of Ministers is the executive body, alone,  do	 not
even  constitute the State Legislature.	 The Governor is  an
integral   part	  of  the  State   Legislature	 under	 the
Constitution.  The rights of the Council of Ministers or  of
the  members of the State Legislature cannot, therefore,  be
equated	 with  the  rights of the State	 even  though  those
rights may be those of the State Government, pro tempore.
The  distinction  between the, State and the  Government  is
brought	 out  with  conspicuous	 clarity  in  the  following
passages :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_33">	      "The  distinction	 between the State  and	 its
	      Government  is  analogous to  that  between  a
	      given   human  individual,  as  a	 moral	 and
	      intellectual person, and his material physical
	      body  :  By the term State is  understood	 the
	      political person or entity which possesses the
	      law  making right.  By the term Government  is
	      understood  the agency through which the	will
	      of  the  State is	 formulated,  expressed	 and
	      executed.	  The  Government thus acts  as	 the
	      machinery of the State, and those who  operate
	      this machinery............. act as the  agents
	      of the State."(")
	      "In all constitutionally organised States	 the
	      State  is permitted to sue in the	 courts	 not
	      only with reference to its own proprietary  or
	      contractual  interests, but also in behalf  of
	      the  general  interests of its  citizen  body.
	      When  appearing  as plaintiff  in	 the  latter
	      capacity it is known as Parens Patriae.	This
	      jurisprudential  doctrine	 is  stated  in	 the
	      Cyclopedia of Law and Procedure as follows :-
	      'A   State,  like	 any  other  party,   cannot
	      maintain a suit unless it appears that it	 has
	      such an interest in the subject-matter thereof
	      as  to authorise the bringing of the  suit  by
	      it.

I  am  clearly of opinion that the, subject  matter  of	 the
dispute in these suits does not appertain to legal rights of
the  States concerned to satisfy the requirement of  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_598">Article
131</a>  of the Constitution.  These suits are,  therefore,	 not
maintainable in law and on this ground they are liable to be
dismissed.

and is bound to act on the aid and advice of the Council  of
Ministers (<a href="/doc/127060/" id="a_599">Article 74</a>).	 This  was the position even  before
the amendment of <a href="/doc/1951021/" id="a_600">Article 74(1)</a>	   of  the  Constitution  by
the 42nd Amendment (<a href="/doc/1382698/" id="a_601">See Shamsher Singh	&amp;  Anr. v. State  of
Punjab</a>) (2). The position has been made absolutely  explicit
by  the amendment of <a href="/doc/1951021/" id="a_602">Article 74(1)</a> by the Constitution	42nd
Amendment which says "there shall be a Council of  Ministers
with  the Prime Minister at the head to aid and	 advise	 the
President  who shall, in the exercise of his functions,	 act
in  accordance	with  such  advise."  What  was	  judicially
interpreted  even under the unamended <a href="/doc/1951021/" id="a_603">Article 74(1)</a> has	 now
been  given  parliamentary recognition by  the	Constitution
Amendment.   There  can,  therefore, be no  doubt  that	 the
decision under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_604">Article 356</a> of the Constitution which is made
by the President is a decision of the Council of  Ministers.
Because certain reasons ate given in the letter of the	Home
Minister,  it  cannot be said that those will, be  the	only
grounds which will weigh with the Council of Ministers	when
they  finally  take  a decision when  the  advise  has	been
rejected  by  the  Chief  Ministers.   There  are  so	many
imponderables  that  may intervene between the time  of	 the
letter and the actual advice of the Council of Ministers  to
the  President.	  There	 may  be  further  developments	  or
apprehension  of developments which the Government may	have
to  take  not of and finally when the Council  of  Ministers
decides	 and advises the President to issue  a	proclamation
under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_605">Article 356</a>, the Court will be barred from  enquiring
into  the  advice that was tendered by the  Cabinet  to	 the

the   satisfaction   of	 the  President	  in   issuing	 the
proclamation  under  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_608">Article  356(1)</a>  shall  be	 final	 and

view  of  this	stand  of the Union that  Mr.  De  drew	 our
attention  to  Benoari Lai Sarma's case	 (supra)  where	 the
Privy  Council seems to have indicated that the question  of
mala fides could be gone in to by the court.  Mr. De submits
that a mala fide order under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_612">Article 356</a> will be no order in
the eye of law.
</p><p id="p_229">I am not prepared to say that this Court, which is the	last
recourse  for  the oppressed and the bewildered,  will,	 for
good,  refuse  to  consider when  there	 may  be  sufficient
materials  to  establish that a proclamation  under  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_613">Article

to add that the grounds given in the Home Minister's  letter
cannot	be  any strength of imagination be held to  be	mala

reasonable  nexus with the subject of a	 proclamation  under
<a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_614">Article	 356(1)</a> of the Constitution.  The matter would	have
been  entirely	different if there were	 no  proposal,	pari

to these Assemblies.
</p><p id="p_230">In  view of my conclusion that the suits and Writ  Petitions
are not maintainable I do not feel called upon to deal	with
the   question	whether	 there	is  a  case  for   permanent
injunction or other appropriate writ in these matters.	 The
suits  and  the	 Writ  Petitions  were,	 therefore,  already
dismissed.
</p><p id="p_231">I  part	 with the records with a cold  shudder.	  The  Chief
Justice was good enough to tell us that the acting President
saw  him during the time we were considering judgment  after
having already announced the order and there was mention  of
this  pending matter during the conversation.  I have  given
this  revelation  the  most anxious  thought  and  even	 the
strongest  judicial restraint which a Judge would prefer  to
exercise,  leaves me no option but to place this  on  record
hoping that the majesty of the High Office of the President,
who should be beyond the high-watermark of any	controversy,
suffers not in future.
</p><p id="p_232">UNTWALIA, J. The unanimous order of the Bench in these cases
was  delivered on April 29, 1977.  The judgments in  support
of  the	 order	are now being  delivered.   While  generally
agreeing  with the reasons given in the leading judgment  of
the  learned  Chief Justice, on some of the points  I  would
like  to  add a few words and make some observations  of  my
own.
</p><p id="p_233">As to the maintainability of the writ applications filed  by
some of the members of the Punjab Legislature under  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_615">Article
32</a>  of	the Constitution of India, I would,  as	 at  present
advised,  not  like to express any opinion one	way  or	 the
other.	I will assume in their favour that at the  threshold
the applications are maintainable.  Yet they do not make out
a  case	 for  issuance of any kind of  writ,  direction,  or
order.
</p><p id="p_234">But  as	 to  the maintainability of the	 suits	filed  under
<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_616">Article 131</a> by the various States I would like to say  that,
although  the  point is highly debatable and not  free	from
difficulty, the dispute of the kind raised in the suits does
not involve any question whether of law or fact on which the
existence or extent of any legal right of the States con-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_80">93</span>
<p id="p_235">cerned	depends.  To my mind the dispute raised	 is  between
the   Government  of  India  and  the  Government   or	 the
Legislative  Assembly of the States concerned.	One or	more
limbs,	namely, and the Government, the Legislature  or	 the
Judiciary  of  a  State cannot be equated  with	 the  State.
Although  the expression "legal right" occurring in  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_617">Article
131</a>  embraces within its ambit not only	 the  constitutional
rights	of the States but also other kinds of legal  rights,
the  dispute must relate to the territory, property or	some
other  kind of legal right of the State.  Broadly  speaking,
the  nature  of	 the  dispute in these	cases  is  that	 the
President  on  the advice of the Council  of  Ministers,  in
other  words, the Government of India proposes	to  exercise
his  powers under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_618">Article 356</a> for making a  proclamation  in
order  to  dissolve the Legislative Assembly  of  the  State
concerned  and	to dislodge the Council	 of  Ministers,	 the
particular  Government	in  power in  that  State.   Such  a
dispute, in my opinion, is not a dispute vis-a-vis the legal
right  of the State a unit of the Union of India.  It  falls
short  of  that.  What is alleged is that  pursuant  to	 the
impugned  proclamation the President will assume to  himself
all  or any of the functions of the Government of the  State
and all or any of the powers vested in or exercisable by the
Governor including the power to dissolve the Assembly  under
<a href="/doc/1782245/" id="a_619">Article	 174(2) (b).</a>  Such a proposed or  threatened  action
does  affect the legal right of the Government in power	 and
the  Legislative Assembly a part of the	 State	Legislature,
but  not  of  the State itself.	 The  State  undoubtedly  is
entitled to have a Governor a Government in one form or	 the
other and the Legislature.  No part of it can be  abolished.
Abolition would affect the legal right of the State.  But it
is not quite correct to say that a State has legal right  to
have  a particular Governor or a particular Government or  a
particular  Legislative Assembly.  In contrast to  the	word
"dissolved"  used  in  <a href="/doc/1582504/" id="a_620">Article 174</a> I would  point  ,out	 the
provision  of  "abolition" of the Legislative Council  of  a
State mentioned in <a href="/doc/1295106/" id="a_621">Article 169.</a>	 Similarly, to illustrate my
view point, I may refer to <a href="/doc/1606546/" id="a_622">Article 153</a> which provides "there
shall  be a Governor for each State", and <a href="/doc/227057/" id="a_623">Article 156</a>  which
provides for a particular Governor holding office during the
pleasure  of the President. if a dispute arises in  relation
to  an	action or threat of the Government  of	India  under
<a href="/doc/1606546/" id="a_624">Article	 153</a> it will affect the legal right of the State  as
the  State  cannot  exist without a Governor.	But  if	 the
dispute concerns merely the removal of a particular Governor
by  the	 President, it only affects the legal right  of	 the
person holding the office or the Government of the State but
not  of	 the  State itself.  That  the	distinction,  though
subtle,	 is significant and appreciable, is clear  from	 the
language  of  the various clauses of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_625">Article 131</a>  itself  as
also  from  the definitions of State  Governments  given  in
<a href="/doc/174566148/" id="a_626">section	 3</a> (5 8) and 3 (60) of the <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_627">General Clauses Act</a>.	  In
my  considered judgment, therefore, the suits as  instituted
under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_628">Article 131</a> are not maintainable.
</p><p id="p_236">But  I would not rest content to maintain the  dismissal  of
the suits only on this technical ground.
</p><p id="p_237">Putting the matter briefly in some words of my own as to the
merits of the suits I would like to emphasize, in the  first
instance,  that	 it  is	 difficult  to	presume,  assume  or
conclude  that the only basis of the proposed action by	 the
President is the facts mentioned in the letter of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_81">94</span>
Home Minister to the Chief Ministers of the States concerned
or  the	 speech	 of the Law Minister of	 the  Government  of
India.	 There	is  no warrant	nor  any  adequate  material
disclosed in any of the plaints in support of any  assertion
to the contrary.  Secondly, even if one were to assume	such
a  fact in favour of the plaintiffs or the  petitioners	 the
facts  disclosed, undoubtedly, lie in the field or  an	area
purely	of  a political nature, which are  essentially	non-
justiciable.  It would be legitimate to characterise such  a
field as prohibited area in which it is neither	 permissible
for  the  Courts  to enter nor should they  ever  take	upon
themselves the hazardous task of entering into such an area.
In  the very nature of things the President must be left  to
be  the sole Judge, of course, on the advice of his  Council
of  Ministers,	for  his satisfaction as  to  whether  there
exists or not a situation in which the Government of a State
cannot	be carried on in accordance with the  provisions  of
the  Constitution.   Such  a satisfaction may  be  based  on
receipt	 of  a	report	from the  Governor  of	a  State  or
otherwise.   Neither can the President be compelled to	dis-
close	all   the  facts  and  materials  leading   to	 his
satisfaction  for  an action under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_629">Article 356</a>	nor  is	 his
conclusion  as	to the arising of a situation  of  the	kind
envisaged  in  <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_630">Article 356(1</a>), generally speaking,  open  to
challenge even on the disclosed facts.
</p><p id="p_238">I, however, must hasten to add that I cannot persuade myself
to  subscribe  to the view that under  no  circumstances  an
order  of proclamation made by the President  under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_631">Article
356</a>  can be challenged in a Court of Law.  And, I am  saying
so notwithstanding the provision contained in clause (5)  of
the  said  Article  introduced	by  the	 Constitution  (38th
<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_632">Amendment)  Act</a>,  1975.	 In support of the  divergent  views
canvassed  before us either in relation to the	proclamation
of  emergency  under  <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_633">Article 352</a> or  a	 proclamation  under
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_634">Article 356</a>, extreme hypothetical examples were cited on one
side  or the other.  From a practical point of view most  of
such examples remain only in hypothesis and in an  imaginary
world.	 It is difficult to find them in realty but yet	 not
impossible in a: given case or cases.  Then, where lies	 the
difference?   Even before the introduction of clause (5)  in
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_635">Article 356</a> or a similar clause in some other Articles, such
as  Articles  352  and 123, the doors were  closed  for	 the
Courts	to enter the prohibited area which is popularly	 and
generally  called the political field.	If the	validity  of
the action taken by the President in exercise of his  power,
say,  under any of the three Articles referred to  above  is
challenged   attracting	 the  necessity	 of   entering	 the
prohibited  field to peep into the reality of the  situation
by  examination of the facts for themselves, either  on	 the
ground	of  legality or mala fides the	Courts	have  always
resisted  and  shall continue to resist	 the  inducement  to
enter  the Prohibited field; for example, Bhagat  Singh	 and
others v. The King-Emperor, (1) King-Emperor v. Benoari	 Lal
Sarma and others; (2)
(1)  58, Indian Appeals, 169.
</p><p id="p_239">(2)  72 Indian Appeals, 57.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_82">95</span>
<p id="p_240"><a href="/doc/1394213/" id="a_636">Lakhi Naryana Das v. The Province of Bihar</a> etc. etc.(1)	 and
<a href="/doc/110265/" id="a_637">M/s S.K. G.    Sugar  Ltd. v. State of Bihar and  Ors</a>.	(2).
To put it graphically clause (5)has merely put a seal  on
such closed doors to check more emphatically the  temptation
or  the urge to make the Courts enter the prohibited  field.
Attempts  have always been made by the party who is  out  of
the  field of power, if I can equate it with the  prohibited
field aforesaid, to induce the Court to enter that field  in
order  to  give	 relief against the  taking  of	 the  extra-
ordinary  steps	 by  the  President on	the  advice  of	 the
Government in power.  On the other hand, the party in  power
has  always resisted such move.	 In a democracy the  current
of  public opinion and franchise may push a particular	ship
on one side of the shore or the other.	But this Court, like
the  Pole Star, has to guide and has guided the path of	 all
mariners in an even manner remaining aloof from the  current
and irrespective of the fact whether a particular ship is on
this shore or that.
</p><p id="p_241">But  then,  what did I mean by saying that a  situation	 may
arise in a given case where the jurisdiction of the Court is
not  completely ousted ? I mean this.  If, without  entering
into the prohibited area, remaining on the fence, almost  on
the  face of the impugned order or the threatened action  of
the  President it is reasonably possible to say that in	 the
eye  of	 law it is no order or action as it is	in  flagrant
violation  of  the  very  words	 of  a	particular  Article,
justifying  the	 conclusion that the order is  ultra  vires,
wholly	illegal or passed mala fide, in such a situation  it
will be tantamount in law to be, no order at all.  Then this
Court  is not powerless to interfere with such an order	 and
may, rather, must strike it down.  But it is incompetent and
hazardous  for	the  Court  to	draw  such  conclusions	  by
investigation  of  facts  by entering  into  the  prohibited
area..	It would be equally untenable to say that the  Court
would be powerless to strike down the order, if on its face,
or, if I may put it, by going round the circumference of the
prohibited  area,  the	Court  finds the  order	 as  a	mere
pretense  or  a colourable exercise  of	 the  extra-ordinary
powers given under certain Articles of the Constitution.  In
a  given  case it may be possible to conclude that it  is  a
fraud  on  the exercise of the power.  But as  I  have	said
above  in all such types of cases from a practical point  of
view  are likely to seldom occur and even if they occur	 may
be  few and far between, the Courts have to arrive  at	such
conclusions  by	 checking  their  temptation  to  enter	 the
prohibited  area  of  facts  which  are	 essentially  of   a
political  nature.  It is in this context Lord	Mac  Dermott
seems to have observed in the case of Stephen Kalong Ningkan
and Government of Malaysia(3) at pages 391-92 :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_35">	      "The  issue  of justiciability raised  by	 the

<p id="p_245">	      the  Federation can be challenged	 before	 the
	      courts   on,   some  or  any  grounds   is   a
	      constitutional   question	  6(	far-reaching
	      importance which, on the present state of	 the
	      authorities, remains unsettled and debatable."
In  the application of the principle enunciated by me,	and.
in  the	 demarcation of the prohibited	area,  opinions	 may
sometimes differ, mistakes may sometimes be committed either
by  unduly enlarging the area of the prohibited field or  by
unduly	limiting.  But such differences are inherent in	 the
very  nature  of  administration of  justice  through  human
agency.	  No way out has yet been involved nor can one	con-
ceive  of a better methodology.	 Nonetheless the Courts	 and
the  Judges manning them are the best arbiters	of  judging,
their  own  limits of jurisdiction as the custodian  of	 the
functions  to watch and see every Limb of the  State  acting
under  the  constitution  in  accordance  with	it.   It  is
intrinsic  and not uncommon to find that a party in  control
of  the	 field which I have described as a  prohibited	area
would  be  trying  to view and make that area  as  large  as
possible and the party outside that field will endeavour  to
narrow	it down as far as feasible.  But the Courts do	keep
and  have  got to keep that area the same as far  as  it  is
humanly and legally possible to do so either for the one  or
the  other party.  It is neither possible nor  advisable  or
useful	to  make an attempt to define such  area  by  taking
examples  one way or the other to illustrate as to when	 the
Court  would  be  able to say that : "I am  striking  out  a
particular  order  of  the President  without  entering	 the
prohibited area or vice versa".	 In these cases I would rest
content	 by saying that, as I view the facts  placed  before
us, they are exclusively within the prohibited area.
The  main  theme of contention has been that  the  President
cannot	make the proclamation because when laid before	each
House  of  the Parliament in accordance with clause  (3)  of
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_638">Article	 356</a> it is sure Or very likely that it will  not  be
approved by the Rajya Sabha where the party in power in	 the
concerned  States  is in clear majority; in any	 event,	 the
President  cannot  and should not be permitted to  take	 any
action	pursuant  to  the  proclamation	 of  dissolving	 the
Assembly  without  the	approval  of  both  the	 Houses	  of
Parliament, as the act of dissolution will be  irretrievable
and  in flagrant violation of the federal structure  of	 the
constitution.	I  find no words of such limitation  on	 the
power  of  the President either in the original	 Article  as
framed	and passed by the Constituent Assembly or in any  of
the  amendments	 brought  therein from time  to	 time.	 The
proclamation  made and an action taken pursuant thereto,  if
otherwise valid and not open to challenge in the manner	 and
within the limitation I have indicated above, arc valid till
the  proclamation lasts, the maximum period of which is	 two
months	 even  without	the  approval  of  the	 Houses	  of
Parliament.   On the revocation of the proclamation  by	 the
President or its disapproval or non-approval by either House
of the Parliament the proclamation merely ceases to  operate
without	 in  any way affecting or  invalidating	 the  action
taken  pursuant	 to the proclamation before  its  cesser  of
operation.  No body has yet suggested, nor could any one  do
so,  with  any semblance of justification that such  a	wide
power  conferred  on  the President  even  by  the  original
constitution as passed and adopt-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_84">97</span>
<p id="p_246">ed by the people of India could have any relevancy to the so
called	destruction  of the basic federal structure  of	 the
constitution.  In this respect I, for myself, do not see any
appreciable  or	 relevant difference between the  action  of
dissolution  of	 an Assembly by the Governor of a  State  in
exercise  of his power under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_639">Article 1740</a>) (b), or  such  an
action	taken  pursuant to the	proclamation  under  <a href="/doc/1330132/" id="a_640">Article
356(1)	 (a).</a>	 There	may  be	 justifiable   and   genuine
differences  of opinion between the  politicians,  political
thinkers,  jurists  and others whether the  grounds  of	 the
proposed  action disclosed so far in the letter of the	Home
Minister or the speech of the Law Minister of the Government
of  India can necessarily lead to the conclusion  whether  a
situation  has arisen in which the Government of  the  State
cannot	be carried on in accordance with the  provisions  of
the constitution.  Firstly, the possibility of other grounds
being there for the proposed action under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_641">Article 356</a> cannot
be  ruled out.	Even if ruled out, the conclusion  drawn  on
the  facts  disclosed  cannot be said  to  be  so  perverse,
erroneous  and palpably unsustainable so as to	enable	this
Court  to  say that standing on the, fence  the	 Court	can,
declare	 that the proposed action of proclamation  on  these
facts  falls  in the category of the cases where  the  Court
will  be  justified  to prevent	 the  threatened  action  by
injuncting the President either to issue the proclamation or
to dissolve the Assembly of a particular State. 1, for	one,
would  meticulously  guard  myself  against  expressing	 any
opinion	 one way or the other except saying that  the  facts
disclosed so far, in my considered judgment, are  definitely
and   exclusively  within  the	prohibited  area   and	 the
conclusions   drawn  therefrom	are   reasonably   possible,
especially in the background of <a href="/doc/490234/" id="a_642">Article 355.</a>  On the  facts,
as they are, it is difficult, rather, impossible to say that
the proposed proclamation is going to be made mala fide with
an  ulterior  motive.  Apart from the  other  technical	 and
insurmountable difficulties which are therein the way of the
plaintiffs or the petitioners in getting any of the  reliefs
sought	I have thought it advisable to pin-point in  my	 own
humble way the main grounds in support of the order we	have
already declared.
</p><p id="p_247">FAZAL  ALI, J. In a big democracy like our's  the  popularly

conclusions to which I arrive.	I might also mention that  I
fully agree with the judgment proposed by my Lord the  Chief
Justice	 giving	 complete reasons for the  order  which	 the
Court  had unanimously passed on April 29, 1977,  dismissing
the  suits  as	also the writ petitions	 and  rejecting	 the
injunctions  sought for and other interim orders.  I  would,
however,  like to give my own reasons high-lighting some  of
the important aspects that arise in the case.
By  virtue of the President's order dated the  18th  January
1977  published in the Gazette of India-Extraordinary,	Part
1-<a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_643">section  1-by</a> a notification dated the 19th  January	1977
the  President in exercise of the powers conferred upon	 him
by  sub-clause	(b)  of	 clause	 (2)  of  <a href="/doc/284788/" id="a_644">Art.	85</a>  of	 the
Constitution dissolved the Lok Sabha.  Thus notification was
soon  followed	by  another  notification  dated  the	10th
February  1977	issued by the Ministry of Law,	Justice	 and
Company	  Affairs   calling  upon  all	 the   parliamentary
constituencies to elect members in accordance with<a href="/doc/70448367/" id="a_645"> S.  14(2)</a>
of  the	 Representation	 of  the,  <a href="/doc/55081742/" id="a_646">People  Act</a>,	 1951.	  In
pursuance  of this Notification the Election  Commission  on
the  same day appointed the dates when elections were to  be
held in various constituencies.	 This order was passed under
s.  30	of  the	 <a href="/doc/320017/" id="a_647">Representation of  the	 People	 Act</a>,  1951.
Further	 details  are  not  necessary  for  the	 purpose  of
deciding  the  issues arising in this case.  Suffice  it  to
mention that in consequence of the elections which were held
in  March  1977,  the Congress Party was  almost  routed  in
Bihar,	U.P.,  Himachal Pradesh,  Haryana,  Madhya  Pradesh,
Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan and West Bengal, and	particularly
in  some of the States not a single candidate set up by	 the
Congress  Party	 was returned.	The Congress also  lost	 its
majority  in  the  Lok	Sabha as  a  result  of.  which	 the
Government  at the centre was formed by the Janata Party  in
coalition  with	 the Congress for  Democracy.	Mr.  Morarji
Desai  the present Prime Minister was sworn in	after  being
elected	 as  the  party	 leader on March  24,  1977  and  he
selected  his Council of Ministers on March 25, 1977.	Soon
thereafter the Union Home Minister addressed a letter to the
aforesaid   nine  states,  namely,  Bihar,  U.P.,   Himachal
Pradesh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Punjab,  Rajasthan
and  West  Bengal, asking them to  advise  their  respective
Governors  to  dissolve	 the Assemblies	 and  seek  a  fresh
mandate from the people.
</p><p id="p_248">The six plaintiffs, namely, the States of Rajasthan,  Madhya
Pradesh,  Punjab,  Bihar, Himachal Pradesh and	Orissa	have
filed suits in this Court praying for a declaration that the
matter	of the Home Minister was illegal and ultra vires  of
the  Constitution  and	not binding on	the  plaintiffs	 and
prayed	for  an interim injunction restraining	the  Central
Government  from resorting to <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_648">Art. 356</a> of the  Constitution.
A permanent injunction was also sought for by the plaintiffs
in order to restrain the Central Government permanently from
taking	any  steps to dissolve the  Assemblies	until  their
normal	period of six years was over.  The writ	 petitioners
who  are some members of the Legislative Assembly of  Punjab
have  filed writ petition complaining of violation of  their
fundamental   rights  and  have	 also  prayed  for   similar
injunctions.   The prayer of the plaintiffs as also that  of
the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_86">		     99</span>
petitioners   has   been   seriously   contested   by	 the
defendant/respondent  Union  of India on  whose	 behalf	 the
Additional  Solicitor-General  raised  several	 preliminary
objections and also contested the claim on merits.
Having discussed the nature of the claim by the	 plaintiffs,
if may now be germane to examine the preliminary  objections
taken  by the defendant to the maintainability of the  suits
by  the	 plaintiffs  as also of the  petitions.	  The  first
preliminary  objection	raised by the  Additional  Solicitor
General was that the suits were not maintainable under	<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_649">Art.
131</a>  of	 the Constitution because one of the  essential	 re-
quirements  of	<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_650">Art. 131</a> was that there must  be  a  dispute
between the Government of India and one or more States,	 and
the present dispute is, on the very face of the	 allegations
made by the plaintiffs, not between the Government of  India
and one or more States, but it is between the Government  of
India  and the States Governments which is not	contemplated
by  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_651">Art. 131</a> of the Constitution.  Mr. Niren  De,  appearing
for  some  of the plaintiffs, however,	submitted  that	 the
language of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_652">Art. 131</a> is wide enough to include not only	 the
States	but  also  the State  Governments  which  alone	 can
represent  the states and context any legal right on  behalf
of the States.
</p><p id="p_249">It  was next contended by the  Additional  Solicitor-General
that  even if the first condition of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_653">Art. 131</a> is  satisfied,
there  was  no dispute, as contemplated by  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_654">Art.  131.</a>	 Mr.
Niren  De  rebutted  this argument by  contending  that	 the
letter of the Home Minister disclosing the grounds on  which
the   Central  Government  proposed  to	 take	action	 (or
dissolution of the Assemblies was a sufficient dispute which
entitled  the plaintiffs to approach this Court	 under	Art.
</p><p id="p_250">131.
Lastly, it was submitted by the Additional Solicitor-General
that while the plaintiffs have prayed for the relief of both
temporary  and permanent injunctions, this Court, hearing  a
suit  under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_655">Art. 131</a> of the Constitution, cannot  grant	 the
relief	for injunction and the only relief which this  Court
can  give would be purely of a declaratory character.	This
point,	however,  was later on given up	 by  the  Additional
Solicitor-General,  and in our opinion rightly,	 because  s.
204 of the Government of India Act, 1935, which preceded the
Constitution contained an express provision, viz. sub-s. (2)
which  expressly barred the right of the Court to grant	 any
relief	excepting a declaratory one, whereas in <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_656">Art. 131</a>  of
the   Constitution   that   particular	 clause	  has	been
deliberately omitted and the restriction imposed under	that
clause by the Government of India Act has been removed, as a
result	of  which this Court can grant any relief  which  it
thinks suitable and which is justified by the necessities of
a particular case.
</p><p id="p_251">In  order  to examine the validity of  the  contentions	 put
forward	 by counsel for the parties, it may be necessary  to
extract the provisions of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_657">Art. 131</a> of the Constitution,	 the
relevant part of which runs thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_36">	      "131.  Original  jurisdiction of	the  Supreme

</blockquote><p id="p_252">An  analysis of this provision would indicate that before  a
suit can be entertained by this Court under this  provision,
the following conditions must be satisfied :

case, it may be necessary to run through the contents of the
letter	of the Home Minister as	 also the Press	 interviews
given by him and by the, Law Minister which according to the
plaintiffs  form  an  integral	part  of  the  communication
received by them from the Home Minister.  My Lord the  Chief
Justice	 has  extracted in extenso the press  statements  as
also the contents of the letter of the Home Minister written
to  the	 various Chief Ministers of the States and  I  would
like, however, to indicate the main points contained therein
for the purpose of deciding whether or	not  a real  dispute
arose in the case.

thus

Relevant  portions of the extracts from the interview  given
by  Mr. Shanti Bhushan in a spotlight programme of  the	 All
India  Radio-may  also be quoted from Annexure	'B'  of	 the
Paper Book in Original Suit No. 1 of 1977 filed by the State
of Rajasthan which run thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_46">	      "In  an interview in the spot-light  programme

	      should function with the broad consent of	 the
	      people and only solong as it enjoyed  their
	      confidence.  If State Governmentschose   to
	      govern  the  people  after  having  lost	 the

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_47">			       (Emphasis supplied)
	      Constitution was democracy which meant that  a
	      Government  should  function  with  the  broad
	      consent  of the people and only so long as  it
	      enjoyed the confidence of the people.
	      Mr.  Shanti  Bhushan said that the  mere	fact
	      that at one time the Government in the  States
	      enjoyed  the confidence of the people did	 not
	      give  them  the right to	govern	unless	they
	      continued	 to  enjoy that	 confidence.   If  a

	      continued	 confidence of the people, then	 the
	      provision	 for  premature dissolution  of	 the
	      Assembly immediately came into operation.
	      The  provision not merely gives the power	 but
	      it casts a duty because this power is  coupled
	      with  duty,  namely,  the	 Assembly  must	  be
	      dissolved immediately and the Government	must
	      go  to  the people to see whether it  has	 the
	      continued confidence of the people to govern."
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_89">102</span>
<p id="p_257">Thus analysing the stands taken by the Home Minister and the
Law  Minister,	the following grounds appear  to  have	been
relied	on by them for the purpose of maintaining  that	 the
Assemblies  should  be	dissolved and  the  Chief  Ministers
themselves should advise the Governors accordingly
	      (1)   that    an	  unprecedented	   political
	      situation had arisen by the virtual rejection,
	      in  the  recent Lok Sabha	 elections,  of	 the
	      Congress	candidates in the States  concerned,
	      namely   the  plaintiffs	in  the	 six   suits
	      including	 Uttar	Pradesh,  Haryana  and	West
	      Bengal);
</p><p id="p_258">	      (2)   that   the	people	at  large  did	 not
	      consider	 it  expedient	for   the   Congress
	      Governments  to  continue	 without  seeking  a
	      fresh  mandate,  when the Congress  party	 was
	      completely  routed in the Lok Sabha  elections
	      from the States concerned;
</p><p id="p_259">	      (3)   that  the  constitutional  experts	have
	      also advised the Home Minister that the  State
	      Governments   have  impliedly  forfeited	 the
	      confidence of the people;
</p><p id="p_260">	      (4)   that  there is a climate of	 uncertainty
	      which  has  created a sense of  diffidence  at
	      different levels of administration;
</p><p id="p_261">	      (5)   that  such a climate of uncertainty	 has
	      given  rise  to  serious threats	to  law	 and
	      order;
</p><p id="p_262">	      (6)   that the most important basic feature of
	      the Constitution being democracy, a Government
	      had to function with the broad consent of	 the
	      people  so long as it enjoyed its	 confidence.
	      If the State Government lost the confidence of
	      the people, then it would be undemocratic	 for
	      them to continue;
</p><p id="p_263">	      (7)   that  if a situation arises in  which  a
	      serious  doubt  was cast upon  the  Government
	      enjoying	the  continued	confidence  of	 the
	      people,  then  the  provision  for   premature
	      dissolution  of the Assembly would at once  be
	      attracted.  Where such a situation arises, the
	      power contained in the Constitution is coupled
	      with  a  duty  to dissolve  the  Assembly	 and
	      direct  the Government to go to the people  in
	      order  to	 see whether it	 has  the  continued
	      confidence of the people to govern them.
</p><p id="p_264">The  correctness  of  the extracts  quoted  above  from	 the
documents  filed by the plaintiffs has not been disputed  by
the  Additional	 Solicitor-General.  Mr. Niren	De  contends
that in view of the stand taken by the Law Minister and	 the
Home  Minister	there  arose a	clear  dispute	between	 the
Government of India and the State Governments so as to	call
for  an	 adjudication  by this Court.  In  my  opinion,	 the
crucial question to be considered is whether or not there is
a   dispute.   Statements  by  Ministers  or  even  by	 the
Government or made by one party and denied by the other	 may
not amount to a dispute, unless
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_90">103</span>
such a dispute is based on a legal right.  A "dispute?'	 has
been  defined  in  the	Webster's  Third  New  International
Dictionary as follows
	      "verbal  controversy  :  strife  by   opposing
	      argument	or expression of opposing  views  or
	      claims :	controversial discussion."
</p><p id="p_265">A dispute, therefore, clearly postulates that there must  be
opposing  claims which are sought to be put forward  by	 one
party  and  resisted by the others.  One  of  the  essential
ingredients  of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_658">Art. 131</a> is that the dispute must involve  a
legal  right based on law or fact.  The question  which	 one
would  ask is what is the legal right which is	involved  in
the  'statements  given	 by the Home  Minister	or  the	 Law
Minister or the letter addressed by the Home Minister to the
Chief  Ministers  The governmental authorities	have  merely
expounded  the	consequences of the  interpretation  of	 the
constitutional provisions relating to the dissolution of the
Assemblies.  There can be no doubt that under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_659">Art. 356</a> it is
the  Central Government alone which, through its Council  of
Ministers, can advise the President to issue a	proclamation
dissolving  the	 Assemblies.  The word	"otherwise"  clearly
includes  a contingency where the President acts not on	 the
report of the Governor but through other modes, one of which
may  be	 the advice tendered by the  Council  of  Ministers.
Under  <a href="/doc/127060/" id="a_660">Art. 74</a> as amended by the Constitution  (Forty-second
Amendment)  Act,  1976, the relevant part of  which  may  be
extracted below :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_48">	      "There  shall be a Council of  Ministers	with
	      the  Prime  Minister at the head	to  aid	 and
	      advise   the  President  who  shall,  in	 the
	      exercise	of his functions, act in  accordance
	      with such advice."
</blockquote><p id="p_266">the Council of Ministers has to aid and advise the President
and  once  the	advice is given, the President	has  got  to
accept	it, there being no discretion left in him.  Thus  if
the  Central Government chooses to advise the  President  to
issue  a proclamation dissolving an Assembly, the  President
has  got  no  option but to issue  the	proclamation.	This
manifestly  shows  that the Central Government has  a  legal
right to approach the President to issue a Proclamation	 for
dissolution of an Assembly as a part of the essential duties
which the Council of Ministers have to perform while  aiding
and advising the President.  The State Governments, however,
do not possess any such right at all.  There is no provision
in the Constitution which enjoins that the State  Government
should be consulted or their concurrence,should be  obtained
before	the Council of Ministers submit their advice to	 the
President regarding a matter pertaining to the State so	 far
as the dissolution of an Assembly is concerned.	 <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_661">Article 356</a>
also  which  confers  a power on the President	to  issue  a
Proclamation  dissolving all Assembly does not	contain	 any
provision   which  requires  either  prior   or	  subsequent
consultation  or concurrence of the State Government  before
the President exercises this power.  In these circumstances,
can  it be said that the State Governments have a  right  to
assert	that an order under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_662">Art. 356</a> shall not be passed  by
the President or to file
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_91">104</span>
a  suit	 for a	declaration  that  the	President  may	be
injuncted  from	 passing such an order ? The  right  of	 the
State Governments to exist depends on the provisions of	 the
Constitution which is subject to <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_663">Art. 356.</a>  If the President
decides to accept the advice of the Council of Ministers  of
the Central Government and issues a proclamation  dissolving
the  Assemblies,  the  State Governments have  no  right  to
object to the constitutional mandate contained in <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_664">Art.	356.</a>
It is conceded by Mr. Niren De that if the President, on the
advice	of  the Council of Ministers, would  have  passed  a
notification dissolving the State Assemblies under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_665">Art. 356</a>,
the  plaintiffs were completely out of court and  the  suits
would not have been maintainable.  It is not  understandable
how  the  position would be any different or worse,  if	 the
Central	  Government   chose  to  be  fair  to	 the   State Governments
concerned by informing them of the grounds  on
the basis of Which they were asked to advise their Governors
to dissolve the Assemblies.  The mere fact that such letters
were  sent  to the State  Government  containing  gratuitous
advice	would not create any dispute, if one did  not  exist
before, nor would such a course of conduct clothe the  State
Government  with a legal right to call for  a  determination
under  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_666">Art.  131.</a>  If the State Governments do	not  possess
such  a	 legal right, or for that matter any right  at	all,
then they cannot put forward any claim before a Court for  a
declaration or injunction.  Mr. Niren De, however, submitted
that  the very fact that the Home Minister was compelled  to
address a communication to the Chief Ministers of the  State
Governments  for  advising  the Governors  to  dissolve	 the
respective  Assemblies	and the Chief Ministers	 refused  to
accept the advice of the Home Minister shows that a  dispute
arose.	 In  my opinion, however, the  contention  does	 not
appear	 to  be	 well  founded.	  Assuming  that  the	Home
Minister's letter to the Chief Ministers raised some sort of
a  dispute,  the moment the Chief  Ministers  answered	that
letter	and spurned the advice given by the  Home  Minister,
the  dispute  came to an end and ceased	 to  exist.   Unless
there is on existing dispute involving a legal right between
the  parties,  the  forum provided by  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_667">Art.  131</a>  cannot  be
availed	 of  by any party.  I am fortified in my view  by  a
decision of the Federal Court in The United Provinces v. The
Governor-General in Council,(1) where Gwyer, C.J.,  speaking
for the Court observed thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_49">	      "The  Federal  Court has by<a href="/doc/605848/" id="a_668"> s. 204(1)</a>  of	 the
	      Constitution   Act   an	exclusive   original
	      jurisdiction   in	 any  dispute  between	 the
	      Governor-General	 in   Council	(or,   after
	      federation, the Federation) and any  Province,
	      if  and in so far as the dispute involves	 any
	      question, whether of law or fact, on which the
	      existence or extent of a legal right  depends.
	      It  is  admitted that the legal right  of	 the
	      Province	 to   have  the	 fines	 now   under
	      discussion credited to Provincial revenues and
	      not  to the Cantonment Funds depends upon	 the
	      validity or otherwise of<a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_669"> s. 106</a> of the Act  of
	      1924.  The plaintiffs deny the validity of the
	      section,	the  defendant asserts	it;  and  it
	      seems  to	 me that this is clearly  a  dispute
	      involving a question on which the existence of
	      a legal right depends."
</blockquote><p id="p_267">(1)  [1939] F.C.R. 124,136.
</p><p id="p_268">10 5
This  case  effords a clear illustration of a  real  dispute
involving a legal; right.  In that case the main dispute was
regarding  the	question  whether  the	fines  credited	  to
Provincial revenues and not to the Cantonment Funds belonged
to  the	 Province  or the  Central  Government	through	 the
Cantonment.   It  will	be noticed that	 the  Federal  Court
clearly	 held  that such a dispute clearly fell	 within	 the
purview	 of S. 204(1) of the Government of India  Act  which
was  in pari materia to <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_670">Art. 131</a> of the Constitution.	That
case is purely illustrative and decides that it is only such
type of disputes as are contemplated by <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_671">Art. 131.</a>  For these
reasons,  therefore,  I am clearly of the view	that  having
regard	to the facts and circumstances of the present  case,
it  has	 not  been established that there  was	any  dispute
involving a legal right between the Government of India	 and
the  State Governments, and therefore one of  the  essential
ingredients of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_672">Art. 131</a> not having been fulfilled the  suits
are not maintainable on this ground alone.
The  next  preliminary	objection taken	 by  the  Additional
Solicitor  General was that there is no dispute between	 the
Government  of	India and the States because what  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_673">Art.	 131</a>
postulates   is	 that  the  dispute  must  be  between	 the
Government  of	India and the States as	 understood  in	 the
proper	sense, namely, the territories comprising the  State
or  the	 permanent institutions comprised in it,  e.g.,	 the
Governor,  the	Legislature,  the  High	 Court,	 the  Public
Service Commission and the like.  In other words, where	 the
Central	  Government   wants  to  oblish   the	 Legislature
completely or to abolish the institution of the Governor  or
the High Court, this will be a matter which will concern the
State  and the State Government as such.  I am	inclined  to
agree  with  the contention put forward	 by  the  Additional
Solicitor-General.   What <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_674">Art. 131</a> takes within its fold  is
not  the State Government comprising of a particular set  of
Ministers, but the Government itself, which exists for ever,
even though the personnel running the Government may change,
from  time  to time.  <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_675">Article 12</a> of  the  Constitution,	 the
scope of which is restricted only to the fundamental rights,
does  provide that the "State" includes the  Government	 and
Parliament  of India and the Government and the	 Legislature
of each of the States.	Here the term "State" has been given
a very broad spectrum because the definition is dealing with
the  exposition	 of  fundamental  rights  and  its   various
incidents  which  have	to be interpreted  in  the  broadest
possible  sense	 so  as	 to protect  the  citizen  from	 any
institution included in the term "State" which even includes
not only the Government of the State but also Government  of
India.	 <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_676">Article 12</a>, however, does not apply to	 Chapter  IV
where  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_677">Art.  131</a>  occurs  and which  deals  with  the  Union
Judiciary.   In fact the word "State" as mentioned  in	<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_678">Art.
131</a>  has  not  been defined anywhere  in  the  Constitution.
Under	<a href="/doc/579323/" id="a_679">Art.  367</a>  if  any  term  is  not  defined  in	 the
Constitution recourse can be had to the General Causes	Act,
1897, for the purpose of understanding the meaning of such a
term.	<a href="/doc/174566148/" id="a_680">Section	 3(58)</a> of the General  Clauses	Act  defines
"State" thus :
</p><p id="p_269">"State"-
</p><p id="p_270">.lm15
</p><p id="p_271">(a)as  respects any period before the commencement of  the
Constitution  (Seventh	Amendment) Act, 1956, shall  mean  a
Part A State, a Part B State or a Part C State; and
10 6
</p><p id="p_272">(b)as  respects any period after such commencement,  shall
mean  a	 State specified in the First Schedule to  the	Con-
stitution and shall include a Union territory :"
On the other hand<a href="/doc/174566148/" id="a_681"> S. 3(23)</a> defines the word "Government"  or
"the  Government" as including both the	 Central  Government
and  any State Government.  Thus it will be clear  from	 the
definition  of	"State'	 given in<a href="/doc/174566148/" id="a_682"> s. 3(58)</a>  of	the  General
Clauses	 Act  that the "State" does not	 include  the  State
Government.

</p><p id="p_285">A  perusal  of these Articles would  reveal  in	 unequivocal
terms  that  wherever  the Constitution has  used  the	word
"State"	 without any qualification it means "State"  in	 the
ordinary sense of its term, namely, the State along with its
territory or institutions.  <a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_683">Article 3</a> expressly empowers the
Parliament to increase or diminish the area or territory  of
any  State.  It has no reference to the State Government  at
all or for that matter to a particular State Government	 run
by  a particular party.	 In my opinion, therefore, the	word
"State"	 in  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_684">Art. 131</a> has also been used  in  this  ordinary
sense  so as to include only the territory of the State	 and
the  permanent	institutions contained therein.	  A  dispute
arising	 between the personnel running the  institutions  is
beyond the ambit of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_685">Art. 131.</a>  Further more, it would appear
that  cls. (a) &amp; (b) of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_686">Art. 131</a> deliberately and  advisedly
use the word "Government of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_92">107</span>
India  and  one or more States".  If the  intention  was  to
bring  even,  a Stale Government as run by  the	 Council  of
Ministers  within  the purview of this provision,  then	 the
words "one or more State Governments" should have been	used
instead	 of using the word "State".  This is, therefore,  an
intrinsic circumstance which shows that the founding fathers
of  the	 Constitution intended that the	 dispute  should  be
contained only to the Government of India and the States  as
a  polity or a constituent unit of the republic	 instead  of
bringing  in  dispute  raised by the  Government  run  by  a
particular  Council of Ministers which does not	 pertain  to
the State as such.
</p><p id="p_286">Thus, summarising my conclusions on this point, the position
is  that  the  import &amp; purport of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_687">Art.	 131</a>  is  to  decide
disputes  between  one	State and  another  or	between	 the
Government  of India and one or more States.   The  founding
fathers	 of the Constitution have used the word	 "State"  in
<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_688">Art.   131</a>  both  deliberately	and  advisedly	so   as	  to
contemplate  the  State as a constituent unit of  the  Union
along  with its territory and permanent	 institutions.	 The
question  as to the personnel who run these institutions  is
wholly	unrelatable to the existence of a dispute between  a
State and the Government of India.  It is only when there is
a complete abolition of any of the permanent institutions of
a  State  that a real dispute may arise.  A  mere  temporary
dissolution of an Assembly under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_689">Art. 356</a> does not amount to
an  abolition  of  a  State  Assembly,	because	 after	such
dissolution   under  the  provisions  of  the	Constitution
elections  are bound to follow and a new  Legislature  would
evidently come into existence after the voters have  elected
the  candidates.  Unfortunately, there is no clear  decision
of  this  Court directly on this point, but on	a  true	 and
proper	construction  of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_690">Art. 131</a><a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_691">, 1</a> am of the view  that  a
dispute	 like  the present is totally outside the  scope  of
<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_692">Art. 131</a> of the Constitution.  For these reasons, therefore.
I  hold	 that  the State Governments  who  have	 raised	 the
dispute	 in  this case are not covered by the  word  "State"
appearing  in  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_693">Art.  131</a> and therefore	the  suits  are	 not
maintainable  on this ground also. 1, therefore,  record  my
respectful dissent from the view taken by my lord the  Chief
Justice and brother Judges on this particular point.
Similarly  in  the case of writ	 petitions,  the  Additional
Solicitor-General  raised a preliminary objection as to	 the
maintainability of the petitions.  It was contended that the
right  of  the	petitioners as members	of  the	 Legislative
Assembly of Punjab was not a fundamental right as  envisaged
by part III of the Constitution.  At the most, the right  to
receive	 allowances as members of the Assembly was merely  a
legal right consequent upon their election as members of the
Assembly.   It	was  not  a  right  which  flowed  from	 the
Constitution.  Thus argued the Additional  Solicitor-General
that there being no infraction of any fundamental right, the
petitioners cannot be allowed to take recourse to <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_694">Art. 32</a> of
the  Constitution of India.  This argument was sought to  be
repelled  by Mr. Garg, Counsel for the petitioners,  on	 the
ground	that in view of the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/660275/" id="a_695">H.  H.
Maharajadhiraja Madhav Rao Jiwaji Rao Scindia Bahadur &amp; Ors.
v. Union of India</a>(1) commonly known as "Privy Purses  Case"-
the  right  to	receive allowances by  the  petitioners	 was
undoubtedly a right to property and by the
(1) [1971] 3 S.C.R. 9.
</p><p id="p_287">8-722SCI/77
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_93">108</span>
threatened  dissolution of the Assembly there was  a  direct
threat	to  the	 fundamental right  to	property  which	 the
petitioners  had both under <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_696">Art. 19 (1 ) (f)</a> and <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_697">Art. 31</a>  of
the Constitution.  Very attractive though they are, we	are,
however,  unable to accept the arguments put forward by	 Mr.
Garg.  This Court in the Privy Purses Case was considering a
legal  right in quite a different context, namely, <a href="/doc/1955809/" id="a_698">Art.	 291</a>
of  the	 Constitution which has since been repealed  by	 the
Constitution  (Twenty-sixth Amendment) Act,  1971.   <a href="/doc/1955809/" id="a_699">Article
291</a> as it stood then may be extracted thus
"291.  Privy purse sums of Rulers:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_50">	      Where under any covenant or agreement  entered
	      into  by the Ruler of any Indian State  before
	      the  commencement	 of this  Constitution,	 the
	      payment  of  any sums, free of tax,  has	been
	      guaranteed or assured by the Government of the
	      Dominion	of India to any Ruler or such  State
	      as privy purse-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_51">	      (a)   such sums shall be charged on, and	paid
	      out of, the Consolidated Fund of India, and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_52">	      (b)   the	 sums so paid to any Ruler shall  be
	      exempt from all taxes on income."
</blockquote><p id="p_288">A perusal of this provision would clearly indicate that	 the
founding  fathers  of the Constitution sought  to  guarantee
certain	 legal rights conferred on the Rulers by making	 the
sums  paid  to	them a charge on the  Consolidated  Fund  of
India.	 The payments made to the Rulers were guaranteed  by
the Constitution itself and it was in view of this  peculiar
and special provision that this Court held that the right of
the  Rulers to receive payments free of tax was not  only  a
legal  right flowing from the Constitution but also a  right
to   property,	 because  a  charge  was  created   on	 the
Consolidated  Fund of India for the payments to be  received
by the Rulers.	In other words, the right to property  arose
directly  from the status occupied by the Rulers  under	 the
Constitutional	provision itself and it was  not  consequent
upon the Rulers obtaining a particular status as members  of
the Assembly or otherwise which may be consequential to	 the
acquisition  of	 their 'subsequent status.  In	the  instant
case,  the right of the petitioners is only a limited  right
inasmuch  as it subsists only so long as the  Assembly	runs
its usual course of six years.	The right may also cease  to
exist  if  the	Assembly is dissolved by  the  President  by
issuing	  a  proclamation  under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_700">Art.	356.</a>	The   right,
therefore, subsists only so long as these two  contingencies
do  not	 occur.	  Further more, the  Constitution  does	 not
guarantee  any	right or allowances to the  Members  of	 the
Assembly which are given to them by local Acts or Rules.  In
these  circumstances, therefore, the ratio decidendi of	 the
Privy  Purses Case cannot apply to the petitioners.   Hedge,
J.,  while  dealing  with  the nature  of  the	legal  right
possessed by the Rulers in the Privy Purses case observed as
follows
	      "As I am satisfied that the rights under Arts.
	      31  and 19(1)(f) have been contravened  it  is
	      not   necessary	to   examine   the   alleged
	      contravention of other rights.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_94">	      109</span>
<p id="p_289">	      I have earlier come to the conclusion that the
	      right to get the privy purse under <a href="/doc/1955809/" id="a_701">Art. 291</a> is
	      a legal right. from that it follows that it is
	      a right enforceable through the courts of law.
	      That right is undoubtedly a property.  A right
	      to  receive  cash	 grants	 annually  has	been
	      considered by this Court to be a	property-<a href="/doc/1963913/" id="a_702">see

</p><p id="p_291">It  is	obvious that the observations of this  Court  cannot
apply  to  the petitioners who cannot be said  to  have	 any
fundamental right contained in Part III of the Constitution.
For  these reasons, therefore, I am of the opinion that	 the
preliminary  objection raised by the  Additional  Solicitor-
General is well founded and must prevail.
</p><p id="p_292">Since we have heard the suits and the petitions on merits at
great length also, even if we assume that the writ petitions
are maintainable, we shall deal with the merits of both	 the
suits  and the writ petitions.	We now proceed to deal	with
the merits of the suits and the writ petitions, although  we
think that the suits of the plaintiffs as also the petitions
are  liable  to be rejected on	the  preliminary  objections
raised by the Additional Solicitor-General.
Coming	to  the merits, three contentions were	put  forward
before us by counsel for the plaintiffs and the	 petitioners
:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_53">	      (1)   that   the	letter	sent  by  the	Home
	      Minister to the Chief Ministers amounted to  a
	      directive	 by  the Central Government  to	 the
	      Chief  Ministers	to  advice  the	  respective
	      Governors	  for  dissolving   the	  Assemblies
	      resulting	 in interference in the federal	 set
	      up   of	the  States  contemplated   by	 the
	      Constitution;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_54">	      (2)   that  even	if the letter  of  the	Home
	      Minister	was  not  a  directive,	 it  clearly
	      amounted	to  a  threat to the  right  of	 the
	      present  Government to continue in office	 and
	      to be dissolved if the directions given to the
	      Chief Ministers were not carried out;
	      (3)   that the circumstances mentioned in	 the
	      letter  did not constitute  sufficient  reason
	      for  dissolution of the Assemblies under	<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_705">Art.
	      356</a>  and the action of the Central  Government
	      in  writing the letter to the Chief  Ministers
	      and giving interviews at the Press and the All
	      India  Radio  amounted  to  a  mala  fide	 and
	      colourable  action  which	 was  sufficient  to
	      vitiate  the  advice  which  the	Council	  of
	      Ministers	 might	give to	 the  President	 for
	      resorting to <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_706">Art. 356</a> of the Constitution.
</blockquote><p id="p_293">Lastly,	 Mr. Niren De as also Mr. Garg submitted  that	<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_707">Art.
356</a>  would have no application to the facts of	the  present
case.
</p><p id="p_294">We shall now deal separately with the contentions raised  by
counsel	 for the parties.  As, regards the first  contention
that the letter of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_95">110</span>
the  Home Minister to the Chief Ministers of the  plaintiff-
States	amounted  to  a	 directive  issued  by	the  Central
Government,  it was clarified by counsel for the  plaintiffs
that  the  Central  Government had no  authority  under	 any
provision  of  the Constitution to give a directive  to	 the
Chief Ministers in the matter concerning purely the  States.
In the first place, a careful perusal and an adroit analysis
of  the contents of the letter does not at all show that  it
amounts	 to a directive given by the Central  Government  to
the  Chief  Ministers.	 Although  the	Home  Minister	 has
expressed  his	views in the matter, but in  the  concluding
portion	 of  the  letter he has	 merely	 advised  the  Chief
Ministers   without   interfering   with   their    absolute
discretion.  The concluding portion of the letter  extracted
thus-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_55">	      I would, therefore earnestly command for	your
	      consideration   that  you	 may   advise	your
	      Governor	to  dissolve the State	Assembly  in
	      exercise	of powers under <a href="/doc/1782245/" id="a_708">Article	 174(2)	 (b)</a>
	      and seek a fresh mandate from the	 electorate.
	      This  alone would in our considered  view,  be
	      consistent with constitutional precedents	 and
	      democratic practices."
</blockquote><p id="p_295">Clearly shows that no compulsion was brought to bear on	 the
Chief Ministers by the Home Minister and he sought to  state
certain facts with great stress for the consideration of the
Chief  Ministers.   The words "earnestly  commend  for	your
consideration  that  you may advise" clearly show  that	 the
Home  Minister sought to give a friend advice to  the  Chief
Ministers  as  to  what	 they should  do  in  the  facts  an
circumstances  of  the situation.  The	words  "may  advise"
further	 indicate that the Home Minister did not  intend  to
give  any mandator)directions to the Chief Ministers in	 the
matter.	  In of the words, the aforesaid letter if  properly
construed  is  no  more than an act  of	 political  courtesy
containing a suggestion or an advice or a fervent appeal  to
the Chief Ministers lo consider the desirability of advising
the  Governors	to dissolve the Assemblies in  view  of	 the
facts and circumstances disclosed in the said document.	  It
is  in no measure binding on the Chief Ministers and  it  is
open  to  them	to refuse to act on  the  gratuitous  advice
tendered by the Home Minister which the Chief Ministers have
already done.  Reading the letter as a whole, as I do, I  am
unable	to  regard the letter as a directive issued  by	 the
Central Government and as contemplated by Arts. 256 and	 257
of  the Constitution of India.	In fact <a href="/doc/76145/" id="a_709">Art. 256</a> which	runs
thus
"Obligation of States and the Union ;
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_56">	      The executive power of every State shall be so
	      exercised	 as  to ensure compliance  with	 the
	      laws made by Parliament and any existing	laws
	      which  apply in that Stale, and the  executive
	      power of the Union shall extend to the  giving
	      of such directions to a State as may appear to
	      the  Government of India to be  necessary	 for
	      that purpose."
</blockquote><p id="p_296">clearly defines the limits within which the executive  power
of  Parliament may exist and the directions contemplated  by
<a href="/doc/76145/" id="a_710">Art. 256</a> can be given to the States only within the  limited
sphere	as  prescribed	by <a href="/doc/76145/" id="a_711">Art. 256</a>  i.e.,  in	relation  to
existing laws made by Parliament and those
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_96">111</span>
laws which apply in the States.	 <a href="/doc/117780/" id="a_712">Article 257</a> contains a note
of  warning  and caution to both the Union  and	 the  States
against	 functioning  in  such	a way so  as  to  impede  or
prejudice  exercise  of the executive power  of	 the  Union.
<a href="/doc/117780/" id="a_713">Article 257</a> contains a further restriction on the Government
of India in that the power has to be exercised only for	 the
purposes mentioned in Arts. 256 and 257.
</p><p id="p_297">With due respects of my Lord the Chief Justice, I am  unable
to subscribe to his view that the directive contained in the
letter	must be carried out, as I am clearly of the  opinion
that   the  letter  does  not  amount  to  a  directive	  as
contemplated  by Arts. 256 and 257 of the  Constitution	 and
cannot	be  binding on the Chief Ministers  as	it  pertains
purely to the States concerned, namely, giving of the advice
to  the	 Governors for dissolution of the  Assemblies.	 Our
Constitution  contains a well distributed system  of  checks
and balances on the various constituents, namely, the Union,
the   States,  the  Executive,	the  Legislature   and	 the
Judiciary.    An   analysis  of	 the   provisions   of	 the
Constitution  would show that a separate sphere for each  of
the  constituent units has been carved out and they have  to
function  within the limits of their sphere, or	 within	 the
limits	of the orbit, as my lord the Chief Justice  has	 put
it.   In order to ensure a smooth and  efficient,  pragmatic
and purposeful working of the Constitution, it is  necessary
that  the Union and the States should work n close  coopera-
tion  and  absolute  coordination  with	 each  other.	 Any
confrontation  may lead to a constitutional breakdown  which
may  be	 avoided in all circumstances.	 Under	<a href="/doc/114820/" id="a_714">Art.  174(2)</a>
clauses	 (a) and (b) the Governor has the power to  prorogue
the  House or to dissolve the Legislative Assembly.   It  is
obvious that this power has to be exercised by the  Governor
generally  on the advice of the Council of  Ministers.	 The
Chief  Minister, as the head of the Council of Ministers  in
the  State,  has  the undoubted	 discretion  to	 advise	 the
Governor to dissolve the Assembly if a particular  situation
demands	 such a step.  The Chief Minister is the best  judge
to  assess  the	 circumstances under which  such  an  advice
should	be  given to the Governor.  The	 Central  Government
cannot	interfere  with this executive power  of  the  State
Government  by giving directions under <a href="/doc/76145/" id="a_715">Art. 256</a> or <a href="/doc/117780/" id="a_716">Art.	 257</a>
of the Constitution, because the dissolution of the Assembly
by the Governor is purely a matter concerning the State	 and
does  not fall within the four comers of either <a href="/doc/76145/" id="a_717">Art. 256</a>  or
<a href="/doc/117780/" id="a_718">Art. 257</a> of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_298">It  was also contended that the direction contained  in	 the
letter	 of   the  Home	 Minister  amounts  to	 a   serious
interference  with  the federal set-up contemplated  by	 the
Constitution and is likely to bring the autonomy enjoyed  by
the  States  into jeopardy.  My Lord the Chief	Justice	 has
dealt  with the federal aspect of the Constitution in  great
length	and has pointed out that while our  Constitution  is
based  on a federal pattern it is, to quote Dr. Ambedkar  "a
tight mold of Federalism" so that it can move from a federal
to unitary plane, according as the situation requires.	 The
federal	  nature  of  our  Constitution	 has  been   clearly
explained  by  my Lord the Chief Justice and I	fully  agree
with  his  views  and have nothing useful to  add.   It	 is,
however,  not  necessary  for me to dilate  on	this  point,
because in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_97">112</span>
my view the letter of the Home Minister does not amount to a
directive at all and therefore the question of	interference
with the autonomous rights of the State Government does	 not
arise.	 As to what would have happened if a  directive	 was
given  by the Central Government in a matter like this is  a
purely	hypothetical  question which does not call  for	 any
answer in the facts and circumstances of the present case as
the same does not arise.  In this view of the matter it-  is
obvious	 that  the  plaintiffs cannot get  a  relief  for  a
declaration  that  the letter amounted to  a  directive	 and
being against the authority of law was ultra vires and hence
not binding on the plaintiffs.	In fact it seems to me	that
the  plaintiffs	 themselves  did not take the  letter  as  a
directive  at  all and had, therefore, written back  to	 the
Home Minister refusing to accept the advice given to them.
The  next question that arises for consideration is  whether
the  letter  of	 the Home Minister amounts to  a  threat  to
dissolve the Assembly.	Although there are no clear words in
the  letter  or in the interviews to show that any  kind  of
threat	or  force  was	used  against  the  Chief  Ministers
concerned,  but	 even assuming that the letter	contained  a
veiled	threat,	 I  fail  to see what  kind  of	 relief	 the
plaintiffs  could  get,	 even  if this	is  so.	  The  Chief
Ministers  of  the  States  had	 the  right  to	 advise	 the
Governors  to dissolve the Assemblies or not to do so.	Even
if there was a threat given by the Home Minister they  could
have  ignored  the threat because the right  to	 advise	 the
Governors  to dissolve the Assemblies belonged to the  Chief
Ministers  of the States themselves, and as indicated by  me
the  Central Government had no right to interfere with	this
discretion of the Chief Ministers.
</p><p id="p_299">Mr.  Garg appearing for the petitioners, however,  submitted
that  the  action of the Central Government  amounted  to  a
threat	of the fundamental right of the petitioners  and  be
was  entitled  to  ask for  an	injunction  restraining	 the
Central Government from resorting to <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_719">Art. 356.</a>	In the first
place,	I  have	 already held that the	petitioners  had  no
fundamental right at all so as to approach this Court  under
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_720">Art.  32</a>  of the Constitution.	Assuming that they  had	 the
right the threat was not so imminent and the prayer made  by
the  petitioners was premature as no action appears to	have
been  taken by the Central Government at the time  when	 the
petitions  were filed.	Finally, if the	 Central  Government
had  a	constitutional	power to  advise  the  President  to
dissolve the Assemblies under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_721">Art. 356</a>, the Courts could not
interfere  with	 the  exercise of that	power,	because	 the
fundamental right of the Petitioners itself existed so	long
as  the	 Assembly  was not dissolved.  <a href="/doc/1034417/" id="a_722">Article	172</a>  of	 the
Constitution  itself  provides that the	 Assembly  of  every
State  shall  continue	for  six  years,  unless   dissolved
earlier.  The petitioners therefore could not have a  better
right than what was conferred by <a href="/doc/1034417/" id="a_723">Art. 172.</a>  If the  Assembly
was  dissolved earlier than six years, i.e. before its	full
duration  expired, under the provisions of the	Constitution
itself	no complaint could be made by the  petitioners	that
there  had been an infringement of their fundamental  right.
It  was	 not a case where the petitioners  had	indefeasible
right to property which itself was threatened.	The right of
the petitioners, if any, was merely a temporary and inchoate
right.	For these reasons, therefore, even
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_98">113</span>
if the letter of the Home Minister be treated to be a veiled
threat,	 the  petitioners cannot get any  relief  from	this
Court.
</p><p id="p_300">Coming	to  the	 third	contention  that  the  circumstances
mentioned in the letter did not constitute sufficient reason
for  dissolution of the Assemblies under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_724">Art. 356</a>, the	same
was  repelled by the Additional Solicitor-General mainly  on
the ground that the Courts could not go into the sufficiency
or  adequacy  of  the materials on the basis  of  which	 the
Council	 of Ministers of the Central Government	 could	give
any  advice to the President.  It was also argued that	this
matter was not a justiciable issue.  In order to answer this
contention  we	have  to  consider  two	 different   facets.
Firstly,  whether or not the issue was	justiciable.   Apart
from Cl. (5) of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_725">Art. 356</a> which gives the order passed by the
President under this Article complete immunity from judicial
scrutiny  it  was pointed out by the  Additional  Solicitor-
General	 that  even before Cl. (5) which was  added  by	 the
Constitution (Forty second <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_726">Amendment) Act</a>, 1976 the law laid
down  by this Court, Privy Council and the High	 Courts	 was
the  same.  Reliance was placed on a decision of  the  Privy
Council	 in Bhagat Singh and others v. The  King-Emperor,(")
where  the Privy Council, dwelling on the  question  whether
the  existence	of  an	emergency  was	justiciable  or	 not
observed thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_57">	      " A state of emergency is something that	does
	      not   permit  of	any  exact  definition;	  It
	      connotes	a  state  of  matters  calling	 for
	      drastic action, which is to be judged as	such
	      by  some	one.  It is more than  obvious	that
	      that  some one must be the  Governor  General,
	      and  he  alone.  Any other view  would  render
	      utterly inept the whole provision.

	      declaring	  that	 once  the   Ordinance	 was
	      challenged  in  proceedings by way  of  habeas
	      corpus the crown ought to prove  affirmatively
	      before  a	 Court	that a	state  of  emergency
	      existed,	or  (b) by a finding of	 this  Board

	      the Ordinance with all that followed on it was
	      illegal.

	      would  be idle to allow an appellant to  argue
	      about it."

Naravan	 Das v. Province of Bihar</a>(2), where  describing	 the
nature and incidents of art Ordinance, the Court observed as
follows :

promulgation of an Ordinance.  The existence of such  neces-
sity  is not a justiciable matter which the Courts could  be
called upon to determine by applying an objective test.'-'
The same view was taken by this Court in M/s S. K. G.  Sugar
Ltd.  v.  state of Bihar and others(1) where it was observed
thus :
</p><p id="p_304">"It is however well-settled that the necessity of  immediate
action and of "Promulgating an Ordinance is a matter  purely
for the subjective satisfaction of the Governor.  He is	 the
sole  Judge  as	 to  the  existence  of	 the   circumstances
necessitating the making of an Ordinance.  His	satisfaction
is  not	 a justiciable matter.	It cannot be  questioned  on
ground of error of judgment or otherwise in court-<a href="/doc/36589/" id="a_728">see  State
of Punjab v. Sat Pal Dang</a> (1969) 1 S.C.R. 633."
The  Andhra Pradesh High Court has also expressed  the	same
view  in In re.	 A. S. Sreeramulu(2) where it  was  observed
thus :
</p><p id="p_305">"We have seen that there is a wide range of situations	when
the  President	may act under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_729">Article  356.</a>   The  important
thing to notice is that the Constitution does not  enumerate
the situations and there is no 'satisfactory criteria for  a
judicial determination' of what are relevant considerations.
The very absence of satisfactory criteria makes the question
one which is intrinsically political and beyond the reach of
the  Courts.   The  considerations which  are  relevant	 for
action	 under	<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_730">Article	 356</a>  and  the	weighing  of   those
considerations	appear	to be clearly matters  of  political
wisdom, not for judicial scrutiny."
</p><p id="p_306">I  find myself in complete agreement with  the	observations
made by the learned Judge.
</p><p id="p_307">The  same  view was taken by another Division Bench  of	 the
Andhra	Pradesh	 High Court in <a href="/doc/1298218/" id="a_731">S. R. K.	 Hanumantha  Rao  v.
State of Andhra Pradesh</a>. (3)
It is obvious that exercise of discretion under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_732">Art. 356</a>  by
the  President is purely a political matter and	 depends  on
the  advice  that  the President gets from  the	 Council  of
Ministers.   The Council of Ministers are the best judge  to
assess	 the  needs  of	 the  situation,   the	 surrounding
circumstances,	the feelings and aspirations of	 the  people
and the temper of the times.  If on an overall assessment of
these  factors the Council of Ministers in  their  political
wisdom	or  administrative  expediency decide  to  tender  a
particular advice to the President.  The Courts cannot enter
into   this  arena  which  is  completely  beyond   judicial
scrutiny.   Even  if the Chief Ministers did  not  think  it
advisable  to dissolve the Assemblies, their views  are	 not
binding

<p id="p_310">on  the Central Government which can form its  own  opinion.
The exercise of the power under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_733">Art. 356</a> by the President is
a  matter  which falls directly within the exercise  of	 the
powers of the Union and the Council of Ministers need not be
guided	by the views of the Chief Ministers in the  exercise
of this power.	In colegrove v. Green(1) Justice Frankfurter
very aptly observed thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_61">	      "We are of opinion that the petitioners ask of
	      this  Court what is beyond its  competence  to
	      grant.   This  is	 one  of  those	 demands  on
	      judicial	power which cannot be met by  verbal
	      fencing  about  "jurisdiction."  It  must	  be
	      resolved	by  considerations on the  basis  of
	      which  this  Court,  from time  to  time,	 has
	      refused to intervene in controversies.
	      It  is  hostile  to  a  democratic  system  to
	      involve  the judiciary in the politics of	 the
	      people.  And it is not less pernicious if such
	      judicial	 intervention  in   an	 essentially
	      political	  contest  be  dressed	up  in	 the
	      abstract phrases of the law."
</blockquote><p id="p_311">It  is manifestly clear that the Court does not possess	 the
resources  which are in the hands of the Government to	find
out  the political needs that they seek to subserve and	 the
feelings  or  the aspirations of the nation that  require  a
particular  action to be taken at a particular time.  It  is
difficult  for	the Court to embark on an inquiry  of  that
type.	Thus what the Constitution (Forty-second  Amendment)
Act,  1976 has done by adding clause (5) to <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_734">Art. 356</a>  is  to
give  statutory	 recognition  to the law laid  down  by	 the
Courts long before.
</p><p id="p_312">Mr.  Niren  De	submitted in reply to the  argument  of	 the
learned	 Additional Solicitor-General that in two cases	 the
Privy  Council	had  taken a contrary  view.   Reliance	 was
placed	on a decision of the, Privy Council in King  Emperor
v.  Benoari  Lal  Sarma	 (2) where  Viscount  Simon,  L.  C.
observed thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_62">	      "Their  Lordships entirely agree with  Rowland
	      J's  view	 that such circumstances  might,  if
	      necessary,    properly   be   considered	  in
	      determining  whether an emergency had  arisen;
	      but,  as that learned judge goes on  to  point
	      out,  and, as had already been  emphasized  in
	      the  High	 Court,	 the  question	whether	  an
	      emergency	 existed at the time when  an  ordi-
	      nance  is made and promulgated is a matter  of
	      which the Governor-General is the sole  judge.
	      This proposition was laid down by the Board in

</blockquote><p id="p_313">Although  the  first  part  of	the  observations  of  their
Lordships  supports  the argument of Mr. Niren	De  to	some
extent,	 the second part of the observations  clearly  shows
that their Lordships had fully endorsed the proposition laid
down by the Court in Bhagat Singh's case (supra).  In  these
circumstances, therefore, this authority does not appear  to
be of any assistance to Mr. Niren De.

<p id="p_315">Reliance  was  also  placed  on	 Padfield  v.  Minister	  of

	      have   influenced	 him-or,   conversely,	 has
	      failed,  or  must have failed,  to  take	into
	      account  considerations  which ought  to	have
	      influenced   him-the   court  has	  power	  to
	      interfere."
</blockquote><p id="p_316">These observations, however, do not support the argument  of
Mr.  Niren De at all.  Even if an issue is not	justiciable,
if the circumstances relied upon by the executive  authority
are  absolutely extraneous and irrelevant, the	Courts	have
the  undoubted power to scrutinise such an exercise  of	 the
executive  power.   Such a judicial scrutiny  is  one  which
comes  into  operation when the exercise  of  the  executive
power is colourable or mala fide and based on extraneous  or
irrelevant considerations.  I shall deal with this aspect of
the  matter a little later.  It is, however, 'sufficient  to
indicate here that an order passed under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_735">Art. 356</a> is  immune
from  judicial	scrutiny  and unless it is  shown  that	 the
President  has been guided by extraneous  considerations  it
cannot be examined by the Courts.
</p><p id="p_317">This brings us to the second facet of this argument, namely,
whether the facts stated in the letter of the Home  Minister
or  in the press or the radio interviews are  sufficient  to
enable	the Central Government to take a decision to  advise
the  President	to dissolve the State Assemblies.   We	have
already	 extracted the important portions of the  statements
made  in  the letter of the Home Minister and in  the  radio
interview of the Law Minister and the Press interview of the
Home  Minister.	 These assertions made by the  Ministers  of
the  Central  Government  have,	 however,  to  be  read	 and
understood  in	the light of  the  prevailing  circumstances
which  are established from the notifications issued by	 the
Government  of India from time to time which we	 shall	deal
with hereafter.
</p><p id="p_318">By  virtue  of Ministry of Home	 Affairs,  Notification	 No.
G.S.R.	353 (E) dated June 26, 1975 the President  of  India
issued	a  proclamation	 declaring that	 a  grave  emergency
exists	whereby	 the, security of India	 was  threatened  by
internal  disturbance.	 This notification was	followed  by
another Ministry of Home Affairs Notification No. G.S.R. 361
(E) dated June 27, 1975 issued by the President under clause

the grounds on which the order	had  been  made	 during	 the
period the declaration made in respect of such a person	 was
in force.  This was followed by the Maintenance of  Internal
Security  (Amendment) Act, 1976 passed on January  25,	1976
which added sub-s. (9) to<a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_743"> s. 16A</a> of the principal Act  which

or  confirmation  under sub-s. (3) etc. was made was  to  be

matters of State and it would be against the public interest
to disclose the same.  Thus the effect of this provision was
that  no Court could call for the materials on the basis  of
which  the order of detention was passed.  In  other  words,
any  detention	made  during  this  period  was	 put  beyond
judicial scrutiny.  While this state of affairs existed, the
President by order dated January 18, 1977 dissolved the	 Lok
Sabha under Art.- 85 of the Constitution as would appear the
Lok  Sabha Secretariat Notification dated January  19,	1977
published in the Government of India Gazette  Extraordinary,
Part  I,  <a href="/doc/1600037/" id="a_745">Section  1</a>,  dated January  19,  1977.   This	 was
followed  by  notification dated February 10,  1977  by	 the
Ministry  of Law.  Justice and Company Affairs passed  under
sub-s. (2) of<a href="/doc/872230/" id="a_746"> s. 14</a> of the Representation of the People Act,
1951  by which the President called upon  the  parliamentary
constituencies	to  elect  members in  accordance  with	 the
provisions of the said Act and of the rules and orders	made
thereunder.  In pursuance of this notification the  Election
Commission  of India issued a notification on the  same	 day
appointing  the	 dates of elections to be  held	 in  various
constituencies	which varied from 16th to 20th March,  1977.
According to this Notification there were 54  constituencies
in  Bihar,  10	constituencies in  Haryana,  4	in  Himachal
Pradesh, 40 in Madhya Pradesh, 25 in Rajasthan, 85 in  Uttar
Pradesh,  42 in West Bengal, 21 in Orissa and 13 in  Punjab.
All  these constituencies elected their representatives	 and
from the results of the Lok Sabha as published in the Indian
Express	 of  March 25, 1977 it would appear that out  of  85
constituencies	in  Uttar  Pradesh not	a  single  candidate
belonging to the Congress party was returned.  Similarly  in
Bihar out of 54 constituencies not a single candidate of the
Congress   party   was	elected.   Similarly   out   of	  13
constituencies	in Punjab and 10 constituencies	 in  Haryana
not  a single candidate of the Congress party was  returned.
The same position obtained in Himachal Pradesh where out  of
4  constituencies  not	a  Single  Congress  candidate	 was
elected.   In the States of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan,	West
Bengal and Orissa, the Congress party appears to have  fared
very  badly  also.  In Madhya Pradesh out of 40	 seats,	 the
Congress party could bag only one seat, whereas in Rajasthan
also the Congress met with a similar fate where it got	only
I  seat out of 25 seats.  In Orissa, also the  Congress	 got
only  4	 seats out of 21 and in West Bengal it	got  only  3
seats  out  of 42.  It would thus appear that  in  the	nine
states referred to above, the Congress party was practically
routed.	 It is also clear that the voters who voted for	 the
candidates standing for the Lok Sabha in the States
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_103">118</span>
were more or less the same who had voted the Congress  party
in the State Assemblies during the previous elections.
Thus, summarising the position in short, it is clear
	      (1)   that  a grave emergency was	 clamped  in
	      the whole country;
</p><p id="p_320">	      (2)   that civil liberties were withdrawn to a
	      great extent;
</p><p id="p_321">	      (3)   that important fundamental rights of the
	      people were suspended;
</p><p id="p_322">	      (4)   that strict censorship on the press	 was
	      placed; and
	      (5)   that  the judicial powers were  crippled
	      to a large extent.
</p><p id="p_323">In  the	 new elections the Congress party suffered  a  major
reverse in the nine states and the people displayed complete
lack  of confidence in the Congress party.   The  cumulative
effect	of the circumstances mentioned above may lead  to  a
reasonable  inference  that the people had given  a  massive
verdict not only against the Congress candidates who  fought
the elections to the Lok Sabha but also to the policies	 and
ideologies  followed by the Congress Governments as a  whole
whether	 at  the Centre or in the States during	 the  twenty
months	preceding the elections.  In these circumstances  it
cannot be said that the inference drawn by the Home Minister
that the State Governments may have forfeited the confidence
of  the people is not a reasonable one or had no nexus	with
the  action  proposed to be taken under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_747">Art.  356</a>  for	dis-
solution of the Assemblies.
</p><p id="p_324">It  was in the background of these admitted facts  that	 the
Central	 Government  formed  the  opinion  that	 the   State
Governments  should  seek a fresh mandate  from	 the  people
because they ceased to enjoy the confidence of the people of
the   States  concerned.   In  other  words.   the   Central
Government  thought that from the nature of  the  concerned,
results	 of  the elections a reasonable inference  could  be
drawn that the State Governments concerned had forfeited the
confidence  of	the  people.  It  was,	however,  vehemently
argued	by the plaintiffs and the petitioners that the	mere
fact  that the Congress party lost its majority in  the	 Lok
Sabha  was  not	 sufficient  to	 lead  to  the	irresistible
inference  that the Congress Governments in the States	also
forfeited  the confidence of the people in the States  where
they  were  in	overwhelming  majority so  as  to  call	 for
dissolution  of the Assemblies and fresh elections.  Mr.  H.
R.  Gokhale, appearing for the State of Punjab, argued	that
even  in the past it had often happened that the people	 had
voted candidates of one party for the Lok Sabha and  another
party for the States and a similar distinction seems to have
been made by the voters this time also.	 The instance  cited
by  Mr.	 Gokhale  was  of  1967	 elections.   This  solitary
circumstance  in  my opinion does not appear to be  of	much
avail, because having regard to the circumstances prevailing
before the last elections what inference should be drawn  is
a matter to be considered by the Central Government and	 not
by  the Courts.	 The Central Government, on a  complete	 and
overall	  assessment  of  the  election	 results   and	 the
circumstances  prevailing during the emergency	as  detailed
above, in that the funda-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_104">119</span>
<p id="p_325">mental rights of the people were suspended, the right of the
detenus	 to  move  the Courts was  almost  crippled,  strict
censorship  was	 placed	 on the press,	and  this  state  of
affairs having prevailed for about 20 months when  elections
were  held after which the people gave their  clear  verdict
against	 the Congress so far as the Lok Sabha election	were
concerned may have had some justification for coming to	 the
conclusion  that  the State Governments	 had  forfeited	 the
confidence of the people.  It is true that if the opinion of
the Central Government was based on extraneous or irrelevant
materials or it was guided by purely personal considerations
or  ulterior  motives,	the Court could have  held  such  an
action to be mala fide and struck it down.  <a href="/doc/925413/" id="a_748">In Dr.  Akshabar
Lal  &amp; Ors. v. Vice Chancellor, Banaras Hindu  University</a>(1)
this  Court  explained as to what was the  true	 nature	 and
character  of a mala fide action, and quoted  the  following
observations of Warrington, L. J., where it observed thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_64">	      "The appellants characterised the whole action
	      as lacking in bona fide.	The action can	only
	      be questioned if it is ultra vires, and  proof
	      of  alien	 or  irrelevant motive	is  only  an
	      example  of the ultra vires character  of	 the
	      action,  as observed by Warrington, L. J.,  in
	      the following passage :
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_65">	      "My  view then is that only case in which	 the
	      Court  can interfere with an act of  a  public
	      body which is, on the face of it, regular	 and
	      within its powers, is when it is proved to  be
	      in  fact ultra vires, and that the  references
	      in the judgments in the several cases cited in
	      argument	to bad faith, corruption, alien	 and
	      irrelevant  motives, collateral  and  indirect
	      objects,	and  so forth, are  merely  intended
	      when  properly understood as examples of	mat-
	      ters which if proved to exist might  establish
	      the  ultra  vires character of the  action  in
	      question." "
</blockquote><p id="p_326">I  find myself in complete agreement with  the	observations
made by Warrington, L. J., extracted above.
But  the  serious question to be considered here  is  as  to
whether	 the action of the Central Government in  trying  to
persuade  the  Chief Ministers to advise  the  Governors  to
dissolve  the  Assemblies  can be mid to  be  mala  fide  or
tainted	 by personal motives or	 extraneous  considerations.
It  was	 suggested that the present ruling party  wanted  to
have a President of its own choice and, therefore, it wanted
to dissolve all the Assemblies and order fresh elections  so
that  they  are able to get candidates of their	 own  choice
elected	 to  the various Assemblies.  In  the  first  place,
there is no reliable material to prove this fact or to	show
that  the Central Government was in any way swayed by  those
considerations.	  Secondly, if the Congress  Governments  in
the  States Concerned Were so sure of their position,  I  do
not  see any reason why they should not be able to face	 the
challenge  and	after taking fresh mandate from	 the  people
vindicate their stand.	Furthermore, we have to look at	 the
circumstances catalogued above in order to find out  whether
an  inference  drawn by the Central  Government	 from  those
circumstances  can  be said to be a  reasonable	 one.	Even
assuming
(1)  [1961] 3 S.C.R. 386.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_105">120</span>
<p id="p_327">that  from  the	 circumstances mentioned  above,  the  other
inference   that  the  electorate  might  choose   different
candidates  for	 the  States and the Lok  Sabha	 is  equally
possible  that	by itself does not make the  action  of	 the
Central	 Government  mala  fide	 or  ultra  vires.   If	 two
inferences  are reasonably possible, the very foundation  of
mala  fide  disappears.	 On the other  hand,  the  important
question  to ask oneself is, could under  the  circumstances
mentioned  above  and the manner in which  the	people	have
acted  and reacted to the emergency and the  post  emergency
era by returning a massive verdict against the Congress,  it
be  said  that the Central Government was guided  by  purely
irrelevant or inept considerations or external or extraneous
motives	  in  wanting  to  have	 fresh	elections   to	 the
Assemblies?   The  answer  must be in the  negative.   I  am
convinced  that having regard to the circumstances  detailed
above,	the  view  taken by the Home Minister  and  the	 Law
Minister   cannot  be  said  to	 be  either  extraneous	  or
irrelevant or mala fide.  The contention of the counsel	 for
the  plaintiffs	 and  the  petitioners	on  this  score	 is,
therefore, overruled.
</p><p id="p_328">There  is yet another facet of this problem.  Assuming	that
the  reasons and the grounds disclosed by the Home  Minister
in his letter are extraneous or irrelevant this is only	 the
first  stage of the matter.  The second stage-which  is	 the
most vital stage-is the one which comes into existence	when
the  Council of Ministers deliberate and finally  decide  to
advise	the  President.	 As to what further grounds  may  be
considered  by them at that time is anybody's guess.  It  is
quite  possible that the Council of Ministers may  base	 the
advice	on grounds other than those mentioned in the  letter
of the Home Minister.  <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_749">Article 74(2)</a> which runs thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_66">	      "(2) The question whether any, and if so	what
	      advice  was  tendered  by	 Ministers  to	 the
	      President	 shall not be inquired into  in	 any
	      court."
</blockquote><p id="p_329">completely  bars any inquiry by any Court into	the  matters
which  form  the subject-matter of the advice given  by	 the
Council	  of  Ministers	 to  the  President.   This   Court,
therefore,   cannot  probe  into  that	matter.	  In   these
circumstances,	the argument of counsel for  the  plaintiffs
and the petitioners cannot be accepted at this stage.  It is
true that while an order passed by the President under	<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_750">Art.
356</a> is put beyond judicial scrutiny by cl. (5) of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_751">Art.	356</a>,
but  this  does	 not  mean  that  the  Court  possesses	  no
jurisdiction  in the matter at all.  Even in respect of	 cl.
(5)  of	 <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_752">Art.  356</a>,  the Courts have  a	 limited  sphere  of
operation  in that on the reasons given by the President  in
his  order  if	the Courts find	 that  they  are  absolutely
extraneous and irrelevant and based on personal and  illegal
considerations	the Courts are not powerless to strike	down
the  order on the ground of mala fide if proved.   We  must,
however,  hasten  to add that this does not  mean  that	 the
Central Government has a free licence to pass any  arbitrary
or despotic order or to clothe it with a blanket power to do
any  thing it Ekes against the well established legal  norms
or  principles	of political ethics.  Such an  arbitrary  or
naked action in a suitable case may amount to a fraud on the
Constitution  and  destroy  the	 very  roots  of  the  power
exercised.    In  fact	the   Additional   Solicitor-General
candidly conceded that if the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_106">121</span>
action under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_753">Art. 356</a> is absolutely and demonstrably  absurd
or  perverse or self-evidently mala fide and there is  total
absence of any nexus whatsoever between the action taken and
the scope and object of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_754">Art. 356</a>, judicial intervention	 may
be  available in such a case.  For the reasons that  I	have
already	 given,	 this is, in my opinion,  not  the  position
here.  We, however, think that this is the least expected of
such a high and mature authority as the Council of Ministers
of the Central Government.  We might also like to stress the
fact  that as the reasons given by the Council of  Ministers
in  tendering  their  advice  to  the  President  cannot  be
inquired   into	 by  the  Courts,  we  expect  the   Central
Government in taking momentous decisions having far reaching
consequences  on the working of the.  Constitution,  to	 act
with  great care and circumspection and with some amount  of
objectivity  so	 as to consider the pros and  cons  and	 the
various shades and features of the problems before them in a
cool  and collected manner.  The guiding principles in	such
cases  should be the welfare of the people at large and	 the
intention  to strengthen and preserve the Constitution,	 and
we  do	hope  that  this matter	 will  receive	the  serious
attention of the Government.  The stamp of finality given by
Cl.  (5)  of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_755">Art. 356</a> of the Constitution does not  imply  a
free licence to the Central Government to give any advice to
the  President and get an order passed on reasons which	 are
wholly irrelevant or extraneous or which have absolutely  no
nexus  with  the passing of the Order.	To this	 extent	 the
judicial  review  remains.  In the  instant  case,  however,
considering  the circumstances indicated above, I feel	that
the  grounds  taken by the Home Minister have  got  a  clear
nexus with the issue in question, namely, the passing of  an
order  by the President under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_756">Art. 356</a> in order to  dissolve
the State Assemblies.  The argument of mala fide put forward
by  the	 plaintiffs  and  the  petitioners  is,	  therefore,
rejected.
</p><p id="p_330">I now come to the last contention raised by counsel for	 the
plaintiffs and the petitioners.	 Mr. Garg, appearing for the
petitioners vehemently	 contended   that   <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_757">Art.   356</a>	 has
absolutely no application to the facts of    the     present
case,  as  it does not give any power to  the  President  to
dissolve  the Assembly.	 In order to examine  this  argument
closely,  it may be, necessary to extract the relevant	part
of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_758">Art. 356</a> thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_67">	      "356.  (1)  If  the President  on	 receipt  of

	      where it is a proclamation revoking a previous
	      Proclamation,   cease   to  operate   at	 the

</blockquote><p id="p_331">The  first part of <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_759">Art. 356(1)</a> gives power to the  President
to  issue a proclamation if he is satisfied on a  report  of
the   Governor	of  the	 State	or  otherwise  to   make   a
proclamation.  In the instant case as there is no report  of
the Governor of any of the States, the President can   act
on  other methods which includes the advice given to him  by
the  Council  of  Ministers.   Another	condition  that-  is
necessary for the   application	 of  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_760">Art. 356</a>  is  that	 the
President must be satisfied that the	Government  of	 the
State cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions
of the Constitution.  Great stress was laid on this part  of
the ingredient of <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_761">Art. 356(1)</a> by counsel for the  plaintiffs
and the Petitioners who contended that there is not an	iota
of material to show that there was any apprehension that the
Government  of	the  State  could  not	be  carried  on	  in
accordance With the provisions of the Constitution or  there
was  any break-down of the Constitutional  machinery.	This
is,  however,  a  matter which	depends	 on  the  subjective
satisfaction  of  the President based on the advice  of	 the
Council	 of Ministers.	It is not for the Court to  make  an
objective assessment of this question as if it were  sitting
in appeal over the advice given by the Council of  Ministers
or the order passed by the President, Even so, there can  be
no  doubt that having regard to the circumstances  in  which
the Congress was completely routed in the nine States during
the  Lok  Sabha	 Elections, the	 possibility  of  the  State
Governments having lost the confidence of the people  cannot
be ruled out.  If so, to continue in office even after	this
would	be  purely  undemocratic  in  character.    As	 our
Constitution   is   wedded  to	a  democratic	pattern	  of
Government,  if a particular State Government ceases  to  be
democratic or acts in an undemocratic fashion, it cannot  be
said  that  the	 Government of the State is  carried  on  in
accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.  Such  a
course of action is opposed to the very tenor and spirit  of
the Constitution.  In these circumstances, therefore, on the
facts  and  materials  placed before  us,  the	second	part
mentioned  in  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_762">Art.  356</a> appears to have  been	prima  facie
satisfied  and the argument of the learned counsel  for	 the
plaintiffs  and	 the  petitioners  on  this  ground  is	 not
tenable.
</p><p id="p_332">It  was then contended by Mr. Garg that a perusal of  clause
(3)  of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_763">Art. 356</a> and the proviso thereof clearly shows	that
the  proclamation  can operate only for the  period  of	 two
months	and automatically expires at the expiration of	this
period.	 It is argued that if the Assembly is dissolved	 and
this  action  is  not  capable of  being  confirmed  by	 the
Parliament within two months, then it is incapable of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_108">123</span>
ratification   by   the	 Parliament,  and   therefore,	 the
reasonable  inference  should  be  that	 <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_764">Art.  356</a>   clearly
excludes  any power to do anything which cannot be  ratified
including dissolution of the Assemblies in the States.	 The
argument  is undoubtedly attractive and interesting, but  on
closer scrutiny it does not impress me.	 In the first place,
under  <a href="/doc/1330132/" id="a_765">Art. 356(1) (a)</a> the President is empowered to  assume
to himself all or any of the functions of the Government  of
the  State  and	 all  or any of	 the  powers  vested  in  or
exercisable  by	 the Governor.	The power  to  dissolve	 the
Assembly  is  contained in <a href="/doc/114820/" id="a_766">Art. 174(2)</a> of  the	Constitution
which  empowers	 the Governor to prorogue  or  dissolve	 the
Legislative  Assembly.	 This very power by  force  of	<a href="/doc/1330132/" id="a_767">Art.
356(1)	(a)</a>  is conferred on the President  implicitly,	 and
once  this  power is conferred by the  application  of	<a href="/doc/1330132/" id="a_768">Art.
356(1)	(a)</a> the President has the undoubted jurisdiction  to
dissolve the Legislative Assembly by assuming the same power
which the Governor has under <a href="/doc/114820/" id="a_769">Art. 174(2).</a>  A Division  Bench
of the Kerala High Court in <a href="/doc/585015/" id="a_770">K. K. Aboo v. Union of India and
others</a>,(1) while interpreting this particular aspect of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_771">Art.
356</a>  observed as follows :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_71">	      "<a href="/doc/526520/" id="a_772">Art.  356(1)  (b)</a>  empowers  the	  President,
	      whenever	he is satisfied of a  Constitutional
	      breakdown	  in   the   State,   to   issue   a
	      Proclamation  declaring inter alia, "that	 the
	      powers  of the Legislature of the State  shall
	      be  exercisable by or under the  authority  of
	      Parliament." That necessarily implies a  power
	      to dissolve the State Legislature.  No  resort
	      therefore need be had by the President to	 the
	      provisions of <a href="/doc/1330132/" id="a_773">Art. 356 (1) (a)</a> read with	<a href="/doc/1034417/" id="a_774">Art.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_72">	      (b) of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_776">Art. 356</a> itself".
</blockquote><p id="p_333">I full endorse the aforesaid observations which lay down the
correct law on the subject on this particular aspect of	 the
matter.
</p><p id="p_334">As  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_777">Art. 356</a> occurs in Part XVIII of the Constitution  which
relates to emergency provisions, it is obvious that when the
Assembly  is  dissolved	 no  Council  of  Ministers  is	  in
existence and, therefore there is no occasion for either the
Governor or the President to take the advise of the  Council
of   Ministers	of  the	 State.	  In  these   circumstances,
therefore, I am clearly of the opinion that <a href="/doc/1330132/" id="a_778">Art. 356(1)	 (a)</a>
confers the powers of the Governor under <a href="/doc/114820/" id="a_779">Art. 174(2)</a> on	 the
President in clear and categorical terms and I cannot  infer
exclusion  of  the  power  merely from	the  fact  that	 the
proclamation  is  to expire after two months.  Even  if	 the
order  dissolving  the Assembly cannot be  ratified  by	 the
Parliament  under  Cl.	(3)  of	 <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_780">Art.  356</a>  that  makes	  no
difference,  because Cl. (3) does not touch  actions  taken,
proceedings   completed,  consequences	ensued	and   orders
executed.   At	the  time  when	 Parliament  exercises	 the
control,  all these actions have already taken place and  it
is not possible to put the clock back or to reverse  actions
which have already been taken and completed, nor was such  a
contingency  contemplated  by the founding  fathers  of	 the
Constitution.	I  am,	therefore,  unable  to	accent	 the
argument of Mr. Garg on this point.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_109">124</span>
It  was	 further argued by Mr. Garg as also  by	 Mr.  Bhatia
appearing  for	the  State of  Himachal	 Pradesh  that	even
assuming that <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_781">Art. 356</a>() (a) confers the power given to	 the
Governor  by <a href="/doc/114820/" id="a_782">Art. 174(2)</a> it would be a proper  exercise	 of
the  discretion	 of the President to prorogue  the  Assembly
instead	 of  taking  the extreme course	 of  dissolving	 it.
This,  however,	 is purely a matter which  lies	 within	 the
domain	of  politics.	The  Court  cannot  substitute	 its
discretion for that of the President nor is it for the Court
to  play the role of an Advisor as to what the President  or
the  Council of Ministers should do in a  particular  event.
The  Central Government which advises the President  is	 the
best  Judge of facts to decide as to what course  should  be
adopted	 in  a particular case, namely, whether	 the  Legis-
lative	Assembly should be prorogued or should be  dissolved
and  it	 is open to the President to take any of  these	 two
actions	 and if he prefers one to the other, this matter  is
beyond judicial review.	 For these reasons, therefore, I  am
clearly	 of the opinion that <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_783">Art. 356</a> does not	contain	 any
express or implied limitations on the nature or functions of
the  Governor  which are to be exercised  by  the  President
under <a href="/doc/1330132/" id="a_784">Art. 356(1) (a)..</a>
</p><p id="p_337">I  generally  agree with my Lord the Chief  Justice  on	 the

for decision in this Case.
