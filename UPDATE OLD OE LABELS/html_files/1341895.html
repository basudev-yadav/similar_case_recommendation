<p id="p_1">JUDGMENT


 

</p><p id="p_2"> 1. Interpretation of certain provisions of <a href="/doc/983571/" id="a_1">Wealth-tax Act</a>, 1957 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) is involved in these set of references.
</p>
 

<p id="p_3"> The question which has been referred for the opinion of this Court is as under:
</p>
<p id="p_4">  "Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was legally correct in coming to the conclusion that the loan of Rs. 113,258/- obtained by the assessed on the security of the Life Insurance Policies is deductible in computing her net wealth u/s 2(m)(ii) of the <a href="/doc/983571/" id="a_2">Wealth-tax Act</a>, 1957?"
</p>
 

<p id="p_5"> 2. For the purpose of disposal of these matters, fact of the 
matter would be noticed from WTR 25 of 1980. 
</p> 
 

<p id="p_6"> The respondent is an assessed under the <a href="/doc/983571/" id="a_3">Wealth-tax Act</a>.  
Partap Chand, husband of the  assessed had obtained a loan against 
certain policies from LIC.  The assessed was trustee as well as 
beneficiary  of these policies. A sum of Rs. 1,13,258/ was obtained by 
way of loan  and assignment of the said policy.  A part of the loan was 
invested in purchase of shares and another part thereof was used for 
making advances to others.    She filed a return under the <a href="/doc/983571/" id="a_4">Wealth-tax Act</a> 
showing net wealth at Rs. 875384/ for the assessment year 1975-76 
which  included the value of certain shares including  those  which had 
been purchased  out of the aforesaid loan.  She claimed deduction for 
total liability of Rs. 138731/-  which included the aforesaid loan amount 
of Rs. 113,258/-.  The Wealth-tax officer assessed the liability of the 
assessed at  Rs. 138731/- .  The net wealth was thus determined at Rs. 
926620/-. The Commissioner of Wealth Tax was however, of the view 
that the order passed by the Wealth-tax Officer was erroneous and 
prejudicial to the interest  of the Revenue. He issued a show cause notice 
on 30.11.1977 calling upon her to explain why the liability relating to 
the aforesaid loan amount should not be deducted from the value of her 
assets.   The Commissioner was of the opinion that the said amount does 
not fall within the purview of the term net wealth as laid down in 
<a href="/doc/400000/" id="a_5">Section 2(m)(ii)</a> of the Act.  The contentions raised by the assessed in 
her show cause were rejected.   
</p> 

<p id="p_7"> Against the order of the Commissioner, the assessed 
preferred an appeal to the Tribunal.  The Tribunal  allowed  the said 
appeal by an order dated 25.6.1979 holding that the Commissioner of   
Wealth-tax was not justified in withdrawing the relief already granted by 
the Wealth-tax officer by holding that his order was erroneous in so far 
as it was prejudicial to the interests of the revenue. 
</p> 
 

<p id="p_8"> Upon an application filed by the CIT, the Tribunal 
referred the aforesaid question  to this Court for its opinion. 
</p> 

<p id="p_9"> 3.Mr Sanjiv Khanna, learned counsel appearing for 
Revenue would submit that undisputedly the LIC policies are exempted 
from  the purview of <a href="/doc/983571/" id="a_6">Wealth-tax Act</a>  under <a href="/doc/126638/" id="a_7">Section 5</a> of the said 
Act.  According to the learned counsel if  the benefit arising out of the 
policy could only be derived upon attaining maturity with the last 
payment made in relation thereto, the same would not attract the 
definition of 'net wealth' as contained in <a href="/doc/569859/" id="a_8">Section 2</a> of the Act.  
Learned counsel would submit that  the provisions of <a href="/doc/1923307/" id="a_9">Sections 3</a>, <a href="/doc/27734/" id="a_10">4</a>, and <a href="/doc/126638/" id="a_11">5</a> 
of the Wealth Tax Act must be read  harmoniously and so read, the 
amendment carried out in the definition to word  'chargeable'  from, 
'payable' would not attract the mischief rule. 
</p> 

<p id="p_10"> The words 'chargeable' and 'payable' according to Mr 
Khanna  are  synonymous.  In support of the said contention reliance has 
been placed by him on  <a href="/doc/656327/" id="a_12">CIT V. Vaidyanathan</a>  (1985) 153 ITR 11, 
Apoorva Shanti Lal v CWT  [1982) 135 ITR 182 and  CWT v. 
Premnarayan Garg (1982) 134 ITR 315.  Our attention was also drawn 
to the fact that this aspect of the matter had although been accepted by 
the Tribunal but it erred in  proceeding on the basis that insurance policy 
is not one of the excluded assets.  
</p> 

<p id="p_11"> Mr Anup Sharma, learned counsel appearing for the 
respondent, on the other hand, would submit that the minority view  in 
<a href="/doc/656327/" id="a_13">CIT V. Vaidyanathan</a> ( supra) has been approved by the Division Bench 
in <a href="/doc/1056020/" id="a_14">CIT V. Vasant</a>  186 ITR 91.  Learned counsel would contend that the 
expression  payable used in <a href="/doc/126638/" id="a_15">Section 5</a>  must be construed having regard 
to the fact that  the assets must at first be 'chargeable' to tax and then a 
question would arise as to whether the same is 'payable' or not.   
</p> 

<p id="p_12"> Mr Khanna in reply pointed out that Bombay High court 
has not determined the question involved in this case and only in relation 
to another  contention, the minority view of the Full Bench of madras 
High Court was followed.   
</p> 

<p id="p_13"> Interpretation clause contained in <a href="/doc/569859/" id="a_16">Section 2</a> of the Act 
begins with the words "unless the context otherwise requires".    
</p> 

<p id="p_14"> 4. Assets has been defined in <a href="/doc/1198680/" id="a_17">Section 2(e)</a> to mean : 
</p>   

<p id="p_15"> "assets" includes property of every description, 
moveable or immovable, but does not include- 
</p> 

<p id="p_16"> (1) in relation to the assessment year commencing on the 
1st day of  April, 1969, or any earlier assessment year- 
</p> 

<p id="p_17"> (i)agricultural  land and growing crops, grass or 
standing trees on such land; 
</p> 

<p id="p_18"> (ii)any building owned or occupied by a cultivator 
of, or receiver of rent or revenue out of 
agricultural land  
 

 Provided  that the building is on or in the immediate 
vicinity of the land and is building which the cultivator or the 
receiver of rent or revenue by reason of his connection with 
the land requires as a dwelling house or a store-house or an  
out-house."  
</p> 

<p id="p_19"> The said definition is of wide amplitude. 
</p> 

  
<p id="p_20"><a href="/doc/400000/" id="a_18">Section 2(m)</a> defines 'net wealth'  in the following 
terms: 
</p>   

<p id="p_21"> (m) "net wealth" means the amount by which the 
aggregate value computed in accordance with the 
provisions of this Act of all the assets, wherever located, 
belonging to the assessed on the valuation date, including 
assets required to be included in his net wealth as on that 
date under this Act, is in excess of the aggregate value of 
all the debts owed by the assessed on the valuation date 
other than- 
</p> 

<p id="p_22"> (i)debts which under <a href="/doc/1607100/" id="a_19">Section 6</a> are not to be taken 
into account; 
</p> 

<p id="p_23"> (ii)debts which are secured on or which have been 
incurred in relation to, any property in respect of 
which wealth -tax is not chargeable under this 
Act: and  
</p><p id="p_24">  (iii)xxxxxxxxx
 

 In this context, it may be noted that<a href="/doc/400000/" id="a_20"> S. 2(m)(ii)</a>, as it 
originally  stood prior to its amendment in 1964 by the Wealth-
tax ( <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_21">Amendment) Act</a>, 1964, reads thus : 
</p><p id="p_25">  "debts which are secured on, or which have been incurred 
in relation to any asset in respect of which wealth-tax is not 
payable under this Act." 
</p> 

<p id="p_26"> The only difference that has been made by the 
amendment is that the word "payable"   has been replaced by the 
word "chargeable" 
</p> 

<p id="p_27"> <a href="/doc/1923307/" id="a_22">Section 3</a> of the Act states that Wealth-tax shall be 
chargeable for every assessment year in respect of net wealth of the 
assessed on the corresponding valuation date.  <a href="/doc/1923307/" id="a_23">Section 3</a>  however, is 
subject to other provisions contained in the Act.  <a href="/doc/126638/" id="a_24">Section 5</a> of the Act 
states that wealth tax shall not be payable in respect of certain assets and 
such assets shall not be included in the net wealth of the assessed. 
The only question which thus falls for our consideration 
is applicability of the definition of net wealth as contained in <a href="/doc/569859/" id="a_25">Section 
2</a> of the Act in the fact of the present matter vis--vis  <a href="/doc/1923307/" id="a_26">Sections 
3</a>, <a href="/doc/27734/" id="a_27">4</a> and <a href="/doc/126638/" id="a_28">5</a> of thereof.  
</p> 

<p id="p_28"> It is now trite that the expression  occurring in the 
interpretation clause should ordinarily be given the same meaning unless 
the context otherwise requires.  In a recent decision, the Apex Court in 
the <a href="/doc/1902234/" id="a_29">Central Bank vs. Ravindra</a> and Ors,  
referred to the decision  in Farrell v. Alexander, (1976) 2 All. E.R. 721 
at 736 which is in the following terms:  
</p><p id="p_29">  "where  the draftsman uses the same word or 
phrase in similar contexts, he must be presumed to 
intend it in each place to bear the same meaning".  
</p> 

<p id="p_30"> The court having accepted invitation to embark 
upon interpretative expedition shall  identify on its 
radar the contextual use of the word or expression 
and then determine its direction avoiding collision 
with icebergs of in consistency and repugnancy.
</p> 
 

<p id="p_31"> 5. It is also trite that the legislator is presumed to know the 
law.  In Dadi  Jagannadham v. Jammalu Ramlu and Ors reported in 
2001 AIR SCW 3051 it has been held : 
</p><p id="p_32">  "13. We have considered the submissions made by the 
parties. The settled principles of interpretation are that 
the Court must proceed on the assumption that the 
legislature did not make a mistake and that it did what is 
intended to do. The Court must, as far as possible, adopt 
a construction which will carry out the obvious intention  
of the legislature. Undoubtedly if there is a defect or an 
omission in the words used by the legislature, the Court 
would not go to its aid to correct or make up the 
deficiency. The court could not add words to a statute or 
read words into it which are not there, especially when 
the literal reading produces  an intelligible result. The 
Court cannot aid the legislature's defective phrasing of 
an Act or add and mend, and by construction, make up 
deficiencies which are there" 
</p> 
 

<p id="p_33"> 6.It is further well settled in view of Gurudevdatta Vksss 
Maryadit v. State of Mahrashtra,  that the Court will 
construe the statute having regard to its literal meaning wherein it was 
held: 
</p><p id="p_34">  "26.Further we wish to clarify that it is a cardinal principle of 
interpretation of statute that the words of a statute must be 
understood in their natural, ordinary or popular sense and 
construed according to their  grammatical meaning, unless 
such construction leads to some absurdity or  unless there is 
something in the context or in the object of the statute to 
suggest to the contrary. The golden rule is that the words of a 
statute must prima facie be given their ordinary meaning. It is 
yet another rule of  construction  that when  the words of the 
statute are clear, plain and unambiguous, then the courts are 
bound to give effect to that meaning, irrespective of the 
consequences. It is said that the words themselves best  
declare  the intention of the law-giver. The courts have 
adhered to the  principle  that efforts should be made to give 
meaning to each and every word used by the legislature and it 
is not a sound principle of construction to brush aside words in 
a statute as being in apposite surpluses, if they can have a 
proper application in circumstances conceivable within the 
contemplation of the statute." 
</p> 

<p id="p_35"> 7.It is not in dispute that the Courts while interpreting the 
statute  must notice the law as it stood before the amendment   
 

</p><p id="p_36"> 8.In Principles of Statutory  interpretation by Shri G.P. 
Singh, 7th Edn at page 98, it  is stated as under: 
</p>  

<p id="p_37"> "When  the material words are capable of bearing two 
or more constructions the most firmly established rule for 
construction of such words  of all statutes in general ( be 
they penal or beneficial, restrictive  or enlarging of the 
common law)" is the rule laid down in Heydon's case 
(1584) 3 Co. Rep. 7a, p. 7B: 76 ER  637 which  has "now  
attained the status of a classic ( <a href="/doc/1057826/" id="a_30">Kanailal Sur v. 
Paramnidhi Sadhukhan</a> . The 
rule ;which  is also known as purposive construlction or 
mischief rule, enables consideration of four matters in 
construing an Act: i) What was the law before the making 
of the Act, ii) what was  the mischief or defect for which 
the law did not provide, iii) what is the remedy that the 
Act has provided and iv)  what is the reason of the 
remedy.  The rule then directs that the Courts must adopt 
that construction ,which  shall suppress the mischief and 
advance the remedy. The rule was explained in the 
Bengal Immunity Co .v State of Bihar   by S.R. Das, CJ, as follows: " It is a sound rule of 
construction of a statute firmly established in England as 
far back as 1584 when Heydon's case was decided that 
for the sure and true interpretation of all Statutes in 
general ( be they penal or beneficial, restrictive or 
enlarging of the common law) four things are to be 
discerned and considered : 
</p> 

<p id="p_38"> 1st - What was the common law before the making of the 
Act; 
</p> 

<p id="p_39"> 2nd - What was the mischief and defect for which the 
common law did not provide  
 

 3rd - What remedy the Parliament hath resolved and  
appointed to cure the disease of the commonwealth, and
 

 4th - The true reason of the remedy ; 
</p> 

<p id="p_40"> and then the office of all the judges is always to make 
such construction as shall suppress the mischief and 
advance the remedy and to suppress subtle  inventions 
and evasions for continuance of the mischief, and pro 
privato commodo, and to add force and life to the cure 
and remedy, according to the true intent of the makers of 
the Act, pro bono publico.  
</p> 
 

<p id="p_41"> 9.The question which must  be raised and answered is 
whether the assets chargeable and payable carry   different meaning or 
the same meaning.  In other words, are the said words interchangeable. 
Black's Law Dictionary ( Sixth Edn) defines these words as 
under: 
</p>   

<p id="p_42"> Chargeable :This word, in its ordinary acceptation, as 
applicable to the imposition of a duty or burden signifies 
capable of being charged, subject to be charged, liable to 
be charged or proper to be charged. 
</p> 

<p id="p_43"> Payable :  Capable of being paid; suitable to be paid, 
admitting or demanding payment, justly due, legally 
enforceable. A sum of money is said to be payable when  
a person is under an obligation to pay it. Payable may 
therefore signify an obligation to pay at a future time but 
when used without qualification, term normally means 
that the debt is payable at once, as opposed to owing."  
</p> 
 

<p id="p_44"> Both the words, therefore are not interchangeable.   
</p> 
 

<p id="p_45"> 10.The scheme of <a href="/doc/983571/" id="a_31">Wealth-tax Act</a>  in our opinion would 
suggest that the said words 'chargeable' and 'payable' carry different 
meaning. The statute  states that the tax shall not be payable in respect of 
certain assets and property or income.  The payability of tax may or may 
not depend on the chargeability of the tax.  In other words, the assets, 
property or income may be chargeable to tax but may not be payable 
having regard to extent of exemption provided for in the schedule  
appended to an Act.   It is axiomatic  that if the assets or property is not 
chargeable to tax, no tax would be payable but the converse may be true.  
In a situation of this nature therefore an attempt must be made to give 
effect to both the expression 'chargeable' and 'payable', having regard 
to the intention of the Parliament as  reflected in different provisions of 
the Act as mentioned hereinbefore. We may notice that even in the 
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_32">Income-tax Act</a>, the words  'chargeable' and 'payable' have been used 
in different provisions thereof. 
</p> 

<p id="p_46"> 11. <a href="/doc/1923307/" id="a_33">Section 3</a> is the charging provision. The same  does not 
exclude the applicability of the interpretation of "net wealth" as 
contained in <a href="/doc/400000/" id="a_34">Section 2(m)(i)(ii)</a> of the Act.  
</p> 

<p id="p_47"> 12.The schedule to the Act  provides that no wealth tax is 
payable in cases where the net wealth exceeds a particular figure. This 
only implies that the net wealth is chargeable to wealth tax in terms of 
<a href="/doc/1923307/" id="a_35">Section 3</a> of the Act but the same may not be payable having regard to 
the limit prescribed by reason of the schedule appended thereto. Having 
regard to the fact that in the definition of net wealth  both the expression 
'means' and 'includes,' are employed the same must be held to be 
exhaustive.  Reference in this connection may be made to  <a href="/doc/1390287/" id="a_36">CIT V. 
Venkateswara Hatcheries</a> (1999)  237 ITR 174. 
</p> 

<p id="p_48"> 13.It may be that chargeability to tax never operates on gross 
amount but nothing is payable as wealth-tax until by process of 
computation of it forms part of net wealth.  The decision rendered in 
<a href="/doc/1411881/" id="a_37">CIT v. Srinivasa Setty</a> 128 ITR 294,  <a href="/doc/1238217/" id="a_38">Bawa Shiv Charan Singh v. 
CIT</a>, 149 ITR 29,  <a href="/doc/1467661/" id="a_39">CIT V. Harprsasad &amp; Co</a>. 99 ITR 118 were 
referred to in different context.   The Court in these cases was dealing 
with the concept of loss.  
</p> 

<p id="p_49"> 14.No assets is chargeable to wealth tax.  The Apex Court  in  
<a href="/doc/1501950/" id="a_40">Sudhir Chandra Nawn v. Wealth-tax Officer, Calcutta and Ors</a> [1968]  
69 ITR 897  while considering the question as regards the constitutional 
validity of the <a href="/doc/983571/" id="a_41">Wealth Tax Act</a>  and also wealth tax held: 
</p>  

<p id="p_50"> "It  is a  tax  on the capital value of the assets of 
individuals and companies on the valuation date. The wealth-
tax is not imposed on the components of the assets of the  
assessed; it is imposed on the total assets which the assessed 
owns, and in determining the net wealth not only the 
encumbrances specifically  charged against any  item of asset, 
but the general liability of the assessed to pay his debts and to 
discharges his lawful obligations have to be taken into 
account. In certain exceptional cases, where a person owes no 
debts and is under no enforceable obligation to discharge any 
liability out of his assets, it may be possible to break up  the 
tax which is leviable on the total assets into components and 
attribute a  component to lands and buildings owned by an 
assessed.  In such a case, the  component out of the total  tax 
attributable to lands and buildings may in the matter of 
computation bear similarity to a tax on lands and buildings 
levied on the  capital or annual value under entry 49 of List II. 
But the legislative authority of Parliament is not determined 
by visualizing the possibility of exceptional cases of taxes 
under two different heads operating similarly on taxpayers."
</p> 

<p id="p_51"> 15.It may thus legitimately be inferred that  the expression   
 "property not chargeable to wealth-tax"  occurring in <a href="/doc/400000/" id="a_42">Section 2(m)(ii)</a> 
would manifest legislative intent that the property and asset may fall in 
<a href="/doc/1198680/" id="a_43">Section 2(e)</a> of the Act  but would only include net wealth  for the 
purpose of taxability.  The said act therefore must be read in the 
aforesaid context.  Computation of net wealth  would be based on charge 
of  wealth tax in terms of <a href="/doc/1923307/" id="a_44">Section 3</a> of the Act.   The definition of "net 
wealth" as contained in <a href="/doc/400000/" id="a_45">Section 2(m)(ii)</a> fits in the scheme  of charging 
provision, inasmuch as  the word  assets as defined in <a href="/doc/1198680/" id="a_46">Section 2(e)</a> of the 
Act covers the tax incurred by the assessed.  Thus, any property which 
does not fall within the definition of assets  under <a href="/doc/1198680/" id="a_47">Section 2(e)</a> would not 
be charged to wealth tax.    
</p> 

<p id="p_52"> 16.It  is true that a Full Bench of Madras High Court in  CIT 
V., Vaidyanathan 153 ITR 11 has held that by reason of such 
amendment no material change was effected. It was held thus : 
  "The rule of strict construction applies only to charging sections and 
not to machinery sections. Section 2(m) of the W.T. Act, 1957, is not 
a charging section and the rule of strict construction cannot be 
applied to it. The principle of "purposive construction" has to be 
applied. This is a construction which will promote the general 
legislative purpose underlying the provision. <a href="/doc/400000/" id="a_48">Section 2(m)(ii)</a> speaks 
of debts which  are secured on or which have been incurred in 
relation to any property in respect of which wealth-tax is not 
chargeable under the Act. In case where an asset is  only partially 
exempt from chargeability to wealth-tax, then it must be necessarily  
follow that the portion of the debt secured on such portion of the 
asset or  incurred in acquiring such portion of the asset has to be 
excluded from reckoning. This construction will be in harmony with 
the scheme and purpose of the W.T. Act" 
</p> 
 

<p id="p_53"> 17.With utmost respect we cannot subscribe to his said view. 
Rule of purposive construction may be taken recourse to when literal 
meaning attributed to a provision of statute leads to an absurdity. Such is 
not the cash here. It is, in our view  possible to give effect to the 
definition of 'net wealth' in implementing <a href="/doc/1923307/" id="a_49">Section 3</a> vis--vis  <a href="/doc/126638/" id="a_50">Section 5</a> 
of the Act 
The minority view expressed by Balsubramaniam, J.  
commends to us.  The view expressed runs thus: 
</p><p id="p_54">  "<a href="/doc/400000/" id="a_51">Section 2(m)(ii)</a> does not speak  of exempted assets. It only refers 
to property in respect of which wealth-tax is not chargeable. This 
phrase must be understood as meaning "property in respect of which 
wealth-tax is not at all chargeable". "Not at all" is not a gloss. It is 
very much a part of the meaning. If the secured properties fit in with 
the meaning of <a href="/doc/400000/" id="a_52">Section 2(m)(ii)</a>, the connected debts go out of the 
reckoning. But if the properties are not comprehended by <a href="/doc/400000/" id="a_53">Section 
2(m)(ii)</a>, the general rule of deductibility operates and this general 
rule knows no restrictions. In other words, depending  on its relation 
to the asset in question, a debt is either deductible or not deductible. 
<a href="/doc/400000/" id="a_54">Section 2(m)(ii)</a> does not contain any provision for partial abatement,  
or apportionment, of a debt under which part of it is deductible and 
part of it is not. On the words of <a href="/doc/400000/" id="a_55">Section 2(m)(ii)</a> , once an asset 
which secured the debt is treated as an asset on which wealth-tax is 
chargeable, even though a part of the value of the asset is exempt 
from tax, the whole of the secured debt must be deducted.": 
</p> 

<p id="p_55"> 18.The legislature does not make an amendment 
unnecessarily. The amendment   so carried out therefore must be given 
its full effect.  To the aforesaid extent the mischief rule  or 'Heyden's 
rules' must be applied  having regard to the different expressions 
'chargeable'  and 'payable' carry, particularly when the said expression 
are not interchangeable.  In this connection, we may refer to the decision 
of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/518414/" id="a_56">CIT v. Podar Cement Pvt. Ltd</a>. [1997] 226 ITR 
625, where their Lordships observed as under : 
</p>  

<p id="p_56"> "At  this juncture, we can also refer to the judgment cited by Mr. 
Syali regarding updating construction of the words used in the 
statute.  In State (through CBI/New Delhi v. SJ Choudhary, , this Court  has quoted the 
following passage with approval in support of updating construction  ( 
page 433 of [996] 2SCC): 
</p>        

<p id="p_57"> "Statutory Interpretation  by Francis Bennion, 2nd edn, <a href="/doc/983571/" id="a_57">Section 288</a> 
with the heading 'Presumption that updating construction to be given' 
states one of the rules thus (page 617) : 
</p> 

<p id="p_58">      (2) It is presumed that Parliament intends the court to apply to 
an ongoing Act a construction that continuously updates its working 
to allow for changes since the Act was initially framed ( an updating 
construction). While it remain s law, it is to be treated as always 
speaking. This means that in  its application on any date, the 
language of the Act, though necessarily embedded in its own time, is 
nevertheless to be construed in accordance with the need to treat it 
as current law.
</p> 

<p id="p_59">     In the comments that follow it is pointed out that an ongoing Act 
is taken to be always speaking.  It is also, further stated thus (pp. 
618-19) : 
</p>  

<p id="p_60">       In construing an ongoing Act, the interpreter is to presume that 
Parliament intended the Act to be applied at any future time in such a 
way as to give effect to the true original intention.  Accordingly the   
interpreter is to make allowances for any relevant changes that have 
occurred, since the Act's passing, in law, social conditions, 
technology, the meaning of words, and other matters.  Just as the 
US Constitution is  regarded as " a living Constitution", so an ongoing 
British Act is regarded as "a living Act".  That today's  construction 
involves the supposition that  Parliament was catering long ago for a 
state of affairs that did not then exist is no argument against that 
construction. Parliament, in the wording of an enactment, is expected 
to anticipate temporal developments.  The drafts will try to foresee 
the future, and allow for it in the wording. 
</p> 

<p id="p_61">      An enactment of former days is thus to be read today. In the light 
of dynamic processing received over the years, with such 
modification of the current meaning of its language as will now give 
effect to the original legislative intention. The reality and effect of 
dynamic processing provides the gradual adjustment. It is constituted 
by judicial interpretation, year in and year out. It also comprises 
processing by executive officials."  
</p> 

<p id="p_62"> It  was further observed  : 
</p>   

<p id="p_63"> Assuming that there are two possible interpretations on <a href="/doc/1776833/" id="a_58">section 22</a> of 
the Act, which is akin to a charging section, it is well settled, that the 
one which is favorable to the assessed has to be preferred. 
</p> 
 

<p id="p_64"> Furthermore, for the purpose of computing  the net 
wealth, the source of acquisition of assets  may not have much 
relevance. The said assets have admittedly been acquired by the 
assessede.  Policies are issued by LIC for particular purpose. Although 
loan can be obtained from LIC against  such policy but the same by 
itself cannot  be said to be object and purpose thereof.  Assets had been 
acquired by the assessed by investing the amount in shares and by grant 
of loan or advance to other persons. 
</p> 

<p id="p_65"> 19.We may notice that the income derived from such 
investment would be  subjected to income tax   and thus there does not 
exist any reason as to why the same shall not form  part of the 'assets' 
for the purpose of <a href="/doc/983571/" id="a_59">Wealth-tax Act</a>.  The source of acquiring the money 
for such investment may not be relevant. What is relevant is the extent 
of assets in the  hands of the assessed at the relevant time.  If any assets  
acquired by investment from loan  from any other source could form 
part of assets we fail to understand  as to why the same principle would 
not apply to acquisition of assets by investment of money which was 
procured by way of loan by pleading LIC policies.  This aspect of the 
matter has not been considered in deciding by the courts. 
Vaidyanathan's case ( supra) , Apoorva Shanti Lal's case ( supra) and 
Premnarayan Garg's case (supra).  
</p> 

<p id="p_66"> 20.It may be true that the Bombay High court in the 
<a href="/doc/1458352/" id="a_60">Commissioner of Wealth Tax v. Vasant Kumar Govindi Kotak</a> (1990) 
186 ITR 91 did not go into the question from this point of view  but it is 
profitable to notice that therein it was held:   
  " On the words of <a href="/doc/569859/" id="a_61">section 2</a>, once an asset which 
secures the debt is treated as an asset on which wealth 
tax is chargeable, even though a part of the value of the 
asset is exempt from tax, the whole of the secured debt 
must be deducted."  
</p> 

  
<p id="p_67">The policy amount would be payable only upon its 
maturity but the same by itself  in our considered view cannot be it a 
ground to exclude any assets acquired out of the loan from LIC by 
securing the policies.  The loan could have been obtained from any other 
source.  Selection 5(1)(4)  of the Act has provided for exemption. An 
exemption of the  clause may be strictly construed and the same cannot 
be interpreted  in such a manner so as to take away a benefit to which 
the assessed may otherwise be entitled to. 
</p><p id="p_68">In Federation of A.P. Chambers of Commerce &amp; 
Industry V. state of A.P. , the Apex Court observed 
thus:- 
</p>   

<p id="p_69"> " It is trite law that a taxing statute has to be strictly 
construed and nothing can be read into it. In the classic 
passage from  Cape Brandy Syndicate, (1921) 1 KB 
64,71 which was noticed in the judgment under appeal, 
it was said : 
</p> 

<p id="p_70"> "In a taxing Act one has to look merely at which is 
clearly said. There is no room for any intendment. There 
is no equity about a tax. There is  no presumption as to a 
tax. Nothing is to be read in, nothing is to be implied. 
One can look fairly at the language used."  
</p> 

<p id="p_71"> This view has been reiterated by this Court time and 
again. Thus, in  State of Bombay v. Automobile and 
Agricultural Industries Corpn (1961) 12 STC 122, this 
Court said: 
</p><p id="p_72">  "But the courts in interpreting a taxing statute will not be 
justified in adding words thereto so  as to make out some 
presumed object of the legislature. If the legislature has 
failed to clarify its meaning by the use of appropriate 
language, the benefit  thereof must go to the tax payers. 
It is  settled law that in case of doubt, that interpretation 
of a taxing statute which is beneficial to the taxpayer 
must be adopted". 
</p> 

  
<p id="p_73">21.In view of the aforesaid discussion the reference is 
answered in affirmative and  in favor of the assessed and against the 
revenue. 
</p> 

<p id="p_74"> The reference is disposed of accordingly. 
</p>
