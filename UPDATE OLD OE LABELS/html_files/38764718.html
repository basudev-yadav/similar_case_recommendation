           Act, 2000 1 to the Calcutta High Court. It is the said order which was

           set aside by the High Court on 1.9.2020 directing that the

           Commercial Court, Indore is itself competent to decide the suit in

           terms of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 2.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">2.         The plaintiff/respondent herein filed a suit for declaration and

           permanent injunction to restrain the appellants from either directly

           or indirectly copying, using or enabling others to use the plaintiff’s

           design of Container and Lid registered under Design Application Nos.

           299039 and 299041 respectively.

<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">3.         In the said suit, the defendant/appellant had filed a written statement

           along with the counter-claim before the Commercial Court, inter alia

           seeking cancellation of the abovementioned registered designs for

           the reason that the said designs were not new or original and hence

           could not be registered in terms of Section 4(a) of the 2000 Act. The

           appellant also filed an application under Section 22(4) read with

           Section 19(2) of the 2000 Act to transfer the suit to the Madhya

           Pradesh High Court, Indore Bench. It is the said application which

           was allowed by the learned District Judge and the suit was thus

           transferred to the Calcutta High Court.

</p><p id="p_9">4.        The said order passed by Commercial Court was challenged by the

          plaintiff/respondent before the Madhya Pradesh High Court. The High

          Court examined the question as to whether the proceedings of the

          said suit was liable to be transferred to the High Court or if the

          Commercial Court at Indore was competent to decide the matter. The

          High Court relied upon <a href="/doc/712415/" id="a_1">Godrej Sara Lee Ltd. vs Reckitt Benckiser

          Australia Pty</a>. Ltd. and another 3 to hold that the legislature

          intended that an application for cancellation of registration of design

          would lie to the Controller exclusively without the High Court having

          a parallel jurisdiction to entertain such matter because the appeals

          from the order of the Controller lie before the High Court. It was

          further held that the 2015 Act is a special enactment having an

          overriding effect, save as otherwise provided the provisions, by virtue

          of Section 21 of the said Act.

          High Court. It was also argued that the High Court erred in holding

          that since an appeal against the order of cancellation by the

          Controller lies to the High Court, the transfer would not be

          sustainable for the reason that the appellate jurisdiction is distinct

          from the original jurisdiction in a plea for cancellation of the design

          in a suit in terms of the provisions of 2000 Act.


</p><p id="p_42">7.        On the other hand, Mr. Assudani, learned counsel for the respondent

          relied upon the order of this Court in Godrej Sara Lee as well as

          <a href="/doc/188051985/" id="a_8">Whirlpool of India v. Videocon Industries Ltd</a>. 9 to support the

          order passed by the High Court.

<p id="p_43">
</p><p id="p_44">8.        We have heard learned counsel for the parties. The 2015 Act deals

          with two situations i.e. the High Courts which have ordinary original

          civil jurisdiction and the High Courts which do not have such

          jurisdiction. The High Court of Madhya Pradesh does not have the

          ordinary original civil jurisdiction. In areas where the High Courts do

          not have ordinary original civil jurisdiction, the Commercial Courts at

          the District Level are to be constituted under <a href="/doc/1702478/" id="a_9">Section 3</a> of the 2015

          Act. The State Government is also empowered to fix the pecuniary

          limit of the Commercial Courts at the District Level in consultation

          with the concerned High Court. In terms of <a href="/doc/99572/" id="a_10">Section 3(2)</a> of the 2015

     Act, the Court of District Judge at Indore is notified to be a

     Commercial Court. “Commercial Dispute” within the meaning of

     <a href="/doc/1321789/" id="a_11">Section 2(c)(xvii)</a> of the Act, 2015 includes the dispute pertaining to

     “intellectual property rights relating to registered and unregistered

     trademarks, copyright, patent, design, domain names, geographical

     indications   and   semiconductor       integrated   circuits.”   Therefore,

     disputes related to design are required to be instituted before a

     Commercial Court constituted under <a href="/doc/1702478/" id="a_12">Section 3</a> of the said Act.


</p><p id="p_45">9.   On the other hand, <a href="/doc/562927/" id="a_13">Section 4</a> of the 2015 Act provides that where the

     High Courts have ordinary original civil jurisdiction, a Commercial

     Division is required to be constituted. Further, in terms of <a href="/doc/947182/" id="a_14">Section 5</a>

     of the Act, a Commercial Appellate Division is required to be

     constituted. <a href="/doc/481799/" id="a_15">Section 7</a> of the Act deals with the suits and applications

     relating to the commercial disputes of a specified value filed in the

     High Court having ordinary original jurisdiction, whereas, the second

     proviso contemplates that all suits and the applications transferred

     to the High Court by virtue of sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_16">Section 22</a> of 2000

     Act shall be heard and disposed of by the Commercial Division of the

     High Court in all the areas over which the High Court exercises

     ordinary original civil jurisdiction.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                                                          10</span><p id="p_46">


</p><p id="p_47">10.   It is thus contended that in the High Courts having ordinary original

      civil jurisdiction, the suits which have been transferred to the High

      Court by virtue of sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_17">Section 22</a> of the Act are

      required to be dealt with by the Commercial Division of the High

      Court instead of a Bench of the High Court, in terms of the Rules

      appliable to each High Court. Thus, the suit pertaining to design

      under the 2000 Act would be transferred to the Commercial Division

      from the ordinary original civil jurisdiction, i.e., from one Bench to

      the other exclusive Court dealing with Commercial Disputes.


</p><p id="p_48">11.   It is pertinent to mention that <a href="/doc/481799/" id="a_18">Section 7</a> of the 2015 Act only deals

      with the situation where the High Courts have ordinary original civil

      jurisdiction. There is no provision in the 2015 Act either prohibiting

      or permitting the transfer of the proceedings under the 2000 Act to

      the High Courts which do not have ordinary original civil jurisdiction.

      Further, <a href="/doc/1528876/" id="a_19">Section 21</a> of the 2015 Act gives an overriding effect, only if

      the provisions of the Act have anything inconsistent with any other

      law for the time being in force or any instrument having effect by

      virtue of law other than this Act. Since the 2015 Act has no provision

      either prohibiting or permitting the transfer of proceedings under the

      2000 Act, <a href="/doc/1528876/" id="a_20">Section 21</a> of the 2015 Act cannot be said to be inconsistent

      with the provisions of the 2000 Act. It is only the inconsistent

      provisions of any other law which will give way to the provisions of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                                                             11</span>


      the 2015 Act. In terms of <a href="/doc/617193/" id="a_21">Section 22(4)</a> of the 2000 Act, the

      defendant has a right to seek cancellation of the design which

      necessarily mandates the Courts to transfer the suit. The transfer of

      suit is a ministerial act if there is a prayer for cancellation of the

      registration. In fact, transfer of proceedings from one Bench to the

      Commercial Division supports the argument raised by learned

      counsel for the Appellant that if a suit is to be transferred to

      Commercial Division of the High Court having ordinary original civil

      jurisdiction, then the Civil Suit in which there is plea to revoke the

      registered design has to be transferred to the High Court where there

      is no ordinary original civil jurisdiction.

<p id="p_49">
</p><p id="p_50">12.   The judgment in Godrej Sara Lee arises out of an order passed by

      the Controller of Patent &amp; Designs, Kolkata under <a href="/doc/691857/" id="a_22">Section 19(1)</a> of

      the 2000 Act, cancelling the registered designs belonging to the

      respondent therein. The question examined was as to whether the

      Delhi High Court has jurisdiction to entertain the appeals against the

      order of the Controller. The respondent had also filed a civil suit

      before the Delhi High Court alleging infringement of registered

      designs and thus seeking cancellation of the designs. Later, the

      Controller of Design cancelled three designs belonging to the

      respondent. This order of cancellation was challenged by the

      respondent before the High Court.             In these circumstances, the

           <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_25">Section 51A</a> of the Indian Patents and <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_26">Designs Act</a>, 1911 10.


</p><p id="p_51">13.        It was held that any application for cancellation of registration under

           <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_27">Section 19</a> could be filed only before the Controller and not to the

           High Court. Therefore, in these circumstances, it was held that the

           High Court would be entitled to assume jurisdiction only in appeal. It

           was not a case of suit for infringement in which the defendant has

           raised a plea of revocation of registration which is required to be

           transferred to the High Court in terms of <a href="/doc/617193/" id="a_28">Section 22(4)</a> of the 2000

           Act. Therefore, such judgment has been wrongly relied upon by the

           High Court assuming that the proceedings are before the Controller

           and that the plaintiff/respondent had filed a suit for infringement

           wherein a plea of revocation of registration was raised which was

           required to be transferred to the High Court in terms of <a href="/doc/617193/" id="a_29">Section 22(4)</a>

           of the 2000 Act.
</p>
<p id="p_52">
</p><p id="p_53">14.        Furthermore, in the 2000 Act, there are two options available to seek

           revocation of registration. One of them is before the Controller,

           appeal against which would lie before the High Court. Second, in a

           suit for infringement in a proceeding before the civil court on the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">10</span>
     for short the ‘1911 Act’
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                                                              13</span>


      basis of registration certificate, the defendant has been given the

      right to seek revocation of registration. In that eventuality, the suit

      is to be transferred to the High Court in terms of sub-section (4) of

      <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_30">Section 22</a> of the 2000 Act. Both are independent provisions giving

      rise to different and distinct causes of action.


</p><p id="p_54">15.   In Standard Glass Beads, the 1911 Act was under examination

      before the Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court. <a href="/doc/1414898/" id="a_31">Section 29</a>

      thereof permits a suit to be filed by a patentee wherein the defendant

      could raise a plea of revocation of patent in a counter-claim.

      Considering <a href="/doc/1414898/" id="a_32">Section 29</a> of the Act, it was held as under:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">            “10. The expression “shall be transferred” in our judgment
            means “shall stand transferred”; and the District Judge is left
            with no jurisdiction save to make such order as is necessary
            to secure the physical transfer of the records of the case to
            the High Court. If this meaning be not given to these words
            there will be an element of uncertainty both with regard to the
            time when the record of the case is to be sent to the High
            Court and to the powers of the District Court during the period
            which is allowed to elapse before the record is in fact
            transferred.”


</blockquote><p id="p_55">16.   The said view was reiterated by another Single Bench of Allahabad

      High Court in a judgment reported as R. N. Gupta after the

      enactment of the 2000 Act. The Court held as under:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">            “35. Apart from that, looking from another angle, in case it is
            left open to District Court to proceed further to record any
            satisfaction on the material filed on record in support of the

           ground taken by the defendant as available under <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_33">Section 19</a>,
           it would mean that the District Court would be entering into
           the jurisdiction of the Controller of the Designs as provided to
           him under <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_34">Section 19</a> or of the High Court, in case any such
           proceedings for cancellation of registration are proceeded
           further by the Controller of Designs or are sent to the High
           Court. To my mind, the District Court can go only to the extent
           of satisfying itself as to whether ground, on which the
           registration of design may be cancelled under <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_35">Section 19</a>, has
           been availed as a ground of defence or not. It cannot go into
           the merits of the defence so taken by the defendant as it would
           amount to exceeding his jurisdiction, which can only be gone
           into by the High Court on transfer of the case to the High court
           as to whether there is any force or not in such defence taken
           by the defendant under <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_36">Section 19</a> of the Act.

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">           36. In such view of the matter, once, on bare reading of the
           reply filed to the interim injunction application, it is found that
           that a defence or ground under <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_37">Section 19</a> is availed of,
           nothing further is to be seen by the District court and he has
           no option but to transfer the case to the High Court for
           decision including the interim injunction application.”



</blockquote><p id="p_56">17.   Similar view was taken by Single Bench of Karnataka High Court in a

      judgment reported as M/s Astral Polytechnic, wherein the Court

      held as under:
</p>
<p id="p_57">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">           “15. In that view of the matter, the order passed by the
           trial judge refusing to transfer the pending suit to this court
           when admittedly the second defendant has taken a defence
           under sec. 19 of the Act contending that the design which
           is registered in favour of the plaintiff was not registerable
           at all, is erroneous and liable to be quashed…..”

</blockquote><p id="p_58">18.   To the same effect is a judgment of Jammu and Kashmir High Court

      reported as M/s. Escorts Construction Equipment, wherein it is

      held that once a defence is taken for revocation of registration, then

      in terms of sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_38">Section 22</a> of the 2000 Act, the Civil

      Court has no power to decide the revocation of the design and it is

      only the High Court which has to adjudicate upon the matter and

      decide as to whether the design is to be cancelled or not. It was held

      that the learned trial court committed a legal error in not transferring

      the case to the High Court.
</p>
<p id="p_59">
</p><p id="p_60">19.   The Bombay High Court in Whirlpool of India was dealing with a

      suit against the Defendant for infringement of the registered designs;

      passing off; and the damages. The defendant never sought the

      cancellation of the registration granted to the plaintiff but relied upon

      the registration granted to it. In these circumstances, the High Court

      held as under:
</p>
<p id="p_61">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">            “19. In support of its contention that the Defendant's
            registered design can only be challenged by proceedings under
            <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_39">Section 19</a> of the Act before the Controller, the Defendant
            would argue that the availability of a remedy under <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_40">Section 19</a>
            of the Act for cancellation of a registered design amounts to a
            negation and exclusion of remedy under <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_41">Section 22</a> of the Act.
            This is plainly incorrect. <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_42">Section 19</a> and <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_43">Section 22</a> of the Act
            operate independently in different circumstances. <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_44">Section 19</a>
            of the Act is invoked to seek cancellation of a registration of a
            design. <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_45">Section 22</a> of the Act is invoked where a registered
            design of a proprietor is infringed by any person and the
            registered proprietor seeks reliefs in the form of damages,
            injunction, etc. against the infringer. Such relief can be sought
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                                                                   16</span>

              even against a registered proprietor of a design by questioning
              his registration. The Defendant too can submit that the
              Plaintiff is not entitled to any relief in terms of damages,
              injunction etc. by questioning the registration of the Plaintiff's
              on grounds available under <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_46">Section 19</a> of the Act for
              cancellation of a registration. Again, <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_47">Section 19</a> entitles a party
              to move the Controller for cancellation of a design even where
              the registered proprietor is not using the design. <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_48">Section 19</a>
              therefore affords a cause of action where a mere registration
              is considered objectionable and a mere factum of registration
              affords a cause of action. In marked contrast, <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_49">Section 22</a> of
              the Act affords a cause of action only where a registered
              design is being applied or caused to be applied to any article
              for the purposes of sale or in relation to or in connection with
              such sale. Consequently, if a registered proprietor does not
              apply his design to an article for sale or in connection with
              such sale, another registered proprietor cannot have recourse
              to <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_50">Section 22</a> of the Act. The remedy under <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_51">Section 22</a> of the
              Act is only available where the impugned design is being used.
              A further distinction between <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_52">Section 19</a> and <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_53">22</a> of the Act, as
              correctly pointed out on behalf of the Plaintiff is that while
              <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_54">Section 19</a> is applicable to ‘any person interested’, <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_55">Section 22</a>
              is available only to a small segment of such person viz.
              registered proprietors. The remedy under <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_56">Section 19</a> and the
              remedy under <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_57">Section 22</a> are therefore very different. They
              apply to different persons in different circumstances and for
              different reliefs.”

      Level is in accordance with law. However, we are unable to agree with

      the Commercial Court to transfer such suit to Calcutta High Court.

      The High Court, where the cause of action arises has the Jurisdiction

      to entertain the Suit in terms of Godrej Sara Lee. Since no part of

      cause of action has arisen within the jurisdiction of Kolkata, the suit

      is liable to be transferred to Madhya Pradesh High Court, Indore

      Bench. In fact, the Plaintiff has filed suit at Indore, Madhya Pradesh

      only.
