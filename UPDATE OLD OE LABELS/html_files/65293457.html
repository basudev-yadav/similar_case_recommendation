<p id="p_55">4.     The petitioner states that he is a financier who gives advances to
various contractors working with Director General, Defence Estates.
</p><p id="p_56">5.     Keeping in view the width and amplitude of the information sought
by the petitioner, it is apparent that the prayers in the writ petition are
nothing short of an abuse of process of law and motivated if not an attempt
to intimidate the respondent. In fact, even two days ago, this Court had dealt
with a writ petition filed by the present petitioner being W.P.(C) 784/2014
wherein equally wide information had been asked for under the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_5">RTI Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_57">6.     In the opinion of this Court, the primary duty of the officials of
Ministry of Defence is to protect the sovereignty and integrity of India. If
the limited manpower and resources of the Directorate General, Defence
Estates as well as the Cantonment Board are devoted to address such
meaningless queries, this Court is of the opinion that the entire office of the
Directorate General, Defence Estates Cantonment Board would come to
stand still. The Supreme Court in CBSE vs. AdityaBandopadhyay, (2011) 8
SCC 497, has held as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">       62. When trying to ensure that the right to information does not

        fiscal resources, etc.), it is difficult to visualise and enumerate
       all types of information which require to be exempted from
       disclosure in public interest. The legislature has however made
       an attempt to do so. The enumeration of exemptions is more
       exhaustive than the enumeration of exemptions attempted in the
       earlier Act, that is, <a href="/doc/1669859/" id="a_6">Section 8</a> of the Freedom to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_7">Information Act</a>,
       2002. The courts and Information Commissions enforcing the
       provisions of the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_8">RTI Act</a> have to adopt a purposive
       construction, involving a reasonable and balanced approach
       which harmonises the two objects of the Act, while interpreting
       <a href="/doc/758550/" id="a_9">Section 8</a> and the other provisions of the Act.

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">       63. At this juncture, it is necessary to clear some
       misconceptions about the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_10">RTI Act</a>. <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_11">The RTI Act</a> provides access
       to all information that is available and existing. This is clear
       from a combined reading of <a href="/doc/1979161/" id="a_12">Section 3</a> and the definitions of
       "information" and "right to information" under clauses (f) and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">       (j) of <a href="/doc/277989/" id="a_13">Section 2</a> of the Act. If a public authority has any
       information in the form of data or analysed data, or abstracts,
       or statistics, an applicant may access such information, subject
       to the exemptions in <a href="/doc/758550/" id="a_14">Section 8</a> of the Act. But where the
       information sought is not a part of the record of a public
       authority, and where such information is not required to be
       maintained under any law or the rules or regulations of the
       public authority, the Act does not cast an obligation upon the
       public authority, to collect or collate such non-available
       information and then furnish it to an applicant. A public
       authority is also not required to furnish information which
       require drawing of inferences and/or making of assumptions. It
       is also not required to provide "advice" or "opinion" to an
       applicant, nor required to obtain and furnish any "opinion" or
       "advice" to an applicant. The reference to "opinion" or
       "advice" in the definition of "information" in <a href="/doc/1516599/" id="a_15">Section 2(f)</a> of
       the Act, only refers to such material available in the records of
       the public authority. Many public authorities have, as a public
       relation exercise, provide advice, guidance and opinion to the
       citizens. But that is purely voluntary and should not be confused
       with any obligation under the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_16">RTI Act</a>.
