ACT:
    Madras   Panchayats	  Act,	1958:	Sections   115	 and
116--Mining  lease--Levy  of  cess  on	royalty--Held  ultra
vires.
    Constitution  of  India,  1950:  Seventh  Schedule	List
II--Entries 23, 49 &amp; 50--Levy of cess on royalty in  respect
of mining lease-Sections 115 &amp; 116 of Madras Panchayats	 Act
1958--Held illegal and ultra vires.
    Mineral Concession Rules, 1960: Levy of cess in  respect
of mining leases--Sections 115 and 116 Madras Panchayats Act
1958--Held illegal and ultra vires.



HEADNOTE:
    The appellant company used to manufacture cement and was
granted mining lease for limestone and kankar by the Govern-
ment of Tamil Nadu in accordance with the Mineral Concession
Rules,	1960.  The  royalty was fixed under  the  Mines	 and
Minerals  (Regulation  &amp; <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_1">Development) Act</a>, 1957 which  is  a
<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_2">Central	 Act</a> by which the control of mines and minerals	 had
been taken over by the Central Government for the regulation
and development of minerals.
    Sub-<a href="/doc/75854329/" id="a_3">section	 1</a> of section 115 of the  Madras  Panchayats
Act,  1958 enjoins that there shall be levied in every	pan-
chayat	development  block, a local cess at the rate  of  45
paise on every rupee of land revenue payable to the  Govern-
ment in respect of any land for every Fasli. An	 explanation
to the said section was added, and was deemed always to have
been  incorporated by the Tamil Nadu  Panchayats  (Amendment
and <a href="/doc/269107/" id="a_4">Miscellaneous Provisions) Act</a>, 1964. In this explanation
a  fiction was created whereby even the royalty payable	 had
been included within the definition of "land revenue".
    The	 appellant filed a writ petition in the	 High  Court
challenging the competence of the State legislature to	levy
cess  on royalty. A learned Single Judge dismissed the	writ
petition holding that the cess levied
693
under section 115 of the Madras panchayats Act was a tax  on
land and, as such, fell under Entry 49 of the State List  of
Schedule  VII of the Constitution. The Division	 Bench	dis-
missed	the  appellant's  appeal and held  that	 local	cess
authorised  by	<a href="/doc/269107/" id="a_5">section 115</a> was not land revenue but  was  a
charge on the land itself, and <a href="/doc/269107/" id="a_6">section 115</a> merely quantified
the basis of the quantum of land revenue. The learned Single
Judge, as well as the Division Bench, relied on the decision
of  this  Court in <a href="/doc/21773/" id="a_7">H.R.S. Murthy v. Collector  of  Chittoor</a>,
[1964] 6 SCR 666.
    Before  this  Court, it was contended on behalf  of	 the
appellant that the levy of cess on royalty in this case	 was
nothing	 but a tax on royalty and was therefore ultra  vires
the  State legislature. On the other hand, it was  contended
that  the cess in the present case was a levy in respect  of
land and could be justified or sustained either under  entry
49, 50 or 45 of List II of the 7th Schedule to the Constitu-
tion.  It  was further submitted that the cess	having	been
realised  on  the  basis of the decision of  this  Court  in
"H.R.S. Murthy" case, if at all, the Court shall declare the
said cess on royalty to be ultra vires prospectively.
Allowing the appeal, this Court,
    HELD:  (E.S.  Venkataramiah, C J,  Sabyasachi  Mukharji,
Ranganath  Misra,  B.C. Ray, K.N. Singh	 and  S.  Natarajan,
JJ.--per Sabyasachi Mukharji, J.)
    (1) Courts of law are enjoined to gather the meaning  of
the  Constitution from the language used, and  although	 one
should	interpret the words of the Constitution on the	same
principles  of interpretation as one applied to an  ordinary
law  but these very principles of interpretation compel	 one
to  take into account the nature and scope of the Act  which
requires interpretation. It has to be remembered that it  is
a Constitution that requires interpretation. Constitution is
the  mechanism under which the laws are to be made  and	 not
merely an Act which declares what the law is to be. [704B-C]
    The Attorney General for the State of New South Wales v.
The Brewery Employees Union of New South Wales, [1908] 6 CLR
469, referred to.
    (2)	 A Constitution must not be construed in any  narrow
or  pedantic sense, and construction most beneficial to	 the
widest possible amplitude of its powers, must be adopted.  A
broad and liberal spirit should inspire those whose duty  it
is to interpret the Constitution, but
694
they are not free to stretch or pervert the language of	 the
enactment  in  the interest of any legal  or  constitutional
theory,	 or even for the purposes of supplying omissions  or
correcting supposed errors. [704D-E-F]

wealth of Australia, [1936] AC 578, referred to.
    (3)	 It is well-settled now that the various entries  in
the  three lists are not powers but fields  of	legislation.
The  power  to legislate is given by <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_8">Article 246</a>  and  other
articles of the Constitution. [704G]

    (4)	 It is well settled that widest amplitude should  be
given  to the language of these entries, but some  of  these
entries	 in different lists or in the same list may  overlap
and sometimes may also appear to be in direct conflict	with
each  other. Then, it is the duty of the court to  find	 out
its  true  intent and purpose and to  examine  a  particular
legislation  in its pith and substance to determine  whether
it fits in one or the other of the lists. Each general	word
should	be  held to extend to all  ancillary  or  subsidiary
matters	 which can fairly and reasonably be comprehended  in
it. [705A-B &amp; D]

    (5)	 It is clear that over a period of  centuries,	land
revenue	 in  India has acquired a cannot active	 meaning  of
share  in the produce of land to which the King or the	Gov-
ernment is entitled to receive. [707B]

land and tax on income arising from land. [708C]

    (7)	 Explanation to <a href="/doc/269107/" id="a_14">section 115(1)</a> itself makes  a	dis-
tinction  between land revenue as such and royalty which  by
amendment  is deemed to be land revenue. It  is,  therefore,
recognised  by	the very force of that explanation  and	 the
amendment thereto that the expression 'royalty' in  <a href="/doc/269107/" id="a_15">sections
115</a>  &amp;	<a href="/doc/269107/" id="a_16">116</a>  of the Act cannot mean  land  revenue  property
called	or conventionally known, which is separate and	dis-
tinct from royalty. [707D-E]
    (8)	 In  the instant case, cess is not on land,  but  on
royalty, which is included in the definition of 'land  reve-
nue',  None  of the three lists of the 7th Schedule  of	 the
Constitution permits or authorises a State to impose tax  on
royalty.
    (9)	 Royalty  which is indirectly connected	 with  land,
cannot	be  said  to be a tax directly on land	as  a  unit.
Royalty is payable on a proportion of the mineral extracted.
<a href="/doc/269107/" id="a_17">The  Act</a> does not use dead rent as a basis on which land  is
to  be	valued. Hence, there cannot be any  doubt  that	 the
impugned  legislation in its pith and substance is a tax  on
royalty and not a tax on land. [709E]

    (10) Royalty is directly relatable only to the  minerals
extracted and on the principle that the general provision is
excluded  by the special one, royalty would be relatable  to
entries	 23  &amp; 50 of List II, and not entry 49 of  List	 II.
[713D]
    (11)  Royalty  is a tax, and as such a cess	 on  royalty
being  a  tax on royalty, is beyond the	 competence  of	 the
State  Legislature  because  <a href="/doc/136667771/" id="a_21">section 9</a> of  the	Central	 Act
covers the field and the State Legislature is denuded of its
competence under entry 23 of List II. In any event, cess  on
royalty	 cannot	 be sustained under entry 49 of List  II  as
being a tax on land. Royalty on mineral rights is not a	 tax
on land but a payment for the user of land. [713F-G]

SCR 666, overruled.
    (12)  The  amounts of cess have been  collected  on	 the
basis of the decision of this Court in H.R.S. Murthy's case.
The  Court is therefore justified in declaring the  levy  of
the said cess under <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_31">section 115</a> to be ultra vires the  power
of the State legislature prospectively only. The respondents
will  not be liable for any refund of cess already  paid  or
collected. [714C-D &amp; E]
Per G.L. Oza, J.
    (1)	 Sub-clause (1) of <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_32">Section 115</a> provides for levy  of
45 naya paise for every rupee of land revenue payable to the
Government. In the explanation a fiction is created  whereby
even the royalty payable has been included within the  defi-
nition of 'land revenue'. [718A]
    (2) The language of Entries 23 and 50 in List II clearly
subjects the authority or jurisdiction on the State Legisla-
ture to any enactment made by the Parliament. Entry 23 talks
of regulation and Entry 50 talks of taxes on mineral rights.
It therefore could not be disputed that if the cess  imposed
under section 115 of the Madras Panchayats Act is a cess  or
tax on mineral rights then that jurisdiction could be  exer-
cised by the State Legislature subject to the law enacted by
the Parliament. [715D-E]
    (3) Unit of charge of royalty is not only land but	land
+ labour + capital. It is therefore clear that if royalty is
a  tax or an imposition or a levy, it is not on	 land  alone
but it is a levy or a tax on mineral (land),
697
labour and capital employed in extraction of the mineral. It
therefore  is  clear that royalty if it is  imposed  by	 the
Parliament  it could only be a tax not only on land  but  on
the three things stated above. [718H; 719A]
    (4)	 When  the  Legislature included  royalty,  it	went
beyond its jurisdiction under Entry 49 of List II and there-
fore clearly is without the authority of law. [719D]
    (5)	 This may lead to an interesting situation. As	this
cess on royalty is without the authority, the result will be
that the cess is levied so far as lands other than the lands
in  which mines are situated are concerned but	lands  where
mines  are situated this levy of cess is not  in  accordance
with  the law. This anamoly could have been averted  if	 the
Legislature had used words 'surface rent' in place of royal-
ty. Even if the lands where mines are situated and which are
subject	 to licence and mining leases, even for those  lands
there  is a charge on the basis of the surface of  the	land
which  is Sometimes described as surface rent  or  sometimes
also as 'dead rent'. [719E-F]

</p><p id="p_3">The Judgment of the Court were delivered by
    SABYASACHI	MUKHARJI, J. The question involved in  these
appeals,  special  leave petitions and	writ  petitions	 is,
whether levy of cess on royalty is within the competence  of
the State Legislature. In order to appreciate the  question,
it is necessary to refer to certain facts. Civil appeal	 No.
62/79  is an appeal by special leave from the  judgment	 and
order of the High Court of Madras, dated 13th October, 1969,
in writ appeal No. 464/67. The appellant is a public limited
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">698</span>
company	 incorporated under the <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_33">Indian Companies Act</a>,  1913.
The  Company  at  all relevant times,  used  to	 manufacture
cement in its factory at Talaiyuthu in Tirunelveli district,
and at Sankaridrug in Salem district of Tamil Nadu. By	G.O.
Ms. No. 3668 dated 19th July, 1963, the Govt. of Tamil	Nadu
sanctioned  the	 grant	to the appellant  mining  lease	 for
limestone and kankar for a period of 20 years over an extent
of 133.91 acres of land in the village of Chinnagoundanur in
Sankaridrug  Taluk of Salem district. Out of the  extent  of
133.91	acres  comprised in the mining lease, an  extent  of
126.14	acres was patta land and only the balance extent  of
7.77 acres Govt. land. The lease deed was in accordance with
the  Mineral Concession Rules, 1960. The rates	of  royalty,
dead rent and surface rent, were as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	      "Royalty:

	      the  land revenue and cess assessable  on	 the

</blockquote><p id="p_4">The  appellant	started	 mining operations  soon  after	 the
execution
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">699</span>
of the lease deed and has ever since been paying the  royal-
ties, dead rents and other amounts payable under the Deed.
    Under s. 115 of the Madras Panchayats Act (XXXV of 1958)
(hereinafter  called  'the Act'), as amended by	 Madras	 Act
XVIII  of 1964 (herein after called 'the amended  Act'),  as
royalty	 the appellant was required to pay local cess  @  45
paise  per rupee. It may be mentioned that the said  imposi-
tion  was  with retrospective effect along with	 local	cess
surcharge  under <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_34"> s. 116</a> of the Act. The contention  of	 the
appellant  is and was, at all relevant times, that  cess  on
royalty cannot be levied. This is the common question  which
falls for consideration and requires determination in  these
appeals and petitions.
</p><p id="p_5">    To complete the narration of events, however, it has  to
be  noted  that the Collector sent a communication  on	10th
April, 1965, demanding cess or royalty payable under the Act
on  minerals  carried  on  during  the	period	1.7.1961  to
31.12.1964,  and  the petitioner was threatened	 of  serious
consequences  in  case of default of payment on	 receipt  of
that  communication. Thereafter, writ petition	No.  1864/65
was  filed  in	the High Court of Madras.  By  the  judgment
delivered and order passed on 23rd February, 1967. a learned
Single	Judge  of the Madras  High  Court--Justice  Kailasam
dismissed  the	writ petition holding that the	cess  levied
under<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_35"> s. 115</a> of the act is a tax on land and, as such, falls
under Entry 49 of the State List of the Schedule VII of	 the
Constitution,  and  was within the competence of  the  State
legislature. Reliance was placed by the learned single Judge
on the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/21773/" id="a_36">H.R.S. Murthy v.  Collector
of Chittoor &amp; Anr</a>., [1964] 6 SCR 666. He held that the	cess
levied	under <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_37"> s. 115</a> was a tax on land, though	 fixed	with
reference  to the land revenue. In regard to<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_38"> s. 116</a>  of	 the
Act,  the learned Single Judge held that the  maximum  limit
had been prescribed by the Government by rules flamed  under
the  Act, and, therefore, there was no	arbitrariness  about
the levy.
</p><p id="p_6">    Sub-<a href="/doc/75854329/" id="a_39">section	 1</a> of s. 115 of the Act enjoins	 that  there

</p><p id="p_11">    There  was	an  appeal from the  said  decision  of	 the
learned	 Single	 Judge, to the division bench  of  the	High

13th October, 1969, dismissed the writ appeal, and held that
local  cess authorised by<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_51"> s. 115</a> as aforesaid "was not	land
revenue but is a charge on the land itself and <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_52">Section 115</a>

merely quantified on the basis of the quantum of land  reve-
nue". The division bench held that the meaning of the Expla-
nation added to<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_54"> s. 115</a> was that the cess is levied as a	 tax
on  land  and is measured with reference  to  land  revenue,
royalty, lease amount etc. as mentioned in the	Explanation.
The division bench also relied on the decision of this Court
in  H.R.S.  Murthy  (supra), and further held  that  in	 the
aforesaid view of the matter, it was not possible to  accept
the contention that<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_55"> s. 115</a> of the Act read with the Explana-

by  this  Court on 12th January, 1970 the  appeal  has	been
filed.
</p><p id="p_12">    The	 appellant  is	bound to pay royalty  to  the  Govt.
according  to the rates provided in the Second	Schedule  to
the  said Act of 1957. Clause (1) of Part VII of  the  lease
document provides as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">	      "The lessee/lessees shall pay the rent,  water
	      rate  and royalties reserved by this lease  at
	      such times and in the manner provided in	Part
	      V and VI of these presents and shall also	 pay
	      and discharge all taxes, rates, assessment and
	      impositions whatsoever being in the nature  of
	      public demand which shall from time to time be
	      charged, assessed or imposed by the  authority
	      of the Central and State Government upon or in

	      and  work of a like nature except demands	 for
	      land revenue."</blockquote>
<p id="p_13">    As mentioned hereinbefore, there is an obligation of the
lessee	to pay rent and other charges mentioned in the	said
Clause,	 and  all other Central and  State  Government	dues
"except demands for land revenue". The question,  therefore,
which arises is, is cess on royalty a demand of land revenue
or additional royalty?
</p><p id="p_14">    For the appellants and/or petitioners we have heard	 Mr.
Nariman,_  Dr. Chitale and Mr. Salve, and for the  interven-
ers,  S/Shri K.D. Prasad, Rajendra Choudhary and  Ms.  Seita
Vaidialingam  have made their submissions. For the State  of
Tamil Nadu, Mr. Krishnamurthy Iyer and Mr. V.  Krishnamurthy
have  made their submissions. We have had the  advantage  of
the  submissions made by learned Attorney General on  behalf
of  Union of India. The issues are common in the writ  peti-
tions  as  well as in the appeal and in	 the  special  leave
petitions. The question involved in the appeals and the writ
petition  is  about the constitutional validity	 of  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_58">Section
115(1)</a> of the Act, in so far as it
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">702</span>
sought to levy as local cess @ 45 naya paise on every  rupee
of  the land revenue payable to the Government, the  meaning
of land revenue being artificially expanded by the  explana-
tion  so  as  to include royalty payable  under	 the  mining
lease.
</p><p id="p_15">    In	this connection, it may be appropriate to  refer  to
the Statement of Objects and Reasons for the amendment which
stated, inter alia, as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">	      "Under  the Explanation to <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_59">section 115</a> of	 the
	      Act "land revenue" means public revenue due on
	      land  and includes water-cess payable  to	 the
	      Government for water supplied or used for	 the
	      irrigation  of land but does not	include	 any
	      other cess or surcharge payable under  section
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">	      116.  The Explanation does not  cover  "royal-
	      ties",  lease amount or other sum	 payable  to
	      the Government in respect of land held  direct
	      from the Government on lease or licence  which
	      were  included  in  the  definition  of  "land
	      revenue" under the Madras District Boards Act,
	      1920. As under the Madras District Boards Act,
	      1920, certain panchayat union councils contin-
	      ued  to levy the cess and surcharge under	 the
	      Madras  Panchayats Act, 1958 also. It is	con-
	      sidered  that the levy should be on  the	same
	      basis as under the Madras District Boards Act,
	      1920.  It is, therefore, proposed	 to  include
	      "royalty, lease amount and other sums  payable
	      to  the Government" in the definition of	land
	      revenue  in the Explanation to <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_60">section 115</a>  of
	      the  Act	and also to validate  the  levy	 and
	      collection  of  the cess	and  surcharge	made
	      hitherto on the said basis."</blockquote>
<p id="p_16">    It	is obvious that the said amendment was	intended  to
bring  royalty within the Explanation and the definition  of
land  revenue in <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_61">section 115</a> as well as<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_62"> s. 116</a> of  the	Act,
and was effected by the Gazette Notification of 2nd  Septem-
ber, 1964 by Act No. 18 of 1964. In order to appreciate	 the
controversy,  it  has  no be understood that  in  this	case
royalty	 was payable by the appellant which  was  prescribed
under  the  lease deed, the terms whereof  have	 been  noted
hereinbefore. The royalty had been fixed under the statutory
rules and protected under those rules. The royalty was fixed
under the Mines and Minerals (Regulation &amp; <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_63">Development) Act</a>,
1957  which is a <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_64">Central Act</a> by which the control  of  mines
and minerals had been taken over by the Central	 Government.
It was an Act for the regulation of mines and development of
minerals under the control of Union of India. That
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">703</span>
Act  was  to  provide for the regulation of  mines  and	 the
development  of minerals under the control of the  Union  of
India.	Sec. 2 of the Act declares that it is  expedient  in
the  public  interest that the Union of	 India	should	take
under  its control the regulation of mines and the  develop-
ment  of  the minerals to the extent provided  in  the	Act.
<a href="/doc/136667771/" id="a_65">Section 9</a> of the Act provides as follows:

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">704</span>
under  Entry  54 of list I of the 7th  Schedule.  Since	 the
control of mines and the development of minerals were  taken
over by Parliament, the question that arises here is whether
the  levy or the impost by the State Legislature imposed  in
this  case can be justified or sustained either under  entry
49, 50 or 45 of list II of the 7th Schedule.
</p><p id="p_18">    Courts of law are enjoined to gather the meaning of	 the
Constitution from the language used and although one  should
interpret the words of the Constitution on the same  princi-
ples of interpretation as one applies to an ordinary law but
these  very principles of interpretation compel one to	take
into account the nature and scope of the Act which  requires
interpretation. It has to be remembered that it is a Consti-
tution	that  requires interpretation. Constitution  is	 the
mechanism under which the laws are to be made and not merely
an Act which declares what the law is to be. See the  obser-
vations	 of Justice Higgins in the Attorney General for	 the
State  of New South Wales v. The Brawery Employees Union  of
New South Wales, [1908] 6 CLR 469 at 611-2.
</p><p id="p_19">    In re: C.P. and Berar Sales of Motor Spirit &amp; Lubricants
Taxation Act, 1938, [1939] FCR at p. 1, Chief Justice  Gwyer
of the Federal Court of India relied on the observations  of
Lord  Wright in James v. Common wealth of Australia,  [1936]
AC  578	 and observed that a Constitution must not  be	con-
strued	in any narrow or pedantic sense, and that  construc-
tion most beneficial to the widest possible amplitude of its
powers,	 must be adopted. The learned Chief  Justice  empha-
sised  that a broad and liberal spirit should inspire  those
whose duty it is to interpret the Constitution, but they are
not free to stretch or pervert the language of the enactment
in  the interest of any legal or constitutional	 theory,  or
even  for the purposes of supplying omissions or  correcting
supposed  errors. A Federal Court will not  strengthen,	 but
only derogate from, its position, if it seeks to do anything
but  declare  the  law; but it may rightly  reflect  that  a
Constitution  of  a country is a living and  organic  thing,
which  of all instruments has the greatest claim to be	con-
strued ut res magis valeat guam pereat.--'It is better	that
it should live than that it should perish'.
    Certain  rules have been evolved in this period, and  it
is  wellsettled	 now that the various entries in  the  three
lists are not powers but fields of legislation. The power to
legislate  is  given by <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_68">Art. 246</a> and other articles  of	 the
Constitution. See the observations of this Court in <a href="/doc/690534/" id="a_69">Calcutta
Gas  Co. v. State of West Bengal</a>, [1962] Suppl 3 SCR 1.	 The
entries	 in the three lists of the Seventh Schedule  to	 the
Constitution,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">705</span>
are legislative heads or fields of legislation. These demar-
cate  the area over which appropriate legislature can  oper-
ate.  It  is well settled that widest  amplitude  should  be
given  to the language of these entries, but some  of  these
entries	 in different lists or in the same list may  overlap
and sometimes may also appear to be in direct conflict	with
each  other. Then, it is the duty of the court to  find	 out
its  true  intent and purpose and to  examine  a  particular
legislation  in its pith and substance to determine  whether
it  fits in one or the other of the lists. See the  observa-
tions of this Court in H.R. Banthia &amp; Ors. etc. v. Union  of
India &amp; Ors., [1970] 1 SCR 479 at 489 and <a href="/doc/1235907/" id="a_70">Union of India  v.
Shri  H.S.  Dillon</a>, [1971] 2 SCC 779 at 792. The  lists	 are
designed  to  define  and delimit the  respective  areas  of
respective  competence	of the Union and the  States.  These
neither	 impose any implied restriction on  the	 legislative
power  conferred  by <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_71">Article 246</a> of  the  Constitution,	 nor
prescribe any duty to exercise that legislative power in any
particular manner. Hence, the language of the entries should
be  given  widest scope, <a href="/doc/582733/" id="a_72">D.C. Rataria v.  Bhuwalka  Brothers
Ltd</a>., [1955] 1 SCR 1071, to find out which of the meaning is
fairly	capable because these set up machinery of the  Govt.
Each general word should be held to extend to all  ancillary
or  subsidiary	matters which can fairly and  reasonably  be
comprehended in it. In interpreting an entry it would not be
reasonable  to	import any limitation by comparing  or	con-
trasting that entry with any other one in the same List.  It
is  in this background that one has to examine	the  present
controversy.
</p><p id="p_20">    Here,  we  are concerned with cess on royalty.  One	 can
have  an idea as to what cess is, from the  observations  of
Justice Hidayatullah, as the learned Chief Justice then was,
in  M/s	 Guruswamy  &amp; Co. etc. v. State of  Mysore  &amp;  Ors.,
[1967]	1 SCR 548 where at page 571, the learned  Judge	 ob-
served:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">	      "The  word 'cess' is used in Ireland and_.  is
	      still  in use in India although the word	rate
	      has replaced it in England. It means a tax and
	      is  generally used when the levy is  for	some
	      special administrative expense which the	name
	      (health cess, education cess, road cess  etc.)
	      indicates.  When levied as an increment to  an
	      existing	tax,  the name matters not  for	 the
	      validity of the cess must be judged of in	 the
	      same  way as the validity of the tax to  which
	      it is an increment."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_17">    The said observations were made in the dissenting  judg-
</blockquote><p id="p_21">ment, but there was no dissent on this aspect of the matter.
Relying on the aforesaid observations, Mr Nariman  appearing
for the appellant and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">706</span>
the  petitioners  suggested that the impugned levy  in	this
case is nothing but a tax on royalty and is therefore  ultra
vires the State legislature. Mr. Krishnamurthy Iyer  appear-
ing  for the State of Tamil Nadu submitted that the cess  in
question  in the instant case is a levy in respect  of	land
for  every fasli. He urged that the words "a local  cess  at
the  rate  of 45 naya paise on every rupee of  land  revenue
payable" qualify the words "land revenue". These words	were
only intended, according to Mr. Krishnamurthy Iyer, to	mean
cess  payable. It is, however, not possible to	accept	this
submission,  in	 view  of the obligation  indicated  by	 the
language  of  the provisions. Cess is not on  land,  but  on
royalty	 which is included in the definition of 'land  reve-
nue'.  None  of the three lists of the 7th Schedule  of	 the
Constitution permits or authorises a State to impose tax  on
royalty.  This	levy has been sought to be  justified  under
Entry 45 of List II of the 7th Schedule. Entry 45 deals with
land revenue, which is a well-known concept and has  existed
in  India before the Constitution came into force.  In	N.R.
Reddy  &amp; Ors. v. State of A.P. &amp; Ors., [1965] 2	 Andhra	 Law
Times  297, Jaganmohan Reddy, J. as the learned	 Judge	then
was  of	 the Andhra Pradesh High Court, while sitting  in  a
division bench observed that no land revenue Act existed  in
the  composite State of Madras nor had the  ryotwari  system
ever been established by legislative enactment. The  learned
Judge  at p. 306 of the report observed that in the  earlier
days, sovereigns had in exercise of their prerogative  right
claimed a share of the produce of all cultivated land  known
as  'Rajabhagam' or by any of the various other	 names,	 and
had fixed their share or its commuted money value from	time
to  time, according to their will and pleasure. The  learned
Judge  noted that as long as the share of the sovereign	 was
being paid, the sovereign had no right to the possession  of
the lands, and the proprietorship of these lands was  vested
in  the occupier, who could not be removed  because  another
offered	 more. The right of the sovereign to a share in	 the
produce	 as observed by the Govt. of Madras in 1856 "is	 not
rent which consists of all surplus produce after paying	 the
cost  of cultivation and the profits of	 agricultural  stock
but  land  revenue only which ought, if possible, to  be  so
lightly assessed as to leave a surplus or rent to the  occu-
pier, when he in fact lets the land to others or retains  it
in his own hands." It was noted that the amount of tax	that
was  levied  before the Mohamedan Rule, amounted  to  1/8th,
1/6th  or 1/12th according to Manu depending on the  differ-
ences in the soil and the labour necessary to cultivate	 it,
and it even went up to 1/4th part, in times of urgent neces-
sity, as of war or invasion. The later commentators, Yajnav-
alkya,	Apastamba, Gautama, Baudhayana and Narada, have	 all
asserted  not  only the right but the extent of	 the  share.
When  the British came to India they followed not  only	 the
precedent
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">707</span>
of  the previous Mohamedan Rulers who also claimed  enormous
land  revenue, with this difference that what the  Mohamedan
Rulers claimed they could never fully realise, but what	 the
British Rulers claimed they realised with vigour. It is	 not
necessary  to refer in detail how land revenue developed  in
India  after  the advent of the British Rule. There  was  an
appeal	from the said decision of the High Court  of  Andhra
Pradesh	 and this Court dismissed the appeal in State of  A.
P. v. N.R. Reddy &amp; Ors., [1967] 3 SCR 28.
</p><p id="p_22">    It	is, however, clear that over a period of  centuries,
land  revenue in India has acquired a connot active  meaning
of  share  in the produce of land to which the King  or	 the
Govt. is entitled to receive. It was contended on behalf  of
the appellants that the impugned measure being a tax, not on
share  of  the produce of the land but on  royalty;  royalty
being  the  return received from the produce  of  the  land,
revenue	 was payable for winning minerals from the land.  In
the premises it was contended that it cannot be attributable
to Entry 45 of List II of the 7th Schedule, being not a land
revenue. It has, however, to be borne in mind that  Explana-
tion to <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_73">Section 115(1)</a> was added and there was an  amendment
as  we	have  noted before. That very  Explanation  makes  a
distinction  between land revenue as such and royalty  which
by amendment is deemed to be land revenue. It is, therefore,
recognised  by	the very force of that Explanation  and	 the
amendment thereto that the expression 'royalty' in  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_74">sections
115</a>  &amp;	<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_75">116</a>  of the Act cannot mean  land  revenue  properly
called	or conventionally known, which is separate and	dis-
tinct from royalty.
</p><p id="p_23">    It was also contended on behalf of the respondent  State
of  Tamil Nadu of Mr. Krishnamurthy Iyer that it could	also
be  justified under Entry 49 of List II of the 7th  Schedule
as  taxes on lands and buildings. This, however,  cannot  be
accepted.  In this connection, reference may be made to	 the
decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/258508/" id="a_76">Raja Jagannath Baksh Singh v.	 The
State  of U.P. &amp; Anr</a>., [1963] 1 SCR 220 where at p.  229  it
was  indicated	that the expression 'lands' in Entry  49  is
wide  enough  to include agricultural land as well  as	non-
agricultural  land. Gajendragadkar, J. as the learned  Chief
Justice then was, observed that the cardinal rule of  inter-
preting	 the  words used by the Constitution  in  conferring
legislative  power  was	 that these must  receive  the	most
liberal construction and if they are words of wide amplitude
the  construction must accord with it. If general  word	 was
used, it must be so construed so as to extend to all  ancil-
lary  or subsidiary matters that can reasonably be  included
in  it. So construed, there could not be any doubt that	 the
word 'land' in Entry 48, List II of the 7th Schedule
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">708</span>
includes all land whether agricultural or  non-agricultural.
Hence, since the impugned Act imposed tax on land and build-
ing which was within the competence of the State Legislature
and its validity was beyond challenge but the Court observed
that  as there was Entry 46 in List H which refers to  taxes
on agricultural income, it is clear that agricultural income
is  not included in Entry 49. If the State Legislature	pur-
ports to impose a tax on agricultural income it would not be
referable to Entry 49. Mr. Krishnamurthy Iyer relied on	 the
said principle. But in the instant case, royalty being	that
which  is payable on the extraction from the land  and	cess
being  an additional charge on that royalty, cannot  by	 the
parity	of the same reasoning, be considered to be a tax  on
land.  But  since it was not a tax on land and there  is  no
Entry like Entry 46 in the instant situation like the  posi-
tion  before this Court in the aforesaid decision,  enabling
the State to impose tax on royalty in the instant situation,
the  State was incompetent to impose such a tax. There is  a
clear  distinction between tax directly on land and  tax  on
income	arising from land. The aforesaid decision  confirmed
the  above position. In New Manek Chand Spinning  &amp;  Weaving
Mills  Co. Ltd. &amp; Ors., v. Municipal Corpn. of the  City  of
Allahabad &amp; Ors., [1967] 2 SCR 679 at 696, this Court  after
referring to the several decisions observed that Entry 49 of
list  II of the 7th Schedule only permitted levy of  tax  on
land  and  building. It did not permit the levy	 of  tax  on
machinery  contents  in	 or situated on	 the  building	even
though	the machinery was there for the use of the  building
for a particular purpose. Rule 7(2) of the Bombay  Municipal
Corporation Rules was held to be accordingly ultra vires  in
that case. In S.C. Nawn v. W.T.O., Calcutta &amp; Ors., [1969] 1
SCR 108 this Court had occasion to consider this and  upheld
the validity of the <a href="/doc/983571/" id="a_77">Wealth Tax Act</a>, 1957 on the ground	that
it  fell within Entry 86 of List I and not Entry 49 of	List
II.  Construing	 the said Entry, this  Court  observed	that
Entry  49 list II contemplated a levy on land as a unit	 and
the  levy must be directly imposed on land and must  bear  a
definite relationship to it. Entry 49 of list Il was held to
be  more general in nature than Entry 86, list I, which	 was
held  to be more specific in nature and it  is	well-settled
that  in the event of conflict between Entry 86, list I	 and
Entry 49 of list II, Entry 86 prevails as per <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_78">Article 246</a> of
the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_24">    In	Asstt. <a href="/doc/1180216/" id="a_79">Commissioner of Urban Land Tax &amp; Ors. v.	 The
Buckingham  &amp;  Carnatic Co. Ltd</a>. etc., [1970] 1 SCR  268  at
278, this Court reiterated the principles laid down in	S.C.
Nawn's	case (supra) and held that entry 49 of list  II	 was
confined  to a tax that was directly on land as a  unit.  In
Second	Gift  Tax Officer, Mangalore etc. v.  D.H.  Nazareth
etc., [1971] 1 SCR 195 at 200 it was held that a tax on	 the
gift
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">709</span>
of land is not a tax imposed directly on land but only on  a
particular  user,  namely, the transfer of land	 by  way  of
gift. <a href="/doc/1235907/" id="a_80">In Union of India v. H.S. Dhillon</a>, (supra), this Court
approved the principle laid down in S.C. Nawn's case as well
as Nazareth's case (supra). <a href="/doc/198371/" id="a_81">In Bhagwan Dass Jain v. Union of
India</a>, [1981] 2 SCR 808 at 816 this Court made a distinction
between	 the levy on income from house property which  would
be  an	income tax, and the levy on  house  property  itself
which would be referable to entry 49 list II. It is,  there-
fore,  not possible to accept Mr. Krishnamurthy Iyer's	sub-
mission	 and that a cess on royalty cannot possibly be	said
to be a tax or an impost on land. Mr. Nariman is right	that
royalty	 which is indirectly connected with land, cannot  be
said to be a tax directly on land as a unit. In this connec-
tion,  reference may be made to the differentiation made  to
the different types of taxes for instance, one being profes-
sional	tax  and  entertainment tax. <a href="/doc/1212156/" id="a_82">In	 the  Western  India
Theatres  Ltd.	v. The Cantonment Board,  Poona	 Cantonment</a>,
[1959] 2 Suppl. SCR 63 at 69 it was held that an  entertain-
ment tax is dependent upon whether there would or would	 not
be  a show in a cinema house. If there is no show, there  is
no tax. It cannot be a tax on profession or calling. Profes-
sional tax does not depend on the exercise of one's  profes-
sion but only concerns itself with the right to practice. It
appears	 that in the instant case also no tax can be  levied
or  is leviable under the impugned Act if no mining  activi-
ties  are carried on. Hence, it is manifest that it  is	 nor
related to land as a unit which is the only method of valua-
tion of land under entry 49 of list II, but is relatable  to
minerals  extracted. Royalty is payable on a  proportion  of
the  minerals  extracted. It may be mentioned that  the	 Act
does  not  use dead rent as a basis on which land is  to  be
valued.	 Hence, there cannot be any doubt that the  impugned
legislation  in its pith and substance is a tax	 on  royalty
and not a tax on land.
</p><p id="p_25">    On	behalf of the State of Tamil Nadu,  learned  counsel
Mr.  Krishnamurthy Iyer sought to urge that it can  also  be
sustained  under entry 50, list II. Entry 50 of list  II  of
the 7th Schedule deals with taxes on mineral rights  subject
to  limitation	imposed by Parliament  relating	 to  mineral
development.  Entry 23 of List II deals with  regulation  of
mines  and mineral development subject to the provisions  of
list I with respect to regulation and development under	 the
control	 of  the  Union and entry 54 in list  I	 deals	with
regulation of mines and minerals under the control of  Union
declared by the Parliament by law to be expedient in  public
interest.  Even though minerals are part of the	 State	List
they  are  treated separately, and therefore  the  principle
that the specific excluded the general, must be applied. See
the observations of <a href="/doc/228570/" id="a_83">Waverly Jute Mills Co. Ltd. v. Raymon  &amp;
Co</a>. (1) Pvt. Ltd., [1963] 3
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">710</span>
SCR  209 at 220, where it was held that land in entry 49  of
list II cannot possibly include minerals.
    In	this connection, learned Attorney General  appearing
for the Union of India submitted before us that in order  to
sustain the levy, the power of the State Legislature has  to
be found within one or more of the entries of list II of the
7th Schedule. The levy in question has to be either a tax or
a fee or an impost. If it is neither a tax nor a fee then it
should	be under one of the general entries under  List	 II.
The  expression 'land' according to its	 legal	significance
has  an	 indefinite extent both upward	and  downwards,	 the
surface	 of the soil and would include not only the face  of
the earth but everything under it or over it. See the obser-
vations in <a href="/doc/1648125/" id="a_84">Anant Mills Co. Ltd. v. State of Gujarat &amp;  Ors</a>.,
[19751	3 SCR 220 at 249. The minerals which are  under	 the
earth,	can in certain circumstances fall under the  expres-
sion  'land' but as tax on mineral rights is expressly	cov-
ered by entry 50 of list II, if it is brought under the head
taxes under entry 49 of list II, it would render entry 50 of
list  II  redundant. Learned Attorney General  is  right  in
contending  that  entries should not be so construed  as  to
make  any  one entry redundant. It was further	argued	that
even in pith and substance the tax fell to entry 50 of	list
II,  it would be controlled by a legislation under entry  54
of list I.
</p><p id="p_26">    On	the other hand, learned Attorney  General  submitted
that if it be held to be a fee, then the source of power  of
the  state legislature is under entry 66 read with entry  23
of  list  II. Here also the extent to  which  regulation  of
mines and mineral development under the control of the Union
is  declared  by Parliament by law to be  expedient  in	 the
public interest, to the extent such legislation makes provi-
sions  will  denude the State Legislature of  its  power  to
override the provision under entry 50 of list II. In view of
the Parliamentary legislation under entry 54, list I and the
declaration  made under<a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_85"> s. 2</a> and provisions of<a href="/doc/136667771/" id="a_86"> s. 9</a>  of	 the
Act,  the  State  Legislature would be	overridden  to	that
extent.	 S.  2 declares that it is expedient in	 the  public
interest that Union should take under its control the  regu-
lation	of  mines  and the development of  minerals  to	 the
extent	provided therein. In this connection, reference	 may
be  made to the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1464523/" id="a_87">The  Hingir-Rampur
Coal Co. Ltd. &amp; Ors. v. The State of Orissa &amp; Ors</a>., [1961] 2

Our  attention	was drawn to the decision  of  the  division
bench
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">711</span>
judgment of the High Court of Mysore in M/s.  Laxminarayana,
Mining Co., Bangalore v. Taluk Der. Board., AIR 1972  Mysore
</p><p id="p_27">299. There speaking for the court, one of us,  Venkataramiah
J-  of the Mysore High Court, as the learned  Chief  Justice
then was, observed that a combined reading of entries 23 and
50  in list II and entry 54 of list I, establishes  that  as
long as the Parliament does not make any law in exercise  of
its  power under entry 54, the powers of the State  Legisla-
ture  in entries 23 &amp; 50 would be exercisable by  the  State
Legislature.  But when once the Parliament makes a  declara-
tion  by law that it is expedient in the public interest  to
make regulation of mines and minerals development under	 the
control of the Union, to the extent to which such regulation
and development is undertaken by the law made by the Parlia-
ment, the power of the State Legislature under entries 23  &amp;
50  of	List II are denuded. There the court  was  concerned
with the Mysore Village Panchayats &amp; Local Boards Act, 1959.
Thus, it was held that it could not, therefore, be said that
even after passing of the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_90">Central Act</a>, the state legislature
by  enacting<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_91"> s. 143</a> of the Act intended to confer  power  on
the Taluk Board to levy tax on the mining activities carried
on  by the persons holding mineral concessions. It  followed
that  the  levy	 of tax on mining by the Board	as  per	 the
impugned notification was unauthorised and liable to be	 set
aside. At p. 306 of the said report, it was held that royal-
ty  under <a href="/doc/1528522/" id="a_92"> s. 9</a> of the Mines and <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_93">Minerals Act</a> was  really  a
tax.
</p><p id="p_28">    To the similar effects are the observations of the	High
Court  of  Patna in M. Lal &amp; Ors. v. The State	of  Bihar  &amp;
Ors.,  AIR  1965 Patna 491 at 494. Mr.	Krishnamurthy  Iyer,
however,  referred to the decision of this Court  in  H.R.S.
Murthy's  case	(supra). There under the terms of  a  mining
lease  the  lessee worked the mines and won iron-ores  in  a
tract  of  land in a village in Chittor district  and  bound
himself	 to pay a dead rent if he used the leased  land	 for
the extraction of iron ore, to pay a royalty on iron ore  if
it were used for extraction of iron and in addition to pay a
surface	 rent  in respect of the surface  area	occupied  or
used. In the said decision the legislative competence of ss.
78  &amp;  79 of the Madras District Boards Act  was  upheld  by
which  land cess was made payable on the basis	of  royalty.
This Court proceeded on the basis that other cess related to
land and would therefore be covered by entry 49 of list	 II.
It  was	 held that land cess paid on royalty  has  a  direct
relation to the land and only a remote relation with mining.
This,  with respect, seems to be not a correct approach.  It
was  further observed that it was not necessary to  consider
the meaning of the expression 'tax on mineral right' follow-
ing  under  Entry 50 of List II in as much as  according  to
this  Court,  Parliament  has not made any  tax	 on  mineral
rights. This is not a correct basis.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">712</span>
<p id="p_29">    In	H.R.S. Murthy's case (supra), at p. 676 of  the	 re-
port, it was observed by this Court as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_18">	      "When a question arises as to the precise head
	      of  legislative  power under  which  a  taxing
	      statute  has  been  passed,  the	subject	 for
	      enquiry is what in truth and substance is	 the
	      nature  of the tax. No doubt, in a sense,	 but
	      in a very remote sense, it has relationship to
	      mining  as  also to the mineral won  from	 the
	      mine  under  a contract by  which	 royalty  is
	      payable on the quantity of mineral  extracted.
	      But that, does not stamp it as a tax on either
	      the extraction of the mineral or on the miner-
	      al right. It is unnecessary for the purpose of
	      this  case to examine the question as to	what
	      exactly is a tax on mineral rights seeing that
	      such  a tax is not leviable by Parliament	 but
	      only  by the State and the sole limitation  on
	      the  State's power to levy the tax is that  it
	      must not interfere with a law made by  Parlia-
	      ment  as	regards	 mineral  development.	 Our
	      attention was not invited to the provision  of
	      any  such	 law created by Parliament.  In	 the
	      context  of <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_94"> ss. 78</a> and <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_95">79</a> and the  scheme  of
	      those  provisions	 it is clear that  the	land
	      cess is in truth a "tax on lands" within Entry
	      49 of the State List."</blockquote>
<p id="p_30">    It seems, therefore, that attention of the Court was not
invited to the provisions of Mines and Minerals (Development
&amp; <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_96">Regulation) Act</a>, 1957 and<a href="/doc/136667771/" id="a_97"> s. 9</a> thereof. S. 9(3) of the Act
in terms states that royalties payable under the 2nd  Sched-
ule of the Act shall not be enhanced more than once during a
period	of  4 years. It is, therefore, a clear	bar  on	 the
state  legislature taxing royalty so as to in  effect  amend
2nd Schedule of the Central Act. In the premises, it  cannot
be  right to say that tax on royalty can be a tax  on  land,
and even if it is a tax, if it falls within entry 50 will be
ultra  vires the State legislature power in view of<a href="/doc/24448035/" id="a_98"> s.	9(3)</a>
of  the Central Act. <a href="/doc/1464523/" id="a_99">In Hingir--Rampur Coal Co. Ltd. v.	 The
State of Orissa</a> (supra), Wanchoo J. in his dissenting  judg-
ment has stated that a tax on mineral rights being different
from a duty of excise, pertains only to a tax that is  levi-
able for the grant of the right to extract minerals, and  is
not  a	tax  on minerals as well. On that basis,  a  tax  on
royalty	 would	not  be a tax on mineral  rights  and  would
therefore  in  any event be outside the	 competence  of	 the
state legislature.
</p><p id="p_31">    The	 Rajasthan, Punjab, Gujarat and Orissa	High  Courts
have held that royalty is not a tax. See. <a href="/doc/1175621/" id="a_100">Bherulal v.  State

Ors., AIR 1983 Orissa 210.
</p><p id="p_32">    It	was  contended by Mr. Krishnamurthy  Iyer  that	 the
State has a right to tax minerals. It was further  contended
that  if tax is levied, it will not be irrational to  corre-
late  it to the value of the property and to make some	kind
of  annual value basis of tax without intending to  tax	 the
income.	 In  view  of the provisions of the  Act,  as  noted
hereinbefore, this submission cannot be accepted. Mr. Krish-
namurthy  Iyer also further sought to urge that in entry  50
of  list II, there is no limitation to the taxing  power  of
the State. In view of the principles mentioned	hereinbefore
and  the  expressed  provisions of<a href="/doc/1528522/" id="a_102"> s. 9(2)</a> of  the  Mines  &amp;
Minerals (Regulation &amp; <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_103">Development) Act</a>, 1957, this  submis-
sion cannot be accepted. This field is fully covered by	 the
Central legislation.
</p><p id="p_33">    In any event, royalty is directly relatable only to	 the
minerals  extracted  and on the principle that	the  general
provision  is excluded by the special one, royalty would  be
relatable to entries 23 &amp; 50 of list II, and not entry 49 of
list  II.  But as the fee is covered by	 the  Central  power
under entry 23 or entry 50 of list II, the impugned legisla-
tion cannot be upheld. Our attention was drawn to a judgment
of  the High Court of Madhya Pradesh in Miscellaneous  Peti-
tion No. 410/83--M/s Hiralal Rameshwar Prasad &amp; Ors. v.	 The
State of Madhya Pradesh &amp; Ors., which was delivered on	28th
March,	1986  by a Division Bench of the  High	Court.	J.S.
Verma, Acting Chief Justice, as His Lordship then was,	held
that development cess by s. 9 of the Madhya Pradesh Karadhan
Adhiniyam,  1982 is ultra vires. It is not necessary in	 the
view taken by us, and further in view that the said decision
is under appeal in this Court, to examine it in detail.
    In	the  aforesaid	view of the matter, we	are  of	 the
opinion that royalty is a tax, and as such a cess on royalty
being  a  tax on royalty, is beyond the	 competence  of	 the
State Legislature because<a href="/doc/136667771/" id="a_104"> s. 9</a> of the Central Act covers the
field and the State Legislature is denuded of its competence
under  entry  23  of list II. In any event, we	are  of	 the
opinion that cess on royalty cannot be sustained under entry
49  of	list II as being a tax on land. Royalty	 on  mineral
rights	is not a tax on land but a payment for the  user  of
land.
</p><p id="p_34">    Mr.	 Krishnamurthy Iyer, however, submitted that in	 any
event, the decision in H.R.S. Murthy's case (supra) was	 the
decision  of the Constitution Bench of this Court. Cess	 has
been realised on that basis
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">714</span>
for  the  organisation of village and  town  panchayats	 and
comprehensive  programme of measures had been  framed  under
the National Extension Service Scheme to which our attention
was drawn. Mr. Krishnamurthy Iyer further submitted that the
Directive Principle of State Policy embodied in the  Consti-
tution enjoined that the State should take steps to organise
village	 panchayats and endow them with power and  authority
as  may be necessary to enable them to function as units  of
self-Government	 and  as the amounts have been	realised  on
that  basis, if at all, we should declare the said  cess  on
royalty to be ultra vires prospectively. In other words, the
amounts	 that  have  been collected by virtue  of  the	said
provisions, should not be declared to be illegal  retrospec-
tively and the State made liable to refund the same. We	 see
good deal of substance in this submission. After all,  there
was a decision of this Court in H.R.S. Murthy's case (supra)
and  amounts have been collected on the basis that the	said
decision was the correct position. We are, therefore, of the
opinion	 that we will be justified in declaring the levy  of
the  said  cess	 to be ultra vires the power  of  the  State
Legislature prospectively only.
</p><p id="p_35">    In that view of the matter, the appeals must, therefore,
be allowed and the writ petitions also succeed to the extent
indicated  above. We declare that the said cess by  the	 Act
under <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_105"> s.  115</a> is ultra vires and the  respondent  State  of
Tamil  Nadu is restrained from enforcing the same  any	fur-
ther. But the respondents will not be liable for any  refund
of cess already paid or collected. The appeals are  disposed
of  accordingly. The special leave petitions and writ  peti-
tions are also disposed of in those terms. In the facts	 and
the circumstances of the case, the parties will pay and bear
their own costs.
</p><p id="p_36">    OZA, J. While I agree with the conclusions reached by my
learned brother Hon' Mukharji, J. I have my own reasons	 for
the  same. The main argument in favour of this levy  imposed
by the State Legislature is on the basis of Entry 49 in List
II  of the Seventh Schedule conferring jurisdiction  on	 the
State  Legislature. The question therefore to be  determined
is  whether the jurisdiction of the State Legislature  under
Item 49 of List II could be so exercised to impose a cess on
the  royality  prescribed under <a href="/doc/1528522/" id="a_106">Section 9</a> of the  Mines	 and
Minerals (Regulation and <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_107">Development) Act</a>, 1957.
    The entries which are relevant for the purpose of deter-
mining this questions are:
</p><p id="p_37">Entry 54 List I reads:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">715</span>

</blockquote><p id="p_38">The  language of Entries 23 and 50 in List I1  clearly	sub-
jects the authority or jurisdiction on the State Legislature
to  any enactment made by the Parliament. Entry 23 talks  of
regulation and Entry 50 talks of taxes on mineral rights. It
therefore  could  not be disputed that if the  cess  imposed
under  section 115 of the Madras Village Panchayat Act is  a
cess  or tax on mineral rights then that jurisdiction  could
be  exercised  by the State Legislature subject to  the	 law
enacted by the Parliament. The Parliament in <a href="/doc/1528522/" id="a_108">Section 9(1)</a> of
the  Mines  and Minerals (Regulation and  <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_109">Development)	Act</a>,
1957 has fixed the limits of royality on the mining  rights.
It  was therefore contended on behalf of the State  that  in
fact what is imposed under <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_110">Section 115</a> is not a cess on	 the
mining	rights	or on royality but is a tax  on	 land  which
clearly falls within the authority of the State	 legislature
in Entry 49 of List II.

</blockquote><p id="p_46">The  explanation  to sub-clause I is the subject  matter  of
controversy in this case. Sub-clause I provides for levy  of
45 naye paise for every rupee of land revenue payable to the
Government  in the explanation a fiction is created  thereby
even  the  royalty  payable have been  included	 within	 the
definition of "land revenue". As it provides "royalty, lease
amount or any other sum payable to the Government in respect
of  land."  This  phraseology has been	incorporated  by  an
amendment in 1964 by the Madras Village Panchayat  Amendment
Act, 1964 <a href="/doc/1773419/" id="a_117">Section 13</a> wherein the explanation to <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_118">Section	 115</a>
was substituted and substituted retrospectively wherein this
royalty	 has also been included in the definition  of  'land
revenue'  and it is on this ground that it was	mainly	con-
tended	that land revenue being a tax on land is within	 the
authority of the State Legislature under Item 49 of List  II
and therefore the cess which is a tax on land revenue itself
or an imposition on the land revenue and hence could not  be
anything  else but a tax falling within the ambit of tax  on
land  as provided by entry 49 List II and it  was  therefore
contended  that it would not fall within the ambit of  entry
50  List II as if it falls within the ambit of entry  50  of
List  II,  it  would be beyond the authority  of  the  State
legislature as by passing Mines and Minerals (Regulation and
<a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_119">Development) Act</a>, 1957 the Parliament has denuded the  State
Legislature  of	 its  authority to levy any  tax  on  mining
rights.
</p><p id="p_47">    Whether  royality is a tax is not very material for	 the
purpose	 of determination of this question in this case.  It
is  admitted  that royality is charged on the basis  of	 per
unit of minerals extracted. It is no doubt true that mineral
is  extracted from the land and is available, but  it  could
only be extracted if there are three things:
(1) Land from which mineral could be extracted.
(2)  Capital for providing machinery, instruments and  other
requirements.
</p><p id="p_48">(3) Labour
It is therefore clear that unit of charge of royalty is	 not
only land but land + Labour + Capital. It is therefore clear
that  if royalty is a tax or an imposition or a levy, it  is
not  on	 land  alone but it is a levy or a  tax	 on  mineral
(land),	 labour	 and capital employed in extraction  of	 the
mineral. It therefore is clear that royalty if is imposed by
the Parlia-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">719</span>
<p id="p_49">ment  it could only be a tax not only on land but  no  these
three things stated above.
</p><p id="p_50">    It	is  not in dispute that the cess  which	 the  Madras
Village	 Panchayat  Act proposes to levy is nothing  but  an
additional  tax	 and originally it was levied only  on	land
revenue, apparently land revenue would fall within the scope
of  entry 49 but it could not be doubted that royalty  which
is a levy or tax on the extracted mineral is not a tax or  a
levy on land alone and if cess is charged on the royalty  it
could not be said to be a levy or tax on land and  therefore
it  could not be upheld as imposed in exercise of  jurisdic-
tion under Entry 49 List II by the State Legislature.
    Thus it is clear that by introducing this explanation to
<a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_120">Section	 115</a> clause (1) widening the meaning of	 word  'land
revenue'  for the purposes of <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_121">Section 115</a> and <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_122">116</a>. When	 the
Legislature  included Royalty, it went beyond its  jurisdic-
tion under entry 49 List II and therefore clearly is without
the authority of law. But this also may lead to an interest-
ing  situation.	 This cess levied under Section 115  of	 the
Madras Village Panchayat Act is levied for purposes indicat-
ed in the scheme of the Act and it was intended to be levied
on all the lands falling within the area but as this cess on
royalty is without the authority the result will be that the
cess is levied so far as lands other than the lands in which
mines  are situated are concerned but lands where mines	 are
situated  this levy of cess is not in accordance  with	that
law. This anomaly could have been averted if the Legislature
in  this explanation had used words 'surface rent' in  place
of  royalty. Even if the lands where mines are situated	 and
which  are  subject to licence and mining  leases  even	 for
those lands there is a charge on the basis of the surface of
the  land  which is sometimes described as surface  rent  or
sometimes also as 'dead rent'. It could not be doubted	that
if such a surface rent or dead rent is a charge or an  impo-
sition	on  the land only and therefore	 will  clearly	fall
within	the  purview  of entry 49 List H and if	 a  cess  is
levied	on  that it will also be justified as  tax  on	land
falling	 within the purview of entry 49 and it will also  be
uniform as this cess would be levied in respect of the lands
irrespective of the fact as to whether the land is one where
a  mine	 is situated or land which is only  used  for  other
purposes for which land revenue is chargeable.
