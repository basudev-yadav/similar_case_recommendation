HEADNOTE:
    <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_7">Section   2(f)</a>  of	the  Central  Excise   Act   defines
`manufacture',	 to  include  any  process   incidental	  or
ancillary to the completion of a manufactured product.
    The	 President of India promulgated an Ordinance  called
the Central Excises and Salt and Additional Duties of Excise
(Amendment)  Ordinance	1979, which was	 later	replaced  by
<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_8">Central Act</a> VI of 1980, called the Central Excises and	Salt
and  Additional Duties of Excise (Amendment) Act, 1980.	 The
						  PG NO 770
						  PG NO 771
<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_9">Amending  Act</a> became effective from 24th February, 1979.  By
<a href="/doc/678464/" id="a_10">section	 2</a> of the Amending Act, <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_11">Section 2</a> (f) of the  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_12">Excise
Act</a> was amended by adding three sub-items in the  definition
of `manufacture' so as to include activities like bleaching,
dyeing,	 printing  etc. which were held not covered  by	 two
decisions of the Gujarat High Court. Similar amendments were
made  in  items	 19  and  22  of  the  First  Schedule	with
retrospective  effect. <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_13">Section 5(2)(b)</a> of the  Amending	 Act
provided  that	no  suit  or  other  proceedings  shall	  be
maintained or continued in any other Court for the refund of
the  duty collected and no enforcement shall be made by	 any
Court  of any decree or order directing the refund  of	such
duties	of  excise which have been collected and  which	 may
have  been collected, as if the provisions of <a href="/doc/115038149/" id="a_14">Section  5</a>  of
the  Act had been in force on and from the appointed day  as
defined in the Act.
    Prior  to  the  <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_15">Amending  Act</a>, 1980,  the  levy  an	 the
processors, was challenged before the Gujarat High Court  in
the case of vijay <a href="/doc/1905585/" id="a_16">Textiles Mills v.  Union of India</a> nd	Real
Honest Textile v. Union of India, [1979] 4 E.L.E.J. 181. The
Gujarat	 High  Court held that cotton  fabric  subjected  to
bleaching,  dyeing  and printing could not be  subjected  to
excise	duty under items 19 and 22 of the First Schedule  to
the Central Excises and <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_17">Salt Act</a>, 1944, and that  processors
were liable to pay duties under tariff-entry 68 only on	 the
value  added  by that processor. Following this	 judgment  a
large  number of similar claims of  ,processing-houses	were
allowed	 by the High Court by its judgment dated 13.3  1979.
However,  the Bombay High Court, took a different  view	 and
held  that even under the concept of manufacture'  envisaged
in <a href="/doc/678464/" id="a_18">section 2(f)</a> even prior to its amendment, the  operations
carried	 on by the professors amounted to `manufacture'	 and
that,  at  all	events, the matter  was	 placed	 beyond	 any
controversy by the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_19">Amendment Act</a> of 1980.
    The	 judgment of the Gujarat High Court in the  case  of
Vijay Textiles and Real Honest Textiles was considered by  a
Bench  consisting  of three judges of this Court  in  <a href="/doc/39750/" id="a_20">Empire
Industries  v. Union of India</a> [1985] Supp. 1 SCR 292 and  it
was held not to have been decided correctly. The view  taken
by the Bombay High Court in <a href="/doc/1818078/" id="a_21">New	 Shakti Dye Works Pvt.	Ltd.
v. Union of India &amp; Anr</a>. [1983] ELT 1736. was approved.
    The present appeals, by special leave, preferred against
the  judgments	of the High Court of Gujarat  and  the	High
Court  of  Bombay,  and the batch of  writ  petitions  under
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_22">Article	 32</a>  of the Constitution of  India,  involve  common
						  PG NO 772
questions  of  law concerning the validity of  the  levy  of
duties	of  excise  under  tariff-items 19  and	 22  of	 the
Schedule to the Central Excises and <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_23">Salt Act</a> 1944  ("Central
Excise-Act")  as  amended by the Central  Excises  and	Salt
Additional  Duties  Excise (Amendment) 1980  Act  ("<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_24">Amending
Act</a>")  treating as `manufacture' the process  of  bleaching,
dyeing,	  printing,  sizing,  mercerising,   water-proofing,
rubberising, shrink-proofing, organdie processing etc.	done
by  the processors who carry out these operations  in  their
factories  on job-work basis in respect	 of  `cotton-fabric'
and  `Man-made	fabric' belonging to  their  customers.	 The
facts in all the cases are indenticl.
    The	 petitioners/appellants carry out the operations  of
bleaching  dyeing, printing sizing, finishing etc.  of	grey
fabric on job-work against payment of processing charges  to
it  by the customers who are the owners of the	grey-fabric.
The  machinery and equipment installed in  the	petitioners'
factories  are suited for and appropriate to the  processing
of  grey-fabric and are not capable to	manufacturing  grey-
fabric.	 The man-made grey-fabric, such as, Art	 Silk  Grey-
fabric is  manufactured in mills and on power looms and that
latter	is exempt from excise duty on its  manufacture.	 The
Art   Silk   Grey-fabrics  which  are	processed   in	 the
petitioners/appellants	factories are those manufactured  on
power looms and not by the mills and that the Art Silk Grey-
fabric	received do not come from the manufacturers  of	 the
grey-fabric  through the manufacturing-stream but  from	 the
various trader through the sales-stream.
    The	 present writ petitions/appeals also  include  cases
where  the  grey-fabric	 is also purchased by  some  of	 the
processing houses and are sold by them, after processing. In
some cases, the manufacturers of the grey-fabric subject  it
to  captive  consumption  and  process	them  in  their	 own
composite establishments.
    At	the  time of hearing, the correctness  of  the	view
taken  in  the	Empire Industries case	on  certain  aspects
having	been doubted by another Bench of this  Court,  these
appeals/writ  petitions	 were referred to a  Bench  of	five
judges	on two questions namely (1) whether the	  processing
of grey-fabric amounted to `manufacture' within the  meaning
of <a href="/doc/678464/" id="a_25">Section 2(f)</a> as it stood prior to its amendment, and	 (2)
whether, even if such processing did amount to `manufacture'
what  should  be  the  proper  basis  for  determining	 the
assessable value of the processed fabrics.
    In the petitions and appeals, the following points arise
for determination.
						  PG NO 773
    A(i) Whether the process of bleaching, dyeing, printing,
sizing, shrink-proofing etc. carried on in respect of cotton
or  man-made  `grey-fabric'  amount  to	 `manufacture'	 for
purposes,  and	within the meaning of Sect;on  2(f)  of	 the
Central Excises and <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_26">Salt Act</a> 1944 prior to the amendment  of
the said <a href="/doc/678464/" id="a_27">Section 2(f)</a> by section 2 of the Amending Act VI of
1980.
    A(ii) Whether the decision in Empire Industries  Limited
JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">that  these  operations amount to `manufacture'	 is  wrongly
decided and requires reconsideration.
</p><p id="p_2">    (B)	 Whether the amendment brought about by the  Act  of
1980  of <a href="/doc/678464/" id="a_28">Section 2(f)</a> and to tariff-items 19 and 22  of	 the
<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_29">Central	 Excise	 Act</a>  is ultra-vires Entry 84  List  1	and,
therefore, beyond the competence of the Union Parliament.
    Whether, at all events, even if the expended concept  of
manufacture introduced by the Amendment is beyond the  scope
of  Entry 84 List 1, whether the impost is, at	all  events,
referable  to  and supportable by the residual Entry  97  of
List 1.
</p><p id="p_3">    (C)	 Whether,  at all events even if the  amendments  to
<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_30">Central Excise Act</a> are valid, the levy under the  Additional
Duties Act is unsupportable and without the authority of law
as  there is no corresponding enlargement of the  definition
of `manufacture' under the Additional Duties Act.
    (D) Whether the retrospective operation of the  <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_31">Amending
Act</a> is an unreasonable restriction on the fundamental  right
of   the   `processors'	 under	<a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_32">Article	 19(1)(g)</a>   of	 the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_4">    (E)	 Whether,  even	 if the levy is	 justified,  at	 all
events,	 the  computation  of the  assessable-value  of	 the
processed  grey-fabric on the basis of the  whole-sale	cash
selling-price declared under classification list under	Rule
173(b)	is  unjustified	 and  illegal  in  respect  of	 the
assessable  value of the processed grey-fabric done on	job-
work-basis.
</p><p id="p_5">    Allowing the appeals preferred by the Union of India,
    HELD: (Per Majority)
    The appeals preferred by the Union of India are  allowed
and  the Judgment of the Gujarat High Court under appeal  is
						  PG NO 774
set-aside.  The appeals preferred by the processors  against
the judgment of the Bombay High Court and the Writ  Petition
filed	by  the	 processors  directly  in  this	 Court	 are

[810C-D]
    Per	   Sabyasachi	Mukharji,   J.	 (Concurring	with
Venkatachaliah. J.)
    (1) A statutory charge should be measured by the  method
of  its	 computation as laid down in the statute and not  by
any  other   method of computation. The	 circumstances	that
thereby	 the  benefit  of any  computation  granted  by	 the
legislation  may  be lost and that in  some  cases  hardship
might result are not matters which would influence courts on
the Instruction of the statute. A tax payer is entitled only
to such benefit as is granted by the legislature [811C-D]
    (2)	  (i)	Where  a  manufacturer	 sells	 the   goods
manufactured  by him in wholesale to a wholesale  dealer  at
the  arms  length and in the usual course of  business,	 the
wholesale cash price charged by him to the wholesale  dealer
less  trade discount would represent the value of the  goods
for  the  purpose  of assessment of excise.  But  the  price
received by he wholesale dealer who purchases the goods from
the manufacturer and in his turn sells the same in wholesale
to  other dealers would be irrelevant for  determination  of
the  value  of the goods and the goods would be	 charged  on
that basis. [812E-F]
    (2) (ii) The valuation must be on the basis of wholesale
cash  price  at the time when the manufactured	goods  enter
into the open market. The value of the trade-marks is not to
be  taken into account in computing the assessable value  as
the affixation of the trade-marks of a particular brand	 was
extraneous to manufacture. The values of such extraneous  on
additional  factors  do not enter into	the  computation  of
assessable  value  and as such the wholesale cash  price  at
which  the  goods enter into the wholesale market  would  be
independent of the value of the trade-marks.  [812G-H:8134A-
B]
    (2)(iii) The assessable value would, therefore,  include
the  value of the grey cloth in the hands of the  processors
plus  the  value  of the job-work  done	 plus  manufacturing
profits	  and  manufacturing  expenses	whatever  would	  be
included  in  the  price at the factory	 gate.	The  correct
assessable  value  must be the value of the  fabric  at	 the
factory	 gate,	that  is  to say, the  value  at  which	 the
manufactured  goods  leave the factory and  enter  the	main
stream. [813E]
						  PG NO 775
</p><p id="p_6">    3.	Computation of the assessable-value is one  question
and  as	 to who should be liable for the  same	is  another.
Duties of excise are imposed on production or on manufacture
of  goods  and	are  levied upon  the  manufacturer  or	 the
producer  in  accordance with the relevant  rules.  This  is
quite  independent of the ownership of goods. It is,  there-
fore,  necessary  to  reiterate	 that  the  value  for,	 the
assessment  under  <a href="/doc/101389/" id="a_33">Section  4</a> of the Act  will	not  be	 the
processing  charge  along  but the intrinsic  value  of	 the
processed fabric which is the price at which the fabrics are
sold  for the first time in the wholesale market. The  rules
are clear on the computation of that value.[813F-<a href="/doc/766438/" id="a_34">H]

    1(i)  The  prevalent  and  generally  accepted  test  to
ascertain that there is `manufacture' is whether the  change
or the series of changes brought about by the application of
processes   take   the	commodity  to	the   point   where,
commercially,  it can no longer be regarded as the  original
commodity but is, instead, recognised as a distinct and	 new
article	 that  has  emerged as a result	 of  the  processes.
[797E-F]
    1(ii) The view taken in the Empire Industries case	that
`grey-fabrics'	after they undergo the various processes  of
bleaching,  dyeing sizing, printing, finishing etc.  emerges
as  a commercially different commodity with its	 own  price-
structure,  custom and other commercial incidents  and	that
there  was in that sense a `manufacture' within the  meaning
of  <a href="/doc/678464/" id="a_37">Section  2(f)</a>,  even  as  unamended,  is  an   eminently
plausible view and is not shown to suffer from any  fallacy.

</p><p id="p_8">    2(i)  Entries in the legislative lists. are not  sources
of the legislative power but are merely topics or fields  of
legislation and must receive a liberal construction inspired
by  a  broad   and  generous  spirit  and not  in  a  narrow
pedantic sense. The expression "with respect to" in  <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_50">Article
246</a>  brings  in	 the  doctrine	of "Pith  and Substance"  in
the   understanding of	 the  exertion of  the	legislative
power and wherever the question of legislative-competence is
raised, the test is whether the legislation, looked at as  a
whole,	is  substantially `with respect to'  the  particular
topic  of legislation. If the legislation has a	 substantial
and  not  merely  a remote connection with  the	 entry,	 the
matter	may  well be taken to be legislation on	 the  topic.
[799B-D]
    2(ii)  Competence to legislate flows from Articles	245.
246  and the	other Articles following in Part XI of	the
Constitution. In defending the validity of a law  questioned
on ground of legislative-incompetence, the State can  always
show  that  the law was supportable under  any	other  entry
within	 the  competence  of  the  legislature.	 Indeed	  in
supporting  a legislation sustenance could be drawn and	 had
from  a	 number	 of  entries. The  legislation	could  be  a
composite  legislation drawing upon several entries. Such  a
"rag-bag" legislation is particularly familiar in  taxation.

    2(iii) So far as, the exclusive competence of the  Union
Parliament to legislate is concerned, all that is  necessary
is  to find out whether the particular topic of	 legislation
is in List 11 or List 111. If it is not, it is not necessary
to  go any further or search for the field in List 1.  Union
Parliament has exclusive power to legislate upon that  topic
or field. Of course, it has concurrent power also in respect
of the subjects in List 111. [801E-F]
    2(iv)  Even	 if the impost on process is not  one  under
Entry 84, List 1, but Is an impost of `processing'  distinct

which has been declared by court to be invalid provided	 the

judgment  becomes irrelevant and unenforceable, that  cannot
be  called  an impermissible legislative overruling  of	 the

in  a  valid law with retrospective effect in the  light  of
which earlier judgment becomes irrelevant. Such	 legislative
expedience   of	  validation  of  laws	is   of	  particular
significance  and  utility  and is quit	 often	applied,  in
taxing statutes. It is necessary that the legislature should
be  able  to cure defects in statutes.	No   individual	 can

acquire a vested right from a defect in a statute and seek a
wind-fall from the legislature's mistakes. [804G-H; 805A-<a href="/doc/1018531/" id="a_55">C]
    Sri	 Prithvi Cotton Mills Ltd. &amp; Anr. v. Broach  Borough
Municipality &amp; Ors</a>., [1970] 1 S.C.R. 388, referred to.
    4(ii)  Validity  of	 legislations  retroactively  curing
defects	 in taxing statutes is well recognised	and  courts,
except under extraordinary circumstances, would be reluctant
to override the legislative judgment as to the need for	 and
wisdom of the retrospective legislation. [805C]
    4(iii) In testing whether a retrospective imposition  of
a  tax operates so harshly as to violate fundamental  rights
under  <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_56">article	19(1)(g</a>), the  factors	considered  relevant
include the context in which retroactivity was	contemplated
such  as  whether  the law is one of  validation  of  taxing
statute	 struck-down  by  courts for  certain  defects;	 the
period	of such retroactivity, and the decree and extent  of
any  unforeseen or unforeseenable financial  burden  imposed
for   the  past	 period	 etc.  Having  regard  to  all	 the
circumstances  of  the present case, this  court  in  Empire
Industries' case rightly held that the retroactivity of	 the
Amending provisions was not such as to incure any  infirmity
under <a href="/doc/1507561/" id="a_57">Article 9(1)(g).</a> [805E-G]
    5(i)  <a href="/doc/101389/" id="a_58">Section  4</a> of the `<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_59">Central Excise  Act</a>'  envisages
that the value of an article for the purposes of duty  shall
be  deemed to be; (a) the wholesale cash price for which  an
article of the like kind and quality was sold or was capable
of being sold at the time of removal of the article from the
factory	 or  premises  of manufacture for  delivery  at	 the
place  of  manufactures	 or (b) where  such  price  was	 not
,ascertainable	the  price at which an article of  the	like
kind  and  quality as sold or capable of being sold  al	 the
time of removal of the article chargeable with duty [808F-G]
    5(ii)  Consistent with the provisions of <a href="/doc/30102403/" id="a_60">Section  4</a>	 and
the  Central  Excise (Valuation) Rules, 1975,  framed  under
sec.  37 of the Act, it cannot be said that the	 assessable-
value of the processed fabric should	comprise only of the
processing-charges.  this  extreme  contention,	 if accepted,
would  lead to and create more problems than it is  supposed
to  solve,  and	 produce  situations  which  could  only  be
characterised as anomalous. The incidence of the levy should
be  uniform, uninfluenced by fortuitous considerations.	 The
view taken in the matter in Empire Industries case does	 not
call for reconsideration. [809C-D]
						  PG NO 779
    5(iii)   The  question  whether  the  producer  or	 the
manufacturer  is  or is not the owner of the  goods  is	 not
determinative	of   the  liability.   The   essential	 and
conceptional  nature  of  the  tax is  to  be  kept  clearly
distinguished  from both the extent of the power  to  impose
and  the stage at which the tax is imposed. Though the	levy
is  on	the  production or manufacture	of  the	 goods,	 the
imposition  of the duty could be at the stage which the	 law
considers  most convenient to impose as long as	 a  rational
relationship  with  the	 nature of the	tax  is	 maintained.
[806B-D]
    5(iv)  The	nature	of  the excise duty  is	 not  to  be
confused  with, or tested with reference to, the measure  by
which  the  tax	 is assessed. The standard  adopted  as	 the
measure	 of assessment may throw light on the nature of	 the
levy  but  is  not determinative of  it.  When	a  statutory
measure for assessment of the tax is contemplated, it  "need
not  contour  along  the  lines which  spell  out  the	levy
itself',  and "a broader based standard of reference may  be
adopted	 for the purposes of determining the measure of	 the
levy".	Any statutory standard which maintains a nexus	with
the  essential	character of the levy can be regarded  as  a
valid  basis for assessing the measure of the tax.  [808G-H;

    2(i)    The	 words	`levied'  is  a	 wide  and   generic
expression.  One can say with as much  appropriateness	that
the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_62">Income Tax Act</a> levies a tax on income as that the Income
Tax Officer levies the tax in accordance with the provisions
of the Act. It is an expression of wide import and takes  in
all  the  stages of charge, quantification and	recovery  of
duty,  though in certain contexts it may have  a  restricted
meaning. In the context of sub-section (I) the word 'levied'
admittedly  means `charged as well as assessed'.  The  words
`levy and collection' in sub-section (3) cannot be construed
differently  from the words `levied and collected'  used  in
sub-section  (1). <a href="/doc/674513/" id="a_63">Section 3(3)</a>, therefore. also	 covers	 the
entire gomut of<a href="/doc/30194904/" id="a_64"> s. 3(1)</a> and cannot be construed as  becoming
operative at some what later stage. Its operation cannot  be
excluded in determining the scope of the charge. [818F-H]
    2  (ii) Having regard to the nature and content  of	 the
levy  indicated in<a href="/doc/30194904/" id="a_65"> s. 3(1)</a>, it is obvious that<a href="/doc/674513/" id="a_66"> s. 3(3)</a>	has
to  have  the  effect  of attracting  not  only	 the  purely
procedural and machinery provisions of the 1944 Act but also
some of its charging provisions. It is, therefore, difficult
to consider <a href="/doc/30194904/" id="a_67">section 3(1)</a> of the 1957 Act--in contrast to the
<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_68">Finance	 Act</a>  of 1965--as covering the entire ambit  of	 the
charge imposed. In short, the language of<a href="/doc/674513/" id="a_69"> s. 3(3)</a> has to  be
given  a wider meaning than under the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_70">Finance Act</a>,  1965.  A
provision similar to that in<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_71"> s. 80</a> of the Finance Act,	1965
is  also  found in  other <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_72">Finance Act</a>s. On perusal  of these
provisions,  it	 will be found that a like  position  exists
there  also.  These provisions are  all	 self-contained	 and
completely  specify  the  scope of the charge  either  as  a
percentage of the excise duty normally chargeable under	 the
Central	 Excises &amp; <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_73">Salt Act</a>, 1944 or as a percentage of	 the
`assessable  value  determined under<a href="/doc/30102403/" id="a_74"> s. 4</a> of the  1944	Act.
This  is very important reason why the observations  in	 the
Associated  Cement Co. s, case [1985]2 S.C.C. 719 cannot  be
of application in the context of the 1957 Act. [821E-H]

    3(i) Legislatures sometimes take a short cut and try  to
reduce	 the  length  of  statutes  by	omitting   elaborate
provisions  where such provisions have already been  enacted
earlier	 and can be adopted for the purpose on hand.  While,
on  the one hand, the prolixity of modern statutes  and	 the
necessity to have more legislations than one on the same  or
allied topics render such a course useful and desirable, the
attempt to legislate by reference is sometimes overdone	 and
brevity is achieved at the expense of lucidity. However this
legislative  device is quite well known and  the  principles
applicable to it fairly well settled. [823C-D]
						  PG NO 781
    3(ii)  Referential legislation is of two types.  One  is
where  an  earlier  Act	 or  some  of  its  provisions	 are
incorporated  by reference into a later Act. In this  event,
the provisions of the earlier Act or those so  incorporated,
as   they  stand  in  the  earlier  Act	 at  the   time	  of
incorporation,	will be read into the later Act.  Subsequent
changes	 in the earlier Act or the  incorporated  provisions
will have to be ignored because, for all practical  purposes
the  existing  provisions of the earlier Act have  been	 re-
enacted	 by  such reference into the  later  one,  rendering
irrelevant  what happens to the earlier statute	 thereafter.
On the other hand, the later statute may not incorporate the
earlier provisions. It may only make a reference of a  broad
nature	as to the law on the subject generally or contain  a
general	 reference to the terms of an earlier statute  which
are  to be made applicable. In this case  any  modification,
repeal	or re-enactment of the earlier statute will also  be
carried	 into  in  the later, for here,	 the  idea  is	that
certain	 provisions  of	 an  earlier  statute  which  become
applicable  in certain circumstances are to be made  use  of
for the purpose of the later Act also. [823E-H]
    3(iii) Whether a particular statute falls into the first
or  second  category is always a question  of  construction.
[824B]
    In	the  present case, the legislation  falls  into	 the
second	 category.  S.	3(3)  of  the  1957  Act  does	 not
incorporate into the 1957 Act any specific provisions of the
1944 Act. It only declares generally that the provisions  of
the  1944 Act shall apply 'so far as may be"'. that is,	 to
the extent necessary and practical, for the purposes of	 the
1957 Act as well. [824B-<a href="/doc/1334697/" id="a_75">C]

</p><p id="p_12">    3(iv)  The legislation presently in question is  clearly
in  pari  materia  with	 the 1944 Act.	It  is	also  merely
supplemental.  While the 1944 Act imposes a general levy  of
excise duty on all goods manufactured and produced, and	 aim
of  the	 present  Act  is  to  supplement  the	levy  by  an
additional duty of the same nature on certain goods.
</p><p id="p_13">						  PG NO 782
The  duration  of the applicability is	underfined  but	 the
statute	 is  clearly  enforceable as long as it	 is  in	 the
statute book side by side with the normal excise duties. The
clear  intention  is that the same provisions  shall  govern
both the levies except that the duty under the later Act  is
confined  to  certain goods only  und  its  distributability
among the States may perhaps follow a different pattern from
the principal duty. [825B-C]
    3(v) <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_80">The Finance Act</a>s which levied special or regular or
additional  excise  duties contained in themselves  all	 the
elements  of charge or duty. T he goods were  mentioned	 and
the  duty  has to be levied either at a	 percentage  of	 the
normal	excise	duty  payable under the 1944  Act  or  at  a
percentage   of	 the  value  of	 the  assessable  goods	  as
determined  under the 1944 Act. All that was further  needed
was  the applicability of the procedural provisions  of	 the
1944  Act.  However, the 1957 Act is incomplete	 as  to	 the
basis of the charge and its provisions would become  totally
unworkable   unless  the  concepts  of	 'manufacture'	 and
'assessable  value'  as determined under the  1944  Act	 are
carried into it. [825D-F]

with  machinery and plants for processing of man-made  grey-
fabric	 The  machinery	 and  equipment	 installed  in	 the
petitioners  factory?  it  is  averred---and  that  is	 not
disputed  either--are  suited  for and	appropriate  to	 the
processing   of	  Grey-fabric  and  are	  not	capable	  of
manufacturing  Grey-fabric The man-made grey-fabric such  as
Art  Silk  Grey--fabric, it is stated,	is  manufactured  in
mills  and  on power looms and that letter- is	exempt	from
excise duty on its manufacture Petitioners further over that
the  Art  Silk	(Grey-fabrics which  are  processed  in	 the

and  not  by the mills and that the  Art  Silk	(Grey-fabric
received  do  not come from the manufacturers of  the  grey-
fabric	through	 the   manufacturing-stream  but  from	 the
various	 traders through the sales stream.  The	 point	that
the  petitioners seek to made is that the processing of	 the

manufacture   in   the	manufacturing-stream,  but   is	  an
independent and distinct operation carried out in respect of
the  Grey-fabric, after it has left manufacturing-stage	 and
has become part of the common-stock of goods in the  market.
It is also averred that the firm M/s. Ujagar Prints does not
purchase  the Grey-fabric but is only engaged in  processing
it for charges and that in many cases the Grey-fabric  would
have  passed  on from trader to trader	with  the  attendant
increase in the prices with each successive change of  hands
and is entrusted to the petitioner by the last purchaser for
processing against stipulated processing-charges on job work
basis.

						  PG NO 785
therwise fully manufactured man-made fabric and that what is
returned  to  the customers after  processing  continues  to
remain man-made fabric. The imposition of excise duty on the
processor  on the basis of the full-value of  the  processed
material,  which  reflects the value  of  grey-fabrics,	 the
processing-charges,  as well as the selling profits  of	 the
customers  is,	at  once  unfair  and  anamolous,  for,	  in

in the different fact-situations which would be the  logical

do  not processing work for charges on the goods  not  their

under the concept of "manufacture' envisaged in <a href="/doc/678464/" id="a_94">Section 2(f)</a>
even  prior to its amendment, the operations carried  on  by
the  processors amounted to "manufacture" and that,  at	 all

come  up in appeal by Special Leave in Civil Appeal No	6396

</p><p id="p_28">    The	 reasoning  of the Gujarat High Court was  on  these

    "In	 the  instant case, the excise duty claimed  on	 the

manmade	 fabrics  cannot be levied  because,  assuming	that
process	 amounts to manufacture, all that they have done  is
to  manufacture	 processed cloth, processed  fabric,  either
cotton or man-made and that not being a taxable event in the
light  of  <a href="/doc/230008/" id="a_98">Section 3</a> read with <a href="/doc/678464/" id="a_99">section 2(d)</a> of the  Act	 and

vires and contrary to law ..	"
</p><p id="p_29">    This  view, according to the Revenue, was incorrect	 and
caused	 serious  prejudice  to	 the  legitimate   financial
interests  of the State. Accordingly the President of  India
promulgated an Ordinance called the 'Central Excise and Salt
and Additional Duties of Excise (Amendment) Ordinance', 1979
(Central  Ordinance No. 12 of 1979)--sub-sequently  replaced

<a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_102">Section	 2(f)</a>  was concerned, Section of  the  Amending	 Act
introduced   three   sub-items	 in   the   definition	  of
'manufacture'.	Two  of them are material  for	the  present
purpose:
</p><p id="p_30">    "(v) in relation to goods comprised in Item No. 19(1) of

in  <a href="/doc/1818078/" id="a_110">New Shakti Dye Works Pvt. v. Union of India &amp;  Anr</a>.	 was
approved.
</p><p id="p_51">    The	 pronouncement	of this court in  Empire  Industries
case  otherwise	 covers,  and  is  a  full  answer  to,	 the
contentions  raised  in this batch of  cases.  However,	 the
correctness of the view taken in the Empire Industries' case
on  certain  aspects was doubted by another  Bench  of	this
court  and the matter was, accordingly, referred to a  Bench
of five judges.
</p><p id="p_52">    9. It is, perhaps, necessary to refer to the order dated
9.12.1986 made by the Division Bench referring the cases  to
a larger bench. What came before the Division Bench were  WP
12183/1985 (<a href="/doc/194832/" id="a_111">M/s. Ujagar Prints v. Union of India &amp; Ors</a>.) and
CA  Nos. 1685-1766/1979 (Union of India &amp; Ors.	v.  Narendra
Processing  Industries &amp; Ors.). Two questions  arose  before
and  were  examined by the Referring Bench.  The  first	 was
whether	  the	processing  of	 Grey-fabric   amounted	  to
'manufacture' within the meaning of <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_112">Section 2(f)</a> as it stood
prior  to  its amendment. The second question  was  whether,
even  if  such processing did amount to	 'manufacture'	what
should	he the proper basis for determining the	 assessable-
value  of  the processed fabrics. Both these  questions	 had
earlier been examined and answered in the Empire  Industries
case. It is necessary to ascertain as to the precise  points
on which the Empire Industries' decision was required to  be
reconsidered. The Referring Bench did not disagree with	 the
decision in Empire Industries' case on the question  whether
processing'  did  amount  to  'manufacture'.  Indeed,	the
Referring  Bench  appears to have proceeded on	the  premise
that  the view taken in Empire Industries case on the  point
was the correct one. Referring Bench said this on the point:
</p><p id="p_53">    "....  So far as the first question is concerned it	 was
agitated  before  this	Court in Empire	 Industries  Ltd.  v
Union  of  India and this Court held that the  processes  of
bleaching,  mercerising, dyeing,  printing.  water-proofing.
etc. carried out by the processors on job-work basis  amount
to  manufacture both under the Act as it stood prior to	 the
amendment as also under the Act subsequent to the  amendment
and  the  processed  fabrics are liable to  be	assessed  to
excise	duty  in the hands of what may be  called  jobbers'.
Since this was a decision given by a Bench of three  Judges,
the petitioners and appellants who are carrying on  business
of processing on job-work basis could not contend that these
						  PG NO 791
processes  do  not  amount  to	manufacture  and  that	 the
processed  fabrics are not liable to be assessed  to  excise
duty  in  the hands of the jobbers. But, it was	 the  second
question which provoked serious controversy before us . .
    It	is  only on the second question	 touching  valuation
that  it expressed some doubts. Nevertheless, in par.  6  of
the order, the Referring Bench made a further observation to
this effect:
</p><p id="p_54">    ".... Of course, when. ,n se writ petitions and  appeals
are  referred  to the larger Bench it will be  open  to	 the
larger	 Bench	to  consider  not  only	 the   question	  of
determination  of  the assessable value but also  the  other
question,  namely,  whether processing of grey fabric  by  a
processor on job work basis constitutes manufacture, because
the  judgment  in Empire Industries case which	has  decided
this  question	in  favor of the  revenue  and	against	 the
processor is a judgment of a Bench of only three Judges	 and
now the present writ petitions and appeals will be heard  by
a Bench of five Judges ."
</p><p id="p_55">    10.	 This is how the first question which is,  otherwise
concluded by the pronouncement in Empire Industries case  is
sought	to be reagitated before us Out of deference  to	 the
learned	 counsel who vigorously argued this aspect at  great
length	and  we though we should examine the  submission  on
this  point  also, though, the matter could by no  means  be
considered to have been referred to a larger bench.
    On the second question also the matter is within a short
compass.   The	 Referring  Bench   clearly   excluded	 any
possibility  of	 the assessable-value being limited  to	 the
mere  processing-charges.  It contemplated  the	 alternative
possibilities of valuation thus:
</p><p id="p_56">    "It	 was  common  ground between the  parties  that	 the
procedure  followed by the Excise authorities was  that	 the
trader,	 who  entrusted cotton or man made  fabrics  to	 the
processor  for	processing on job-work basis  would  give  a
declaration  to the processor as to what would be the  price
at  which  he would be selling the processed  goods  in	 the
market and that would be taken by the Excise authorities  as
the  assessable	 value of the processed fabrics	 and  excise
duty would be charged to the processor on that basis. This
may be illustrated by giving the following example:
</p><p id="p_57">						  PG NO 792
</p><p id="p_58">    (i)	 Value of grey cloth in the hands of the  processor:
Rs. 20.00
    (2)	 Value of job-work done: Rs.5.00 Value	of  finished
cloth returned to the trader ( 1+2): Rs.25.00
    (3)	 Trader's  selling price inclusive  of	his  selling
profits, etc.: Rs.30.00
    The	 assessable value in the case given in this  example
would be taken by the Excise authorities at Rs.30 which	 was
the sale price of the trader . . .''
    The view of the Referring Bench on the point was this:
    "We cannot accept the contention of the learned  counsel
on  behalf  of the petitioners and the appellants  that	 the
value of the grey cloth which is processed by the  processor
should	not  be	 included in the  assessable  value  of	 the
processed  fabric  since the grey cloth is one	of  the	 raw
materials  which goes into the manufacture of the  processed
fabric	and  the  value of the processed  fabric  cannot  be
computed  without  including the value of the  raw  material
That goes into its manufacture. The assessable value of	 the
processes  fabric cannot therefore be limited merely to	 the
value  of  the job-work done but it must  be  determined  by
reference  to  the  wholesale cash price  of  the  processed
fabric gate of the factory of the processor . . .
    The	 Referring  Bench was of the view that	the  correct
assessable-value should be:
</p><p id="p_59">    ".....	  Thus	in  the	 example  given	 above	 the
assessable value of the processed fabric must be taken to be
Rs.  20 + 5 that is Rs. 25 and the profit of Rs.5 which	 the
trader	may make by selling the processed fabric  cannot  be
included  in  the assessable value. The element	 of  selling
profit of the trader would be entirely an extraneous element
and  it	 cannot	 be taken into account for  the	 purpose  of
determining  the  assessable value of the  processee  fabric
which  would  comprise the value of the grey cloth  and	 the
						  PG NO 793
job-work charges but exclude the profit at which the  trader
may sub-sequently sell the processed fabric."

Chitale	 and Sri Dholakia, learned Senior Advocates  in	 the

character or use."
</p><p id="p_78">    Further,   learned	 counsel   placed   reliance	upon
Tungabhadra Industries' case where it was held that  ground-
nut  oil after the process of hydrogenation  which  improved
its keeping-qualities and shelf life yet remained  basically
ground-nut  oil	 and that the quality of the  oil  had	been
improved  by  the  processes it was subjected  to,  did	 not
detract from its continuing identity as ground-nut oil.	 The
change	brought	 about in the oil, it was observed  by	this
Court,	rendered  it  more acceptable to  the  customers  by
improving  its	quality,  but  did  not	 render	 the  oil  a
commodity other than ground-oil which still continued to  be
"groundnut  oil"  notwithstanding the processing  which	 was
merely for the purpose of rendering the oil more stable thus
improving  its	keeping qualities for those  who  desire  to
consume	 ground-nut  oil. Likewise the	processing  such  as
bleaching,  dyeing. printing, finishing etc., it was  urged,
merely	improved the quality of Grey-fabric and rendered  it
more  acceptable  to the customers while  not  shedding	 its
basic character as 'cotton fabric' or 'man-made fabric'.  It
was  also urged that the affidavits filed by person  engaged
in  and familiar with the textile-trade indicated  that	 the
finished fabric was not a commercially different commodity.
</p><p id="p_79">    14.	 We have carefully considered these submissions.  In
the  Empire Industries case, this court	 considered  similar
submissions  in an almost identical context  and  situation.
Learned	 judges referred to the observations of this  Court
in  Commissioner of Sales Tax UP (Lucknow) v. Harbilas	Rai,
21 STC 17 in which the view expressed by the Division  Bench
of  the	 Madhya	 Pradesh High Court  in	 <a href="/doc/814624/" id="a_134">Hiralal  Jitmal  v.
Commissioner  of  Income-tax</a>,  8 STC 325  at  326  was	held
supportable on the reasoning that:
</p><p id="p_80">    "  .  . . The decsion of the Madhya Pradesh	 High  Court
might  perhaps be justified on the ground that a printed  or
dyed cloth is commercially different article from the  cloth
which is purchased and printed or dyed."
</p><p id="p_81">						  PG NO 797
    The Division Bench also referred to, with approval,	 the
decision  of the Bombay High Court in <a href="/doc/91201/" id="a_135">Kores (India)  Limited
v. Union of India and Ors</a>., [1982] 10 ELT 253. The  Division
Bench noticed the question arising for decision:
</p><p id="p_82">    "Fabric  itself means woven materials. It was  contended
that processing the manufactured fabric does not bring	into
existence  any new woven material but the question is:	does
new and different goods emerge having distinctive name,	 use
and character?"
</p><p id="p_83">    Answering, the Bench said:
</p><p id="p_84">    "It appears in the light of the several decisions and on
the  construction  of  the expression that  the	 process  of
bleaching,  dyeing  and printing etymologically	 also  means
manufacturing processes ..	'
</p><p id="p_85">    15. It is strenuously urged for the processors that	 the
view  taken by the Division Bench in the  Empire  Industries
case suffers from fallacies both of reasoning and conclusion
and requires to be reconsidered.
</p><p id="p_86">    The	 prevalent and generally accepted test to  ascertain
that  there  is 'manufacture' is whether the change  or	 the
series	of  changes  brought about  by	the  application  of
processes   take   the	commodity  to	the   point   where,
commercially,  it can no longer be regarded as the  original
commodity but is, instead, recognised as a distinct and	 new
article	 that has emerged as a result of the processes.	 The
principles  are	 clear.	 But  difficulties  arise  in  their
application in individual cases. There might be	 border-line
case  where  either conclusion with equal  justification  be
reached.  Insistence on any sharp or  intrinsic	 distinction
between processing' and 'manufacture, we are afraid, results
in  an over simplification of both and tends to	 blur  their
interdependence	 in  cases  such as  the  present  one.	 The
correctness of the view in the Empire Industries case cannot
be tested in the light of material--in the form of affidavit
expressing  the opinion of persons said to be engaged in  or
connected  with	 the  textile-trade  as	 to  the  commercial
identity of the commodities before and after the processing-
</p><p id="p_87">-placed	 before	 the  court in	a  sub-sequent	case.  These

question.
</p><p id="p_88">						  PG NO.798
</p><p id="p_89">    16.	 On a consideration of the matter, we are  persuaded
to  think that the view taken in the Empire Industries	case
that 'Grey fabric' after they undergo the various  processes
of  bleaching,	dyeing,	 sizing	 printing,  finishing	etc.
emerges	 as a commercially different commodity with its	 own
price-structure,  custom and other commercial incidents	 and
that  there  was in that sense a  'manufacture'	 within	 the
meaning of <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_136">Section 2(f)</a>, even as unamended, is an  eminently
plausible view and is not shown to suffer from any  fallacy.
Indeed,	 on this point the Referring bench did not  disagree
or have any reservations either. It is to be noticed that if
the amending law is valid, this aspect becomes academic.
    We think, we should reject Contention (a).
</p><p id="p_90">    17. Re: Contention (b)
    The concept of manufacture' embodied in Entry 84 of List
I,  it	is urged, should be construed not in  an  artificial

artificial  dimensions	sought to be imparted to it  by	 the
amendment  would  be  impermissible.  Learned  counsel	drew
attention  to  the following observations of this  Court  in
<a href="/doc/777743/" id="a_137">Diamond Sugar Mills v. State of UP</a>, [1961] 3 SCR 242 at 248.
</p><p id="p_91">    ".....	 we have, on the one hand, to bear  in	mind

permissible.  It  is submitted the  concept  manufacture  in
Entry  84 List I has a well accepted legal connotation	 and
in  construing	the entry the precise connotation  which  it
possesses and conveys in law must be kept in mind. There  is
in law no 'manufacture' unless as a result of the process  a
new  and  commercially distinct product	 with  distinct	 use
emerges.  The  idea of manufacture might imply	change,	 but
every	change	is  not	 necessarily  manufacture.  It	 is.
accordingly,  contended	 that the amendment which  seeks  to
equate	"processing "with "manufacture" is beyond the  scope
of Entry 84 List I.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">						 PG NO. 799</span>
<p id="p_93">    18.	 In the Empire Industries' case a  similar  argument
was urged but without success. Learned Judges were  persuaded
to  the view that such processes which were referred  to  by
the amendment were not so alien or foreign to the concept of
'manufacture' that they could not come within that concept.
    Entries  to the legislative lists, it must be  recalled,
are  not  sources of the legislative power  but	 are  merely
topics	or fields of legislation and must receive a  liberal
construction inspired by a broad and generous spirit and not
in a narrow pedantic sense. The expression "with respect to"
in   <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_138">Article  246</a>  brings-in  the  doctrine  of	 "Pith	 and
Substance"  in	the  understanding of the  exertion  of	 the
legislative power and wherever the question of	legislative-
competence  is raised the test is whether  the	legislation,
looked at as a whole, is substantially 'with respect to' the
particular  topic of legislation. If the legislation  has  a
substantial  and  not merely a remote  connection  with	 the
entry, the matter may well be taken to be legislation on the
topic.
</p><p id="p_94">    In Empire Industries case, it was held:
</p><p id="p_95">    "As has been noted processes of the type which have been
incorporated  by  the  impugned Act were  not  so  alien  or
foreign	 to the concept of "manufacture ' that	these  could
not come within that concept."
</p><p id="p_96">    19. At all events, even il the impost on process is	 not
one under Entry 84, list l, but is an impost on 'processing'
distinct from "manufacture" the levy could yet be  supported
by  Entry  '97. List l, even without the aid  of  the  wider
principle recognised and adopted in Dhillon's case AIR	1972
SC l061. It was, however, contended that the levy of tax  on
an  activity  which  cannot reasonably	be  regarded  as  an
activity  of 'manufacture' cannot be described as a levy  of
duties	of  excise under Entry 84, List I. If it is  a	non-
descript  tax under Entry 97, the Parliament, it  is  urged,
has  not  chosen1 to enact any such law in  this  case.	 The
charging  section  does	 not,  it is  urged.  bring  such  a
taxable-event to charge. This argument was noticed in Empire
Industries case thus:
</p><p id="p_97">    "  ..	It was then argued that if the	legislation
was sought to be defended on the ground that it is a tax  on
activity like processing and would be covered by the  powers
enumerated under Entry 97 of List I of the Seventh  Schedule
						  PG NO 800
then it was submitted that there was no charging section for
such an activity and as such the charge must fail, and there
cannot be any levy ..	"
</p><p id="p_98">    The contention was rejected holding:
</p><p id="p_99">    "....	  This	argument  proceeds  on	 an   entire
misconception. The charging section is the charging  <a href="/doc/76749005/" id="a_139">section
3</a>  of the Central Excises and <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_140">Salt Act</a>, 1944. It  stipulates
the levy and charge of duty of excise on all excisable goods
produced or manufactured. "Manufactured" under the Act	after
the  amendment	would  be the 'manufacture'  as	 amended  in
<a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_141">section	 2(f)</a>  and Tariff item 19-I and 22  and	 the  charge
would  be  on  that  basis. Therefore  it  is  difficult  to
appreciate  the argument that the levy would fail  as  there
will  be  no appropriate charging section or  machinery	 for
effectuating  the  levy on the activity like the  method  of
processing  even if such an activity can be justified  under
Entry  97 of List l of Seventh Schedule. We are,  therefore,
of the opinion that there is no substance in this contention
    We respectfully agree.
</p><p id="p_100">    20. If a legislation purporting to be under a particular
legislative  entry  is	assailed for  lack  of	legislative-
competence, the State can seek to support it on the basis of
any  other  entry within the legislative competence  of	 the
legislature. It is not necessary for the State to show	that
the  legislature, in enacting the law,	consciously  applied
its mind to the source of its own competence. Competence  to
legislate  flows  from	 <a href="/doc/574894/" id="a_142">Article 245</a><a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_143">,  246</a>,  and  the  other
Articles  following,  in  Part XI of  the  Constitution.  In
defending  the	validity of a law questioned  on  ground  of
legislative-incompetence, the State can always show that the
law  was  supportable  under  any  othe	 entry	within	 the
competence  of	the  legislature.  Indeed  in  supporting  a
legislation sustenance could be drawn and had from a  number
of entries. The legislation could be a composite legislation
drawing	 upon several entries. Such a "rag-bag"	 legislation
is particularly familiar in taxation.
</p><p id="p_101">    Bennion in his "Statutory Interpretation" (at page	644)
refers such a composite legislation, though the observations
must  be under-stood in the context of the supremacy of	 the
British Parliament and one of unlimited powers and which is,
under	no   inhibitions  unlike  a   federal	polity,	  of

to  go any further or search for the field in List I.  Union
Parliament has exclusive power to legislate upon that  topic

    This  pertains  to the validity of	levy  of  additional
duties. The contention proceeds on the pre-supposition	that
processing  does not amount to 'manufacture'  under  Section
3(1)  of the Additional Duties Act. If it does, as has	been
held on point (a), this argument does not survive at all.
    The	 point,	 however, sought to be put across  is  that,
even if the concept of 'manufacture' for purposes of levy of
excise	duty  under  the '<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_148">Central  Excise  Act</a>'	 is  validly
expanded  or  that  a  tax  on	processing  is,	  otherwise,
						  PG NO 802
supportable  under  Entry  97(1),  the	position  under	 the
'Additional Duties Act' ;s quite different. The	 'Additional

definition of 'Manufacture' in <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_149">Section 2(f)</a> of the  '<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_150">Central

contain a definition of 'manufacture' in the broad terms  in
which <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_151">Section 2(f)</a>, as amended, contains. The result is,  it
is   urged,   that  the	 ordinary   legal   connotation	  of
'manufacture', contained in the charging <a href="/doc/30194904/" id="a_152">Section 3(1)</a> of the
'Additional  Duties Act' can alone support the levy.  It  is
not,  it is urged, permissible to import the artificial	 and
expanded  definition of 'manufacture' containing in  <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_153">Section
2(f)</a>, as amended, into Section 3(1) of the Additional Duties

the wider definition of 'manufacture' in <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_158">Section 2(f)</a> to  be

						  PG NO 803
consideration  of  the validity of the	levy  of  additional
duties.	 But on a closer examination of the concept of,	 and
the scheme for, levy and collection of the additional duties
and the specific statutory provisions, the tensile  strength
of  the	 argument  breaks  down.  There	 are  at  least	 two
circumstances  which render the definition of  'manufacture'
under  <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_159">Section	2(f)</a>  attracted to  the	 additional  levies.
Section 3(3) of the Additional Duties Act provides:

they  apply  in relation to the levy and collection  of	 the
duties of excise on the goods specified in sub-section (l) .

in  the "<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_160">Central Excise Act</a>" apply in relation to 'levy	 and
collection'  of	 the  additional  duties.  The	question  is
whether this provision is sufficient to attract <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_161">Section 2(f)</a>
of the main Act as amended. This, in turn, depends upon what
the expression "levy" connotes and carries with it. The term
'levy'	it  is	held, is an expression of  wide	 import.  It
includes   both	 imposition  of	 a  tax	 as  well   as	 its
quantification	and  assessment. <a href="/doc/6759/" id="a_162">In Assistant  Collector  of

    There  is really no substance in the grievance that	 the
retroactivity  imparted	 to the amendments is  violative  of
<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_164">Article	 19  [</a>l]  (g). A Competent  legislature	 can  always
validate  a  law  which has been declared by  courts  to  be
invalid,  provided the infirmities and	vitiating  infactors
noticed	 in the declaratory-judgment are removed  or  cured.
Such a validating law can also be made retrospective. If  in
the  light of such validating and curative exercise made  by
the Legislature-granting legislative competence--the earlier
judgment  becomes irrelevant and unenforceable, that  cannot
						  PG NO 805
be  called  an impermissible legislative overruling  of	 the
judicial decision. All that the legislature does is to usher
in  a  valid law with retrospective effect in the  light  of
which earlier judgment becomes irrelevant. (<a href="/doc/1018531/" id="a_165">See Sri  Prithvi
Cotton	Mills Ltd. &amp; Anr. v. Broach Borough  Municipality  &amp;
Ors</a>., [1970] 1 SCR, 388)
    Such legislative expedience of validation of laws is  of
particular  significance  and  utility and  is	quite  often
applied,  in  taxing  statutes. It  is	necessary  that	 the
legislature  should be able to cure defects in statutes.  No
individual  can	 acquire a vested right from a defect  in  a
statute and seek a windfall from the legislature's mistakes.
Validity  of  legislations retroactively curing	 defects  in
taxing statutes is well recognised and courts, except  under
extraordinary circumstances, would be reluctant to  override
the  legislative judgment as to the need for and  wisdom  of
the retrospective legislation. In Empire Industries  Limited
&amp;  Ors. Etc. v. Union of India &amp; Ors. Etc., [ 19851 l  Supp.
292 at 327 this court observed:
</p><p id="p_128">    ".....  not only because of the  paramount	governmental
interest  in obtaining adequate revenues, but  also  because
taxes  are not in the nature of a penalty or  a	 contractual
obligation  but rather a means of apportioning the costs  of
government amongst those who benefit from it".
In  testing  whether  a retrospective imposition  of  a	 tax
operates  so harshly as to violate fundamental rights  under
Article	 l9(1)(g), the factors considered  relevant  include
the context in which retroactivity was contemplated such  as
whether	 the  law  is one of validation	 of  taxing  statute

    There is no merit in contention (d) either.
</p><p id="p_129">26. Re: Contention (e)
    This  concerns  the question of the correctness  of	 the
determination  of the assessable-value. The  processors	 say
that  they have filed classification lists under rule 173  B
						  PG NO 806
of  the Central Excises and Salt Rules 1944 as they  had  no
other	choice	and  that  if  the  proper   principles	  of
determination of the assessable-value do not legally justify
the consequences flowing from the classification, it is open
to   them   to	 contend  against  the	 validity   of	 the
determination and they are not estopped from doing so.
    Duties  of	excise	are imposed  on	 the  production  or
manufacture of goods and are levied upon the manufacturer or
the producer in respect of the commodity taxed. The question
whether	 the producer or the manufacturer is or is  not	 the
owner  of the goods is not determinative of  the  liability.
The essential and conceptual nature of the tax is to be kept
clearly	 distinguished from both the extent of the power  to
impose and the stage at which the tax is imposed. Though the
levy  is on the production or manufacture of the goods,	 the
imposition  of the duty could be at the stage which the	 law
considers  most	 covenient to impose as long as	 a  rational
relationship with the nature of the tax is maintained.
</p><p id="p_130">    27.	 The processors contend that,  the  assessable-value
could only be the job-work charges received by them for	 the
processing  of 'Grey-fabric' and cannot be the selling-price
at  which  the	customer who entrusts the  Grey	 fabric	 for
processing  ultimately sells it in the market. Such a  sale-
price, it is said, would, quite painly. include the value of
the  Grey  fabric,  the	 processing-charges  and  also	 the
selling-profit of the customer. Even in regard to the  price
of  the	 Grey fabric itself which comes to  the	 processing-
houses	in fully manufactured condition would  again  depend
upon  how  many	 hands it has changed  before  reaching	 the
particular  customer  who brings them  for  processing.	 The
determination	of   assessable-value  at  the	 actual	  or
hypothetical  selling-price  of	 goods of  like	 nature	 and
quality	 in  the wholesale market would	 include  the  post-
manufacturing	profits	  of   the   trader   which   cannot
legitimately be regarded as part of the assessable-value.
</p><p id="p_131">    28.	 This contention was considered in detail in  Empire
Industries  case [ 1985] 1 Supp. SCR 293 at 327	 wherein  it
was held:
</p><p id="p_132">    "When the textile fabrics are subjected to the processes

4</a>  of  the  Central Excise Act will not	 be  the  processing
charges	 alone	but  the intrinsic value  of  the  processed

include	  the  value  of  grey	fabrics	 supplied   to	 the
independent  processors for the processing. However,  excise
duty,  if  any, paid on the grey fabrics will be  given	 pro
forma  credit to the independent processors to	be  utilised
for the payment on the processed fabrics in accordance	with
the  Rules  56A or 96D of the Central Excise Rules,  as	 the
case may be."

The principles for the determination of assessable-value are
laid  down  under  <a href="/doc/30102403/" id="a_170">section 4</a> of the Act. <a href="/doc/30102403/" id="a_171">Section  4</a>  of	 the
Central	 Excise Act' envisages that the value of an  article
for  the  purposes of duty shall be deemed to  be;  (a)	 The

and  quality  was sold or was capable of being sold  at	 the
time of removal of the article from the factory or  premises

not  determinative  of	it. When a  statutory	measure	 for
assessment of the tax is contemplated, it "need not  contour
						  PG NO 809
along  the lines which spell out the levy itself.",  and  "a
broader	 based standard of reference may be adopted for	 the
purposes  of  determining  the measure	of  the	 levy."	 Any

</p><p id="p_145">    30. In the case of processing-houses, they become liable
to  pay excise duty not because they are the owners  of	 the
goods but because they cause the 'manufacture' of the goods.
The  dimensions	 of the <a href="/doc/174615438/" id="a_172">Section 4(1)(a)</a> and  (b)  are  fully
explored in number of decisions of this Court. Reference may
be made to the case of Bombay Tyres International.
    Consistent	with  the provisions of <a href="/doc/30102403/" id="a_173">Section	 4</a>  and	 the
Central Excise (Valuation) Rules, 1975, framed under <a href="/doc/102791117/" id="a_174">Section
37</a> of the Act it cannot be said that the assessable-value of
the processed fabric should comprise only of the processing-
charges. This extreme contention if accepted, would lead  to
and  create more problems than it is supposed to solve;	 and
produce	 situations  which could only  be  characterised  as
anomalous.  The	 incidence of the levy	should	be  uniform,
uninfluenced  by  fortuitous considerations. The  method  of
determination  of  the	assessable-value  suggested  by	 the
processors  would lead to the untenable position that  while
in one class of Grey-fabric processed by the same  processor
on   bailment,	the  assessable-value  would  have   to	  be
determined differently dependent upon the consideration that
the   processing-house	had  carried  out   the	  processing
operations  on job-work basis, in the other class of  cases,
as it not unoften happens, the goods would have to be valued
differently  only for the reason the  same  processing-house
has  itself  purchased the Grey-fabric and  carried-out	 the
processing operations on its own.
</p><p id="p_146">It is to solve the problem arising out of the  circumstances
that goods owned by one person are "manufacture ' by another

</p><p id="p_150">    SABYASACHI	MUKHARJI,  J. I have had  the  advantage  of
reading in draft the judgment proposed to be delivered by my
learned brother Venkatachaliah, J. I respectfully agree with
him. There is, however, one aspect of the matter in  respect
of which I would like to say a few words. Contention (e)  as
noted  by my learned brother in his judgment deals with	 the
determination of the assessable-value. The processors in the
cases  before  us say that they	 have  filed  classification
lists under rule 173B of the Central Excises and Salt Rules,
1944  as  they had no other choice and that  if	 the  proper
principles  of determination of the assessable-value do	 not
legally	  justify   the	 consequences	flowing	  from	 the
classification	it  is open to them to contend	against	 the
validity of the determination and they are nOt estopped from
doing  so. The processors are right in contending  that	 the
true  principle	 should	 be  followed  in  determining	 the
assessable-value. Then what is the true principle? <a href="/doc/30102403/" id="a_177">Section 4</a>
of  the Act deals with the valuation of excisable goods	 for
purposes of charging of duty of excise. <a href="/doc/30102403/" id="a_178">Section 4</a> [l] (a) of
the Act stipulates that the value should be subject to other
provisions of the Section the normal price thereof, that  is
to say, the price at which such goods are ordinarily sold by
the assessee to a buyer in the course of wholesale trade for
delivery  at the time and place of removal, where the  buyer
						  PG NO 811
is  not	 a  related  person  and  the  price  is  the	sole
consideration for the sale. For the present purpose, we	 are
not concerned with the provisos nor the situation where	 the
normal price of goods is not ascertainable for any reason.
    In	Empire Industries Limited &amp; Others etc. v. Union  of
India  and Others etc., L [1988] Suppl. S.C.R. 292,  it	 was
held  that where for the purpose of  calculating  assessable
value, a notional sum is laid down by the legislature to  be
arrived	 at one a certain basis, it is not  permissible	 for
the  courts  to	 engraft  into it  any	other  deduction  or
allowance  or  addition or read it down on  the	 score	that
unless	the  said  deduction or	 allowance  or	addition  is
authorised elsewhere in the Act or in the Rules. A statutory
charge	should	be  measured  by  the  method  of  its	 own
computation as laid down in the statute and not by any other
method	of computation. The circumstances that	thereby	 the
benefit	 of any exemption granted by the legislation may  be
lost  and that in some cases hardship might result  are	 not
matters which would influence courts on the construction  of
the statute. A tax payer is entitled only to such benefit as
is  granted by the legislature. It was emphasised  that	 the
taxation  under	 the  Act is the rule and  the	benefit	 and
exemption, the exception. And it was held that there was  no
hardship in these cases. It was further reiterated that when
the  textile  fabrics are subjected to	the  processes	like
bleaching,   dyeing   and  printing  etc.   by	 independent
processes,  whether on their own account or on	job  charges
basis,	the  value  for the  purposes  of  assessment  under
<a href="/doc/30102403/" id="a_179">section	 4</a>  of	the  Central Excise  Act  will	not  be	 the
processing  charge  alone  but the intrinsic  value  of	 the
processed  fabrics which is the price at which such  fabrics
are sold for the first time in the wholesale market. That is
the  effect  of	 <a href="/doc/30102403/" id="a_180">section  4</a> of	the  Act.  The	value  would
naturally include the value of grey fabrics supplied to	 the
independent  processors for the processing.  However  excise
duty,  if  any,	 paid  on the grey  fabrics  will  be  given
proforma credit to the independent processors to be utilised
for the payment on the processed fabrics in accordance	with
the relevant rules.
</p><p id="p_151">    <a href="/doc/194832/" id="a_181">In	M/s. Ujagar Prints v. Union of India</a>, [1986]  Suppl.
S.C.C.	652  Bhagwati  C.J.  held  that	 the  processes	  of
bleaching, dyeing, printing, mercerising etc. carried on  by
a  processor  on job-work basis in respect  of	grey  cotton
fabrics	 and manmade fabrics belonging to the  customer	 and
entrusted  by him for processing amount to manufacture	with
the  meaning  of  the Act prior to its amendment  so  as  to
attract levy of excise duty on the processed fabrics and  in
any  event, after the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_182">Amendment Act</a>, these processes  amount
to manufacture and excise duty is leviable on the  processed
fabrics. The learned Chief Justice also dealt with the other
						  PG NO 812
question, namely, what is the value of the processed fabrics
liable	to be assessed. Referring to the aforesaid  decision
of  the	 Empire	 Industries,  (supra),	he  illustrated	 the
problem by reference to the example set out in the  judgment
(Page  654  of	the  report at	para  2).  In  that  example
illustrated by him the value of the grey cloth in the  hands
of  the processor was Rs.20. The value of the  job-work	 was
Rs.5.  B  Trader's selling price inclusive  of	his  selling
profits etc. was put at Rs.30. Bhagwati C.J. at page 655  of
the  report  observed  that  the  assessable  value  of	 the
processed fabric must obviously be taken to he the wholesale
cash price of the processed fabric at the factory gate	that
is  when  the  processed fabric leaves the  factory  of	 the
processor and it cannot possibly include the selling  profit
of the trader who subsequently sells the processed  fabrics.
The learned Chief Justice reiterated that it is at the point
when  the  processed  fabric  leaves  the   factory  of	 the
processor that its assessable value has to be determined and
that  assessable value cannot include the selling profit  of
the trader. Empire Industries, (supra) did not say that	 the
post-manufacturing profits or post-manufacturing costs could
be included in the assessable-value of the processed fabric.
If  the trader who entrusted cotton or man-made	 fabrics  to
the processor for processing on job-work basis, would give a
declaration  to the processor as to what would be the  price
at  which  he would be selling the processed  goods  in	 the
market that would be taken by the Excise authorities as	 the
assessable-value  of the processed fabrics and	excise	duty
would  be  charged to the processor on that basis.  Where  a
manufacturer   sells  the  goods  manufactured	by  him	  in
wholesale  to a wholesale dealer at the arms length  and  in
the  usual  course  of business, the  wholesale	 cash  price
charged	 by him to the wholesale dealer less trade  discount
would  represent the value of the goods for the	 purpose  of
assessment of excise But the price received by the wholesale
dealer who purchases the goods from the manufacturer and  in
his turn sells the same in wholesale to other dealer,  would
be  irrelevant for determination of the value of  the  goods
and  the goods would not be charged on that basis. This	 has
been explained in <a href="/doc/766438/" id="a_183">Atic Industries Ltd. v. H.H. Dave</a>.  Asstt.
Collector of Central Excise and Ors., [ 1975] 3 S.C.R . 563.
This  has also been explained in Union of India &amp; Ors.	etc.
etc. v. Bombay Tyre International Ltd. etc. etc. . [1984]  l
S.C.R.	347  at	 375.  It has  to  he  reiterated  that	 the
valuation  must be on the basis of wholesale cash  price  at
the  time  when the manufactured goods enter into  the	open
market.	 See in this connection the ratio of this  Court  in
<a href="/doc/882769/" id="a_184">Union of India and Ors. v. Cibatul Ltd</a>., [ 1985] Suppl 3 SCR
95  and the <a href="/doc/1364847/" id="a_185">Joint Secy. to the Govt of India &amp; Ors. v.	Food
Specialities   Ltd</a>.,  11985]  Suppl  3	SCR  165.   It	 was
emphasised in Union of India &amp; Ors. v. Cibatul, (supra) that
the  value of the trade-marks was not be taken into  account
						  PG NO 813
in  computing the assessable value as the affixation of	 the
trade-marks   of  a  particular	 brand	was  extraneous	  to
manufacture.  The  values of such extraneous  or  additional
factors	 do  not enter into the	 computation  of  assessable
value  and  as such the wholesale cash price  at  which	 the
goods  enter into the wholesale market would be	 independent
of  the	 value of the trade-marks. So that cannot  be  taken
into the computation of the assessable value. Similarly,  in
the case of <a href="/doc/1364847/" id="a_186">Joint Secretary to the Govt. of India and others
v.  Food  Specialities Ltd</a>., (supra), it was held  that	 the
value of Nestle's trade marks could not be to the  wholesale
price  charged by the dealer to Nestle's for the purpose  of
computing the value of the goods manufactured. The goods  in
both  these  cases were manufactured  independently  of	 the
addition  of  the  trade-marks. The  price  thereof  at	 the
factory gate was not after taking into account the value  of
the  trade-marks. If that was the position the value of	 the
trade-marks  cannot  be added to the  wholesale	 cash  price
charged	 by  the  dealer.  Affixation  of  trade-marks	 for
enhancement  of	 the  value thereof  is	 extraneous  to	 and
independent  of the process of manufacture. The charges	 for
the  same  are not part of the assessable value	 and  cannot
enter  into computation of the whole-sail cash price on	 the
basis of which excise duties ale to be levied.
    In	the  aforesaid view of the law and tor	the  reasons
mentioned by my learned brother, l agree with his answer  to
this  contention.  The assessable  value  would.  therefore.
include	 the  value of the grey cloth in the  hands  of	 the
processors  plus  the  value  of  the  job-work	 done	plus
manufacturing  expenses	 whatever would be included  in	 the
price  at  the	factory gate. The correct  assessable  value
must be the value of the fabric at the factory gate, that is
to  say,  the value at which manufactured  goods  leave	 the
factory and enter the main stream.
</p><p id="p_152">    One more aspect will have to be reiterated.	 Computation
of the assessable-value is one question and as to who  would
be  liable  for the same is another. Duties  of	 excise	 are
imposed	 on production or the manufacture of goods  and	 are
levied	upon the manufacturer or the producer in  accordance
with  the relevant rules. This is quite independent  of	 the
ownership of goods. It is, therefore. necessary to reiterate
that  the value for the assessment under section of the	 Act
will  not be the processing charge alone but  the  intrinsic
value  of the processed fabrics which is the price at  which
the  fabrics  are sold for the first time in  the  wholesale
market.	 The  rules  are clear on the  computation  of	that
value.	If the valuation is made according to the  rules  as
adumbrated in Empire Industries (supra) and as clarified  by
my  learned  brother in this judgment no  difficulty  should
arise.
</p><p id="p_153">						  PG NO 814
    RANGANATHAN,  J. I agree but I should like to add a	 few
words on two of the points argued before us.
    First,  I  should  like to clarify	the  nature  of	 the
decision in Hindustan Milkfood Manufacturers Ltd. v.  Union,
(the  HMM  case) 1980 E.L.T. 480 (to which I was  a  party),
since learned counsel for the petitioners sought to rely  on
my  judgment in that case as supporting his contention	that
the  Union cannot seek to uphold the amendment presently  in
question  by reference to Entry 97 of List I in the  Seventh
Schedule  to the Constitution. In that case, the Delhi	High
Court was concerned with the interpretation of the amendment
to<a href="/doc/30102403/" id="a_187"> S. 4</a> of the Central Excises and <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_188">Salt Act</a>, 1944 by Act  22
of   1975.   The  pre-amendment	  section   postulated	 the
determination  of excise duty on the basis of the  wholesale
cash  price  of the excisable goods at "the  factory  gate";
and,  an  explanation  provided that,  in  determining	this
price, no abatement or deduction shall be allowed in respect
of trade discount and the amount of duty payable at the time
of  the	 removal of the goods from the	factory.  The  post-
amendment  section  made certain changes in the	 concept  of
sale  at  the  factory gate  by	 excluding  therefrom  sales
effected  in  favour  of a category of	persons	 defined  as
"related persons" with which we are not concerned here.	 The
amendment  also	 defined  the assessable "value"  so  as  to
include packing charges but to exclude the amount of  excise
duty,  sales tax and other taxes as well as trade  discount.
The  question  was  whether  this  amendment  precluded	 the
deduction,  from the wholesale factory gate price, of  post-
manufacturing  expenses and profits. The question  had	been
answered by several High Courts in the negative	 principally
on  the ground that the duty sought to be levied  under	 the
Act was an excise duty, the very nature of which required  a
proximate connection with production or manufacture and that
what had passed beyond this region and entered the domain of
sale could not pass as excise duty. Counsel for the Union of
lndia.	with  a	 view  to  overcome  these  decisions,	 had
contended  that	 since	Entry 97 of List I  in	the  Seventh
Schedule  to the Constitution enabled Parliament to enact  a
legislation  even  beyond  the purview	of  an	excise	duty
covered by Entry 84 of that list, the Court should not	read
into  the  amended  section the limitations  that  had	been
considered inherent in the section before its amendment.  It
was  in repelling this contention that certain	observations
were  made by me in paras 30 to 32 of the judgment to  which
Sri  Soli Sorabjee drew our attention. It will, however,  be
clear  from  the discussion in the  paragraphs	referred  to
that the contention was repelled not on the ground that	 the
legislature  could  not make a wider levy  by  reference  to
Entry  97 but only on the ground that the  history,  context
and  language  of the amendment did not	 warrant  the  wider
interpretation.	 This will be clear from the  following	 two

    "Mr.  Chandrasekharan's  contention ..	 that  the
language  of  the new section should be	 given	an  enlarged
scope and interpretation by relating it to Entry 97 of	List
I  of Seventh Schedule cannot, in our opinion, be  accepted.
We  do not think, in considering this amendment, that it  is
necessary  for us to discuss whether, if Parliament were  to
enact  a  law imposing on goods manufactured or	 produced  a
duty  based not only on the manufacturing cost/profits,	 but
also including in the dutiable value the whole or some part,
post  manufacturing cost/profits, such a law would be  intra
vires or not: because it appears to us that no such law	 has
been  enacted  in  this	 case.	We  shall  assume  with	 Mr.
Chandrasekharan, that in view of Entry 97 in the Union	List
under the Constitution, it is open to and competent for	 the
legislature to expand or even modify the nature of the levy.
The question, however, will be whether it has done so."
It  was concluded, after referring to the previous  position
as  well  as the statement of objects and  reasons  for	 the
amendment,   that  there  was  nothing	to  show  that	 the
legislature  had intended to make ally change and  that	 the
rule against a presumption of implicit alteration of the law
should	be invoked in the context. In other words,  the	 HMM
decision was based not on the scope of legislative Entry  97
in  List  1 but on the language and scope of  the  amendment
actually  effected.  It	 was  considered  not  necessary  or
possible  to stretch the language of the definition in<a href="/doc/30102403/" id="a_189"> s.  4</a>
beyond	the  ambit  of the provision as	 delineated  in	 the
earlier	 decisions.  The question decided was not  that	 the
legislature could not, but that it did not, make any radical
change in the nature of the levy.
</p><p id="p_155">    The	  position  considered	in  the	 HMM  case  may	  be
illustrated by an analogy. Entry 82 in List I of the Seventh
Schedule  to the Constitution permits the enactment, by	 the
Union  Legislature,  of	 a  law	 relating  to  taxation	  of
'income.  The entry does not restrict such laws only to	 the
income of a 'previous year', though this was the pattern  of
the  prevelent <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_190">Income Tax Act</a>s activated by  annual  <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_191">Finance
Act</a>s.  Between	1948  and 1955, however,  the  <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_192">Finance	Act</a>s
purported  to impost a tax on "excess dividends"  which,  in
brief,	was  a tax on dividends declared out of	 profits  of
past years. The effect of these enactments was considered by
the  Bombay High Court as well as this Court. <a href="/doc/1092578/" id="a_193">In  C.I.T.  v.
Elphinstone Spinning &amp; Weaving Mills Co. Ltd</a>., [1960] 3	 SCR
953,  this  Court  held that the language  of  the  relevant
provision  in the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_194">Finance Act</a>s was so framed that  it  could
not  be read as an independent charging section. It will  be
appreciated  that the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_195">Finance Act</a>s were also  enactments  of
the  Union  Legislature and a taxation of profits,  even  of
past  years, by an independent and specific enactment  could
certainly have been brought within the scope of Entry 97, if
not Entry 82 itself. Nevertheless, the enactments were	held
ineffective not because they could not but because they	 did
not  contain the words necessary to effectuate	the  result.
The  position  in  the HMM case was  somewhat  similar.	 The
legislature retained the levy on the basis of the  wholesale
cash price at the factory gate as before and only introduced
a  definition  of the expression 'value' in terms  a  little
more  elaborate but basically not very different  from	what
had been contained in the earlier section. The Court saw  no
reason to read into the language of the amended provision  a
meaning much wider that had been attributed to the provision
before its amendment. The amendment gave no indication that,
contrary  to  what  had been decided  earlier,	it  was	 the
intention  of the legislature to bring into  the  assessable
value even an element of post manufacturing cost/profit.
</p><p id="p_156">						  PG NO 816
    But	 here  the  position  is  entirely  different.	 The
amendment has specifically enlarged the meaning and  concept
of  the	 word  "manufacture". If such  extended	 concept  is
within	the  range of duties of excise	as  envisaged  under
Entry  84-and  I agree that with my  learned  brothers	that
is-,  there is no difficulty. But, if,	as contended for  by
Sri Sri Soli Sorabjee, that legislative entry permits a duty
levied with on the process of 'manufacture", stricto  sensu,
and  the  processing in this case cannot be  brought  within
that  definition  then this expended  definition  cannot  be
fitted into that entry. Nevertheless the specific  statutory
definition cannot be ignored and it it cannot be held  valid
by reference to Entry 84, its validity has to be  considered
with reference to the residuary Entry 97. The definition  of
manufacture  in a limited sense. It explictly  enlarges	 the
scope  of  the	levy  of  excise duty  and,  if	 it  is	 not
permissible  to	 bring it within the scope of  Entry  84,  a
resort	to  Entry  97  cannot be  ruled	 out.  In  my  view,
therefore, there is nothing in the decision in the HMM	case
that  supports the contention  of the petitioners have	that
the  amendment of the definition of "manufacture" cannot  be
						  PG NO 817
sustained by reference to Entry 97 of List I in the  Seventh
Schedule  to  the  Constitution of India, if  it  cannot  be
upheld as falling under the purview of Entry 84.
    The second point, on which I feel inclined to add a	 few
words  is  in  regard to the contention	 on  behalf  of	 the
petitioners  that the definition of the	 term  "manufacture"
enacted in the Central Excises &amp; <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_196">Salt Act</a>, 1944 as  enlarged
by <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_197">Amendment Act</a> 6/80, cannot be read into the provisions of
the  Additional	 Duties of Excise Act (No.  58),  1957.	 The
argument is in three phases and runs thus:
</p><p id="p_157">    (i)<a href="/doc/76749005/" id="a_198"> S. 3</a> of the 1957 Act, which is the charging section,
fastens the charge of duty at the state of 'manufacture out
this e expression is deliberately left undefined, though the
statute	 takes	special	 care  in<a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_199"> s. 2</a>	to  adopt,  for	 its
purposes, the definition of the specified goods as contained
in   the   1944	 Act.  This  excludes  the   definition	  of
'manufacture'  enacted in<a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_200"> s. 2(f)</a> of the 1944  and  enlarged
from time to time .
</p><p id="p_158">    (ii)<a href="/doc/674513/" id="a_201"> S. 3(3)</a> cannot help the Revenue in this regard,  as
its  only  purpose and effect is to avoid a  repetition.  in
this  Act of the procedural provisions of the 1944 Act.	 The
charge or imposition of the tax having been said under<a href="/doc/76749005/" id="a_202"> S.  3</a>
[1], the purpose of .S. 3(3) is only to say that this charge
shall  be  qualified, demanded of the 1944  Act.  This	sub-
section cannot be read as having the effect of incorporating
the substantive definition of "manufacture" in the 1944	 Act
particularly  when <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_203"> s.	2</a>  chose  to  incorporate  only	 the
definition  of the specified goods as contained in the	1944
Act.
</p><p id="p_159">    [iii]  Even	 if the language of<a href="/doc/76749005/" id="a_204"> S. 3</a>( 3 )  is  construed
more liberaly, it will be effective with only to incorporate
the definitions contained in the  1944 Act as on the date of
commencement  of  the  1957  Act  but  not  its	  subsequent
legislative expansions.
</p><p id="p_160">    In my opinion. there is no warrant or justification	 for
giving such a narrow interpretation to the wide language  of
s. 3[3] of the 1957 Act. Learned counsel for the petitioner,
in  advancing  this  argument, apparently has  in  mind	 the
famous	dictum of Lord Dunedin in Whitney v. Inland  Revenue
Commissioners, [1927] A.C. .7 echoed in several decisions of
this Court and of the various High Courts in India:
</p><p id="p_161">						  PG NO 818
    "Now, there are three stages in the imposition of a tax:
there  is the declaration of liability, that is the part  of
the statute which determines what persons in respect of what
property   are	liable.	 Next,	there  is  the	 assessment.
Liability does not depend on assessment. That, ex hypothesi,
has  already been fixed. But assessment	 particularizes	 the
exact sum which a person liable has to pay. Lastly come	 the
methods	  of  recovery,	 if  the  person  taxed	  does	 not
voluntarily pay."
</p><p id="p_162">The  argument,	founded on the	above  figurative  analysis,
seeks  to equate the expressions "levy and collection"	used
in <a href="/doc/674513/" id="a_205"> s.	3(3)</a> with the stages of	 assessment  and  collection
concerned with the procedure for quantification and recovery
of a duty that has already been imposed. The first stage  of
"charge", according to counsel, has already been dealt	with
in  the	 first	sub-section of<a href="/doc/76749005/" id="a_206"> s. 3</a>, which  has	 fastened  a
charge on the production of manufacture of specified  goods.
The  third  sub-section,  it is said, only  relates  to	 the
quantification	or recovery of the charge imposed  under <a href="/doc/30194904/" id="a_207"> s.
3(1)</a> . I do not see any force in this argument.
    In the first place, even<a href="/doc/30194904/" id="a_208"> s. 3(1)</a> which, according to the
counsel,  is  the  charging section,  uses  the	 same  words
"levied and collected. These are the same as the words	used
in  <a href="/doc/1405898/" id="a_209">Article  265</a>  of  the  Constitution,  which	 have	been
interpreted as comprehending the entire process of  taxation
commencing  from  the imposition of the tax  by	 enacting  a
statute	 to the actual taking away of money from the  pocket
of a citizen. They take in every stage in the entire process
of  taxation.  The  words "levied" is  a  wide	and  generic
expression.  One can say with as much  appropriateness	that
the  Income tax Act levies a tax on income as that  the	 the
Income	Tax  Officer levies the tax in accordance  with	 the
provisions  of the Act. It is an expression of	wide  import
and  takes in all the stages of charge,	 quantification	 and
recovery  of duty, though in certain contexts it may have  a
restricted  meaning. In the context of sub-section  (1)	 the
word  "levied"	admittedly  means  "charged  "	as  well  as
"assessed.  The words "levy and collection'  in	 sub-section
(3)  cannot be construed differently from the  words  levied
and  collected used in sub-section (1). S. 3(3),  therefore,
also  covers  the  entire gomut of<a href="/doc/76749005/" id="a_210"> s. 3</a> (1)  and  cannot  be
construed  as becoming operative at a somewhat later  stage.
Its operation cannot be excluded in determining the scope of
the charge.
</p><p id="p_163">						  PG NO 819
    In this context, reference has to be made to a  decision
of  this  Court which had to consider  a  provision,  almost
identical  with	<a href="/doc/674513/" id="a_211"> S. 3(3)</a> of the 1957 Act, appearing  in	 the
<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_212">Finance	 Act</a>  1965, in a somewhat indirect  manner,  as	 the
decision contains some observations, which, at first  sight,
appear	to  support the line of argument of  the  petitioner
herein.	 Such a provision has been annually repeated in	 all
<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_213">Finance	 Act</a>s--vide, the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_214">Finance Act</a> from 1963 to  1983--and
imposes	 what has been described as "special", "regular"  or
"auxiliary" duties of excise and customs. The decision I  am
referring to is that of this Court in <a href="/doc/1517094/" id="a_215">Associated Cement	 Co.
Ltd.  v.  Director of Inspection</a>, [1985] 2 SCC	7  19.	This

</p><p id="p_169">						  PG NO 820
Section	 280  ZD  of the Income Tax  Act,  1961	 enabled  an
assessee, in certain circumstances, to obtain a "tax credit"
certificate  in	 respect of a percentage of  the  amount  of
"duty  of  excise  payable by him."  "Duty  of	excise"	 was
defined by the section to mean "the duty of excise  leviable
under  the  Central Excises &amp; <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_220">Salt Act</a>".  The  question	 was
whether the tax credit could also be given in respect of the
amount	of the special duty of excise levied  and  collected
under the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_221">Finance Act</a>.	This Court held that, obviously, the
special	 duty  levied under<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_222"> s. 80</a> could not be	regarded  as
having been levied under the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_223">Central Excise Act</a>. It said:
</p><p id="p_170">    "It	 is  true  that	 the  expression  'leviable'  is  an
expression   of	  wide	import	and   includes	 stages	  of
quantification	and recovery of the duty but in the  context
in which that expression has been used in clause (b) of sub-
section (6) of s. 280 ZD, it is clear that it has been	used
in  the sense of chargeability to duty. In other words,	 the
duty  of excise in respect whereof tax credit  is  available
would be in respect of such duty of excise as is  chargeable
under the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_224">Excise Act</a> and clearly the Special excise duty  in
respect	 whereof  additional  tax credit is  sought  by	 the
appellant company is not chargeable under the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_225">Excise Act</a> but
chargeable under the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_226">Excise Act</a>."
</p><p id="p_171">    Having said this, the Court added:
</p><p id="p_172">    "'Sub-clauses  [3] and (4) of<a href="/doc/105251258/" id="a_227"> s. 8</a>() of the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_228">Finance	 Act</a>
on  which  reliance  has  been placed  by  counsel  for	 the

</p><p id="p_173">The  above  observations no doubt lend some support  to	 the
contention of the petitioner, as the wording of<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_232"> s. 80(4)</a>  of
the  1965 <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_233">Finance Act</a> is identical with that of<a href="/doc/674513/" id="a_234"> s. 3(3)</a>	 and
has  been  interpreted	as attracting  only  the  procedural
aspect	of the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_235">Central Excise Act</a>. But in my opinion,  while
that  may  have been true of<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_236"> s. 80(4)</a> of  the  Finance	Act,
1965,  it  will not be correct to draw the  same  conclusion
about  the 1957 Act. For,<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_237"> s. 80(1)</a> of the Finance Act,	1965
fully exhausted the aspect of charge of the special duty. It
						  PG NO 821
specified the goods to be taxed and also laid down that	 the
special	 duty  was to be a percentage of the  normal  excise
duty chargeable on those goods. Nothing else remained except
the quantification and the collection. But here the position
is  different. There are three ingredients of  the  charging
provision  viz. s. 3(1). The additional duties	are  charged
</p><p id="p_174">(a)  on	 manufacture, storage of production (b)	 of  certain
named  goods  (c)  at  the  rates  specified  in  the  first
schedule.  Of  these, only aspect (b) finds mention  in	 the
t957 Act but in relation to the definitions contained in the
1944  Act.  Aspect (c), clearly is not	complete  without  a
reference  to  the  main  Act. For,  turning  to  the  First
Schedule  of the Act, originally it specified rates  on	 the
basis  of  length,  weight or number  on  all  items  except
"cigarettes"  where  the  duty was to  be  ad  valorem.	 <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_238">The
Amendment Act</a>, No. 6 of 1980, substituted the rate per metre
specified  under  the original schedule in  respect  of	 the
items  with which we are concerned to ad valorem rates.	 Now
the  assessable	 value is to be determined on the  basis  of
which the special duty will have to be worked out cannot  be
found out from the 1957 Act which contains no definition  or
indication  in	this regard. The statute  cannot  be  worked
atleast	 in  respect of goods where an ad  valorem  rate  is
prescribed  unless <a href="/doc/76749005/" id="a_239"> s. 3(l)</a> is read with<a href="/doc/76749005/" id="a_240"> s. 3</a>(3	 )  and	 the
definition  of "assessable value" in<a href="/doc/82982698/" id="a_241"> s. 14</a> of the  1944	 Act
is  read with the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_242">Finance Act</a>. In like manner, I think.	 the
content of aspect (a) cannot be understood differently from,
or independently of, the  definition in the main enanctment.
Having	regard	to  the	  nature and  content  of  the	levy
indicated in s 3(1), it is obvious that<a href="/doc/674513/" id="a_243"> s. 3(3)</a> has to	have
the effect of attracting not only the purely  procedural and
machinery  provisions of the 1944 Act but also some  of	 its
charging provisions. It is, therefore difficult to  consider
<a href="/doc/30194904/" id="a_244">section	 3(1)</a> of the 1(1957 Act--in contrast to the  <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_245">Finance
Act</a>  of	 1965---As covering the entire ambit of	 the  charge
imposed. In short, the language of s. (3) has to he given  a
wider  meaning	than  under the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_246">Finance Act</a>,  1985.  I	have
referred to the fact that a provision similar to that in <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_247"> s.
80</a>  of the Finance Act, 1965 is also found in other  <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_248">Finance
Act</a>s. On perusal of  these provisions, it will be found that
a like position exists there also. These provisions are	 all
self-contained	and  completely	 specify the  scope  of	 the
charge	either as a percentage of the excise  duty  normally
chargeable under the Central Excises &amp; <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_249">Salt Act</a>, 1944 or  as
a percentage of the 'assessable value determined under<a href="/doc/30102403/" id="a_250"> s.  4</a>
of  the	 1944 Act.' This, in my view, is  a  very  important
reason	why the observations in the Associated Cement  Co.'s
case (supra) cannot be of application in the context of	 the
1957 Act.
</p><p id="p_175">    A  question	 has been raised as to why, if it  were	 the
intention  of the Legislature to take in all the  provisions
						  PG NO 822
including  definitions from the 1944 Act, it was  considered
necessary to make a specific reference to the definitions of
the various goods on which additional duty was being imposed
as  contained in the schedule to the 1944 Act. Counsel	says
that  this enactment of specific definitions drawn from	 the
1944  Act  should  lead	 to  an	 inference  that  no   other
definitions  from that Act were intended to be	incorporated

the  Central Excises &amp; <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_261">Salt Act</a>,  1944	vide  items  (ii-a),
</p><p id="p_178">(vii), (viii), (ix). (x) and (xi). Thus, it was always clear
that  the specified goods have to be understood in  the	 way
they  were defined in the Central Excises &amp; <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_262">Salt Act</a>,  1944.
The idea in 1956 was to restrict the powers of the States to
levy sales tax in respect of such goods and other goods.  In
1958,  the  idea  was conceived of  the	 Centre	 levying  an
additional  excise duty on these goods and distributing	 the
same  to  the States subject to the condition  specified  in
Schedule  II  that such States did not impose  any  sale  or
purchase tax on these commodities. Subsequently, perhaps. it
was realised that<a href="/doc/61089437/" id="a_263"> s. 7</a> served no specific purpose under	 the
Act  except  that  of the definitions which  was  an  aspect
						  PG NO 823
already covered by<a href="/doc/118035528/" id="a_264"> s. 2(c)</a>. In these circumstances, not much
significance need be attached to<a href="/doc/118035528/" id="a_265"> s. 2(c)</a> much less can it be
construed as negativing the import of other definitions from
the 1944 Act.
</p><p id="p_179">    The	 next  question	 that  arises  for  considerion	 is,
whether,  even	assuming  that	the terms  of <a href="/doc/674513/" id="a_266"> s.  3(3)</a>	 are
applicable, its terms are wide enough to take in not  merely
the  provisions of the Central Excises and &amp; <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_267">Salt Act</a>,	1944
and, in particular its definition clauses, as they stood  in
1957 on the date when the 1957 Act came into force but	also
the  amendments	 effected  therein from time  to  time.	 The
answer to this question depends upon the general  principles
applicable to what is described as 'referential legislation'
of which this is an instance. Legislatures sometimes take  a
short  cut  and	 try to reduce the  length  of	statutes  by
omitting  elaborate  provisions where such  provisions	have
already	 been  enacted earlier and can be  adopted  for	 the
purpose	 on hand. While, on the one hand, the  prolixity  of
modern	statutes and the necessity to have more	 legislation
then  one on the same or allied topics render such a  course
useful and desirable, the attempt to legislate by  reference
is sometimes everdone and previty is achieved at the expense
of lucidity. However, this legislative device is  quite well
known  and  the	 principles applicable	to  it	fairly	well
settled.
</p><p id="p_180">    Referential legislation is of two types. One is where an
earlier	 Act or some of its provisions are  incorporated  by
reference into a later Act. In this event, the provisions of
the  earlier Act or those so incorporated, as they stand  in
the  earlier Act at the time of incorporation, will be	read
into the later Act. Subsequent changes in thc earlier Act or
the   incorporated  provisions	will  have  to	be   ignored
because, for all practical purposes, the existing provisions
of  the earlier Act have been re-enacted by  such  reference
into  the later one,  rendering irrelevant what	 happens  to
the earlier statute thereafter. Examples of this can be seen
in  <a href="/doc/1334697/" id="a_268">Secretary  of State v. Hindustan  Cooperative  Insurance
Society</a>, AIR 1931 P.C. 149; <a href="/doc/1370552/" id="a_269">Solani Ores Ltd. v.	 State</a>,	 AIR
1975  S.C. 17 and <a href="/doc/1000517/" id="a_270">Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. v.	 Union</a>,	 AIR
1979  S.C.798. On the other hand, the later statute may	 not
incorporate  the  earlier  provisions. It may  only  make  a
reference  of  a  broad nature as to thc law  on  a  subject
generally, as in Bhajiyu v. Gopikabai. [1978] 3 SCR 561;  or
contain	 a  general  reference to the terms  of	 an  earlier
statute	 which are to be made applicable. In this  case	 any
modification, repeal or re-enactment of the earlier  statute
will  also be carried into in the later, for here, the	idea
is  that  certain  provisions of an  earlier  statute  which
become	applicable in certain circumstances are to  be	made
use  of for the purpose of the latter Act also. Examples  of
						  PG NO 824
this  type  of legislation are to be seen  in  <a href="/doc/1193965/" id="a_271">Collector  of
Customs	 v. Nathella Sampathu Chetty</a>, [1962] 3 SCR 786;	 <a href="/doc/838980/" id="a_272">New
Central Jute Mills Co. Ltd. v. Assistant Collector</a>, [1971] 2
SCR  92	 and  Special  Land  Acquisition  Officer  v.	City
Improvement  Trust, [1977] 1 SCR 569. Whether  a  particular
statute falls into the first or second category is always  a
question  of construction. In the present case, in my  view,
the  legislation falls into the second category. S. 3(3)  of
the  l957  Act does not incorporate into the  1957  Act	 any
specific  provisions  of  the 1944  Act.  It  only  declares
generally  that the provisions of the 1944 Act	shall  apply
"so  far  as may be", that is, to the extent  necessary	 and
practical, for the purposes of the 1957 Act as well.
    That  apart,  it  has been held, even  when	 a  specific
provision  is incorporated and the case apparently falls  in
the  first  of	the above categories,  that  the  rule	that
repeals, modifications or amendments of the earlier Act will
have  to be ignored is not adhered to incertain	 situations.
These  have  been  set out in <a href="/doc/1721191/" id="a_273">State  of	 Madhya	 Pradesh  v.
Narasimhan</a>. [ 1976] 1 SCR 6. In that case. the Supreme Court
was	considering the question whether the amendment of<a href="/doc/1052367/" id="a_274"> s.
21</a>  of	the Penal Code by the <a href="/doc/258943/" id="a_275">Criminal	Law  Amendment	Act</a>.
195X, was also applicable for purposes of the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_276">Prevention  of
Corruption  Act</a>, 1947, which by <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_277">section 2</a> incorporates,	 for
the purposes of that Act, the definition of `public servant'
in  s 2l<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_278"> of the Penal Code</a>. Answering thc (question  in	 the
affirmative, the Court outlined the following proposition:
</p><p id="p_181">    "Where  a  subsequent Act incorporates provisions  of  a
previous  Act.	then  the  borrowed  provisions	 become	  an
integral and independent part of the subsequent Act and	 are
totally	 uneffected  by	 any  repeal  or  amendment  in	 the
previous  Act This principle. however will not apply in	 the
following, cases:
</p><p id="p_182">    (a)	 where the subsequent Act and the previous  Act	 are
supplemental to each other;
</p><p id="p_183">    (b) where the two Acts are in pari materia:
</p><p id="p_184">    (c)	 where	the amendment in the previous  Act,  if	 not
imported  into	the subsequent Act also,  would	 render	 the
subsequent Act wholly unworkable and uneffectual; and
</p><p id="p_185">    (d)	 where	the amendment of the  previous	Act,  either
						  PG NO 825
expressly  or  by  necessary intendment,  applies  the	said
provisions to the subsequent Act. "
</p><p id="p_186">    The	 present  case	falls  within  the  scope  of  these
exceptions,  even if<a href="/doc/674513/" id="a_279"> s. 3(3)</a> is construed  as  incorporating
certain	 specific provisions of	 the 1944 into	itself.	 The
legislation presently in question is clearly in pari materia
with the 1944 Act. It is also merely supplemental. While the
1944 Act imposes a general levy of excise duty on all  goods
manufactured and produced, and aim of the present Act is  to
supplement the levy by an additional duty of the same nature
on  certain  goods.  The duration of  the  applicability  is
undefined but the statute is clearly enforceable as long  as
it  is	in  the statute book side by side  with	 the  normal
excise	duties.	 The  clear  intention	is  that  the	same
provisions shall govern both the levies except that the duty
under  the later Act is confined to certain goods  only	 and
its  distributability among the States may perhaps follow  a
different  pattern  from  the principal duty.  There  is  no
reason	or logic why all the incidents attaching  under	 the
earlier	 legislation,  in  so &amp;r as  they  are	not  clearly
inconsistent  with the later one should not be	extended  to
the  later  legislation	 as well. As has  been	pointed	 out
earlier, the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_280">Finance Act</a>s which levied special or regular or
additional  excise  duties contained in themselves  all	 the
elements of charge of duty. The goods were mentioned and the
duty  as to be levied either at a percentage of	 the  normal
excise duty payable under the 1944 Act or at a percentage of
the  value of the assessable goods as determined  under	 the
1944 Act. All that was further needed was the  applicability
of the procedural provisions of the 1944 Act Here,  however,
the 1957 Act is incomplete as to the basis of the charge and
its  provisions would become totally unworkable	 unless	 the
concepts   of  "manufacture"  and  "assessable	value?'	  as
determined under the 1944 Act are carried into it.
    In	the circumstances, I agree that we should give	full
and literal effect to the language of<a href="/doc/674513/" id="a_281"> s. 3(3)</a> and hold	that
it  has	 the effect not only of	 attracting  the  procedural
provisions   of	 the  1944  Act	 but  also  all	 its   other
provisions, including those Containing the definition.
