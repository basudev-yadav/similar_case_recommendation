INTRODUCTION


      Interpretation of <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_1">Section 31</a> of the Copyright Act, 1957 (for the

sake of brevity, hereinafter referred to as, `the Act') is involved in these

appeals.

</p><p id="p_4">      We may notice the factual matrix of the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
BACKGROUND FACTS



      First respondent is one of the leading music companies engaged in

the production and/or acquisition of rights in sound recordings. It has

copyright over a series of cassettes and CDs commonly known as T-

series. It has copyrights in cinematographic films and sound recordings.

Appellant M/s. Entertainment Network (India) Ltd. (ENIL) broadcasts

under the brand name "Radio Mirchi".           It is a leading FM radio

broadcaster. Disputes and differences arose between Bennett Coleman &amp;

Co. Ltd., the holding company of the first respondent and Phonographic

Performance Ltd. (PPL) as regards the playing of the songs of which

copyrights belongs to the first respondent in their FM radio network.

Appellant is a company which holds licence for running FM radio

stations in various cities across India.
</p>
<p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">      Free-to-Air private      FM Radio       Broadcasting   is   a recent

phenomenon in India and the basic content of any radio station,

presently, is only sound recordings, i.e., songs.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  4</span>


</p><p id="p_8">      Disputes and differences having arisen between the parties in

regard to broadcast of the songs in respect whereof the first respondent

holds a copyright as owner thereof or by reason of purchase of the

copyright belonging to others.
</p>
<p id="p_9">

BACKGROUND FACTS

      The radio industry was revolutionized by the Government of India

as in October 1999 for its first phase of granting license for private FM,

broadcasting channel, tenders were invited.
</p>
<p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">      Appellant herein was awarded the license for running a private FM

broadcasting service in 12 cities on payment of a hefty license fee.

Several other bidders were also granted licenses. Respondent, however,

was not a member of the appellant - society. It was found to have been

using the broadcasting songs in respect whereof Super Cassettes Industry

Limited (SCIL) had an ownership over the copyright. It was a member

of the copyright society being Phonographic Performance Ltd. (PPL).

Indisputably, there had been an infringement of the copyright of Super

Cassettes. Allegedly, appellant was under the belief that it was a part of

PPL and whereupon the music belonging to the repertoire of SCIL was

played during the period from October 2001 to May, 2002 in its stations
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                  5</span>


at Indore and Ahmedabad. Royalty was paid by ENIL to PPL at the rate

of Rs.400/- per needle hour pursuant to the order passed by the Calcutta

High Court dated 28.9.2001. Attempts were made to obtain a licence

from SCIL when ENIL came to know that it was not a part of the

copyright society PPL. Negotiations failed between the parties.



</p><p id="p_12">      A suit was filed before the Delhi High Court for restraining ENIL

from playing and broadcasting the music belonging to SCIL on any of

the Radio Stations belonging to ENIL.
</p>
<p id="p_13">

COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE PARTIES



      We may notice relevant parts of some communications between

the parties.   Super Cassettes through its lawyer by a notice dated

21.1.2002, in view of the said infringement of his copyright called upon

ENIL, inter alia, to give an undertaking that it shall not broadcast the

sound records of Super Cassettes through its Radio Station without a

valid licence and payment of royalty (the terms of which were mutually

arrived at). Super Cassettes again by a notice dated 2.4.2002 through its

Advocate called upon ENIL to: "a) immediately desist from broadcasting

Sound Recording(s) of Super Cassettes clients through its Radio Station;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                   6</span>


</p><p id="p_14">b) Tender an unconditional apology for the illegal broadcast of Sound

Recordings of Super Cassettes clients in past; c) give an undertaking that

it shall not broadcast the Sound Recordings of Super Cassettes clients

through its Radio Station without a valid licence and payment of royalty

(the terms of which can be mutually arrived at), and d) pay a sum of Rs.

50,00,000.00 (Fifty lacs only) as liquidated damages, for the illegal

broadcast and acts of infringements committed by it, to Super Cassettes

within 15 days of receipt hereof under intimation to Super Cassettes

failing which Super Cassettes have positive instruction of its clients to

initiate such legal actions both Civil and/or Criminal against you, your

directors, and all other persons responsible for the said infringement

without any further notice and in that case you shall be further liable for

all cost and consequences thereof which may please be noted very

carefully".
</p>
<p id="p_15">

</p><p id="p_16">      In response to the said notice, ENIL stated:
</p>
<p id="p_17">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">              "2. Since our clients intend to negotiate with your
              clients, as was our clients intention from the
              beginning we have approached your clients and have
              offered payment of royalty, the price of which will be
              mutually convenient to both the parties.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">              3.    It is our clients' contention that music is for
              general benefit of society at large.      Our clients
              understand that your clients have entered into a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                 7</span>


            contract/Agreement with Media Broadcast Indian
            Ltd., broadcasting under the channel "Radio City",
            and our clients are also likewise prepared to
            popularise your client's music and add value to your
            clients' content by entering into Agreement/License
            with your clients.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">            4.     As we have already stated in the aforesaid para
            music is for general enjoyment and a restrictive
            practice of a tie up only with Media Broadcast India
            Ltd. is not in public interest. We, therefore, do not
            admit any of the allegations made by your clients in
            your aforesaid letter and further suggest that your
            clients resolve the issue by entering into a contract
            beneficial to both parties."
</blockquote>



<p id="p_18">      Super Cassettes, however, by another legal notice dated 1.6.2002

stated:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">            "My client has clearly indicated its willingness to
            grant your client a public performance license.
            However, without obtaining such license, your client
            continues to broadcast songs of our clients.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">                   In the circumstances, your client is once again
            called upon to :

<p id="p_19">(a)   First immediately cease and desist from such unauthorized
      broadcast before a formal license agreement is drawn up.

</p><p id="p_20">(b)   Pay my client a sum of Rs.1,00,00,000/- (Rupees one crore)
      for past infringement by way of radio broadcast of my

      Radio Stations situated in various cities."

.     PPL again to the Holding Company of ENIL, BCCL by a letter

dated 6.9.2000 stated:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">            "As you may be aware, it is a legal requirement to
            obtain permission (Licence) from the copy-right
            owners before you can broadcast the copyrighted
            music (Sound Recordings). As you may further be
            aware, Phonographic Performance Ltd. (PPL), is the
            copyright society in respect of sound recordings and
            is registered with Government of India. We have
            about 50 member companies including HMV,
            Universal, Tips, Venus, Sony Music (India), Virgin,
            Milestone, Magnasound, BMG - Crescendo and
            others.    The broadcasting rights in the music
            recordings - both of Indian and International music -
            or our members are administered by us.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">            It will be essential for your to apply for our licence for
            broadcasting of our members' existing and future
            sound recordings, subject to our tariff and terms and
            conditions as applicable.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">            We shall appreciate if you kindly confirm to us the
            centres where you will be setting up your F.M.
            Broadcasting stations/transmitters, and the estimated
            date/month from which the said stations/transmitters
            will start operations.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">            On receipt of this information, we shall send you the
            licence application form and the tariff details."</blockquote><p id="p_22">



</p><p id="p_23">      It, however, appears that several broadcasters including ENIL by a

letter dated 17.4.2001 addressed to PPL stated as under:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">            "We acknowledge that you are constituted as the
            body legally empowered to represent the interests of
            the owners of music copyrights around the world
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                      9</span>


when performances take place in India. We are,
therefore, approaching you to discuss arrangements
for the provisions of licensing the broadcast of
copyrighted music on our new stations.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_24">We want to begin discussions immediately, since at
least some of our stations are all but ready to begin
broadcasts now.
</p>
<p id="p_25">We can begin with the agreement that owners of
copyrights deserve to be compensated for the use of
their music on radio stations. Radio stations play
copyrighted music because of its popularity because
the music helps build the audience that the stations
can offer to advertisers with eventual hope of making
an opening profit. We assume that copyright owners
desire exposure to their music that is as broad as
possible.
</p>
<p id="p_26">The expectations for the future of private radio
broadcasting in India are high, and we have the
ambition to develop private radio to a level of
popularity not unlike what achieves in most other
developed countries in the world. Whereas radio
currently attracts the average Indian for less than half
an hour a day, daily radio listenership in most
countries averages something over three hours a day.
Uniquely among the media, radio has the ability to
provide as entertainment and information services to
listerners who do not have to stop everything else
they may be doing to take full advantage of the
programming. We feel that while radio has been a
dismal failure at attracting listenership thus far in this
country, we can, with your expectation, build radio
listening to the point that music will begin to play a
much larger role in the lives of the Indian public than
is the case today.
</p>
<p id="p_27">We hope that we can meet at your earliest
convenience to begin to discuss a contractual business
arrangement, which will be beneficial to both the
society and to the new radio industry in India.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                  10</span><p id="p_28">



</p><p id="p_29">            We would appreciate if you can get in touch with Mr.
            Prakash Iyer at 852-3880 extn. 3291 or Mobile : 982-
            11-82869 in the next 7 days to set up a date and time
            for the meeting."
</p>
<p id="p_30">

      Indisputably, appellant, in the suit filed by the first respondent

having come to learn that it is outside PPL's jurisdiction to give an

undertaking not to use the songs copyright whereof belongs to PPL,

Super Cassettes. The said suit admittedly has been withdrawn. It may

therefore not be necessary to refer thereto the proceedings before the

Board.
</p>
<p id="p_31">

</p><p id="p_32">      In a letter to the respondent, appellant stated, "We had no intention

to infringe your copyright as in fact we had been regularly paying royalty

to PPL including the T-Series needle time played on our station."



</p><p id="p_33">            The appellant thus contended that it had been all along

under a wrong impression that Super Cassettes was a member of PPL and

that it had no knowledge that the license was required to be obtained.

Super Cassettes, however, contend that such a stand was not correct as

would appear from its letter dated 28.5.2002, and that the appellant had

intended to negotiate with the respondent from the very beginning.

<p id="p_34">FIRST LICENCE CASE



      Various Radio Stations including the petitioner filed an application

<p id="p_44">SECOND LICENSE CASE



      On or about 28.1.2003, appellant filed an application before the

Copyright Board at Delhi, which was marked as Case No. 10 of 2003 for

grant of compulsory licence in terms of <a href="/doc/1998945/" id="a_3">Section 31(1)(b)</a> of the Act

against Super Cassettes praying, inter alia, for the following reliefs:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">             "Grant the applicant a compulsory license of the
             complete repertoire (present and future) of SCIL on

             by this Hon'ble Copyright Board."</blockquote><p id="p_45">


</p><p id="p_46">      On being noticed, respondents filed an objection contending that

as the suit for infringement was pending before the Delhi High Court, no

application for compulsory license could be entertained.          The High

Court, on an application filed by the appellant, clarified that the

respondent was free to canvas its submissions before the Copyright

Board that the person infringing the Copyright should not be granted

compulsory license. The Board directed the parties to come with their

respective witnesses. However, when respondent intended to present

oral evidence, it was declined. Submissions were directed to be made on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                  14</span>


or about 20.10.2003. Application No. 10 of 2003 was allowed granting a

compulsory license.

<p id="p_47">

</p><p id="p_48">      Appellant filed an appeal against the said order before the Bombay

High Court questioning the rates of compensation only. The said appeal

was tagged with various other appeals which had been filed before the

Bombay High Court against the order dated 19.11.2002 passed by the

Copyright Board at Hyderabad.
</p>
<p id="p_49">
</p><p id="p_50">      Respondents, however preferred two-fold appeals before the Delhi

High Court which were marked as RFA No. 848 of 2003. By reason of

the impugned judgment dated 30.6.2004, the respondent's appeal has

been allowed remitting the matter back to the Copyright Board to

reconsider the application of the appellant for grant of compulsory

license under <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_4">Section 31</a> of the Act after giving adequate opportunity to

the parties to adduce evidence and to dispose of the same by a reasoned

order. The High Court furthermore directed that the appellant must file

an undertaking that it would not broadcast the sound recordings of the

respondent. Appellant had filed Petition for Special Leave to Appeal

giving rise to Civil Appeal No. 5114 of 2005 in this Court.

<p id="p_55">(ii)   The selective refusal to sell `goods' which is treated under

       Indian Law to be an unfair trade practice is discouraged.

       Copyright Board, therefore, in terms of <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_6">Section 31</a> of the

       Act must be held to be holding the power to grant a

       compulsory licence provided the following conditions are

       satisfied:
</p>
<p id="p_56">
</p><p id="p_57">       (a)    the work in question should have been published or

              performed in public.

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">              publish or allow re-publication or the performance in

              public of the work by reason of which the work is

              withheld from the public; or


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">       (c)    has refused to allow a communication by a broadcast

              of such work on terms which the complainant

              considers reasonable.

<p id="p_60">(iii)   The term `or' used between clauses (a) and (b) of sub-

</p><p id="p_61">        section (1) of <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_7">Section 31</a> should be read disjunctively and

        not conjunctively.
</p>
<p id="p_62">
</p><p id="p_63">(iv)    The language of clause (b) indicates that the same is focused

        on a particular form of communication to the public- namely

        "Broadcast", which requires a proper construction having

        regard to the fact that the said word has been brought about

        by an amendment made by Act No. 23 of 1983. The words

        used prior to its amendment were `radio diffusion'.


</p><p id="p_64">(v)     <a href="/doc/1998945/" id="a_8">Section 31(1)(b)</a> was designed specifically to enable the

        Board to intervene where the owner, particularly of a sound

        recording did not allow its public broadcast.
</p>
<p id="p_65">
</p><p id="p_66">(vi)    The finding of the High Court that no compulsory licence

        can be granted now would be conferred in the public

        interest.
</p>
<p id="p_67">
</p><p id="p_68">(vii)   The words `such work' occurring in clauses (a) and (b) do

        not operate in the same field inasmuch as clause (a) refers to

        publication or republication of the work in print media.

        Clause (b) refers to the broadcast alone; the sound recording

        being a part of it. And in that view of the matter, the finding
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                              18</span>


         of the High Court that clause (b) cannot apply so long as

         somebody has allowed to broadcast it to the public is not

         correct.
</p>
<p id="p_69">(viii)   Properly construed, an owner of a copyright cannot make

         any discrimination between one broadcaster and another and

         what can be demanded is equitable remuneration for grant of

         broadcasting right, as a refusal to grant such a licence may

         even hit the Government owned free to air channels, which

         would be manifestly opposed to public interest.

</p><p id="p_70">(ix)     The Copyright Board not only have the requisite jurisdiction

         to grant a compulsory licence but also determine the

         quantum of remuneration payable to him for grant of such

         licence.
</p>
<p id="p_71">(x)      Subject of course to protection of the commercial rights of

         the owner of the sound recording, no owner of a copyright

         can refuse to allow broadcast of a sound recording, merely

         on the ground that the same may affect the profit of the

         owner inasmuch as the public interest in this behalf is

         paramount.

</p><p id="p_73">         (xi)   <a href="/doc/1479422/" id="a_9">Section 31(1)</a> must be construed having regard to the fact

                that India is a signatory to various International conventions,

                such as, Berne Convention, Rome Convention, etc. as would

                appear from the International Copyright Order, 1999 issued

                by the Central Government.       <a href="/doc/1479422/" id="a_10">Section 31(1)</a> must also be

                construed having regard to the laws indicted by other

                countries in the light of the said convention. Sub-Section

                (2) of <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_11">Section 31</a>, if given literal meaning, would lay to an

                anomaly and thus its area of operation should be confined to

                clause (a) of sub-Section (1) of <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_12">Section 31</a> only.


</p><p id="p_74">         (xii) It was urged that as the courts do not themselves lay down

                the principles for grant of compensation, this Court may lay

                down the same for further guidance of the same.
</p>
<p id="p_75">


         Mr. Shyam Divan, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf

of the respondents, on the one hand, would submit:



</p><p id="p_76">   (i)      The importance of the Copyright protection for the owners of

            the copyrights should be the prime consideration for

            determining the issue. The object of the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_13">Copyright Act</a> is to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                   20</span>


        maintain a balance between the interest of the owner of the

        copyright in protecting his works on the one hand and the

        interest of the public to have access to the works on the other

        hand and, thus, it is imperative to keep in mind the broad

        features of the Act which is the owner's freedom to contract his

        interest by the Act as would be evident from <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_14">Sections 14</a>, <a href="/doc/1454107/" id="a_15">16</a>

        and <a href="/doc/291394/" id="a_16">30</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_77">(ii)    The ownership of any copyright like ownership of any other

        property must be considered having regard to the principles

        contained in <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_17">Article 19(1)(g)</a> read with <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_18">Article 300A</a> of the

        Constitution, besides, the human rights on property.

</p><p id="p_78">(iii)   <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_19">As the Act</a> expressly recognizes the notion of an "exclusive

        licence" as defined in <a href="/doc/1462397/" id="a_20">Section 2(j)</a>, a specific right in terms

        thereof can be conferred only on one person which would

        include a right to have recourse to civil remedies in terms of

        <a href="/doc/1520267/" id="a_21">Section 55</a> of the Act, which enables the owner of a copyright

        to enjoy the fruits of his work by earning an agreed fee or

        royalty through the issuance of licence.
</p>
<p id="p_79">(iv)    The Copyright Board unlike its counterparts of Australia,

        England or Singapore have a limited jurisdiction and its

        principal functions are:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                     21</span><p id="p_80">


"(a) To decide whether a work has been published
     or as to the date on which the work was
     published for the purpose of determining the
     term of copyright under Chapter V of the Act.

</p>
<p id="p_82">(b)   To decide whether the term of copyright or any
      work is shorter in any other country than that
      under the Act (<a href="/doc/134296/" id="a_23">Section 6</a>);

<p id="p_83">(c)   To settle disputes arising in respect of
      assignment of copyright (<a href="/doc/1725108/" id="a_24">Section 19A</a>);
</p>
<p id="p_84">(d)   To settle disputes arising in respect of a
      voluntary license issued under <a href="/doc/463150/" id="a_25">Section 30</a> of the
      Act (Section 30A);
</p>
<p id="p_85">(e)   To grant compulsory licenses in respect of
      Indian works withheld from the public (Section
</p><p id="p_86">      31);
</p>
<p id="p_87">(f)   To grant a compulsory license to public
      unpublished Indian works (<a href="/doc/1288659/" id="a_26">Section 31A</a>);
</p>
<p id="p_88">(g)   To grant a compulsory license to produce and
      publish translation of literary and dramatic
      works (<a href="/doc/701290/" id="a_27">Section 32</a>);
</p>
<p id="p_89">(h)   To grant a compulsory license to reproduce and
      publish certain categories of liberary, scientific
      or artistic works for certain purposes (<a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_28">Section
      32A</a>);
</p>
<p id="p_90">(i)   To rectify the register of copyright on an
      application of the Registrar of Copyrights or
      any other person aggrieved (<a href="/doc/846220/" id="a_29">Section 50</a>);
</p>
<p id="p_91">(j)   To hear appeals from any decision or whatever
      the decision of the Registrar of Copyright
      [<a href="/doc/1528325/" id="a_30">Section 72</a>].
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                              22</span><p id="p_92">


</p><p id="p_93">(v)     <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_31">Section 31</a> of the Act must be given its literal meaning,

        which would mean that the Board can exercise its

        jurisdiction provided:
</p>
<p id="p_94">

</p><p id="p_95">        (i)    There is a refusal by the owner and as a result of

               which the work is "withheld from the public", or

</p><p id="p_96">        (ii)   In the case of a broadcast, the work has not been

               "allowed to be communicated to the public"
</p>
<p id="p_97">

</p><p id="p_98">(vi)    As in the instant case, the repertoire of SCIL and PPL are

        available to the public inasmuch as these copyright owners

        society have entered into voluntary licenses with All India

        Radio and some other FM Radio Broadcasters, the

        provisions of <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_32">Section 31</a> of the Act were not applicable.



</p><p id="p_99">(vii)   As both PPL and SCIL called upon the broadcaster to enter

        into licenses and were willing to license their repertoire on

        mutual agreed terms, it cannot be said that there has been a

        refusal on their part to grant licenses. In the present case, no

        occasion arose for grant of a compulsory licence inasmuch

        as the only relief which could be granted by the Copyright
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                               23</span>


         Board was to direct the Registrar of Copyrights to grant to

         the complainant a license to "communicate the work to the

         public" by broadcast, which is already made available to the

         public by broadcast through All India Radio and other radio

         broadcasters.
</p>
<p id="p_100">(viii)   The existence of license have been communicated to the

         public. <a href="/doc/1998945/" id="a_33">Section 31(1)(b)</a> does not create any entitlement in

         favour of an individual broadcaster, but merely provides a

         mechanism by which an Indian work that has been withheld

         from the public is made available to the public by broadcast.

</p><p id="p_101">(ix)     The interests balanced in <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_34">Section 31</a> are (i) the interest of

         the copyright owners and (ii) the interest of the general

         public. The narrow commercial interests of the broadcasters

         are not to be reckoned under the scheme of <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_35">Section 31</a>.

</p><p id="p_102">(x)      The relative merit and demerit of the complainants in any

         event being imperative for the purpose of arriving at a

         finding as to how the interests of the general public is to be

         best served itself is a pointer to the fact that compulsory

         license should not be granted to all the radio broadcasters.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                        24</span>


</p><p id="p_103">          (xi)   The Board is not expected unlike the statutes of other

                 countries to go into the reasonableness or otherwise of the

                 tariff fixed for grant of licenses.
</p>
<p id="p_104">          (xii) The Copyright society not being the owner of copyright, in

                 any event, cannot be subjected to grant of a compulsory

                 license in terms of <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_36">Section 31</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_105">          (xiii) <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_37">The Act</a>, having used different words `compensation' and

                 `royalty', <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_38">Section 3</a> signifies a lump sum amount to be paid

                 to bring back the work into the pubic domain. It also goes

                 to show that it is a one time exercise.
</p>
<p id="p_106">CORE ISSUES

          The core questions which, therefore, arise for consideration in

these appeals are:
</p>
<p id="p_107">

</p><p id="p_108">   (i)       Whether the Copyright Board has jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_39">Section 31</a>

             copyright in any Indian work or a registered copyright society

             to issue compulsory licences to broadcast such as works, where

             such work is available to the public through radio broadcast?

</p><p id="p_109">   (ii)      Whether in any event such a compulsory license can be issued

             to more than one complainant in the light of <a href="/doc/608133/" id="a_41">Section 31(2)</a>?

<p id="p_173">CONVENTIONS


      Before we embark upon respective contentions of the parties, we

may notice some International Conventions to which India is a signatory.

The Central Government issued the International Copyright order by a

notification published in the Gazette of India on 24.3.1999. It defines

`Berne Convention Country' to mean a country which is a member of the

Berne Copyright Union, and includes a country mentioned either in Part I

or in Part II of the Schedule. It defines `Phonograms Convention

Country' to mean a country which has either ratified, or accepted, or

acceded to the Convention for the Protection of Producers of

Phonograms against Unauthorized Duplication of their Phonograms,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                  42</span>


done at Geneva on the twenty-ninth day of October, one thousand nine

hundred and seventy-one, and includes a country mentioned in Part V of

the Schedule. It defines `Universal Copyright Convention Country' to

mean a country which has either ratified or accepted, or acceded to the

Universal Copyright Convention, and includes a country mentioned

either in Part III or in Part IV of the Schedule. It defines `World Trade

Organization Country' to mean a country which is a member of the

World Trade Organization and which has either ratified, or accepted, or

acceded to the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual

Property Right, 1994, and includes a country mentioned in Part VI of the

Schedule. The countries which have ratified/accepted/acceded to Berne

Convention are specified in Part I of the Schedule appended thereto. Part

II of the Schedule specifies those countries which are yet to

ratify/accept/accede to the 1971 Text of Berne Convention. Part III of the

Schedule specifies the countries which have ratified/accepted/acceded to

the 1971 Text of the Universal Copyright Convention. Part IV of the

Schedule specifies the countries which are yet to ratify/accept/accede to

the 1971 Text of Universal Copyright Convention. Part V of the

Schedule specifies Phonograms Conventions Countries and Part VI

specify the World Trade Organization Countries.

<blockquote id="blockquote_75">GENERAL PRINCIPLES



      There cannot be any doubt whatsoever that an artistic, literary or

musical work is the brain-child of an author, the fruit of his labour and,

so, considered to be his property. A copyright, however, unlike a trade

mark is a right created under the Act as is evident from <a href="/doc/1454107/" id="a_97">Section 16</a>

thereof. When an author of a copyright and other claims a copyright, it is

subjected to the provisions of the Act. The rights and obligations of the

author ought to be found out within the four corners of the Act. It is not

necessary to dilate more upon these aspects of the matter as the object
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                                      46</span>


behind enacting the Act is absolutely clear and explicit. It creates a

monopoly in favour of the author. Copyright also creates a monopoly in

favour of the copyright society. What requires protection is unlawful

reproduction of the author's work by others. It is the long period which

encourages the authors to create works of literature, music and art.</blockquote><p id="p_178">

             civilized nations that it is thought worthy of

<blockquote id="blockquote_78">              "Finally, it is considered a social requirement in the

             the public at large. These four fundamental principles
             are cumulative and inter-dependent and are applied in
             the justification of copyright in all countries, although
             different countries give varying emphasis to each of
             them. To generalize, it is true to say that in the
             development of modern copyright laws, the economic

<p id="p_182">INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS AND FOREIGN LAW



      India is a Signatory to Berne Convention. It is also a signatory to

the Rome Convention.
</p>
<p id="p_183">

</p><p id="p_184">      The International Conventions provide for compulsory license.

Whereas U.K., Australia, Singapore, U.S.A. have framed laws for grant

of compulsory license and also constituted Tribunals for the purpose of

overseeing the tariff for licensing, stricto sensu the <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_98">Indian Act</a> does not

say so.
</p>
<p id="p_185">
BROAD ANALYSIS OF THE PROVISIONS

      A statute as is well known must be read in its entirety. It is

required to be read chapter by chapter, section by section and clause by

clause. The definitions of the term `broadcast' as also `sound recording'
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">                                   48</span>


must be given a wide meaning. Clause (a) of <a href="/doc/4010217/" id="a_99">Section 13</a> protects original

work whereas clauses (b) and (c) protect derivative works. It provides

for commercial manifestation of original work and the fields specified

therein. Clause (a) of sub-Section (1) of <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_100">Section 14</a> deals with original

work. It is extremely broad. In contrast thereto, the copyright on films

or sound recording work operates in restrictive field; they provide for a

restrictive right as would appear from the provisions contained in <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_101">Section

14</a> (1)(e) of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_186">      For a proper construction of the provisions, will it be necessary to

keep in mind the difference between the right of the original work and

right of sound recording? Should we also bear in mind that there are

various forms of intellectual property rights. <a href="/doc/1454107/" id="a_102">Section 16</a> provides that a

right, inter alia, in respect of any work must be claimed only under and in

accordance with the provisions of the Act unlike Trade Mark and

`passing off rights' can be enforced even though they are not registered.

It must also be noticed that whereas the term of a copyright in original

literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works not only remains protected

in the entire life time of the author but also until 60 years from the

beginning of the calendar year next following the year in which the

author dies, the term of copyright in sound recording subsists only for 60

years, but as indicated hereinbefore, the same would not mean that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">                                   49</span>


right of an owner of sound recording is in any way inferior to that of

right of an owner of copyright on original literary work etc.

      Chapter VI deals with licence. The statutory licences are required

to be granted having regard to the various factors stated therein.

</p><p id="p_187">      <a href="/doc/1186979/" id="a_103">Section 33</a> is a special provision which provides for registration of

a copyright society.
</p>
<p id="p_188">      It may, however, be necessary to consider that unlike other

countries the broadcasting rights by themselves were introduced in India

for the first time by inserting <a href="/doc/1244879/" id="a_104">Section 37</a> in the year 1994. It is true that

the rights of free-to-air broadcasters have not been dealt with in a

specific legislation unlike some other jurisdiction. It may, however, be

of some importance to note that Chapter VII deals with Copyright

society, the concept whereof was incorporated in the Act so as to enable

an author to commercially exploit his intellectual property by a

widespread dispersal in a regulated manner. It for all intent and purport

steps into the shoes of the author. The society grants license on behalf of

the author, it files litigation on his behalf, both for the purpose of

enforcement as also protection of the enforcement of his right. It not

only pays royalty to the author but is entitled to distribute the amount

collected by it amongst its members.           <a href="/doc/1695816/" id="a_105">Section 34</a> providing for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">                                  50</span>


administration of rights of owners by a copyright society for all intent

and purport creates a virtual agency so as to enable the society to act on

behalf of the owner. The civil remedies for infringement of copyright as

envisaged under <a href="/doc/1520267/" id="a_106">Section 55</a> of the Act can also be enforced by the

society. The Scheme of the statute governing the field in other countries

is vast and wide. The jurisdiction of the Tribunal is indisputably very

wide. No such legislative changes have been made in India presumably

because until recent times, the Copyright in musical work was owned by

a cooperative society, namely, IPRS and PPL.
</p>
<p id="p_189">

</p><p id="p_190">      The third party granting license on a prescribed fee of a musical

work was contemplated under the Act.            As a general rule for

administering such copyrights, there are about 300 radio stations now.

Monopoly in respect of sound recording is, as it appears from the tariff

supplied to us by the respondent embrace within its field, Pop/Music

Quizzes, Mobile DJ, Jukeboxes, Dance Teachers, Dance Centre/Studio,

Exercise,   Amateur    Operatic   &amp;    Dramatic    Societies,   Theatrical

<p id="p_191">

</p><p id="p_192">         The right of the author of a copyright vis-`-vis the Society, thus,

may be exercised in almost all walks of life from the `Radio Stations' to

a small `Hairdressing Salon'.
</p>
<p id="p_193">         If the right of an author/society is so pervasive, is it necessary to

construe the provisions under <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_107">Section 31</a> of the Act having regard to the

International Covenants and the laws operating in the other countries?

The answer to the said question must be rendered in affirmative.

Interpretation of a statute cannot remain static. Different canons and

principles are to be applied having regard to the purport and object of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">                                      52</span>


Act. What is essential therefor is to see that the expanding area in which

the copyright will have a role to play is covered. While India is a

signatory to the International Covenants, the law should have been

amended in terms thereof. Only because laws have not been amended,

the same would not by itself mean that the purport and object of the Act

would be allowed to be defeated. If the ground realities changed, the

interpretation should also change.          Ground realities would not only

depend upon the new situations and changes in the societal conditions

vis-`-vis the use of sound recording extensively by a large public, but

also keeping in view of the fact that the Government with its eyes wide

open have become a signatory to International Conventions.

<p id="p_226">Australian Law

        Under Section 109 of the Australian Copyright Act, the form

adopted is in the same form as in (b) above. The additional feature of the

law is that the royalty for broadcasting of published sound recording is

frozen at a ceiling of 1% of the gross earnings of the broadcaster during

the specified period. There are also provisions for compulsory licensing.



China



        China has the form (a) above for domestic recordings.       They

however, follow the Berne Convention for International recordings.

These domestic recordings can be broadcasted on the radio or television

without any licence or payment. Even a commercial broadcast is in form

<p id="p_230">ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF THE COPYRIGHT ACT
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">                                    61</span>


      <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_130">The Act</a> seeks to maintain a balance between the interest of the

owner of the copyright in protecting his works on the one hand and the

interest of the public to have access to the works, on the other. The extent

to which the owner is entitled to protection in regard to his work for

which he has obtained copyright and the interest of the public is a matter

which would depend upon the statutory provisions.



</p><p id="p_231">      Whereas the Act provides for exclusive rights in favour of owners

of the copyright, there are provisions where it has been recognized that

public has also substantial interest in the availability of the works. The

provisions relating to grant of compulsory license must be viewed having

regard to the aforementioned competing rights wherefor an appropriate

balance has to be stuck. For the said purpose, we may notice the broad

features of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_232">

</p><p id="p_233">      <a href="/doc/1454107/" id="a_131">Section 16</a> of the Act provides that no person shall be entitled to

copyright otherwise than under and in accordance with the provisions of

the Act. <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_132">Section 14</a> defines the expression "copyright" to mean the

exclusive right to do or authorize the doing of specific things in respect

of a work, as detailed in that section.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">                                    62</span><p id="p_234">


</p><p id="p_235">      The primary method that an owner of copyright employs to exploit

the copyright and to make this work available to the public is through the

vehicle of voluntary licenses in terms of <a href="/doc/291394/" id="a_133">Section 30</a> of the Act.



</p><p id="p_236">      The freedom to contract is the foundation of economic activity and

an essential aspect of several Constitutional rights including the freedom

to carry on trade or business guaranteed under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_134">Article 19(1)(g)</a> and the

right to property under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_135">Article 300A</a> of the Constitution of India. But the

said right is not absolute. It is subject to reasonable restrictions.



</p><p id="p_237">      <a href="/doc/291394/" id="a_136">Section 30</a> enables the owner of the copyright to grant any interest

in the copyright by a license in writing signed by him or by his duly

authorized agent.
</p>
<p id="p_238">      The underlying philosophy of the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_137">Copyright Act</a> is that the owner

of the copyright is free to enter into voluntary agreement or licenses on

terms mutually acceptable to him and the licensee. <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_138">The Act</a> confers on

the copyright owner the exclusive right to do the various acts enumerated

in <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_139">Section 14</a>. An infringement of copyright occurs if one of those acts is

done without the owner's license. A license passes no interest, but

merely makes lawful that which would otherwise be unlawful. <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_140">The Act</a>

also expressly recognizes the notion of an "exclusive license" which is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">                                    63</span>


defined in <a href="/doc/1462397/" id="a_141">Section 2(j)</a>. But, that does not mean, as would be noticed

from the discussions made hereinafter, that it would apply in all

situations irrespective of the nature of right as also the rights of others. It

means a license which confers on the licensee, to the exclusion of all

other persons (including the owner of the copyright) any right comprised

in the copyright in a work. An exclusive licensee has specific rights

under the Act such as the right to have recourse to civil remedies under

<a href="/doc/1520267/" id="a_142">Section 55</a> of the Act. This Scheme shows that a copyright owner has

complete freedom to enjoy the fruits of his labour by earning an agreed

fee or royalty through the issuance of licenses. Hence, the owner of a

copyright has full freedom to enjoy the fruits of his work by earning an

agreed fee or royalty through the issue of licenses. But, this right, to

repeat, is not absolute.      It is subject to right of others to obtain

compulsory licence as also the terms on which such licence can be

granted.

COPYRIGHT SOCIETY



      The provisions with respect to Copyright Societies are contained

in Chapter VII of the Act which in its present form was introduced by the

<a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_143">Copyright (Amendment) Act</a>, 1994. <a href="/doc/1186979/" id="a_144">Section 33</a> of the Act provides for

a Copyright Society to accept from the owner exclusive authorization to

administer any rights in any work by issue of licenses or collection of

license fee or both. A Copyright Society may issue voluntary licenses

under <a href="/doc/291394/" id="a_146">Section 30</a>, collect fees in pursuance of such licenses, distribute

such fees amongst owners of rights, and perform any other functions

      Chapter V of the Copyright Rules, 1958 makes detailed provisions

with respect to the conduct of business by Copyright Societies. Rule 14J

requires that a Copyright Society shall frame a scheme of tariff to be

called a "Tariff Scheme" setting out the nature and quantum of fees or

royalties which it proposes to collect in respect of such copyright or other

rights administered by it. Rule 14K requires a Copyright Society to

frame a "Distribution Scheme" setting out the procedure for collection
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">                                    65</span>


and distribution of royalty specified in the Tariff Scheme among the

owners of copyright. Any distribution under the Distribution Scheme is

required to be in the proportion to the income of the Copyright Society

from actual use of the work or works of each owner of rights."



COMPULSORY LICENCE



      The scheme of the Act affirms the freedom to contract as being the

primary machinery by which the copyright owner publishes his work

through a voluntary license regime in terms of <a href="/doc/291394/" id="a_148">Section 30</a>. Compulsory

licenses are an exception to the general freedom of the copyright owner

CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION 31 OF THE ACT



       The broad requirements of <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_162">Section 31</a> are as under:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_86">             "(a)   The subject work must be an Indian work
                    whose term of copyright is subsisting;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_87">             (b)    The Indian work must be one that has been
                    published or performed in public;</blockquote><p id="p_254">
</p><p id="p_255">             (c) The owner of the copyright in the work must
             have
</p><p id="p_256">(i)    refused to republish or allow republication of the work or
       have refused to allow the performance of the work and by
       reason of such refusal the work is withheld from the public;
       or
</p><p id="p_257">(ii)   refused to allow communication to the public by broadcast,
       of such work or in the case of a sound recording the work
       recorded in such sound recording, on terms which the
       complainant considers reasonable; and

</p><p id="p_258">                    (d)   The Copyright Board is satisfied that the
                          grounds for refusal are not reasonable."
</p>
<p id="p_259">

       Significantly, in between the clauses (a) and (b), the word `or' has

been used. It must be read disjunctively and not conjunctively. Even
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">                                   69</span>


otherwise, reading the said provision, conjunctively is not possible.

Clause (a) refers to republication or allowing republication of the work,

etc. Clause (b) refers to refusal to allow communication to the public in

the case of a broadcast or in the case of the sound recording.



</p><p id="p_260">      What is the meaning of the word `refusal'



      The dictionary meaning of `refusal' whereupon reliance has been

placed by Mr. Divan may, at the outset, be noticed.

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_88">             "refusal. 1. The denial or rejection of something
             offered or demanded&lt; the lawyer's refusal to answer
             questions was based on the attorney-client privilege&gt;.</blockquote><p id="p_261">
</p><p id="p_262">             2. an opportunity to accept or reject something before
             it is offered to others; the right or privilege of having
             this opportunity &lt;she promised her friend the first
             refusal on her house&gt;

                       (See Black's Law Dictionary, Seventh Edition)



      The meaning of a word must be attributed to the context in which

it is used. For giving a contextual meaning, the text of the statute must

be kept in mind. An act of refusal depends upon the fact of each case.

Only because an offer is made for negotiation or an offer is made for

grant of license, the same per se may not be sufficient to arrive at a

conclusion that the owner of the copyright has not withheld its work
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_68">                                    70</span>


from public. When an offer is made on an unreasonable term or a stand

is taken which is otherwise arbitrary, it may amount to a refusal on the

part of the owner of a copyright.
</p>
<p id="p_263">

</p><p id="p_264">      When the owner of a copyright or the copyright society exercises

monopoly in it, then the bargaining power of an owner of a copyright and

the proposed licensee may not be same. When an offer is made by an

owner of a copyright for grant of license, the same may not have

anything to do with any term or condition which is wholly alien or

foreign therefor. An unreasonable demand if acceded to, becomes an

unconstitutional contract which for all intent and purport may amount to

Explanation appended to <a href="/doc/797096/" id="a_168">Section 2(ff)</a> clearly shows the extensive

meaning of the said term. Publication and republication of a work in

general may be different from communication of a work recording in

sound recording.       The use of words `such work' also assumes

significance. The said words must be understood having regard to the

fact that the sound recording is also a work.          If it is accepted that

voluntary licenses have been entered into by the owners with All India

Radio and some other Radio Broadcasters, then it is sufficient for closing

the doors on another person to approach the Copyright Board. One may

as well say that if it is provided to a satellite channel or a space radio, the

same also would subserve the purpose for refusing to grant an

application under <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_169">Section 31</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_273">

</p><p id="p_274">      A contextual interpretation of the provisions would lead us to

consider the ground realities. F.M. radios are played for every city. The

word `work' in the context of broadcast must be understood having

regard to the fact that there are 150 F.M. licenses out of which about 93

are working. There are 300 broadcasters working in almost all the big

cities in India. The word `public' must be read to mean public of all

parts of India and not only a particular part thereof. If any other meaning
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_71">                                   73</span>


is assigned, the terms `on terms which the complaints considers

reasonable' would lose all significance. The very fact that refusal to

allow communication on terms which the complainant considers

reasonable have been used by the Parliament indicate that unreasonable

terms would amount to refusal. It is in that sense the expression `has

refused' cannot be given a meaning of outright rejection or denial by the

copyright owner.
</p>
<p id="p_275">

</p><p id="p_276">      PPL and SCIL might have been called upon the broadcasters to

enter into licenses and were willing to license their repertoire. But their

contention was that if such terms are unreasonable, it amounted to refusal

which would attract <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_170">Section 31</a> of the Act. The word `communicate the

work to the public by broadcast" is of significance. It provides for a

mode of communication. Thus, only because a Registrar of a Copyright

would be directed to grant a licence to communicate the work to the

public by broadcast would not mean that only a single licence shall be

granted. The Board acting as a statutory authority can exercise its power

from time to time. It is therefore not correct to contend that having

regard to the provisions of sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_171">Section 31</a>, compulsory

licence can be granted only to one and not to more than one broadcaster.

We would deal with this provision at some details a little later. In

response to a query as to whether when an application for compulsory

licence is filed any publication thereof is made or not; we are informed

that no such rule or practice exists. Apart from the fact that application

for grant of compulsory licence in the matter of sound recording may be

by different persons; the wide range of it has been noticed by us

hereinbefore. It may for different parts of the country nay different

cities. If a compulsory licence is granted only once covering every single

part of the country, the same cannot be lead to a conclusion that no other

person can approach the Board.

considers that the terms of offer for grant of license are unreasonable. It,

no doubt, provides for a mechanism but the mechanism is for the purpose

of determination of his right. When a claim is made in terms of the

provisions of a statute, the same has to be determined. All cases may not

involve narrow commercial interest. For the purpose of interpretation of

a statute, the court must take into consideration all situations including

the interest of the person who intends to have a licence for replay of the

sound recording in respect whereof another person has a copyright. It,

however, would not mean that all and sundry can file applications.

RIGHT TO PROPERTY - IS THE CONCEPT APPLICABLE



      An owner of a copyright indisputably has a right akin to the right

of property. It is also a human right. Now, human rights have started

gaining a multifaceted approach. Property rights vis-`-vis individuals are

also incorporated within the `multiversity' of human rights. As, for

example, any claim of adverse possession has to be read in consonance

with human rights. The activist approach of the European Court of

Human Rights is quite visible from the judgment of Beaulane properties

Ltd. v. Palmer [2005 EWHC 817(Ch.)] and J. A. Pye (Oxford) Ltd. v.

Graham [(2002) 3 ALL ER 865].
</p>
<p id="p_283">

</p><p id="p_284">      This Court recognized need of incorporating the same principle for

invoking the rule of strict construction in such matters in <a href="/doc/663164/" id="a_174">P.T.

Munichikkanna Reddy and Ors. v. Revamma and Ors</a>. [(2007) 6 SCC

<blockquote id="blockquote_89">               " Adverse possession is a right which comes into play

               also on account of possessor's positive intent to
               dispossess. Intention to possess can not be substituted
               for intention to dispossess. Mere possession for
               howsoever length of time does not result in
               converting the permissible possession into adverse
               possession."

namely, it may be wholly or in part acquired in public interest and on

PUBLIC INTEREST - PUBLIC POLICY



      What would be a public interest? Would it depend upon the facts

and circumstances of each case and the provisions of the statute?
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">                                    78</span>


</p><p id="p_289">         General meaning of the word "public policy" has always been held

to be an unruly horse by this Court. [<a href="/doc/930662/" id="a_177">See Gherulal Parakh v. Mahadeodas

Maiya and Ors</a>. [1959 Supp (2) SCR 406]. This case was referred to in

the recent decision of this court in Devinder Singh and Ors. Vs. State of

Punjab and Ors. [AIR 2008 SC 261]




         The right to property, therefore, is not dealt with its subject to

restrict when a right to property creates a monopoly to which public must

have access. withholding the same from public may amount to unfair

trade practice. In our constitutional Scheme of statute monopoly is not

encouraged. Knowledge must be allowed to be disseminated. An artistic

work if made public should be made available subject of course to

reasonable terms and grant of reasonable compensation to the public at

large.
</p>
<p id="p_290">


ROYALTY AND COMPENSATION


         Are the terms "royalty" and "compensation" are not synonymous?

"Royalty" means the remuneration paid to an author in respect of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">                                  79</span>


exploitation of a work, usually referring to payment on a continuing basis

(e.g. 10 per cent of the sale price) rather than a payment consisting of a

lump sum in consideration of acquisition of rights. May also be applied

to payment to performers. (See `World Copyright Law' (2nd Edn) by

J.A.L. Sterling).
</p>
<p id="p_291">      The word `compensation', however, must have been used keeping

in view the fact that if it is a statutory grant; it is a case of statutory

licence. We are not unmindful of the fact in cases of other statutory

licenses, the word `royalty' has been used. Even the word `usually' has

been used. Mr. Divan himself has referred to Rule 11A and Form IIA

appended to the Rules of 1958. Clauses (10) and (11) of the Form which

have validly been made used the word `royalty.
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_91">             "10. Rate of royalty, which the applicant considers
             reasonable, to be paid to the copyright owner.

             royalty"</blockquote><p id="p_292">



</p><p id="p_293">      The legislature therefore for all intent and purport equates

`compensation' with `royalty'. In the context of the Act, royalty is a

genus and compensation is a species. Where a licence has to be granted,

it has to be for a period. A `compensation' may be paid by way of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_78">                                   80</span>


annuity. A `compensation' may be held to be payable on a periodical

basis, as apart from the compensation, other terms and conditions can

also be imposed. The compensation must be directed to be paid with

certain other terms and conditions which may be imposed.


MARGINAL NOTE



      It was urged that for proper construction of <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_178">Section 31</a> of the Act,

reference to marginal note is permissible.      Strong reliance has been

placed by Mr. Divan on <a href="/doc/399708/" id="a_179">K.P. Varghese v. Income-tax Officer, Ernakulam</a>

[(1981) 4 SCC 173] to contend that the marginal note to a section can be

relied upon for indicating the drift of the section or to show what the

section is dealing with. It is however, also well settled that where the

statute is clear, marginal note may not have any role to play. {<a href="/doc/535729/" id="a_180">See

Bhinka &amp; ors. v. Charan Singh</a> [1959 Supp. (2) SCR 798] .



PARLIAMENTARY INTENT



      The intention of the Parliament, it is trite, must be ascertained from

the plain reading of the Section. The intention is to treat works, which

have been "withheld from the public" differently from the "right to

broadcast". The right to broadcast is a ephemeral right. It requires
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_79">                                   81</span>


special treatment as it confers upon every person, who wishes to

broadcast a work or the work recorded in a sound recording, the right to

do so is either by entering into a voluntary agreement to obtain a licence

on such terms which appear to be reasonable to him or when the term

appears to be unreasonable to approach the Board.



</p><p id="p_294">      We wish the statute would have been clear and explicit. But only

because it is not, the courts cannot fold its hands and express its

helplessness.
</p>
<p id="p_295">

</p><p id="p_296">      When such a complaint is made, it confers the jurisdiction upon

the Board. It may ultimately allow or reject the complaint but it cannot

be said that the complaint itself is not maintainable.


INTERPRETATION OF SECTION 31(2)


      This takes us to the interpretation of <a href="/doc/608133/" id="a_181">Section 31(2)</a>. It is attracted

in a case where there are more than one applicants. The question of

considering the respective claim of the parties would arise if they tread

the same ground. The same, however, would not mean that only one

person is entitled to have a licence for all time to come or for an

indefinite term even in perpetuity.      A licence may be granted for a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_80">                                   82</span>


limited period; if that be so another person can make such an

applicatioin. Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_182">Section 31</a> would lead to an anomalous

position if it is read literally. It would defeat the purport and object of

the Act. It has, therefore, to be read down. P purposive construction

therefor may be resorted to.

            in the case, needed. If they should be added, the
            statute would more than likely fail to carry out the

            one, interpolation is improper, since the primary
            purpose of the legislative intent is what the statute

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_84">                                     86</span>


for that purpose. The statute has to be read down. It is not a case of

improper interpolation so as to take away a primary purpose of the

legislative intent. It is expedient to give effect to the intent of the statute.

This itself says that creases can be ironed out. While undertaking the

said exercise, the court's endeavour would be to give a meaning to the

provisions and not render it otiose. We are, therefore, of the opinion that

<a href="/doc/608133/" id="a_190">Section 31(2)</a> refers to case falling under clause (a) of Sub-section (1) of

<a href="/doc/969912/" id="a_191">Section 31</a> and not clause (b) thereof.

PRINCIPLES OF VALUATION



         We have, moreover, been called upon to lay down the principles of

evaluation. We decline to do so. We have been taken through various

judgments of different jurisdictions. We have noticed hereinbefore that

the scheme therein is different.          The Tribunal exercises a limited

jurisdiction in India. Different cases are required to be considered on its

own merits. What would be reasonable for one may not be held to be

reasonable for the other. The principles can be determined in a given

situation. The Bombay High Court has remitted the matter back to the

Board for the said purpose. We endorse the views of the Bombay High

Court.

DISCRETIONARY JURISDICTION



        The other question which arises is as to whether the discretionary

jurisdiction should have been exercised in favour of the appellant. It was

urged that keeping in view the fact that ENIL infringed the copyright, it

was not entitled to an injunction. Reliance has been on Phonographic

Performance Ltd. vs. Maitra [(1998) Fleet Street Reports 749 at 770-

773].     The general principle of grant of injunction came up for

consideration before the Court of Appeal. Therein, it was held that an

owner may exercise and exploit his proprietary right by licensing some

and not others. He may charge whatever he wishes. Such is not the

position in India.     Therein, the defendant did not take part in the

proceedings. It was, inter alia, from that angle, held that the court could

still exercise discretion.

<p id="p_313">

</p><p id="p_314">        The court of appeal held:
</p>
<p id="p_315">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_98">              "Use of an injunction by PPL to obtain money to
              obtain money to which they are not entitled would be
              an abuse, but there is no evidence that that ever
              occurs. Where unauthorized use of PPL's copyright
              is taking place, we do not believe it is an abuse to
              refuse to licence that copyright without an appropriate
              payment for past use and an agreement for future use.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_86">                                   88</span>


<blockquote id="blockquote_99">             Nor do we consider it an abuse for PPL to require
             compliance with an injunction either by the person
             refraining from using the repertoire or by payment for
             such use that has taken place and will take place."
</blockquote>



<p id="p_316">      Apart from the fact that we are not dealing with a case where an

order of injunction is required to be issued; as indicated hereinbefore, the

question before the Board was as to whether there was an abuse in the

sense that unreasonable amount was being claimed by way of royalty.



CONCLUSION

      As it was a case of abuse, the Board had the jurisdiction to

entertain any application for grant of compulsory licence. How far and

to what extent appellant has infringed the right of the respondent is a

matter which may be taken into consideration by the Board. A suit was

filed and injunction was granted. Apart from the fact that the appellant

offered to take a license held negotiations with the respondents in the suit

as soon as it came to know that Super Cassettes is not a member of PPL,

it gave an undertaking. Each case must be considered on its own facts.



</p><p id="p_317">      However, we do not approve the manner in which the Board has

dealt with the matter. It has refused to examine the witnesses. It took up
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_87">                                   89</span>


the matter on a day for hearing which was fixed for production of

witnesses. We, therefore, are of the opinion that the order of the Board

should be set aside and the matter be remitted to the Board again for the

consideration of the matter afresh on merit.
