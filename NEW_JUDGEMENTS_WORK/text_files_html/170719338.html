       industry at large in India and world over identify and distinguish the
       plaintiff's said goods under the said trade mark/trade name with the
       plaintiff and from the plaintiff's source and origin alone and regard
       them as a high quality product exclusively as that of the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_17">16.    It has further been deposed by PW-1 that the Plaintiff has adopted the
       said Trade Mark IKEA as an essential and material part of its
       Domain Name viz www.IKEA.com as well.
</p><p id="p_18">17.    PW-1 has also deposed that M/s Ikea Trading (India) Pvt. Ltd., is an
       Indian subsidiary/affiliate of the plaintiff in India. It has further been
       deposed by PW-1 that the said Indian subsidiary of the plaintiff is
       one of the 40 odd superstar trading houses in India. This is a special
       status accorded by the Government for companies with trading
       activities in excess of INR 7 billion (USD 140 million) per year.

       rights both statutory and common law in its said trademark/trade
       name/domain name, its goodwill and reputation, the plaintiff has the
       exclusive rights to the use thereof and nobody can be permitted to use

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">CS(OS) 523/2008                                                            Page 6 of 15</span>
        the same or any other deceptively similar trade mark/trade
       name/domain name thereto in any manner whatsoever, in relation to
       any specification of goods without the leave and license of the
       plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_20">19.    PW-1 has further deposed that the defendant M/s IKEA Furniture
       Private Ltd., No.1 and 2, Balaji Nagar II ST, Royapettah, Chennai-14
       is apparently engaged in the same trade and business as that of
       plaintiff namely manufacture of furniture etc.
</p><p id="p_21">20.    PW-1 has also deposed that the defendant has adopted and started
       using or intends to use, in relation to its impugned goods and
       business an identical trade Mark/ trade name IKEA (hereinafter
       referred to as the "impugned Trade Mark/ Trade Name) and the
       impugned trade mark/ trade name as copied and imitated by the
       defendant is identical with and deceptively similar to the plaintiff's
       said trade marks/trade name IKEA in each and every respect
       including phonetically, structurally, in its basic idea and in its
       essential features. The impugned goods and business thereunder are
       of the same/similar/allied/cognate nature and description as that of
       the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_22">21.    PW-1 has further deposed that the defendant by the adoption and use
       of the impugned trade mark is violating the plaintiff's statutory and
       common law right in the said trademark and trade name and thereby
       infringing plaintiff's registered trademark(s) and passing off and
       enabling others to pass off their goods and business as that of the
       plaintiff as well as diluting the plaintiff's proprietary rights and
       goodwill and reputation therein.
</p><p id="p_23">22.    Ms. Surbhi Bansal, PW-1 has further deposed that the defendant is
       fully aware or ought to be aware of the plaintiff's rights, goodwill,
       reputations, benefits and users etc. in the plaintiff's said trade mark,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">CS(OS) 523/2008                                                          Page 7 of 15</span>
        trade name &amp; domain name at the time of their impugned adoption
       and use of the impugned trademark. The resemblance between the
       rival trade mark / trade name is so close that it can hardly occur
       except by deliberate imitation.
</p><p id="p_24">23.    It has further been deposed by PW-1 that the defendant has adopted
       and started using the impugned trade mark/ trade name dishonestly,
       fraudulently and out of positive greed with a view to take advantage
       and to trade upon the established goodwill, reputation and proprietary
       rights of the plaintiff in the plaintiff's said trade mark/ trade name. By
       the defendant's impugned adoption and use, deception and confusion
       is ensuing and/or is likely to so ensue in the market and amongst the
       general public at large. The plaintiff's said trade mark is otherwise
       being diluted and eclipsed thereby and any person not knowing
       clearly the relationship between the parties to this action is bound to
       be confused by the defendant's impugned adoption and use and
       might well do business with the defendant thinking that he is dealing
       with the plaintiff or that some strong, vital and subtle links exist
       between the plaintiff and the defendant. The defendant intends to
       encash upon the hard earned goodwill of the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_25">24.    PW-1 has further gone on to depose that due to the defendant's
       impugned activities, the plaintiff is suffering/ought to suffer massive
       losses and damage both in business and in reputation and as such
       these losses and damage are unliquidated; monetarily being incapable
       of exact and accurate assessment. Unwary purchasers and trade
       persons are being confused and deceived/likely to be deceived as to
       the origin of goods and business. It has further been deposed that the
       defendant in view of its impugned business activities is liable to pay
       damages to the plaintiff to the tune of minimum Rs. 20,000,01/-.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">CS(OS) 523/2008                                                            Page 8 of 15</span>
<p id="p_26"> 25.    PW-1 has also deposed that the plaintiff in the month of August,
       2007 launched inquiries through the trade to ascertain the defendant's
       activities under the impugned trade mark/trade name. The said
       enquiries revealed that the defendant has so far not started using the
       impugned trade mark/trade name in the course of trade on its
       vendible impugned goods and business and nor has the plaintiff so far
       come across any of the impugned vendible goods under the
       impugned trade mark/trade name in the market, however, the
       defendant is soliciting trade, distribution and marketing networks in
       relation to the impugned goods under the impugned trade mark/trade
       name in Delhi and other parts of the country. The defendant has all
       the intention of commercially using the impugned trade mark/trade
       name in relation to the impugned goods/business if not already so
       used. The defendant's user, thereof if any would be clandestine,
       surreptitious, sporadic, restricted, minimal and very recent and that
       too without issuing any formal bills and invoices making it very
       difficult to detect and verify the precise nature of the defendant's
       activities and therefore the defendant's use of impugned trade
       mark/trade name, if any, is void ab-initio.
</p><p id="p_27">26.    I have heard counsel for the plaintiff and carefully perused the
       documents which have been placed on record along with the affidavit
       by way of evidence of PW-1. Plaintiff has proved the copies of its
       trade mark registration certificates in different classes in india which
       have been marked as Mark-A(Colly). Plaintiff has also proved its
       copies of legal proceeding certificates which have been exhibited as
       Ex. PW-1/14. Plaintiff has also proved its pending applications for
       registration in India and the same are marked as Mark-B (Colly).
       Further, plaintiff has proved the copies of registration certificates of
       the plaintiff in different countries across the world which have been

        marked as Mark-C (Colly). Plaintiff has also proved the copies of
       advertisements and other sales promotional literature of the plaintiff
       which is exhibited as Ex.-PW-1/6 (Colly) as also its brochure which
       has been exhibited as Ex. PW-1/3 and Ex. PW-1/4. Plaintiff has also
       proved the downloaded documents from its website which is
       exhibited as Ex.-PW-1/5. In addition to the above, plaintiff has also
       placed reliance on copies of news reports showing commencement of
       plaintiff's activities in India which are exhibited as Ex. PW-1/13.
</p><p id="p_28">27.    On the basis of the documents placed on record, plaintiff has been
       able to prove that the plaintiff is the registered proprietor of the trade
       mark "IKEA" not only in India but is the worldwide owner of its
       "IKEA" trade marks which is evident from the certificates of
       registrations placed on record. Plaintiff has also established that the
       plaintiff has created various stylized and device formats of the said
       trade mark over a period of time and hence the plaintiff owns the
       copyright therein by virtue of them being original artworks. Plaintiff
       is an international company that deals in ready-to-assemble furniture,
       home accessories etc. Plaintiff has also established that the trade
       mark "IKEA" was coined by the plaintiff as far back as in the year
       1943, which is evident from the timeline displayed by the plaintiff on
       its website. Furthermore, the plaintiff has been able to establish that
       over a period of time, the plaintiff has diversified not only with
       respect to its products and services but also in terms of its presence
       and business operations in various countries world over, including
       India. By virtue of its presence across more than 70 countries in the
       world, which is evident from the perusal of its sales promotional
       literature placed on record, plaintiff has been able to prove that it
       enjoys trans border reputation and boasts of an extensive marketing
       network     through     internet,    retail,   e-commerce      and      its

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">CS(OS) 523/2008                                                           Page 10 of 15</span>
        affiliates/subsidiaries. Further, the plaintiff has established that ever
       since its adoption, the plaintiff has been using the said trademark
       regularly and continuously and in fact, the plaintiff has been
       promoting the said mark along with the goods sold thereunder
       through      extensive advertisements, publicity,        promotions     and
       marketing by way of publication/broadcast through print/visual
       media including leading newspapers, magazines etc. In addition to
       the above, plaintiff has also placed reliance on the an article
       published in the magazine, "The Business Week", wherein, the
       plaintiff company has been rated among the top 50 brands in the year
       2002 as also in the year 2010. The plaintiff has successfully
       established that the plaintiff's trade mark has acquired an enviable
       and enduring goodwill, reputation and users not only in India but
       across numerous countries inasmuch as the plaintiff's goods are
       known, recognized, demanded, sold and traded worldwide with
       reference to its trade name/trade mark IKEA. The evidence of the
       plaintiff remains unchallenged and unrebutted.

                  services, and in such manner that it is likely that such use is
                  taken as being an use as a trademark. This amounts to
                  infringement. To fall within Section 29(1), the defendant's
                  use of the mark must be so that it is likely that the public
                  assumes that the said mark is used as a trademark. Section
                  29(2) deals with three situations; one where the defendants
                  mark is identical to that of the plaintiff and in respect of
                  similar goods. Two, where the marks are similar and in
                  respect of goods which are identical or similar. Three, the
                  marks as well as the goods are identical. Infringement does
                  not take place if only one of the three ingredients are
                  satisfied; the plaintiff has to prove that use by the defendant

                   is likely to cause confusion on the part of the public or is
                  likely to have an association with the registered mark."

<p id="p_31">29.    Having regard to the evidence on record and comparing the
       impugned trademark of the defendant with that of the plaintiff, I am
       of the view that the impugned trade mark of the defendant "IKEA" is
       identical to that of the plaintiff in each and every respect including
       phonetically, structurally, in its basic idea and in its essential features.
       Furthermore, the defendant is engaged in the same trade/line of
       business as the plaintiff namely manufacture of furniture etc. It has
       been established by the plaintiff beyond reasonable doubt that the
       said distinctive trade mark "IKEA" has come to be associated with
       the plaintiff and plaintiff's goods for a long time now and the
       purchasing public and the industry at large distinguishes and
       identifies the goods under the said trade mark as originating from the
       plaintiff. In light of the above, in my view, adoption of an identical
       mark by the defendant, that too in the same line of business, is
       malafide and illegal as it is bound to cause confusion and deception
       in the minds of public at large with respect to the source of the goods
       originating from the defendants and many existing/prospective
       consumers may assume a commercial link/nexus between the
       plaintiff and the defendant and otherwise also adoption of the
       impugned mark by the defendant will lead to dilution of the trade
       mark of the plaintiff if the quality of products originating from the
       defendant is inferior to that of the plaintiff. Furthermore, by
       projecting such a commercial connection or relationship with the
       plaintiff, the defendants would be encashing on the hard earned
       goodwill and reputation established by the plaintiff over the period of
       years and passing off their goods as those of the plaintiff.

<p id="p_32"> 30.    The plaintiff has also claimed damages on account of illegal profits
       earned by the defendant along with delivery up of the goods bearing
       the trade mark "IKEA" or use of the said mark as their trade name or
       a constituent of their trade name.
</p><p id="p_33">31.    Order sheets show that despite service of summons, the defendant has
       deliberately stayed away from the present proceedings to ensure that
       an enquiry into their accounts for determination of damages cannot
       take place. In the case of Tata Sons Ltd. v Hoop Anin &amp; Ors.
       reported at 188(2012)DLT327 punitive damages to the tune of 5 lacs
       were awarded to the plaintiff. Relevant paras of the judgment are
       reproduced below:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                  "9. The plaintiff has also claimed Rs. 20,05,000/- as
                  damages from defendants No. 1 &amp; 2. Dealing with the
                  damages, this Court in Tata sons <a href="/doc/344613/" id="a_4">Ltd. v. Manoj Dodia &amp;
                  Ors</a>. (supra) inter alia observed as under:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                  The promotion and building of a Trade Mark, particularly a
                  mark which is used in relation to a variety of good and/or
                  services, requires considerable efforts, skill and expenses.
                  The brands are not built in a day, it takes years to establish
                  a brand in the market. Moreover, brand equity can be
                  earned only if the quality of the product sold and/or services
                  provided under that name are consistently found to be of
                  superior quality. No amount of marketing efforts and
                  promotional expenditure can build a brand, particularly in
                  the long run, if the quality of the product/service does not
                  commensurate with the marketing efforts. The brands,
                  particularly well known brands, themselves are now
                  becoming highly valuable and in fact are being sold as
                  standalone products. The companies which invest heavily in
                  brand building and back them up by quality products are
                  bound to suffer not only in reputation but also in financial
                  terms, on account of diminution in the value of the brand as
                  well as sale of their products/services, if the brands are not
                  given adequate protection by the Courts, by awarding
                  punitive damages against the infringers. Also, a soft or
                  benevolent approach while dealing with such persons, is
                  also likely to prejudicially affect the interests of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">CS(OS) 523/2008                                                          Page 13 of 15</span>
                   consumer, who may pay the price which a premium product
                  commands in the market, but may get an inferior product on
                  account of such unscrupulous persons using trademarks of
                  others for their own commercial benefit, at the cost not only
                  of the trade mark owner, but also the consumer who
                  purchases their product."
</blockquote><p id="p_34">32.    Another purpose behind awarding punitive damages is to deter those
       who may be waiting in the wings and may be tempted to imitate the
       trade mark of others, in case those who are sued before the Courts are
       not made to pay such damages as would really pinch them. Awarding
       token damages may, therefore, not serve the desired purpose. Our
       country is now almost in the league of advanced countries. More and
       more foreign companies are entering our markets, with latest
       products. They would be discouraged to enter our country to
       introduce newer products and make substantial investments here, if
       the Courts do not grant adequate protection to their intellectual
       property rights such as patents, trademarks and copyright. Most of
       the products sold by these companies are branded products, the marks
       on them having trans-border reputation and enjoying tremendous
       brand equity. It is, therefore, becoming increasingly necessary to curb
       such trade mark piracies lest they drive away the huge foreign
       investment our country is attracting. The Court should not give
       premium to dishonesty and unfair practices by those who have no
       compunctions in blatantly using the trademark of others for making
       unearned profits.

       Selection Footwear and Anr. [1999 PTC 578].
</p><p id="p_36">33.    I am in agreement with the aforesaid submission of learned counsel
       for the plaintiff that damages in such cases must be awarded in order
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">CS(OS) 523/2008                                                         Page 14 of 15</span>
        to provide adequate protection to such brands that take years and
       decades to establish their brand names in the public domain and also
       to deter such blatant indulgence in infringing activities by people.
       Also, in my view, a defendant, who chooses to stay away from the
       proceedings of the Court, should not be permitted to enjoy the
       benefits of evasion of court proceedings. R.C. Chopra, J. has very
       succinctly set out in <a href="/doc/1152738/" id="a_6">Time Incorporated v. Lokesh Srivastava and
       Anr</a>. reported at 2005 (30) PTC 3 (Del) that punitive damages are
       founded on the philosophy of corrective justice. A party who chooses
       not to participate in court proceedings and stays away must, thus,
       suffer the consequences of damages as stated and set out by the
       plaintiff. There is a larger public purpose involved to discourage such
       parties from indulging in such acts of deception and, thus, even if the
       same has a punitive element, it must be granted.
</p><p id="p_37">34.    For the reasons stated above, the plaintiff has made out a case for
       grant of decree as prayed in the plaint. Accordingly, the suit is
       decreed in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant in terms
       of para (a) of the prayer. Plaintiff is also entitled to damages to the
       tune of Rs.2 lakhs.
</p><p id="p_38">35.    Decree sheet be drawn up accordingly.
