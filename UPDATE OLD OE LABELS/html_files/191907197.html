</p><p id="p_7">3)   The skeletal facts necessary to decide this Appeal are

that the Plaintiff/Respondent has a trade mark called

“CHYMORAL” and “CHYMORAL FORTE”, which is a drug

administered post-surgically for swellings that may arise

and/or wounds that may arise. It is interesting to note that the

expression “CHYMO” comes from the generic name of the

drug which is CHYMOTRYPSIN-TRYPSIN.                     The learned

Single Judge ultimately found, after a copious reference to the

facts and case law, as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">          “45. In the present case, I am not satisfied that any of
          these tests are met. Reputation as to source is not
          sufficiently demonstrated. The rival products have
          long co-existed and I cannot and will not presume
          misrepresentation by Wockhardt as to source, even
          assuming there is similarity. There is no explanation
          at all for Torrent’s past conduct and the inaction with
          knowledge, or deemed knowledge, of Wockhardt’s
          trade mark registration application, its advertisement
          and subsequent registration, with not a single
          objection from Torrent or is predecessor-in-title. There
          is no answer about the caveats or about the co-
          existence of other players in the market. There is
          simply no misrepresentation shown as required by
          law, at this prima facie stage. There being no prima
          facie case made out, I cannot grant the injunction.</blockquote><p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">          The balance of convenience seems to me to favour
          entirely the Defendants; after all, to the Plaintiff’s
          knowledge, they have had their product in the market
          for a very long time, at the very least for five years,
          possibly more, and an injunction at this stage is far
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                      2</span>
          removed from the prima facie status quo that Wander
          v Antox tells us is the primary objective. There is no
          injury, let alone an irreparable one, to the Plaintiff that
          I can tell if an injunction is refused. It has not had one
          all this time while the Defendants’ business has
          grown into crores. To grant the injunction would be
          unfairly monopolistic.”

</p><p id="p_10">4)    The Division Bench, in an order of reversal, ultimately

found that each one of the triple tests for passing off had been

made out on the facts, namely, the establishment of

reputation, misrepresentation as understood in law and

likelihood of injury or damage caused to the Plaintiff. On the

first count, the Division Bench held that the Plaintiff had

obtained the mark by way of assignment in the year 2014,

from one Elder and Company, which, in turn, had obtained the

said mark from one Armour Pharmaceutical Company. The

user that is claimed on behalf of the Plaintiff is at least from

the year 1988 as and when Elder Pharmaceuticals Ltd.

actually sold drugs under the two trade names as aforesaid.

The Division Bench also referred to the Plaint which, in turn,

referred to sales figures of Rs. 59 Crores and Rs. 95 Crores

for the years 2014-15 and 2015-16 respectively. Having thus

found, the Division Bench then went on to state that it is clear

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                        3</span>
that reputation has been established.         When it came to

misrepresentation, the Division Bench found that confusion

was likely to ensue despite the fact that the purchasers of the

drug, which is a Schedule-H Drug, may be persons who are

Doctors and other patients who are literate. It found that the

substitution of   the   letter ‘T’ for the letter ‘O’ is the only

difference between the two trade names, and therefore, found

that, in law, since confusion on the ground of deceptive

similarity would ensue, misrepresentation in law is also made

out. On the third count, it said, undoubtedly, there would be

likelihood of damage to the Plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">5)    The Division Bench interfered with the conclusion of the

learned Single Judge by ultimately finding that wrong tests had

been applied in law as a result of which the judgment was

“vitiated by errors of law apparent on the face of the record”. It

further went on to hold as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">           “102. After referring to the order of the learned
           single Judge, in the backdrop of the settled
           principles, we are of the view that it is vitiated
           by errors of law apparent on the face of the
           record. The impugned order is, ex-facie,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                     4</span>
          erroneous and illegal. It ignores admitted
          factual materials and settled tests while
          denying relief to the appellant-plaintiff. For
          these reasons, it is unsustainable and we
          have no alternative, but to quash and set aside
          the same. It is, accordingly, quashed and set
          aside.”


It, therefore, upset the judgment of the learned Single Judge

and granted the temporary injunction asked for. It went on to

stay the order for a period of 12 weeks, which stay has been

continued by this Court till date.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_14">6)   Mr. Guru Krishna Kumar, learned Senior Counsel

appearing on behalf of the appellant, has vehemently

contended that the Division Bench judgment should be set

aside as it has disregarded this Court’s judgment in <a href="/doc/330608/" id="a_1">Wander

Limited And Another vs. Antox India P. Ltd</a>. 1990 (Supp)

SCC 727, in particular, para 14 thereon, which reads as

under:-

<p id="p_15">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">          “14. The appeals before the Division Bench were
          against the exercise of discretion by the Single
          Judge. In such appeals, the Appellate Court will not
          interfere with the exercise of discretion of the court of
          first instance and substitute its own discretion except
          where the discretion has been shown to have been
          exercised arbitrarily, or capriciously or perversely or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                      5</span>
        where the court had ignored the settled principles of
        law regulating grant or refusal of interlocutory
        injunctions. An appeal against exercise of discretion
        is said to be an appeal on principle. Appellate Court
        will not reassess the material and seek to reach a
        conclusion different from the one reached by the
        court below if the one reached by that court was
        reasonably possible on the material. The appellate
        court would normally not be justified in interfering
        with the exercise of discretion under appeal solely on
        the ground that if it had considered the matter at the
        trial stage it would have come to a contrary
        conclusion. If the discretion has been exercised by
        the trial court reasonably and in a judicial manner the
        fact that the appellate court would have taken a
        different view may not justify interference with the
        trial court's exercise of discretion. After referring to
        these principles Gajendragadkar, J. in <a href="/doc/1652410/" id="a_2">Printers
        (Mysore) Private Limited vs. Pothan Joseph</a>, 1963
        SCR 713 at 721:

                 established, but as has been
                 observed by Viscount Simon in
                 Charles Osenton &amp; Co. v. Jhanaton,
                 1942 AC 130, ‘…... the law as to the

                 order made by a judge below in the

                 case.’
        The appellate judgment does not seem to defer to
        this principle.”
According to learned Senior Counsel, the Single Judge

Bench summation at para 45 could not have been interfered

with by the Division Bench because the law had been looked

at threadbare, and ultimately it was found that not only had


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                   6</span>
none of the three tests being satisfied but that there was

clearly a case of acquiescence made out, for which the

Plaintiff has to be denied interim relief. He referred to several

judgments to buttress his submissions.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">7)   On the other hand, Dr. A.M. Singhvi, learned Senior

Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents, has

supported the judgment passed by the Division Bench, also,

by copiously referring to various judgments and by stating

that the Division Bench judgment, in fact, upset the learned

Single Judge because of errors of law and, therefore,

interfered on principle and not on fact. He was at pains to

point out that reputation had been established by the sales

figures from 1988 onwards; “misrepresentation” had been

made out in the said sense understood in law, that is, that

absence of an intention to deceive is not a defence in law,

and that the defendant’s state of mind is wholly irrelevant to

the existence of the cause of action in passing off.         He

stressed the fact that as reputation had been made out, and

as the learned Single Judge himself had said that “confusion”


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                                    7</span>
had been made out, the learned Single Judge was wholly

wrong in stating that a further requirement was necessary,

namely, fraud or deceit.     On the third aspect, it was also

pointed out that it is obvious that there would be likelihood of

damage to the Plaintiff. Assuming that there was no damage

caused to the general public, because the drug being sold

unlike   in   <a href="/doc/1114158/" id="a_3">Cadila     Health    Care     Ltd.    vs.   Cadila

Pharmaceuticals Ltd</a>. (2001) 5 SCC 73 consisted of the

same formulation, yet this would not deny them the right to

interim relief, and that is only a further factor that needs to be

taken into account , also to combat the plea of acquiescence.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_16">8)   Having heard learned Senior Counsel for some time, we

may point out that the learned Single Judge, after referring to

the case law, pointed out in para 27 as follows:- “I think I must

accept Mr. Dwarkadas’s submission that confusion may be

assumed, but not deceit or deception.”.         In para 45, the

learned Single Judge went on to state that he would not

presume misrepresentation by Wockhardt as to source, even

assuming there is similarity.
</p>
<p id="p_17">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                                     8</span>
</p><p id="p_18">9)   We may indicate, at this juncture, that insofar as the

second test is concerned, this Court has in a plethora of

judgments held that though passing off is, in essence, an

action based on deceit, fraud is not a necessary element of a

right of action, and that the defendant’s state of mind is wholly

irrelevant to the existence of a cause of action for passing off,

if otherwise the defendant has imitated or adopted the

Plaintiff’s mark. We need only state the law from one of our

judgments, namely, in <a href="/doc/185380767/" id="a_4">Laxmikant V. Patel</a> vs. Chetanbhai

Shah      and Another, (2002) 3 SCC 65, which reads as

under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">          “13 In an action for passing-off it is usual, rather
          essential, to seek an injunction, temporary or ad-
          interim. The principles for the grant of such injunction
          are the same as in the case of any other action
          against injury complained of. The plaintiff must prove
          a prima facie case, availability of balance of
          convenience in his favour and his suffering an
          irreparable injury in the absence of grant of
          injunction. According to Kerly (ibid, para 16.16)
          passing-off cases are often cases of deliberate and
          intentional misrepresentation, but it is well-settled
          that fraud is not a necessary element of the right of
          action, and the absence of an intention to deceive is
          not a defence, though proof of fraudulent intention
          may materially assist a plaintiff in establishing
          probability of deception. Christopher Wadlow in Law
          of Passing-Off (1995 Edition, at p.3.06) states that
          the plaintiff does not have to prove actual damage in
          order to succeed in an action for passing-off.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                                                     9</span>
<p id="p_19">         Likelihood of damage is sufficient. The same learned
         author states that the defendant’s state of mind is
         wholly irrelevant to the existence of the cause of
         action for passing-off (ibid, paras 4.20 and 7.15). As
         to how the injunction granted by the Court would
         shape depends on the facts and circumstances of
         each case. Where a defendant has imitated or
         adopted the plaintiff’s distinctive trade mark or
         business name, the order may be an absolute
         injunction that he would not use or carry on business
         under that name. (Kerly, ibid, para 16.97).”
This judgment has been followed in <a href="/doc/127697258/" id="a_5">S. Syed Mohideen vs. P.

Sulochana Bai</a>, (2016) 2 SCC 683 at 699-700.                    Also, in

<a href="/doc/1630167/" id="a_6">Satyam Infoway Ltd. vs. Siffynet Solutions Pvt. Ltd</a>.,

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">         “14 The second element that must be established by
         a plaintiff in a passing-off action is misrepresentation
         by the defendant to the public.               The word
         misrepresentation does not mean that the plaintiff
         has to prove any mala fide intention on the part of the
         defendant. Of course, if the misrepresentation is
         intentional, it might lead to an inference that the
         reputation of the plaintiff is such that it is worth the
         defendant’s while to cash in on it. An innocent
         misrepresentation would be relevant only on the
         question of the ultimate relief which would be granted
         to the plaintiff [Cadbury Schweppes v. Pub Squash,

</p><p id="p_22">10) The Division Bench essentially interfered with the

judgment of the learned Single Judge on this score and also

found that the learned Single Judge was incorrect in stating

that “reputation as to source is not sufficiently demonstrated”.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                                                          10</span>
It found that reputation was established from the sales

figures, and the fact that the Plaintiff was clearly a prior user

would make it clear that the first pre-requisite for the action in

passing off was made out. Where the Division Bench and the

learned Single Judge really locked horns was on the point of

acquiescence. The learned Single Judge found that not only

was there a lying by for a long period, but that there was

positive action on the part of the Plaintiff in leading the

defendant to believe that he could build up his business, at

which point the Plaintiff swooped in to interdict and throttle

that business as it was rising just as sales were rising. On

this count, the Division Bench interfered with the learned

Single Judge as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">         “89.      The learned Judge then attributes
         acquiescence to the plaintiff.          The plaintiff’s
         predecessor in title did not object to the trademark
         registration application. It allowed others to do so
         and it is the plaintiff’s failure to bring a suit on
         service of a caveat. Thus, there is no objection from
         the plaintiff. It only means that the plaintiff kept
         quiet when the application for registration was made
         by the defendant. They failed to object to the
         advertisement of the defendant’s application or
         when the defendant brought its project in market.</blockquote><p id="p_23">

assume acquiescence. We do not think this to be
the position on facts and in law. A plea of
acquiescence to be raised in defence so as to
succeed ought to be supported by weighty materials
to that effect. Since the learned single Judge has
referred to the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme
Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1965879/" id="a_7">M/s Power Control
Appliances and Ors. vs. Sumeet Machines Pvt.
Ltd</a>., (1994) 2 SCC 448, we would refer to it in
some details. Paras 4, 5, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and
16 of this judgment were heavily relied upon by Mr.
Tulzapurkar. In that, the facts and the submissions
are summarised. Then, in para 20, the argument of
the respondents before the Hon’ble Supreme Court
was set out. In paras 27, 28, 29 and 30, the English
judgments were noted and up to para 31.

that even at this prima facie stage, there is no
positive act which can be attributed to the plaintiff so
as to deny the relief. There is no acquiescence
which can be culled out. Beyond referring to some
general principles, we do not find any material
placed before the learned single Judge from which
an inference of acquiescence can be drawn. Mr.
Dwarkadas has, on this point, relied upon certain
judgments and even in the written submissions,
there is reference to general principles. All that the
first defendant says is as under:-

Respondent No. 1 since the plaintiff was aware of
its right and the defendant was ignorant of its own
right and despite the same, the plaintiff assents to or

view of the same, it would be unjust in all
circumstances to grant the relief of injunction to the
plaintiff. It is submitted that the requirements stand

duly aware of Respondent No. 1’s trademark; the
use of Respondent No. 1’s mark openly and on an
extensive scale; and at no point for over 7 years did
the appellant or its predecessors contest the same.
On the contrary, the appellant’s 2014 acquisition of
the trademark is with full notice of the adoption and
use and registration of Respondent No. 1’s
trademark. As such, the principles of acquiescence
and waiver apply with full vigour.
</p>
<p id="p_28">(iii) Acquiescence is a species of estoppel and
therefore both a rule of evidence and a rule in
equity. It is an estoppel in pais: a party is prevented
by his own conduct from enforcing a right to the
detriment of another who justifiably acted on such
conduct.
</p>
<p id="p_29">(iv) The ‘positive act’ as referred to in the decision of
the Hon’ble Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1965879/" id="a_8">M/s Power Control
Appliances and Ors. vs. Sumeet Machines Pvt.
Ltd</a>. reported in (1994) 2 SCC 448 (relied upon by
the appellant) cannot mean that the plaintiff ‘green
lighting’ the defendant’s action only to later complain
of it. The ‘positive act’ is the ‘sitting by’ or ‘laying by’
i.e., not mere silence or inaction but a refusal or
failure to act despite knowledge of invasion and
opportunity to stop it. In the present case, from
2009, the appellant and/or its predecessors have
been at notice of Respondent No. 1’s adoption, use
and registration of its trademark and against that
there has been a complete failure to register any
protest or objection. In 2014, the appellant acquired
the trademark with full notice of Respondent No. 1’s
registration and use of the trademark “CHYMTRAL”.
This qualifies for both acquiescence and estoppel
defences.”

</p><p id="p_30">91. Thus, the attempt is to equate delay with
acquiescence and which is not correct. We do not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                                               13</span>
         think that because the appellants stepped in the
         year 2014 with notice of the first respondent’s
         registration and use of the mark that means the
         appellant-plaintiff has acquiesced in the same. That
         is not a positive act and which is required to deny
         the relief on the ground of acquiescence.”




</p><p id="p_31">11) We are of the view that this is not a case where Wander

Ltd. (supra) has not been heeded.            On the contrary, the

Division Bench has interfered on a matter of principle,

pointing out errors of law by the learned Single Judge. We

may also point out one other significant fact that has occurred

in the meanwhile. After 17.11.2017, despite the fact that the

Division Bench of the High Court stayed its own order, which

stay was continued by this Court till date, the Appellant has

started to sell the same product under a new trade name,

namely, ‘Chymowok’. We have been shown sales figures in

the last 10 months of sales made by the Appellant under this

new trade name which amounts to a figure of Rs. 2.71 Crores

from 17.12.2017 till 18.08.2018.
</p>
<p id="p_32">
</p><p id="p_33">12) We may also state, that this trade name was registered

in the name of the Appellant way back on 14.11.2009 with

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                                                    14</span>
effect from a date in 2008, but had not been utilized till the

Division Bench judgment was passed against the Appellant.

We are also told that the remaining stock of material has

been disposed of under the trade name “CHYMTRAL”, and

that material manufactured after the Division Bench judgment

is not being sold under the said trade name despite the stay

granted in favour of the Appellant. Seeing the sales figures of

‘Chymowok’ from December, 2017 till August, 2018 and the

fact that the Appellant’s sales under the “new” trade name are

substantial, we do not think that we should exercise our

discretionary jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_9">Article 136</a> of the Constitution

of India in favour of the Appellant, seeing that the balance of

convenience is well served by the judgment under appeal.

The Appeal is, therefore, rejected.
