<p id="p_1">R.F. Nariman, J.
</p>


<p id="p_2">1.    The present appeals arise out of two  reference  orders  –  one  by  a
Division Bench of this Court dated 8.11.2010 to 3  learned  Judges  of  this
Court, and the second by a 3-Judge Bench  of  this  Court  dated  27.8.2014,
placing the matter before 5 learned Judges of this Court.
</p>


<p id="p_3">2.    The reference order by two learned Judges, after referring to  Section
98 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, reads  as follows:-
</p>

<p id="p_4">“6.   The above view was  followed  by  three  Judge  Bench  Court  in  <a href="/doc/65853090/" id="a_1">P.V.
Hemalatha vs. Kattamkandi Puthiya Maliackal Saheeda and  Anr</a>.  AIR  2002  SC
2445. That was a case in which the High Court of Kerala  had,  relying  upon
Section 98 of CPC, confirmed the decree under appeal despite  difference  of
opinion between the two Judges comprising the Bench on a question  of  fact.
This Court held that while Section 23 of the  Travancore-Cochin  High  Court
Act is the general law, Section 98(2) is a special provision. Section 23  of
the Travancore-Cochin High Court Act reads as under:
</p>
<p id="p_5">     "23. Reference by Chief Justice.--Where two Judges forming  a  Division
Bench agree as to  the  decree,  order  or  sentence  to  be  passed,  their
decision shall be final. But if they disagree, they shall  deliver  separate
judgments and thereupon the Chief Justice shall refer, for  the  opinion  of
 another Judge, the matter or matters on  which  such  disagreement  exists,
and the decree, order or sentence   shall follow the opinion of  the  Judges
hearing the case."
</p>
<p id="p_6">7.   Section 9 of the Kerala High Court Act by which  the  Travancore-Cochin
High Court Act was repealed to the extent of  its  repugnance  may  also  be
extracted. It reads:
</p>
<p id="p_7">     "9. Repeal.--The provisions of the Travancore-Cochin  High  Court  Act,
1125 (5 of 1125), insofar as they relate to matters provided  in  this  Act,
shall stand repealed."
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.   In our opinion Section 23  of  the  Travancore-Cochin  Act  is  in  the
nature of a special provision while  Section  98(2)  is  in  the  nature  of
general law. As between the two, the former would  apply  in  preference  to
the latter. The decision of this Court in P.V.  Hemalatha's  v.  Kattamkandi
Puthiya Maliackal Saheeda  and  Anr.  (supra)  to  the  extent  it  takes  a
contrary view, in our opinion, requires to be reconsidered.
</p>
<p id="p_9">9.   That apart, the question whether in an appeal arising out of  an  order
passed by the High Court to which Section 98(2) of  the  CPC  applies,  this
Court can in exercise of its power under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_2">Article  136</a>  of  the  Constitution
direct the matter to be placed before a third Judge to resolve the  conflict
arising from two differing judgments, has not been examined either  in  P.V.
Hemalatha's or Tej Kaur's case. We, therefore, consider  it  appropriate  to
refer  to  a  larger  Bench   for   consideration   and   an   authoritative
pronouncement the following two questions:
</p>
<p id="p_10">    (1) Whether Section 23 of the Travancore-Cochin Act  remains  unaffected
by the repealing provisions of Section 9    of the Kerala  High  Court  Act.
If so, whether Section 23 is in the nature of a special provision  vis-à-vis
Section 98(2) of CPC.
</p>
<p id="p_11">(2) Whether this Court can under Articles 136 and 142  of  the  Constitution
direct in any appropriate case a reference to a third judge to  resolve  the
conflict arising between two judges of the High Court hearing an appeal,  on
a question of fact.”

</p><p id="p_12">3.    The 3-Judge Bench in turn referred the matter to a  5-Judge  Bench  as
follows:-
</p><p id="p_13">“In the reference order, the 2-Judge Bench has doubted  the  correctness  of
the decision of  this  Court  in  P.V.  Hemalatha  Vs.  Kattamkandi  Puthiya
Maliackal Saheeda and Anr. Since the decision has been given  by  a  3-Judge
Bench in P.V. Hemalatha,  we  are  of  the  view  that  correctness  of  the
decision in P.V. Hemalatha has to be considered by a Bench of 5 Judges.
</p><p id="p_14">2. The matter is, accordingly, referred to a Bench of 5 Judges.
</p><p id="p_15">3. The matter may  be  placed  before  the  Chief  Justice  for  appropriate
administrative order in this regard.
</p>
<p id="p_16">S.L.P. (Civil) No. 34457 of 2010
Leave granted.
</p><p id="p_17"> 2. The issues involved in the present Appeal are identical  to  the  issues
that arise in Civil Appeal No. 201 of 2005. Civil Appeal  No.  201  of  2005
has been referred to a Bench of 5 Judges.
</p><p id="p_18">3. For the self same reasons, this Civil Appeal is also referred to a  Bench
of 5 Judges to be heard along with Civil Appeal No. 201 of 2005.
</p><p id="p_19">4. The matter may  be  placed  before  the  Chief  Justice  for  appropriate
administrative order in this regard.”

</p><p id="p_20"> 4.   In order to  appreciate  the  controversy,  which  lies  in  a  narrow
compass, we need first to advert  to  the  decision  in  <a href="/doc/65853090/" id="a_3">P.V.  Hemalatha  v.
Kattamkandi Puthiya Maliackal Saheeda &amp; Another</a>, (2002) 5 SCC 548.  In  that
judgment this Court has held that  the  Travancore-Cochin  High  Court  Act,
Section 23 of which contains a provision which states  that  if  two  Judges
forming a Division Bench of the High Court disagree, they shall refer  their
disagreements to the opinion  of  another  Judge  and  the  opinion  of  the
majority will then prevail, was said to be general as against Section  98(2)
of the Code of Civil Procedure which was said to  be  special.   It  may  be
stated that Section 98(2) in  dealing  with  appeals  to  a  superior  court
generally, has a reference to a  third  or  more  Judges  in  the  event  of
disagreement  between  two  Judges  only  on  a  point  of  law.    If   the
disagreement exists on a point of fact, the lower court judgment  is  to  be
confirmed.  Hemalatha’s case (supra) therefore decided:
“Submission made on comparing Section 23 of the  Travancore-Cochin  Act  and
Section 4 of the Kerala Act read with Section 9 of the latter  Act  is  that
as  the  procedure  indicated  to  Judges  constituting  a  Division   Bench
delivering separate judgments is governed by Section 23 of  the  Travancore-
Cochin Act and as it is not covered by Section 4  of  the  Kerala  Act,  the
former cannot be said to have been repealed by Section 9 of the Kerala  Act.
The submission, therefore, is that the Judges of the Division Bench  of  the
High Court of Kerala could take recourse to Section 23  of  the  Travancore-
Cochin Act and as they had  delivered  two  separate  judgments  they  could
refer the matter to the Chief Justice for the opinion of the third Judge.
</p>
<p id="p_21">The above argument  advanced  is  attractive  but  cannot  be  accepted  for
another reason. In our view, the law contained in the Travancore-Cochin  Act
and the Kerala Act regulating the practices, procedure  and  powers  of  the
Chief Justice and Judges of the High Court in relation  to  all  cases  from
all enactments appearing before them is a general law which cannot  be  made
applicable to appeals from the Code of Civil Procedure regulated  by special
law that is contained in Sections 96 to 98 of the Code.  There  is  a  clear
conflict between the provisions contained in Section 23 of  the  Travancore-
Cochin  Act  which  allows  the  reference  by  differing  Judges  who  have
delivered separate judgments or opinions to a third Judge on issues both  on
fact and law and the provisions contained in proviso of sub-section  (2)  of
Section 98 of the Code which permits reference to one or  more  Judges  only
on the difference of opinion on the stated question of law. When the  Courts
are confronted with such a situation, the Courts'  approach  should  be  “to
find out which of the two apparently conflicting provisions is more  general
and which is more specific and to  construe  the  more  general  one  as  to
exclude  the  more  specific”.   The   principle   is   expressed   in   the
maxims generalia specialibus non derogant (general things  do  not  derogate
from  special  things)  and specialia  generalibus  derogant(special  things
derogate from general things). These principles have also  been  applied  in
resolving a conflict between two different Acts and in the  construction  of
statutory  rules  and  statutory  orders.   (See Principles   of   Statutory
Interpretation by Justice G.P. Singh, 7th Edn., 1999, pp. 113-14.)

Assuming for the sake of argument that  provisions  of  Section  23  of  the
Travancore-Cochin Act are saved by Section 9  of  the  Kerala  Act  and  are
applicable to the High Court of the new State of Kerala, in  our  considered
opinion since provisions contained in Section 98 of the  Code  is  a special
law as  compared  to  the general  law  contained  in  Section  23  of   the
Travancore-Cochin Act read with Section 9 of the Kerala  Act,  the  “special
law” will prevail over the general law and the provisions of Section  98  of
the Code in all its terms will have to be applied to civil  appeals  arising
from civil suits which are regulated by the Code.
</p>
<p id="p_22">Undisputedly, the High Court of Kerala is not a  Chartered  High  Court  and
was not a court in British India. It was  a  High  Court  established  after
formation of the new State of Kerala in 1956 under the SR Act of  1956.  The
High Court of Kerala, therefore, has  no  Letters  Patent.  The  Travancore-
Cochin Act and the Kerala Act are not Letters Patent of the High  Court  and
therefore they cannot be held to have been saved  under  the  provisions  of
sub-section (3) of Section 98 of the Code. It is interesting  to  note  that
provision similar to Section 98(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908  and
proviso thereunder has been on the statute-book in Section 577  of  the  old
Civil Procedure Code  of  1877.  These  provisions  in  the  Code  of  Civil
Procedure were in existence when the  Travancore-Cochin  Act,  1125  (Indian
calendar 1948-49) and the Kerala Act, 1958 were enacted but at no  point  of
time any change was made by amendment to sub-section (3) of  Section  98  of
the Code to give an overriding effect along with the Letters Patent  of  the
Chartered High Courts to other enactments  dealing  with  formation  of  new
High Courts for new States under the SR Act of 1956 or any other laws.”  [at
paras 32 – 34 and 38]

Shri V. Giri, learned senior counsel,  who  has  argued  on  behalf  of  the
appellants in the present cases, has referred to a judgment of five  learned
Judges of this Court in <a href="/doc/12214027/" id="a_4">P.S. Sathappan v. Andhra Bank  Ltd</a>.  (2004)  11  SCC
672, by which learned counsel has referred to the exactly  opposite  finding
insofar as appeals under the Letters Patent are concerned. According to  the
learned senior counsel, this judgment having decided that  for  the  purpose
of Section 4 of the  Code  of  Civil  Procedure,  Section  98  not  being  a
specific law to the contrary would therefore  govern  the  present  case  as
well, as it has been expressly held in that decision that  qua  the  Letters
Patent, the Code of Civil Procedure is general and  the  Letters  Patent  is
special.  Furthermore, in this case also, since the  Travancore-Cochin  High
Court Act, being the old Charter of the Kerala High Court,  is  similarly  a
special law qua the general law contained in the Code  of  Civil  Procedure.
Shri V. Giri’s entire argument is that therefore  Sathappan’s  case  (supra)
concludes the issue at hand and being inconsistent with  the  3-Judge  Bench
in Hemalatha’s case (supra), the law declared in  Hemalatha’s  case  (supra)
is no longer good law.
</p><p id="p_23">5.    Apart from the above, Shri V. Giri  also  based  his  arguments  on  a
judgment of the Privy Council contained in <a href="/doc/1182946/" id="a_5">Bhaidas Shivdas v.  Bai  Gulab  &amp;
Another</a>, AIR 1921 PC 6, as  followed  and  explained  in  various  decisions
including two Full Bench decisions in particular,  <a href="/doc/71179/" id="a_6">Immidisetti  Dhanaraju  &amp;
Another v. Motilal Daga &amp; Another</a>, AIR 1929 MAD 641 and  <a href="/doc/980833/" id="a_7">Shushila  Kesarbhai
&amp; Ors. v. Bai Lilavati &amp; Others</a>, AIR 1975 Guj 39 (FB).   According  to  Shri
V. Giri, the Privy Council judgment  as  followed  in  the  two  Full  Bench
decisions referred to hereinabove again makes it clear  that  Section  4  of
the Code of Civil Procedure when pitted against a High  Court  Charter  like
the Letters Patent, the said Charter being a special law would prevail  over
the Code of Civil Procedure unless there is  a  specific  provision  to  the
contrary in the Code of Civil Procedure itself.   Section  98  was  directly
held not to be such specific provision to the contrary in the Privy  Council
judgment and therefore it is clear that  Section  98(2)  did  not  apply  to
Letters Patent Appeals, whether intra  court  or  appeals  that  arose  from
subordinate courts and would have their origins in Section 96  of  the  Code
of Civil Procedure.  His further submission is that  when  the  legislature,
by amendment in the year 1928, introduced Section 98(3)  into  the  Code  of
Civil Procedure, it made the position amply clear that all High Courts  were
excluded from the ambit of Section 98.  Since, in  1928,  only  High  Courts
established by Letters Patent existed in British India, the  Letters  Patent
alone was referred to in the said provision.  However,  after  India  became
independent and other High Courts were either set up,  or  assimilated  from
the princely States into the constitutional framework  of  India,  the  same
position would necessarily obtain inasmuch as the various  <a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_8">High  Court  Act</a>s
setting up High Courts other than  those  already  set  up  by  the  Letters
Patent would also be the basic Charter (like the  Letters  Patent)  of  each
High Court. <a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_9">Section 98(3)</a> therefore only declares what is already  contained
in <a href="/doc/1028712/" id="a_10">Section 4</a>, namely, that qua the High Courts in this country,  <a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_11">Section  98</a>
would not be a specific provision to the contrary and that  the  <a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_12">High  Court
Act</a>s being special in this regard would necessarily  prevail  by  virtue  of
the other provisions of <a href="/doc/1028712/" id="a_13">Section 4</a> over the general  provision  contained  in
Section 98(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure.
</p><p id="p_24">6.    Shri K.V. Viswanathan, learned senior counsel appearing on  behalf  of
the respondents, countered these submissions and  marshalled  his  arguments
on four different  points.  He  argued  the  case  with  great  ability  and
learning and we heard him with considerable interest.  According to  learned
counsel, the Code of <a href="/doc/1645922/" id="a_14">Civil Procedure Amendment Act</a> of 1951,  which  extended<a href="/doc/1645922/" id="a_15">
the Code</a> of Civil Procedure to the whole of  India,  contained  a  provision
(namely <a href="/doc/1105646/" id="a_16">Section 20</a>) by which all laws  that  corresponded  to<a href="/doc/1645922/" id="a_17">  the  Code</a>  of
Civil  Procedure  in  the  territory  of  India  were  repealed.  Therefore,
according to learned counsel,  Section  23  of  the  Travancore-Cochin  High
Court Act, being a law which corresponded to<a href="/doc/1645922/" id="a_18"> the Code</a>  of  Civil  Procedure,
was repealed. This being so, there is no conflict between any  provision  of
the Kerala High Court Act, 1958 and<a href="/doc/1645922/" id="a_19"> the Code</a> of Civil  Procedure  and  hence
<a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_20">Section 98(2)</a> would be the only provision governing the field.   He  further
argued that, assuming that, he were to fail on the first  argument,  <a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_21">Section
98</a> read with Sections 117, 120, 122, 125  and  129  of  the  Code  of  Civil
Procedure are specific provisions  to  the  contrary  for  the  purposes  of
Section 4(1) of the Code of  Civil  Procedure  and  that  <a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_22">Section  98</a>  would
therefore prevail over Section 23 of the Travancore-Cochin High  Court  Act.
A third submission is that,  in  any  event,  <a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_23">Section  98(2)</a>  is  a  special
provision which deals with appeals under Section 96 of  the  Code  of  Civil
Procedure, and since all appeals under the Kerala High Court Act,  1958  are
appeals under Section 96 of the Code of Civil Procedure,  <a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_24">Section  98</a>  which
is an adjunct to <a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_25">Section 96</a> would alone apply.  For  the  purposes  of  this
argument, he made a distinction between appeals which arise under clause  15
of the Letters Patent, where appellate  jurisdiction  is  conferred  by  the
Letters Patent, as contrasted with clause 16 of the  Letters  Patent,  which
referred only to appellate jurisdiction conferred by  other  laws  including<a href="/doc/1645922/" id="a_26">
the Code</a> of Civil Procedure.  He further argued that  viewed  thus,  <a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_27">Section
98</a> is undoubtedly a special provision and  Section  23  of  the  Travancore-
Cochin High Court Act would thus be a  general  provision  in  this  regard.
His fourth submission  is  that  Articles  136  and  142  cannot  be    used
to apply Section 23 of the Travancore-Cochin High Court  Act,   if  it  were
otherwise clear that the said provision  had  been  expressly  excluded  and
<a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_28">Section 98(2)</a> alone were to apply.
</p><p id="p_25">7.    Having heard learned counsel for the parties, we  need  to  first  set
out the relevant statutory provisions:

The provisions of the Travancore Cochin High Court Act, 1125 (5 of 1125)  in
so far as  they  relate  to  matters  provided  in  this  Act,  shall  stand
repealed.”

</p><p id="p_73">8.    Before proceeding to resolve the controversy at hand, it  first  needs
to be stated that Section 9 of the Kerala High  Court  Act,  1958,  set  out
hereinabove, repeals the provisions  of  the  Travancore-Cochin  High  Court
Act, insofar as the said Act relates to matters provided in the Kerala  High
Court  Act.   Though  Mr.  Viswanathan  sought  to  urge  to  the  contrary,
ultimately it was common ground  between  the  parties  that  there  is   no
provision  corresponding  to  Section  23  of  the  Travancore-Cochin   High
Court  Act  in the Kerala High Court Act, 1958 and that therefore  the  said
provision continues in force,  not having been repealed by Section 9 of  the
Kerala High Court Act, 1958.
</p><p id="p_74">9.    Shri Viswanathan’s first submission requires us  to  set  out  <a href="/doc/208304/" id="a_52">Section
20(1)</a> of the 1951 amendment  to<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_53">  the  Code</a>  of  Civil  Procedure.  The  said
Section reads as follows:-
</p><p id="p_75">“20. Repeals and Savings.-
</p>
<p id="p_76">(1)   If immediately before the date on  which  the  said  Code  comes  into
force in any Part B  State,  there  is  in  force  in  that  State  any  law
corresponding to the said Code, that law shall on that date stand repealed:
</p>
<p id="p_77">Provided that repeal shall not affect-
</p><p id="p_78">The previous operation of any law so  repealed  or  anything  duly  done  or
suffered thereunder, or
Any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued or  incurred
under any law so repealed, or
Any investigation, legal proceeding or remedy in respect of any such  right,
privilege, obligation,  liability,  penalty,  forfeiture  or  punishment  as
aforesaid and any such investigation, legal  proceeding  or  remedy  may  be
instituted, continued or enforced,  and  any  such  penalty,  forfeiture  or
punishment may be imposed as if this Act has not been passed.”

</p><p id="p_79">10.   Travancore-Cochin was a  princely  state  till  the  year  1956.   The
Constitution of India as originally enacted referred to princely  states  as
Part B states.  Apart from Travancore-Cochin, there were  7  other  princely
states which got assimilated into  India  by  the  Constitution.   Prior  to
1951,<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_54"> the Code</a> of Civil Procedure did not extend to  these  princely  states
as even the Adaptation of Laws Order of 1950 did  not  extend<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_55">  the  Code</a>  of
Civil Procedure to Part B States.  The 1951 amendment to<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_56"> the Code</a>  of  Civil
Procedure, for the first time, applied<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_57"> the Code</a> of Civil Procedure  to  Part
B States, and as a consequence repealed any law which  corresponded  to<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_58">  the
Code</a> of Civil Procedure in Part B States.  According  to  Shri  Viswanathan,
the Travancore-Cochin High Court Act, being a law corresponding to<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_59"> the  Code</a>
of Civil Procedure, was repealed, and <a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_60">Section 23</a>, being a part of  the  said
High Court’s Act, would also therefore stand  repealed.   For  this  purpose
Shri Viswanathan relied upon several  authorities.   First  he  relied  upon
<a href="/doc/225413/" id="a_61">Krishan Prasad Gupta v. Controller, Printing &amp; Stationery</a>, (1996) 1  SCC  69
to buttress this submission.  In this judgment, this Court had  to  consider
<a href="/doc/1290303/" id="a_62">Section  28</a>  of  the  Administrative  Tribunals  Act,  which   stated   that
authorities constituted under the  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_63">Industrial  Disputes  Act</a>  or  any  other
corresponding law for the time  being  in  force,  were  exempted  from  the
provisions  of  <a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_64">Section  28</a>.  In  construing  the  expression   “any   other
corresponding law” this  Court  relied  upon  a  New  Zealand  judgment  and
observed as follows:-
</p><p id="p_80">“The  word  ‘corresponding’  is  defined  in Shorter  Oxford   Dictionary as
“answering to in character and function; similar to.” This meaning has  been
adopted in Winter v.Ministry of Transport [1972 NZLR 539] in  which  it  has
been observed as under:
</p><p id="p_81">“We read ‘corresponding’ in <a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_65">Section 20-A</a> as including a new section  dealing
with the same subject-matter as the old one, in a manner or  with  a  result
not so far different from the old as to strain the accepted meaning  of  the
word ‘corresponding’ as given in  the Shorter  Oxford  English  Dictionary —
‘answering to in character and function;  similar  to’.  The  new  (section)
answers to the old one …  in  character  and  function;  it  is  similar  in
purpose, prescribes the same thing to be done, and is  designed  to  produce
the same result. We hold it to be a ‘corresponding’ section.”  (See Words  &amp;
Phrases, 3rd Edn., Vol. 1)

Our  conclusion,  therefore,   is   irresistible   that   the   ‘Authority’,
constituted under <a href="/doc/62125/" id="a_66">Section 15</a> and the appellate authority  under  <a href="/doc/1201492/" id="a_67">Section  17</a>
of the Payment of Wages Act, fall within the exception indicated in  <a href="/doc/1290303/" id="a_68">Section
28</a> of the Administrative Tribunals Act and  this  Act,  namely,  <a href="/doc/794158/" id="a_69">Payment  of
Wages Act</a>, is positively covered  by  the  connotation  “corresponding  law”
used in that section. Consequently, the jurisdiction  of  the  Authority  to
entertain and decide claim cases under <a href="/doc/1106018/" id="a_70">Section 15</a> of the  Payment  of  Wages
Act is not affected by the establishment of the  Administrative  Tribunals.”
[at paras 37 and 38]

The test laid down in this decision for a law to correspond  to  another  is
whether it deals essentially with the same subject matter as was dealt  with
by the old law.
</p><p id="p_82">11.   Similarly, in <a href="/doc/934856/" id="a_71">A.B. Abdulkadir &amp;  Others  v.  The  State  of  Kerala  &amp;
another</a> [1962] Suppl. 2 SCR 741, this Court dealt with <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_72">Section 13(2)</a> of  the
Finance Act which provided that on and from 1.4.1950, any law  corresponding
to the Central Excise and <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_73">Salt Act</a>,  1944  will  stand  repealed  from  that
date.  What had to be determined is whether the Cochin Tobacco Act had  been
so repealed.
</p>
<p id="p_83">12.   In arriving at the conclusion that the said Act had been so  repealed,
this Court held that the main object and purpose  of  both  Acts  being  the
same, namely to provide for control on tobacco from the  time  it  is  grown
till the time it reaches the ultimate seller, and the fact  that  both  Acts
levied an excise duty on tobacco, albeit in completely different  ways,  the
Cochin Act was said to correspond with the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_74">Central Excise Act</a>  in  that  the
main object and purpose of both Acts was in substance  the  same,  and  they
both dealt with the same subject matter,  namely,  control  of  the  tobacco
trade and the levying of excise duty on tobacco.
</p><p id="p_84">13.   Similarly, in <a href="/doc/553385/" id="a_75">The Custodian of Evacuee  Property,  Bangalore  v.  Khan
Saheb Abdul Shukoor</a>, etc. [1961] 3 SCR 855, the question before  this  Court
was whether a later Mysore Act had been repealed by an earlier  Mysore  Act.
It was held by this Court, that as both Acts dealt  with  evacuee  property,
the fact that the scheme under the second Act was different from  the  first
would make no difference as the subject matter that was dealt  with  was  in
substance the same.
</p><p id="p_85">14.   Applying the test laid down by the aforesaid decisions of this  Court,
namely, that the subject matter of the two statutes must essentially be  the
same and/or that the main object and  purpose  of  the  statutes  should  be
substantially similar, we find that the  Travancore-Cochin  High  Court  Act
formed the Charter for jurisdiction to be exercised by the said High  Court.
 This jurisdiction is exercised not only in civil matters but  criminal  and
other matters as well.  The main  object  and  purpose  of  the  Travancore-
Cochin Act is to lay down the jurisdiction and  powers  of  the  High  Court
that was established in the said State.  On  the  other  hand,  the  subject
matter<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_76"> of the Code</a> of Civil Procedure is to lay down procedure in all  civil
matters, and no others.  Also, the said  Code  would  apply  to  all  courts
which deal with civil matters, subject to the exceptions contained  therein,
and not only the High Court.  For this reason, it is difficult to  say  that<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_77">
the Code</a> of Civil Procedure corresponds to the Travancore-Cochin High  Court
Act.  Shri Viswanathan’s first contention must therefore fail.
</p><p id="p_86">15.   Shri  Viswanathan  also  relied  upon  two  High  Court  judgments  to
buttress his submission that the Travancore-Cochin High Court Act  had  been
repealed by the introduction<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_78"> of the Code</a> of Civil  Procedure  in  1951.   He
relied upon <a href="/doc/1635244/" id="a_79">Jelejar Hormosji Gotla v. The State of Andhra Pradesh</a>, AIR  1965
AP 288, in which the Andhra  Pradesh  High  Court  held      that  with  the
coming into force of Section  80  of  the  Code  of  Civil  Procedure,   the
Hyderabad   Suits   against   <a href="/doc/1393639/" id="a_80">Government        Act</a>   stood   repealed.   He
also  relied  upon  <a href="/doc/1693163/" id="a_81">Gurbinder   Singh  and   Others    v.   Lal  Singh   and
Others</a>,   AIR   1959    P&amp;H  123,   whereby     it   was held  that  <a href="/doc/794158/" id="a_82">Section
49(2)</a> of a Pepsu Ordinance had been repealed  by  the  introduction<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_83">  of  the
Code</a> of Civil Procedure by the 1951 <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_84">Amendment Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_87">16.   Neither of these decisions carries the matter  any  further.   In  the
Andhra Pradesh decision, the <a href="/doc/1666002/" id="a_85">Hyderabad  Act</a>  dealt  only  with  civil  suits
against the Government and thus dealt with civil  procedure  insofar  as  it
applied to such suits. In the  Punjab  and  Haryana  case,  the  High  Court
itself states that  the  Pepsu  Ordinance,  which  stood  repealed,  earlier
provided for the civil procedure to  be  applied  in  all  civil  courts  in
Pepsu.  Both cases, therefore, were cases in which the  repealed  Act  dealt
with the same subject  matter  as  the  corresponding  law,  that  is  civil
procedure.
</p><p id="p_88">17.   We now come to the main argument in this case, which  is  the  correct
construction of Section 4(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure.  The scheme  of
<a href="/doc/1013085/" id="a_86">Section 4(1)</a>, as its marginal note provides, is to  “save”  any  special  or
local law from the applicability of  the  Civil  Procedure  Code.  The  said
Section therefore states that whenever there is a special, local,  or  other
law which deals with any matter specified  in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_87">  the  Code</a>,  those  laws  will
continue to have full force and effect notwithstanding that they  deal  with
the same matter as is contained in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_88"> the Code</a> of Civil Procedure.  From  this,
however, an exception is carved  out,  and  that  exception  is  that  there
should not be any “specific provision to  the  contrary”  contained  in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_89">  the
Code</a> itself.
</p><p id="p_89">18.   At one point in time it was not clear  as  to  whether  such  specific
provision should be in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_90"> the Code</a> itself or could also  be  contained  in  any
other law.  In fact, in <a href="/doc/1865829/" id="a_91">Mati Lal Saha v. Chandra Kanta Sarkar &amp; Others</a>,  AIR
1947 Cal 1, the Calcutta High Court held that  such  specific  provision  to
the contrary could be contained in  a  third  Act,  namely,  the  <a href="/doc/997218/" id="a_92">Presidency
Small Causes Courts  Act</a>,  and  need  not  be  contained  even  in  the  two
competing  Acts,  namely<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_93">  the  Code</a>  of  Civil  Procedure   and   a   Bengal
Agricultural Debtors Act.
</p><p id="p_90">      At this point it is necessary to advert to the pari materia  provision
contained in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_94"> the Criminal Procedure Code</a>.   <a href="/doc/696759/" id="a_95">Section  1(2)</a>  of  the  Code  of
Criminal Procedure, 1898 stated:
</p><p id="p_91">“<a href="/doc/1145225/" id="a_96">Section 1</a>. Short title and commencement.
</p><p id="p_92">(2) It extends to the whole of India except the State of Jammu and  Kashmir;
but, in the absence of any  specific  provision  to  the  contrary,  nothing
herein contained shall affect any special or local law now in force, or  any
special jurisdiction or power conferred, or any special  form  of  procedure
prescribed, by any other law for the time being in force, or shall apply –

The Commissioners of Police in the towns of Calcutta, Madras and Bombay,  or
the police in the towns of Calcutta and Bombay;
</p><p id="p_93">Heads of villages in the State of Madras as it  existed  immediately  before
the 1st November, 1956; or
Village police-officers in the State of Bombay  as  it  existed  immediately
before the 1st November, 1956;
</p>
<p id="p_94">Provided that the State Government may, if it thinks  fit,  by  notification
in the Official Gazette, extend any of the provisions  of  this  Code,  with
any necessary modifications, to such excepted persons.
</p>
<p id="p_95">      In 1973, however, the new <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_97">Code  of</a>  Criminal  Procedure  repeated  the
same provision in <a href="/doc/1624119/" id="a_98">Section 5</a> as under:
</p><p id="p_96">“<a href="/doc/1624119/" id="a_99">Section 5</a> - Saving

Nothing  contained   in   this   Code   shall,   in   the   absence   of   a
specific provision to the contrary, affect any special or local law for  the
time being in force, or any special jurisdiction or power conferred, or  any
special form of procedure prescribed, by any other law for  the  time  being
in force.”

      It will be noticed that <a href="/doc/1036324/" id="a_100">Section  1(2)</a>  of  the  old  Code  corresponds
almost exactly to Section 4(1) of the Code of Civil  Procedure.  The  change
in phraseology in <a href="/doc/1624119/" id="a_101">Section 5</a> clarifies that what was intended  was  that  the
specific provision to the contrary should only  be  contained  in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_102">  the  Code</a>
itself and nowhere else.  Taking note of the  legislative  scheme  contained
in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_103"> the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure, we have no doubt  in  construing  <a href="/doc/1013085/" id="a_104">Section
4(1)</a> to say that the specific provision to the contrary  must  be  contained
in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_105"> the Code</a> of Civil Procedure itself and nowhere else.
</p><p id="p_97">19.   The next inquiry that needs to be made is what is the meaning  of  the
expression “specific provision to the contrary”.  <a href="/doc/1222748/" id="a_106">In Maru Ram  v.  Union  of
India and others</a>, (1981) 1 SCC 107, a  Constitution  Bench  dealt  with  the
pari materia provision to Section  4(1)  of  the  Code  of  Civil  Procedure
contained in <a href="/doc/1007660/" id="a_107">Section 5</a> of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure.   This  Court
relied upon the Lahore High Court and the Allahabad High  Court  to  explain
what is meant by “specific provision”. This Court held:-
“<a href="/doc/696759/" id="a_108">Section 1(2)</a>  of  the  Criminal  Procedure  Code,  1898,  is  the  previous
incarnation of Section 5 of the Present  Code  and  contains  virtually  the
same phraseology. The expression “specific provision  to  the  contrary”  in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_109">
the Code</a> of 1898 was considered in the two  Full  Bench  decisions  (supra).
The setting in which the issue was raised  was  precisely  similar  and  the
meaning of “specific provision to the contrary”  was  considered  by  Young,
C.J., in the Lahore case where the learned Judge  observed:  [AIR  1940  Lah
129, 133]
“The word ‘specific’ is defined in Murray's Oxford  Dictionary  as  ‘precise
or  exact  in  respect  of  fulfilment,  conditions  or   terms;   definite,
explicit’.”

In a similar situation, the same words fell for decision  in  the  Allahabad
case where Braund, J., discussed the  meaning  of  “specific  provision”  in
greater detail and observed: [AIR 1940 All 263, 269]
“I have, I confess, entertained some doubt as  to  what  exactly  the  words
'specific provision' mean. I think first, that they  must  denote  something
different from the words ‘express provision’. For a provision of  a  statute
to be an ‘express’ provision affecting another statute or  part  of  it,  it
would have, I think, to refer in so many words to the other  statute  or  to
the relevant portion of it and also to the effect intended  to  be  produced
on it. Failing this, it could hardly be said to be ‘express’  ....  But  the
word ‘specific’ denotes, to my mind, something less exacting than  the  word
‘express’. It means, I  think,  a  provision  which  ‘specifies’  that  some
‘special  law’  is  to  be  ‘affected’  by  that  particular  provision.   A
dictionary meaning of  the  verb  ‘to  specify’  as  given  in Murray's  New
English Dictionary, is ‘to mention, speak of or name (something)  definitely
or explicitly; to set down or state categorically or  particularly....’  and
a meaning of the adjective ‘specific’ in the  same  dictionary  is  ‘precise
... definite, explicit ... exactly named or indicated, or capable  of  being
so, precise, particular’.  What  I  think  the  words  ‘specific  provision’
really mean therefore is that  the  particular  provision<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_110">  of  the  Criminal
Procedure Code</a> must, in order to  ‘affect’  the  ‘special  …  law’,  clearly
indicate, in itself and not merely by  implication  to  be  drawn  from  the
statute generally, that the 'special law' in  question  is  to  be  affected
without necessarily referring to that ‘special law’  or  the  effect  on  it
intended to be produced in express terms. Lord Hatherley in (1898) 3 AC  933
at p. 938 [<a href="/doc/58749/" id="a_111">Thomas Challoner v. Henry  WF  Bolikow</a>,  (1878)  3  AC  933]  has
defined the word ‘specific’  in  common  parlance  of  language  as  meaning
‘distinct from general’…. It  would,  no  doubt,  be  possible  to  multiply
illustrations of analogous uses of the words ‘specify’ and  ‘specific’.  But
this is I think sufficient to show  that,  while  requiring  something  less
than what is ‘express’, they nevertheless require something which is  plain,
certain  and  intelligible  and  not  merely  a  matter  of   inference   or
implication to be drawn from the statute generally. That,  to  my  mind,  is
what is meant by the word ‘specific’ in Section 1(2) CPC....”


In an English case [ Re Net Book  Agreement,  1957,  (1962)  3  All  ER  751
(RPC)] Buckley, J., has interpreted the word  ‘specific’  to  mean  explicit
and definable. While Indian usage of English words often loses the  Atlantic
flavour and Indian Judges owe their fidelity to Indian  meaning  of  foreign
words and phrases, here East and  West  meet,  and  “specific”  is  specific
enough to avoid being vague and general. Fowler regards  this  word  related
to the central notion of species as distinguished from genus and  says  that
it is “often resorted to by those who have no clear idea  of  their  meaning
but hold it to diffuse an air of  educated  precision”.  [  Fowler's  Modern
English Usage, 2nd Edn., p. 574] Stroud [ Stroud's Judicial  Dictionary  Vol
4, 3rd Edn., p. 2836] says “specifically  ...”  means  “as  such”.  Black  [
Blacks Law Dictionary 4th Edn., p.  1571]  gives  among  other  things,  the
following meaning  for  “specific”:  definite,  explicit;  of  an  exact  or
particular nature ... particular; precise. While legalese  and  English  are
sometimes enemies we have to go by  judicialese  which  is  the  draftsman's
lexical guide.

<p id="p_98">The contrary view in the Biram case [(1976) 3 SCC 470 : 1976 SCC  (Cri)  428
: 1976 Supp SCR 552] is more assertive than  explanatory,  and  ipse  dixit,
even if judicial, do not validate themselves. We are inclined to agree  with
the  opinion  expressed  in  the  Lahore   and   Allahabad   cases.   [Biram
Sardar v. Emperor, AIR 1941 Bom 146 - [AIR 1939 PC 47 : 1939 IA 66 : 40  Cri
LJ 364] A thing is specific if it is explicit. It need not be  express.  The
antithesis is between “specific” and “indefinite” or “omnibus”  and  between
“implied” and “express”. What is precise, exact, definite and  explicit,  is
specific. Sometimes, what is specific may also be special but yet  they  are
distinct in semantics. From this angle,<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_112"> the Criminal  Procedure  Code</a>  is  a
general Code. The remission rules are special laws but <a href="/doc/794158/" id="a_113">Section  433-A</a>  is  a
specific, explicit, definite provision dealing with a  particular  situation
or narrow class of cases, as distinguished from the  general  run  of  cases
covered by  <a href="/doc/1464506/" id="a_114">Section  432</a>  CrPC.  <a href="/doc/794158/" id="a_115">Section  433-A</a>  picks  out  of  a  mass  of
imprisonment cases a specific class of life imprisonment cases and  subjects
it explicitly to a particularised treatment. It follows that  <a href="/doc/794158/" id="a_116">Section  433-A</a>
applies in preference  to  any  special  or  local  law  because  <a href="/doc/1624119/" id="a_117">Section  5</a>
expressly declares that specific provisions, if any, to  the  contrary  will
prevail over any special or local law. We  have  said  enough  to  make  the
point that “specific” is  specific  enough  and  even  though  “special”  to
“specific” is near allied and “thin partition do their  bounds  divide”  the
two are different. <a href="/doc/794158/" id="a_118">Section 433-A</a> escapes the exclusion of
<a href="/doc/1624119/" id="a_119">Section 5</a>. [at paras 35 – 38]

</p><p id="p_99">20.   Thus, “specific provision” must mean that the particular provision  in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_120">
the Code</a> of Civil Procedure must clearly indicate in itself and  not  merely
by implication that the special law in question is to be  affected.   It  is
important to note that one of the meanings of the word  “specific”  is  that
it is distinct from something that is general. In Maru Ram’s  case,  <a href="/doc/237247/" id="a_121">Section
433A</a> of the Code of  Criminal  Procedure,  1973,  was  challenged  as  being
against  various  provisions  of  the  Constitution.   That  challenge   was
repelled by this Court.  <a href="/doc/794158/" id="a_122">Section 433-A</a> begins with  a  non  obstante  clause
specifically dealing with a particular situation, that is, where a  sentence
of imprisonment  for   life  is  imposed   in  certain  circumstances,  then
notwithstanding the commutation power contained in <a href="/doc/794158/" id="a_123">Section 433</a>, such  person
is not to be released from prison unless he has served at least 14 years  of
imprisonment. In applying <a href="/doc/1007660/" id="a_124">Section 5</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure,  1973
to <a href="/doc/794158/" id="a_125">Section 433A</a>, great emphasis  was  placed  on  the  non  obstante  clause
contained in <a href="/doc/794158/" id="a_126">Section 433A</a>, and it was  ultimately  held  that  <a href="/doc/794158/" id="a_127">Section  433A</a>
picks out of a mass of imprisonment cases a specific type of case –  namely,
life  imprisonment  cases  and  subjects  such   cases   explicitly   to   a
particularized treatment.  It was for this reason  that  <a href="/doc/794158/" id="a_128">Section  433-A</a>  was
held to be a specific provision to the contrary to the  Prison  Rules  which
were subsumed in the general provision contained in <a href="/doc/1464506/" id="a_129">Section 432</a> of the  Code
of Criminal Procedure, 1973.
</p><p id="p_100">21.    It is in this primary sense that the expression “specific  provision”
is used in Section 4(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure because, as  we  have
seen above, it carves out an exception to  special,  local,  or  other  laws
which deal with the same subject matter as<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_130"> the Code</a> of Civil  Procedure  but
get overridden by<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_131"> the Code</a> of Civil Procedure.
</p><p id="p_101">22.   Viewed in this perspective, we have to discover  whether  the  various
provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_132"> of the Code</a> of Civil Procedure referred to  by  Shri  Viswanathan
can be said to be “specific provisions to the contrary” for the  purpose  of
Section 4(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure.
</p><p id="p_102">23.   <a href="/doc/794158/" id="a_133">Section 117</a> is a general provision which applies<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_134"> the Code</a> to the  High
Courts  of  this  country.   Similarly,  <a href="/doc/794158/" id="a_135">Section  120</a>  is  another   general
provision which states that <a href="/doc/817841/" id="a_136">Section 16</a>, <a href="/doc/1929318/" id="a_137">17</a> and <a href="/doc/1670661/" id="a_138">20</a> of the Code do  not  apply
to the High  Courts  in  exercise  of  their  original  civil  jurisdiction.
<a href="/doc/794158/" id="a_139">Sections 122</a>, <a href="/doc/794158/" id="a_140">125</a> and <a href="/doc/794158/" id="a_141">129</a> equally are general provisions  and  not  specific
to the case at hand, namely, what is to happen  if  two  Judges  hearing  an
appeal differ with each other.  This leaves <a href="/doc/794158/" id="a_142">Section 98</a>, which will be  dealt
with a little later in this judgment.
</p><p id="p_103">24.   Shri Viswanathan also relied upon a Division Bench  judgment  of  this
Court in <a href="/doc/327719/" id="a_143">Kulwant Kaur and Others v. Gurdial Singh Mann</a>  (dead)  by  LRS  and
Others, (2001) 4 SCC 262, to submit that this decision is an  authority  for
the proposition that there is no need to expressly  refer  to  a  local  law
when the legislative intent to repeal local laws inconsistent with<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_144"> the  Code</a>
of Civil Procedure is otherwise clear.
</p><p id="p_104">      The judgment in Kulwant Kaur’s case raised a question which  arose  on
an application of Section 41 of the Punjab Courts Act, 1918.   This  Section
was couched in language  similar  to  Section  100  of  the  Code  of  Civil
Procedure as it existed before<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_145"> the Code</a> of <a href="/doc/1645922/" id="a_146">Civil Procedure (Amendment)  Act</a>,
1976, which amended <a href="/doc/794158/" id="a_147">Section 100</a> to  make  it  more  restrictive  so  that  a
second appeal could only be filed if there was  a  substantial  question  of
law involved in the matter. The question this Court posed before itself  was
whether <a href="/doc/794158/" id="a_148">Section 41</a> stood repealed by virtue of Section 97(1) of the Code  of
Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1976, which reads as under:-
</p><p id="p_105">      “97. Repeal and savings

(1) Any amendment made, or any provision inserted in the principal Act by  a
State Legislature or a High  Court  before  the  commencement  of  this  Act
shall, except insofar as such amendment or provision is consistent with  the
provisions of the principal Act as amended by this Act, stand repealed.”

      This Court concluded that Section 41 of  the  Punjab  Courts  Act  was
repealed because it would amount to an amendment made or provision  inserted
in the principal Act by a State Legislature.  This Court further held  that,
in any event, Section 41 of the Punjab Courts Act being a law  made  by  the
Legislature of a State is repugnant to  a  later  law  made  by  Parliament,
namely, Section 97(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act,  1976,
and that therefore, by virtue  of  the  operation  of  <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_149">Article  254</a>  of  the
Constitution of India, the said provision is in  any  case  overridden.   In
arriving at the aforesaid two conclusions, this Court held:-
“Now we proceed to examine <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_150">Section  97(1)</a>  of  the  Amendment  Act  and  the
amendment of Section 100 CPC by the said 1976 Act. Through  this  amendment,
right to second appeal stands further restricted only  to  lie  where,  “the
case involves a substantial question of law.” This  introduction  definitely
is in conflict with <a href="/doc/1328349/" id="a_151">Section 41</a> of the Punjab Act which was in  pari  materia
with unamended  Section  100  CPC.  Thus  so  long  there  was  no  specific
provision to the contrary in this Code,  Section  4  CPC  saved  special  or
local law. But after it comes in conflict, Section 4 CPC would not save,  on
the contrary its language implied would  make  such  special  or  local  law
inapplicable. We may examine now the submission for the respondent based  on
the language of Section 100(1)  CPC  even  after  the  said  amendment.  The
reliance is on the following words:
</p><p id="p_106">“100. (1) Save as otherwise expressly provided … by any other  law  for  the
time being in force….”
These words existed even prior to the amendment and are  unaffected  by  the
amendment. Thus so far it could  legitimately  be  submitted  that,  reading
this part of the section in isolation it saves the local law. But  this  has
to be read with <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_152">Section 97(1)</a> of the Amendment Act, which reads:
“97. (1) Any amendment made, or any provision inserted in the principal  Act
by a State Legislature or a High Court before the commencement of  this  Act
shall, except insofar as such amendment or provision is consistent with  the
provisions of the principal Act as amended by  this  Act,  stand  repealed.”
(Noticed again for convenience.)

Thus language of <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_153">Section 97(1)</a> of the Amendment Act clearly spells out  that
any local law which can be termed to be inconsistent perishes, but if it  is
not so, the local law would continue to occupy its field.
</p>
<p id="p_107">Since <a href="/doc/1328349/" id="a_154">Section 41</a> of the  Punjab  Act  is  expressly  in  conflict  with  the
amending law, viz., <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_155">Section 100</a> as amended, it would be deemed to have  been
repealed. Thus we have no hesitation to hold that the law  declared  by  the
Full Bench of the High Court in the case of Ganpat [AIR 1978 P&amp;H  137  :  80
Punj LR 1 (FB)] cannot be sustained and is thus overruled.” [at paras  27  –
29]

</p><p id="p_108">25.   We are afraid that this judgment does not state the law  correctly  on
both propositions.  First and foremost, when Section 97(1) of  the  Code  of
Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1976 speaks of any amendment  made  or  any
provision inserted in the principal Act by virtue of  a   State  Legislature
or a High Court, the said Section refers  only  to  amendments  made  and/or
provisions  inserted  in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_156">  the  Code</a>  of  Civil  Procedure  itself  and   not
elsewhere.  This is clear from the expression “principal Act”  occurring  in
<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_157">Section 97(1)</a>.  What <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_158">Section 97(1)</a> really does is  to  state  that  where  a
State Legislature makes an amendment in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_159"> the Code</a> of Civil  Procedure,  which
amendment will apply only within the four corners of the State,  being  made
under Entry 13 of List III of  the  7th  Schedule  to  the  Constitution  of
India, such amendment shall stand repealed if it is  inconsistent  with  the
provisions of the principal Act as amended by  the  Parliamentary  enactment
contained in the 1976 amendment to<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_160"> the Code</a> of  Civil  Procedure.   This  is
further made clear by the reference in <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_161">Section 97(1)</a> to a High  Court.   The
expression “any provision inserted in the principal Act”  by  a  High  Court
has reference to Section 122 of the Code of Civil Procedure  by  which  High
Courts may make rules regulating their own procedure, and the  procedure  of
civil courts subject to their superintendence, and may by such rules  annul,
alter, or add to any of the rules contained in the  first  schedule  to<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_162">  the
Code</a> of Civil Procedure.
</p><p id="p_109">26.   Thus, Kulwant Kaur’s decision on the application of Section  97(1)  of
the Code of Civil Procedure Amendment Act, is not correct in law.
</p><p id="p_110">27.   Even the  reference  to  <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_163">Article  254</a>  of  the  Constitution  was  not
correctly made by this Court in  the  said  decision.   Section  41  of  the
Punjab Courts Act is of 1918 vintage.  Obviously, therefore,  it  is  not  a
law made by the Legislature of a State after the Constitution of  India  has
come into force. It is a law made by a Provincial Legislature under  Section
80A of the Government of India Act, 1915, which law was continued,  being  a
law in force in British India, immediately before the  commencement  of  the
Government of India Act, 1935, by <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_164">Section 292</a> thereof. In  turn,  after  the
Constitution of India came into force and,  by  <a href="/doc/493040/" id="a_165">Article  395</a>,  repealed  the
Government of India Act, 1935, the Punjab Courts Act was continued  being  a
law in force in the territory of India immediately before  the  commencement
of  the  Constitution  of  India  by  virtue  of  <a href="/doc/162232/" id="a_166">Article  372(1)</a>   of   the
Constitution  of  India.   This  being  the  case,  <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_167">Article   254</a>   of   the
Constitution of India would have no  application  to  such  a  law  for  the
simple reason that it is not a law made by the Legislature of  a  State  but
is an existing law continued by virtue of <a href="/doc/74529/" id="a_168">Article 372</a>  of  the  Constitution
of India. If at all, it is <a href="/doc/162232/" id="a_169">Article 372(1)</a> alone that  would  apply  to  such
law which is to continue in force until altered or repealed or amended by  a
competent Legislature or other competent authority.  We have  already  found
that since Section 97(1) of the Code of  Civil  Procedure  (Amendment)  Act,
1976 has no application to Section 41 of the Punjab  Courts  Act,  it  would
necessarily continue as a law in force.  Shri  Viswanathan’s  reliance  upon
this authority therefore does not lead his argument any further.
</p><p id="p_111">28.    Shri  Viswanathan  drew  our  attention  to  <a href="/doc/1648955/" id="a_170">Section  29(2)</a>  of   the
Limitation Act which reads thus:-
</p><p id="p_112">“29. Saving.
</p><p id="p_113">(2) Where any special or local  law  prescribes  for  any  suit,  appeal  or
application a period of limitation different from the period  prescribed  by
the Schedule, the provisions of <a href="/doc/1063385/" id="a_171">section 3</a> shall  apply  as  if  such  period
were  the  period  prescribed  by  the  Schedule  and  for  the  purpose  of
determining any period of limitation prescribed  for  any  suit,  appeal  or
application by any  special  or  local  law,  the  provisions  contained  in
<a href="/doc/1587307/" id="a_172">sections 4</a> to <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_173">24</a> (inclusive) shall apply only in  so  far  as,  and  to  the
extent to which, they are not expressly excluded by such  special  or  local
law.”

</p><p id="p_114">29.   He also referred us to  various  judgments,  namely,  <a href="/doc/1906339/" id="a_174">Hukumdev  Narain
Yadav v. Lalit Narain Mishra</a>, (1974) 2 SCC 133 at  page  Nos.146-147,  (para
</p><p id="p_115">17), <a href="/doc/1036771/" id="a_175">Anwari Basavaraj Patil v. Siddaramaiah</a>, (1993) 1 SCC 636, at  page  639
(para 8), <a href="/doc/1740415/" id="a_176">Gopal Sardar v. Karuna Sardar</a>, (2004) 4 SCC 252 at page 264  (para
</p><p id="p_116">13), which  construed  the  expression  “expressly  excluded”  as  including
something that one can derive from the scheme and words used  in  a  statute
without necessarily referring to the subject matter at hand specifically.
</p><p id="p_117">30.   The three decisions cited by him do not carry the matter much  further
for the simple reason that the  expression  “express  exclusion”  is  to  be
gleaned from the special or local law  and  not  from  the  <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_177">Limitation  Act</a>.
<a href="/doc/1648955/" id="a_178">Section 29(2)</a> of the Limitation Act thus differs from Section  4(1)  of  the
Code of Civil Procedure in  a  very  important  respect,  namely,  that  the
specific or express exclusion must be contained  in  the  special  or  local
law, so far as the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_179">Limitation Act</a>, 1963 is concerned, as opposed to  Section
4(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure, where we have to look for the  specific
exclusion in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_180"> the Code</a> of Civil Procedure itself, and not in the  special  or
local law.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  the  judgments  cited  by  Shri
Viswanathan embarked upon a survey of the scheme of  the  <a href="/doc/320017/" id="a_181">Representation  of
the People Act</a>, 1951, and the West Bengal Land Reforms Act, 1955,  and  held
that  the  said  Acts  were  a  complete  Code  dealing  with  elections  to
Parliament and to preemptions in the State  of  West  Bengal,  respectively,
which expressly excluded <a href="/doc/100581/" id="a_182">Section 5</a> of the Limitation  Act.  In  the  present
case, there is no question of examining the scheme of the  Travancore-Cochin
High Court Act to see whether it  contains  any  provision  which  expressly
excludes the applicability<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_183"> of the Code</a> of Civil Procedure.
</p><p id="p_118">31.   This brings us to the main contention urged by both  parties,  namely,
whether the Constitution Bench in Sathappan’s  case  (supra)  concludes  the
issue in the present case.
</p><p id="p_119">32.   Since the judgment in Sathappan’s case was  strongly  relied  upon  by
both sides, we need to refer to it in  a  little  detail.  Sathappan  was  a
judgment which dealt with the correct interpretation of Section 104  of  the
Code of Civil Procedure.  <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_184">Section 104</a> provides:
</p><p id="p_120">“<a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_185">Section 104</a> - Orders from which appeal lies 

 An appeal shall lie from  the  following  orders,  and  save  as  otherwise
expressly provided in the body of this Code or  by  any  law  for  the  time
being in force, from no other orders:--
</p>

<p id="p_121">*     *     *    *     *    *     *    *


Provided that no appeal shall lie against  any  order  specified  in  clause
(ff) save on the ground that no order, or an order  for  the  payment  of  a
less amount, ought to have been made.
</p>

<p id="p_122">No appeal shall lie from any order passed in  appeal  under  this  section.”
[at para 6]

</p><p id="p_123">33.   The question which arose before this Court was whether Letters  Patent
Appeals, which were referred to in “any other law  for  the  time  being  in
force”, and therefore outside <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_186">Section 104(1)</a>, could be said to  be  governed
by <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_187">Section 104(2)</a> which provided that no appeal shall  lie  from  any  order
passed in  appeal  under  this  Section.   After  noticing  several  earlier
judgments of this Court, this Court concluded:-
</p><p id="p_124">“Thus the unanimous view of all courts till 1996  was  that  Section  104(1)
CPC specifically saved letters patent appeals  and  the  bar  under  <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_188">Section
104(2)</a> did not apply to letters patent appeals. The view  has  been  that  a
letters patent appeal cannot be ousted by implication but the  right  of  an
appeal under the Letters Patent can be taken away by  an  express  provision
in an appropriate legislation. The express provision need not  refer  to  or
use the words “letters patent” but if on a reading of the  provision  it  is
clear that all further appeals are barred then even a letters patent  appeal
would be barred.” [at para 22]

This Court then went on to hold:
</p><p id="p_125">“Thus, the consensus of judicial opinion has been  that  Section  104(1)  of
the Civil Procedure Code expressly saves a letters patent  appeal.  At  this
stage it would be appropriate to analyse Section 104  CPC.  Sub-section  (1)
of Section 104 CPC provides for an appeal from the orders  enumerated  under
sub-section (1) which contemplates an  appeal  from  the  orders  enumerated
therein, as also appeals expressly provided in the body<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_189"> of the  Code</a>  or  by
any law for the time being in force. Sub-section (1) therefore  contemplates
three types of orders from which appeals are provided, namely,
(1) orders enumerated in sub-section (1),
(2) appeals otherwise expressly provided in the body<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_190"> of the Code</a>, and
(3) appeals provided by any law for the time being in force.
It is not disputed that an appeal provided under the Letters Patent  of  the
High Court is an appeal provided by a law for the time being in force.
</p>
<p id="p_126">As such if an appeal is expressly saved by <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_191">Section 104(1)</a>,  sub-section  (2)
cannot apply to such an appeal. <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_192">Section 104</a> has  to  be  read  as  a  whole.
Merely reading sub-section (2) by ignoring the saving clause in  sub-section
(1) would lead to a conflict between the two sub-sections. Read as  a  whole
and on well-established principles of interpretation it is clear  that  sub-
section (2) can only apply to  appeals  not  saved  by  sub-section  (1)  of
<a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_193">Section 104</a>. The finality provided  by  sub-section  (2)  only  attaches  to
orders passed in appeal under <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_194">Section 104</a> i.e. those  orders  against  which
an appeal under “any  other  law  for  the  time  being  in  force”  is  not
permitted. <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_195">Section 104(2)</a> would  not  thus  bar  a  letters  patent  appeal.
Effect must also be given to legislative intent  of  introducing  Section  4
CPC and the words “by any law for  the  time  being  in  force”  in  <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_196">Section
104(1)</a>. This was done to give effect to  the  Calcutta,  Madras  and  Bombay
views that <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_197">Section 104</a> did not bar  a  Letters  Patent  appeal.  As  appeals
under “any other law for the time  being  in  force”  undeniably  include  a
letters patent appeal, such appeals are now specifically saved. <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_198">Section  104</a>
must be read as a whole and harmoniously. If the intention  was  to  exclude
what is specifically saved in sub-section  (1),  then  there  had  to  be  a
specific exclusion.  A  general  exclusion  of  this  nature  would  not  be
sufficient. We are not saying that a general exclusion would  never  oust  a
letters patent appeal. However, when <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_199">Section  104(1)</a>  specifically  saves  a
letters patent appeal then the only way such an appeal could be excluded  is
by express mention in <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_200">Section 104(2)</a> that a letters patent  appeal  is  also
prohibited. It is for this reason that Section  4  of  the  Civil  Procedure
Code provides as follows:
</p><p id="p_127">“4. Savings.—(1) In the absence of any specific provision to  the  contrary,
nothing in this Code shall be  deemed  to  limit  or  otherwise  affect  any
special or local law now in force  or  any  special  jurisdiction  or  power
conferred, or any special form of procedure  prescribed,  by  or  under  any
other law for the time being in force.
</p><p id="p_128">(2)  In  particular  and  without  prejudice  to  the  generality   of   the
proposition contained in sub-section (1), nothing  in  this  Code  shall  be
deemed to limit or  otherwise  affect  any  remedy  which  a  landholder  or
landlord may have under any  law  for  the  time  being  in  force  for  the
recovery of rent of agricultural land from the produce of such land.”
As stated hereinabove, a specific exclusion may be clear from the  words  of
a statute even though no specific reference is made to Letters  Patent.  But
where there is  an  express  saving  in  the  statute/section  itself,  then
general words to the effect that “an appeal would not lie”  or  “order  will
be final” are not sufficient. In such cases i.e. where there is  an  express
saving, there must be an express exclusion. Sub-section (2) of  <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_201">Section  104</a>
does not provide for any express exclusion. In this  context  reference  may
be made to <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_202">Section 100-A</a>. The present <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_203">Section 100-A</a>  was  amended  in  2002.
The earlier <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_204">Section 100-A</a>, introduced in 1976, reads as follows:
“100-A. No  further  appeal  in  certain   cases.—Notwithstanding   anything
contained in any  Letters  Patent  for  any  High  Court  or  in  any  other
instrument having the force of law or in any other law for  the  time  being
in force, where any appeal from an appellate decree or order  is  heard  and
decided by a Single Judge of a High Court, no further appeal shall lie  from
the judgment, decision or order of such Single Judge in such appeal or  from
any decree passed in such appeal.”
It is thus to be seen that when the legislature wanted to exclude a  letters
patent appeal it specifically did so. The words used in  <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_205">Section  100-A</a>  are
not by way of abundant caution. <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_206">By the Amendment Act</a>s of  1976  and  2002  a
specific exclusion is provided as the legislature knew that in  the  absence
of such words a letters patent appeal would not be barred.  The  legislature
was aware that it had incorporated the saving clause in <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_207">Section  104(1)</a>  and
incorporated Section 4 CPC. Thus now  a  specific  exclusion  was  provided.
After 2002, <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_208">Section 100-A</a> reads as follows:
</p><p id="p_129">“100-A. No  further  appeal  in  certain   cases.—Notwithstanding   anything
contained in any Letters Patent for any High  Court  or  in  any  instrument
having the force of law or in any other law for the  time  being  in  force,
where any appeal from an original or appellate decree or order is heard  and
decided by a Single Judge of a High Court, no further appeal shall lie  from
the judgment and decree of such Single Judge.”
To be noted that here again the legislature  has  provided  for  a  specific
exclusion. It must be stated that now by virtue of <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_209">Section 100-A</a> no  letters
patent appeal would be maintainable. However, it  is  an  admitted  position
that the law which would prevail would be the law at the relevant  time.  At
the relevant time neither <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_210">Section 100-A</a> nor <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_211">Section 104(2)</a> barred a  letters
patent appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_130">Applying the above principle to the facts of this  case,  the  appeal  under
clause 15 of the Letters Patent is an appeal provided by a law for the  time
being in force. Therefore, the finality contemplated by sub-section  (2)  of
<a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_212">Section 104</a> did not attach to an appeal passed under such law.
</p>
<p id="p_131">It was next submitted that clause 44  of  the  Letters  Patent  showed  that
Letters Patent were subject to amendment and alteration.  It  was  submitted
that this showed that a Letters Patent  was  a  subordinate  or  subservient
piece of law. Undoubtedly, clause 44  permits  amendment  or  alteration  of
Letters Patent, but then which legislation is not subject  to  amendment  or
alteration? CPC is also subject to amendments and alterations.  In  fact  it
has been amended on a number of occasions. The only  unalterable  provisions
are the basic structure of our  Constitution.  Merely  because  there  is  a
provision for amendment does not mean that, in the absence of  an  amendment
or a contrary provision, the Letters Patent is  to  be  ignored.  To  submit
that a Letters Patent is a  subordinate  piece  of  legislation  is  to  not
understand the true nature of a Letters Patent. As has been  held  in Vinita
Khanolkar case [(1998) 1 SCC 500] and Sharda Devi case [(2002) 3 SCC 705]  a
Letters Patent is the charter of the High Court.  As  held  in Shah  Babulal
Khimji case[(1981) 4 SCC 8] a Letters  Patent  is  the  specific  law  under
which a High Court derives its powers. It is not any  subordinate  piece  of
legislation. As set out in the aforementioned two  cases  a  Letters  Patent
cannot be excluded by implication. Further it is settled law that between  a
special law and a general  law  the  special  law  will  always  prevail.  A
Letters Patent is a special law for the  High  Court  concerned.  The  Civil
Procedure Code is a general law  applicable  to  all  courts.  It  is  well-
settled law, that in the event of a conflict between a  special  law  and  a
general law, the special  law  must  always  prevail.  We  see  no  conflict
between the Letters Patent and <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_213">Section 104</a> but if  there  was  any  conflict
between a Letters Patent and the Civil Procedure Code  then  the  provisions
of the Letters Patent would always  prevail  unless  there  was  a  specific
exclusion. This is also clear from Section 4 of  the  Civil  Procedure  Code
which provides that nothing in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_214"> the Code</a> shall limit or  affect  any  special
law. As set out in Section 4 CPC only a specific provision to  the  contrary
can exclude the special law. The specific provision  would  be  a  provision
like <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_215">Section 100-A</a>.” [at paras 29 – 32]

</p><p id="p_132">34.   Based on the  aforementioned  extracts  from  the  Constitution  Bench
decision, Shri Viswanathan sought to urge that  a  specific  exclusion  need
not refer to the very provision that is sought to be  excluded  but  it  was
enough if the subject matter at hand is referred to and  that  therefore  it
is not necessary for any  provision  in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_216">  the  Code</a>  of  Civil  Procedure  to
expressly refer to Section 23 of the Travancore-Cochin High Court  Act,  but
that it would be enough that on a reading of the said provision it would  be
clear that the particular special, local, or other law would not apply.
</p><p id="p_133">35.   As has been stated by us above, for the exclusion to be  specific,  we
must first hold that the provision contained in <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_217">Section 98(2)</a> is special  as
against Section 23 of the Travancore-Cochin High Court  Act.   This  we  are
afraid we cannot do, as it would be in the teeth of the  Constitution  Bench
judgment in Sathappan’s case, in  particular  paragraph  32  thereof.   This
Court has unequivocally held that a Letters Patent is a special law for  the
High court concerned,<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_218"> the Code</a>  of  Civil  Procedure  being  a  general  law
applicable to all courts, and that it is well settled that in the  event  of
a conflict between the two, the special law must  always  prevail.   In  the
present case, substitute the words “High Court’s Act” for “Letters  Patent”.
What follows is that the High Court’s Act is a  special  law  for  the  High
Court concerned,<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_219"> the Code</a> of Civil Procedure being a general law  applicable
to all courts. This according to us really concludes the  matter  in  favour
of the appellants.    Hemalatha’s case (supra) has  therefore  been  wrongly
decided and must therefore be overruled.
</p><p id="p_134">36.   Shri Viswanathan referred various judgments to us on the  applications
of the general versus special principle.  In particular he  relied  strongly
on <a href="/doc/791872/" id="a_220">Life Insurance Corporation of India v. D.J. Bahadur and Others</a>, (1981)  1
SCC 315. The question that arose before this Court in that case was  whether
the <a href="/doc/1643240/" id="a_221">Life Insurance Corporation Act</a>,  1956  is  a  special  statute  qua  the
<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_222">Industrial  Disputes  Act</a>,  1947  when  it  came  to  a  dispute   regarding
conditions of service of the employees of the Life Insurance Corporation  of
India.  This Court ultimately held that the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_223">Industrial  Disputes  Act</a>  would
prevail over the <a href="/doc/1643240/" id="a_224">Life Insurance Corporation of India Act</a> as  the  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_225">Industrial
Disputes Act</a> relates  specially  and  specifically  to  industrial  disputes
between workmen and employers, whereas the <a href="/doc/1643240/" id="a_226">LIC  Act</a>  is  a  general  statute
which is silent on what happens to disputes between management and  workmen.
 The fact that the <a href="/doc/1643240/" id="a_227">LIC Act</a> must be considered to be  a  special  legislation
regulating the takeover of private insurance business not being relevant  to
the subject matter at hand would not  make  the  said  Act  special  in  any
sense.  The working test laid down by this Court to determine which  statute
is general and which special, is laid down  in  paragraph  52  of  the  said
judgment thus:-
</p>
<p id="p_135">“In determining whether a statute is a special or a general one,  the  focus
must be on the principal subject-matter  plus  the  particular  perspective.
For certain purposes, an Act may be general and for certain  other  purposes
it may be special and we cannot blur distinctions when  dealing  with  finer
points of law. In law, we have a cosmos of relativity, not  absolutes  —  so
too  in  life.  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_228">The  ID  Act</a>  is  a  special  statute  devoted   wholly   to
investigation  and  settlement  of  industrial   disputes   which   provides
definitionally for the nature  of  industrial  disputes  coming  within  its
ambit. It creates an infrastructure for investigation into, solution of  and
adjudication upon  industrial  disputes.  It  also  provides  the  necessary
machinery for enforcement of awards and settlements.  From  alpha  to  omega
the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_229">ID Act</a> has one special mission — the resolution of  industrial  disputes
through specialised agencies according to specialised  procedures  and  with
special reference to the weaker categories of employees  coming  within  the
definition of workmen. Therefore,  with  reference  to  industrial  disputes
between employers and workmen, the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_230">ID Act</a> is a special statute, and the  <a href="/doc/1643240/" id="a_231">LIC
Act</a> does not speak at all with specific reference to workmen. On  the  other
hand, its powers relate  to  the  general  aspects  of  nationalisation,  of
management when private businesses  are  nationalised  and  a  plurality  of
problems which,  incidentally,  involve  transfer  of  service  of  existing
employees of insurers. The  workmen  qua  workmen  and  industrial  disputes
between workmen and the employer as such, are beyond the orbit of  and  have
no specific or special place in the scheme of  the  <a href="/doc/1643240/" id="a_232">LIC  Act</a>.  And  whenever
there was a dispute between workmen and management the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_233">ID Act</a> mechanism  was
resorted to.”

</p><p id="p_136">37.   Applying the aforesaid test, we  have  no  doubt  that  the  principal
subject matter contained in the present case is   appeals  before  the  High
Court of Kerala. The particular perspective that we are  concerned  with  is
what is to happen, in such appeals, if there  is  a  difference  of  opinion
between two Judges hearing such appeals in  the  High  Court.   Viewed  from
this perspective there can be no doubt that the subject matter  pertains  to
appeals in the High Court alone and not other  courts.   Those  appeals  can
deal with civil, criminal, and other matters.   The  particular  perspective
therefore demands the application of a uniform rule  to  all  such  appeals,
which rule is provided by the special rule contained in Section  23  of  the
Travancore-Cochin High Court Act, which in turn displaces the  general  rule
which applies under Section 98(2) of the Code  of  Civil  Procedure  to  all
Courts and in civil proceedings only.
</p><p id="p_137">38.   Viewed from another  perspective,  even  the  topics  for  legislation
contained in the 7th Schedule of the Constitution of India would  show  that
civil procedure is dealt with differently from jurisdiction  and  powers  of
courts. In this regard  the  relevant  entries  in  the  7th  Schedule  make
interesting reading:-
</p><p id="p_138">      “1.   List III entry 13
</p><p id="p_139">13. Civil procedure, including all matters included in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_234">  the  Code</a>  of  Civil
Procedure  at  the  commencement  of  this  Constitution,   limitation   and
arbitration.
</p>
<p id="p_140">2.    List I entry 95

</p><p id="p_141">95. Jurisdiction and powers of all courts, except the  Supreme  Court,  with
respect to any of the matters in this List; admiralty jurisdiction.
</p>
<p id="p_142">3.    List II entry 65

</p><p id="p_143">65. Jurisdiction and powers of all courts, except the  Supreme  Court,  with
respect to any of the matters in this List.
</p>
<p id="p_144">4.    List III entry 46

</p><p id="p_145">46. Jurisdiction and powers of all courts, except the  Supreme  Court,  with
respect to any of the matters in this List.”


</p><p id="p_146">39.   We now turn to the arguments based on Section 98(3)  of  the  Code  of
Civil Procedure.
</p><p id="p_147">40.   As has been stated hereinabove, <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_235">Section 98(3)</a> was  introduced  in  the
year 1928 when all the High Courts in British India were  governed  only  by
the Letters Patent establishing them.  The reason for  the  introduction  of
the said Section goes back to the landmark judgment of the Privy Council  in
Bhaidas’ case and  various  other  judgments  following  the  said  landmark
judgment.
</p><p id="p_148">41.   In Bhaidas’ case (supra), the Privy  Council  had  to  decide  whether
clause 36 of the Letters Patent would prevail over Section 98  of  the  Code
of Civil Procedure.  Clause 36 of the Letters Patent was similar to  Section
23 of the Travancore-Cochin  High  Court  Act.   The  Privy  Council,  after
setting out Section 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure, held:-
“There is no specific provision in <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_236">section 98</a>, and there is a  special  form
of procedure which was already prescribed. That form  of  procedure  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_237">section
98</a> does not, in their Lordships’ opinion, affect. The  consequence  is  that
the appellant is right in saying that in this instance a  wrong  course  was
taken when this case was referred to other Judges for decision,  and  he  is
technically entitled to a decree in accordance  with  the  judgment  of  the
Chief Justice. This view of the section  is  not  novel,  for  it  has  been
supported by judgments in Madras, in Allahabad and in Calcutta.”

</p><p id="p_149">42.   The controversy which reared its head  after  the  aforesaid  judgment
was as to whether appeals under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_238"> the Code</a> of Civil Procedure, being  referred
to in clause 16 of the Letters Patent, would also be covered by  clause  36.
In order to appreciate the aforesaid controversy, it  is  necessary  to  set
out clauses 15, 16 and 36 of the Letters Patent as follows:-
“Clause 15. Appeal from the courts of  original  jurisdiction  to  the  High
Court in its appellate jurisdiction:-
</p>
<p id="p_150">And we do further ordain that an appeal shall lie to the said High Court  of
Judicature at Madras, Bombay, Fort William in Bengal from the judgment  (not
being a judgment  passed  in  the  exercise  of  appellate  jurisdiction  in
respect of a decree or order made in the exercise of appellate  jurisdiction
by a Court subject to the superintendence of the said  High  Court  and  not
being an order made in the exercise  of  revisional  jurisdiction,  and  not
being a sentence or order passed  or  made  in  exercise  of  the  power  of
superintendence under the provisions of Section 107  of  the  Government  of
India Act, or in the exercise of criminal jurisdiction) of one Judge of  the
said High Court or one Judge of any Division Court, pursuant to Section  108
of  the  Government  of  India  Act,  and  that   notwithstanding   anything
hereinbefore provided, an appeal shall lie to the said  High  Court  or  one
Judge of any Division Court, pursuant to Section 108 of  the  Government  of
India Act, on or after the first day of February, 1929 in  the  exercise  of
appellate jurisdiction in respect of a decree or order made in the  exercise
of appellate jurisdiction by a Court subject to the superintendence  of  the
said High Court where the Judge who passed the judgment  declares  that  the
case is a fit one for appeal; but  that  the  right  to  appeal  from  other
judgments of Judges of the said High Court or of such Division  Court  shall
be to Us, Our heirs  or  successors  in  Our  or  Their  Privy  Council,  as
hereinafter provided.
</p>

<p id="p_151">Clause 16. Appeal from Courts in the Provinces:-
</p><p id="p_152">And we do further ordain that the said High  Court  of  Judicature  at  Fort
William in Bengal shall be a court of Appeal from the Civil  Courts  of  the
Bengal Division of the Presidency  of  Fort  William,  and  from  all  other
Courts  subject  to  its  superintendence,  and  shall  exercise   appellate
jurisdiction in such cases as are subject to appeal to the said  High  Court
by virtue of any laws or regulation now in force.
</p>
<p id="p_153">Clause 36. Single Judges and Division Courts:—

And we do hereby declare that any function which is hereby  directed  to  be
performed by the said High Court of Judicature at (Madras),  (Bombay),  Fort
William  in  Bengal  in  the  exercise  of   its   original   or   appellate
jurisdiction, may be performed by  any  Judge,  or  by  any  Division  Court
thereof, appointed or constituted for such purpose, in pursuance of  section
108    of     the     Government     of     India     Act,     1915;     and
if such Division Court is composed of two or more Judges and the Judges  are
divided in opinion as to the decision to be given on any point,  such  point
shall be decided according to the opinion of the majority of the  Judges  if
there shall be a majority, but if the  Judges  should  be  equally  divided,
they shall state the point upon which they differ and the  case  shall  then
be heard upon that point by one or more of the other Judges  and  the  point
shall be decided according to the opinion of the majority of the Judges  who
have heard the case including those who first heard it.”

</p><p id="p_154">43.   It will be seen that clause 36 refers to the “appellate  jurisdiction”
of the High Court, which  jurisdiction  would  contain  appeals  both  under
clause 15 of the Letters Patent and under Section 96 of the  Code  of  Civil
Procedure.  Despite this, some High Courts took the view that appeals  under
Section 96 of the Code of Civil Procedure would not be covered by clause  36
of the Letters Patent, and that therefore <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_239">Section 98(2)</a> and  not  Clause  36
would be applied in such appeals before the High Courts.
</p><p id="p_155">44.   In an instructive Full  Bench  judgment  in  <a href="/doc/71179/" id="a_240">Immidisetti  Dhanaraju  &amp;
Another v.  Motilal  Daga  &amp;  Another</a>,  AIR  1929  MAD  641,  owing  to  the
difference  of opinion between two learned Judges of the  High  Court,   the
question that had to be decided  was  whether   clause  36  of  the  Letters
Patent  would  apply  or  Section  98  of  the  Code  of  Civil   Procedure.
Phillips,J. after referring to the Privy Council judgment in Bhaidas’  case,
stated:-
</p><p id="p_156">“There is no specific provision in<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_241"> S. 98</a>, and there is  a  special  form  of
procedure which was already prescribed. That form of procedure <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_242"> S.  98</a>  does
not, in their Lordships' opinion, affect.”
This is a  very  general  statement  and  is  wide  enough  to  include  the
statement that<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_243"> S. 98</a> does not affect the procedure laid down in the  Letters
Patent. That procedure is given in Cl. 36 which  applies  to  cases  arising
both under Cl. 15 and Cl. 16. It would, therefore, appear that  this  dictum
would apply equally to Cls. 15 and 16 of the  Letters  Patent  and  this  is
supported by the judgment of Lord Sumner in <a href="/doc/1779383/" id="a_244">Sabitri  Thakurain v. Savi</a> where
he observes.
</p><p id="p_157">“In conclusion,  there  is  no  reason  why  there  should  be  any  general
difference between the procedure of the High Court in matters  coming  under
the Letters Patent and its procedure in other matters.”

In an interesting passage, Phillips,J. went on to hold:-
“It is suggested that the amendment of<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_245"> S. 98</a> merely leaves  the  law  as  it
was before, but as there has been no  pronouncement  of  the  Privy  Council
saying that<a href="/doc/185363/" id="a_246"> S. 4</a> did not protect Cl. 36 equally with Cl. 15,  which  it  was
definitely held to protect, it cannot be said  that <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_247"> S.  98</a>,  prior  to  the
amendment, necessarily affected  Cls.  16  and  36.  The  distinction  drawn
between the jurisdiction of the High Court under  Cl.  15  and  Cl.  16  was
based on the  Ianguage  of <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_248"> S.  96</a>;  for,  it  has  been  held  that <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_249"> S.  96</a>
refers only to appeals from Subordinate Courts and not to appeals  from  one
Judge of the High Court to the High Court,<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_250"> S. 96</a> does not in  terms  exclude
appeals from one Judge to the other  Judges  of  the  High  Court;  for,  it
includes all appeals from “any Court  exercising  original  jurisdiction  to
the Court authorised to hear appeals from decisions  of  such  Court.”  This
language is wide enough to include appeals  from  one  Judge  to  the  other
Judge of the High Court. If that is so then<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_251"> S. 96</a>, applies  to  all  appeals
and<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_252"> S. 98</a> which clearly relates back to <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_253"> S.  96</a>  must  also  deal  with  all
appeals. If<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_254"> S. 98</a> does not affect appeals under Cl. 15, how can it  be  held
to affect appeals under Cl. 16? It  appears  to  me  that  in  view  of  the
judgments of the Privy Council in <a href="/doc/1182946/" id="a_255">Bhaidas  Shivdas v. Bai  Gulab</a> and <a href="/doc/1779383/" id="a_256">Sabitri
Thakurain v. Savi</a>)  Sec. 4 of the Civil Procedure Code of 1908  was  enacted
in order to save, amongst other enactments, the provisions  of  the  Letters
Patent. That this was the view of the Legislature is now  made  clearly  the
very recent amendment of<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_257"> S. 98</a>, Civil Procedure Code.”

</p><p id="p_158">45.   In the Full Bench decision in the same case, Ramesam,J.,  agreed  with
the view of Phillips, J., and held:-
</p><p id="p_159">“The result is that it is now beyond all doubt that Cl. 36  of  the  Letters
Patent applies to all appeals. It may be asked,  when  does  S.  98  of  the
Civil Procedure Code have any operation and why should the  legislature  not
say that the section does not apply to  Chartered  High  Courts  instead  of
adding an explanation to the section? The reply is that<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_258"> S.  98</a>  applies  now
only to Courts other than the Chartered High  Courts,  that  is,  the  Chief
Courts, and  Courts  of  Judicial  Commissioners  and  the  reason  why  the
legislature adopted this particular form of elucidating the matter  is  that
it was intended to retain<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_259"> S.  98</a>,  as  applicable  even  to  Chartered  High
Courts, but to make the  application  subject  to  Cl.  36  of  the  Letters
Patent. If, at any time, Cl. 36 of the Letters Patent ceases  to  exist, <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_260"> S.
98</a> will come into operation. It is to attain  this  particular  result  that
the explanation was added to<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_261"> S. 98</a>, instead of saying that S.  98  does  not
apply to Chartered High Courts at all. I would answer the question  referred
to us thus:
</p><p id="p_160">“The procedure adopted by the High Court should be governed  by  Cl.  36  of
the Letters Patent.”

While so holding, the Full Bench of the Madras High Court held that  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_262">Section
98(3)</a> was declaratory of the law as it always stood.  It was held:
“It is true that the <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_263">Amending Act</a> is intended to be  declaratory,  that  is,
not only is its object to make the law clear from its date but also to  make
the Act retrospective; that is, there is no change in the law. The law  both
before the amendment and after the amendment is the same. To this  extent  I
agree with the argument of the  learned  Advocate,  that  the  amendment  is
declaratory. But to assume from this that the <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_264">Amending Act</a>  did  not  intend
to alter the law, as expounded by the decisions up to that  date,  does  not
follow: In the first place, it is not correct to say that there is  a  well-
understood rule of law prior to the amendment, in the manner stated  by  the
learned Advocate for the respondents. The decision  in <a href="/doc/1583617/" id="a_265">Lachmam  Singh v. Ram
Lagan Singh</a> and <a href="/doc/1202719/" id="a_266">Veeraraghava Reddi v. Subba Reddi</a> indicate the contrary.  In
my opinion, the object of the amendment is to make it  now  perfectly  clear
that for  any  purpose  Cl.  36  of  the  Letters  Patent  should  never  be
controlled  by  the  Civil  Procedure  Code.  This  was  the  view  of  Lord
Buckmaster in <a href="/doc/1182946/" id="a_267">Bhaidas Shivdas v. Bai Gulab</a> and the cases  approved  therein.
<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_268">The  Amending  Act</a>  is  really  the  response  of  the  legislature  to  the
invitation of Page, J.”

</p><p id="p_161">46.   In an instructive Full Bench judgment reported in  <a href="/doc/980833/" id="a_269">Shushila  Kesarbhai
&amp; Ors. v. Bai Lilavati &amp; Ors</a>., AIR 1975 Guj. 39 (FB), the Full Bench of  the
Gujarat High Court had to consider whether a  decision  given  by  the  Full
Bench of the Bombay High Court in <a href="/doc/155333/" id="a_270">Bhuta v. Lakadu Dhansing</a> reported  in  AIR
1919 Bom 1 (FB), laid down the correct law. After an  exhaustive  discussion
discussing the entire history of the CPC Acts starting from  1859  right  up
to 1908 the Gujarat High Court held:
</p><p id="p_162">“It would thus be seen that under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_271"> the  Code</a>  of  1882  the  High  Courts  of
Bombay, Calcutta, Madras and Allahabad were  all  agreed  that  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_272">Section  575</a>
superseded  Clause  36  and  since  appeals  from  subordinate  Courts  were
covered, by <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_273">Section 575</a>, the procedure in case of difference of  opinion  in
such appeals was governed by <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_274">Section 575</a> and not by Clause  36,  though,  if
<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_275">Section 575</a> had not been there and Clause 36 had not been superseded by  it,
the procedure applicable would have been that set out in  Clause  36.  There
was difference of opinion amongst the High Courts  only  in  regard  to  the
procedure applicable in case of intra-High Court appeals under  the  Letters
Patent. The Calcutta High Court took the view that even in  case  of  intra-
High Court appeals, <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_276">Section 575</a> applied and Clause  36  was  excluded  while
the Madras and Allahabad High Courts held that  the  procedure  in  case  of
intra-High Court appeals was governed by Clause 36 and not by <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_277">Section 575</a>.”

After setting out Sections 98 and 117 of the Code  of  Civil  Procedure  the
Full Bench further went on to say:
</p><p id="p_163">“If these were the only relevant Sections there can  be  no  doubt  that  by
reason of <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_278">Section  117</a>,  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_279">Section  98</a>  would  ordinarily  apply  in  case  of
difference amongst Judges hearing an appeal from a subordinate Court as  did
<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_280">Section 575</a> by reason of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_281">Section 632</a> of the Code of  1882.  But  <a href="/doc/185363/" id="a_282">Section  4</a>,
sub-section (1) provides in so many terms  that  nothing  in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_283">  the  Code</a>  and
since<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_284"> the Code</a> includes <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_285">Section 98</a>, nothing in <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_286">Section 98</a>, shall  be  deemed
to limit or otherwise affect any special form of procedure prescribed by  or
under any other law for the time being in force. We have  already  discussed
the scope and content of Clause 36 and it is apparent from  that  discussion
that Clause 36 is wide enough to include appeals from subordinate Courts  as
well  as  intra-High  Court  appeals  and,  therefore,  the  procedure   for
resolving difference of opinion, set out in  Clause  36  is  applicable  not
only in case of intra-High Court appeals but also in case  of  appeals  from
subordinate Courts. This  procedure  is  different  from  that  set  out  in
<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_287">Section 98</a> and it is clearly, qua <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_288">Section 98</a>, a special  form  of  procedure
prescribed by Clause 36. Now there is no specific provision to the  contrary
in <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_289">Section 98</a> or any other provision<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_290"> of the Code</a> and nothing in  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_291">Section  98</a>
is, therefore, to be deemed to limit or otherwise affect  the  special  form
of procedure  prescribed  by  Clause  36  and  consequently  notwithstanding
<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_292">Section 98</a>, Clause 36 must operate in its  fullness  and  apply  to  appeals
from subordinate Courts. <a href="/doc/185363/" id="a_293">Section 4</a>, subsection (1) saves  the  special  form
of procedure prescribed in Clause 36 and  provides  that  it  shall  prevail
despite conflict with <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_294">Section 98</a>. It is therefore,  clear  as  a  matter  of
plain grammatical construction that under the present Code the procedure  in
case of  difference  of  opinion  in  appeals  from  subordinate  Courts  is
governed by Clause 36 and not by<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_295"> S. 98</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_164"> This would appear to be the undoubted position in principle but let us  see
what the decided cases say. The first decision to which  we  must  refer  in
this connection is the decision of the Full Bench of the Bombay  High  Court
in 21 Bom LR 157 : (AIR 1919 Bom 1 (FB)) (supra) but before  we  do  so,  we
may make a brief reference to an earlier decision of the Bombay  High  Court
in Suraj Mal v. Horniman, 20 Bom LR 185 : (AIR 1917 Bom 62 (SB)).  That  was
a case of an intra-High Court appeal under Clause 15 and the question  arose
whether on difference of opinion amongst the Judges, <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_296">Section 98</a>  applied  or
Clause 36. The Division Bench observed that Clause 36 prescribed  a  special
form of procedure in certain cases where the  Judges  of  a  Division  Bench
differed and this special form of procedure was saved  by  <a href="/doc/185363/" id="a_297">Section  4</a>,  sub-
section (1) and the applicability of <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_298">Section 98</a> excluded in cases  to  which
this special form of procedure applied. It was held that  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_299">Section  129</a>  made
it abundantly clear that the intention of the Legislature was that in  trial
of oases on the Original Side as well as appeals  arising  in  the  Original
Jurisdiction, nothing should be done which is inconsistent with the  Letters
Patent and, therefore, the special form of procedure  prescribed  in  Clause
36 applied in case of intra-High Court appeals  arising  from  the  Original
Side and <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_300">Section 98</a> had  no  application  in  case  of  such  appeals.  This
decision was no doubt given in the context of intra-High Court  appeals  but
the principle on which it was  based  must  apply  equally  in  relation  to
appeals from subordinate Courts. Clause 36, as we have already pointed  out,
embraces appeals  from  subordinate  Courts  as  well  as  intra-High  Court
appeals and, therefore, if the  special  form  of  procedure  prescribed  in
Clause 36 is saved from intra-High Court appeals, it must  be  held  equally
to be  saved  for  appeals  from  subordinate  Courts  and  Clause  36  must
accordingly be held to apply in relation to them and not <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_301">Section 98</a>.”

The Full Bench of Gujarat then went on to state that the Full Bench  of  the
Bombay High Court stood overruled by  referring  to  Bhaidas’  case  in  the
following terms:-
</p><p id="p_165">“This fallacy underlying the decision of the Full Bench in 21 Bom LR  157  :
(AIR 1919 Bom 1 (FB)) was exposed by the Judicial  Committee  of  the  Privy
Council in a decision given only two years later  in <a href="/doc/1182946/" id="a_302">Bhaidas  Shivdas v. Bai
Gulab</a>, 23 Bom LR 623 : 48 Ind App 181 :  (AIR  1921  PC  6).  That  was,  of
course, a case of an intra-High Court  appeal  under  Clause  15  and  while
dealing with the question as to what is the  procedure  to  be  followed  in
case of difference of opinion in such  an  appeal,  Lord  Buckmaster,  after
referring to <a href="/doc/185363/" id="a_303">Section 4</a>, sub-section (1)<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_304"> of the Code</a> of 1908 observed:—
“There is no specific provision in <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_305">Section 98</a>, and there is a  special  form
of procedure which was already prescribed. That form  of  procedure  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_306">Section
98</a> does not, in their Lordships' opinion, affect. The  consequence  is  that
the appellant is right in saying that in this instance a  wrong  course  was
taken when this case was referred to other Judges for decision,  and  he  is
technically entitled to a decree in accordance  with  the  judgment  of  the
Chief Justice. This view of the section  is  not  novel,  for  it  has  been
supported by judgments in Madras, in Allahabad, and  in  Calcutta:  see <a href="/doc/296555/" id="a_307">Roop
Lal v. Lakshmi Doss</a>, (1906) ILR 29 Mad 1: Lachman Singh v. Ram Lagan  Singh,
(1904) ILR 26 All 10  and Nundeepat  Mahta v. Urquhart,  (1870)  4  Beng  LR
</p><p id="p_166">181.” These observations were undoubtedly made  in  the  context  of  intra-
High, Court appeals but the reasoning behind these observations  is  equally
applicable  in  case  of  appeals  from  subordinate  Courts  because   both
categories of appeals are embraced by Clause 36. This decision of the  Privy
Council must, therefore, be held to have overruled 21  Bom  LR  157  :  (AIR
1919 Bom 1 (FB)) by necessary implication. Moreover, the Judicial  Committee
pointed out that the view taken by them in regard  to  the  inter-action  of
<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_308">Section 98</a> and Clause 36 was not novel for it was supported  inter  alia  by
the judgment of the Calcutta High Court in 1870 Beng  LR  181  (supra).  The
case of 1870 Beng LR 181 as we have pointed out above, related to an  appeal
from a subordinate Court and it was held by the Calcutta High Court in  that
case that the procedure in case of difference of opinion in such  an  appeal
was governed by Clause 36. This decision of  the  Calcutta  High  Court  was
approved by the Judicial Committee and it  must,  therefore,  be  held  that
according to the Judicial Committee it is  Clause  36  and  not  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_309">Section  98</a>
which applies in case of an appeal from a subordinate  Court.  The  decision
in 21 Bom LR 157 : (AIR 1919 Bom 1) (FB) cannot, therefore, be  regarded  as
good law after the decision of the Judicial Committee in 23  Bom  LR  623  :
(AIR 1921 PC 6) and it need not deter us from taking a different view.”

After this long discussion on the point at hand, the Full Bench went  on  to
consider the amendment made in <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_310">Section 98</a>  by  adding  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_311">Section  98(3)</a>.   The
Full Bench held that <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_312">Section  98(3)</a>  merely  clarified  the  existing  legal
position by removing a doubt  which  was  cast  upon  it  by  some  judicial
decisions.  The very Statement of Objects and Reasons of the  Repealing  and
<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_313">Amending Act</a> of 1928 said that the object  of  introduction  of  sub-section
(3) in <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_314">Section 98</a> is to enact more clearly a provision which was  previously
implied in <a href="/doc/1329373/" id="a_315">Section 4</a> of the Code.  Thus, the Full Bench of the Gujarat  High
Court held:-
</p><p id="p_167">“This sub-section makes it clear beyond doubt that  nothing  in  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_316">Section  98</a>
shall be deemed to alter or otherwise affect Clause 36. Clause 36 is not  to
be controlled by <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_317">Section 98</a>. If there is any area in which  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_318">Section  98</a>  and
Clause 36 operate simultaneously. Clause 36  must  prevail  and  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_319">Section  98</a>
must give way. Now we need not repeat that Clause 36  embraces  exercise  of
appellate jurisdiction in both categories of appeals, namely,  appeals  from
subordinate Courts as well as intra-High Court appeals under Clause  15.  It
is, therefore, obvious that, at any rate, since  the  introduction  of  sub-
section (3), the procedure in case of difference of opinion in appeals  from
subordinate Courts must be held to be governed  by  Clause  36  and  not  by
<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_320">Section 98</a>. In fact as we have pointed out above, that was  always  the  law
under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_321"> the Code</a> of 1908 even before the amendment by  reason  of  <a href="/doc/185363/" id="a_322">Section  4</a>,
sub-section  (1).  Sub-section  (3)  of  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_323">Section  98</a>  merely  clarified  the
existing legal position by removing a doubt which was cast upon it  by  some
judicial decisions. That is made clear  by  the  Statement  of  Objects  and
Reasons of the Repealing and <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_324">Amending Act</a> 18 of  1928  where  it  is  stated
that the object of introduction of sub-section  (3)  in  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_325">Section  98</a>  is  to
enact; more clearly the provision which was previously implied in <a href="/doc/1329373/" id="a_326">Section  4</a>
of the Code. The respondents relied on the decision of  the  Allahabad  High
Court in <a href="/doc/1827684/" id="a_327">Muhammad Ishaq Khan v. Muhammad Rustam Ali Khan, ILR</a> 40 All  292  :
(AIR 1918 All 412) and urged that it is a recognised rule that  where  there
have been decided cases before an Act is amended, if the amendment does  not
expressly show that the law as interpreted by the decisions is altered,  the
rule laid down  by  the  decisions  must  be  adhered  to.  We  accept  this
principle but we do not see how it has any application here. The  law  prior
to the amendment was never different. The amendment did not  seek  to  alter
the law: it merely clarified what was always the law under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_328"> the Code</a> of  1908
and what that law was on a proper interpretation of <a href="/doc/185363/" id="a_329">Section  4</a>,  sub-section
(1) has already been discussed by us. But even if the  view  be  taken  that
prior to the amendment, the law was that  appeals  from  subordinate  Courts
were governed by <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_330">Section 98</a> despite the existence of <a href="/doc/185363/" id="a_331">Section 4</a>,  sub-section
(1). sub-section (3) introduced in  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_332">Section  98</a>  made  it  very  clear  that
Clause 36 must operate in its fulness and its applicability to appeals  from
subordinate Courts should not be excluded by <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_333">Section 98</a> and to  that  extent
the preexisting law must be held to have been altered. The  decision  in  21
Bom LR 157 : (AIR 1919 Bom 1) (FB) (supra) cannot, therefore,  in  any  view
of the matter, stand after the introduction of sub-section  (3)  in  Section
</p><p id="p_168">98.
We may now turn to the decisions of the other High Courts. The  Madras  High
Court in a Division Bench  judgment  in <a href="/doc/1202719/" id="a_334">Veeraraghava  Reddy v. Subba  Reddy,
ILR</a> 43 Mad 37 : (AIR 1920 Mad 391) (SB) held that even in  case  of  appeals
from subordinate Courts. Clause 36 applies  and  not  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_335">Section  98</a>  but  this
judgment is not of much help because it does not contain any  discussion  of
the question on principle. This question again  came  up  for  consideration
before    a    Division    Bench    of     the     Madras     High     Court
in <a href="/doc/1239398/" id="a_336">Venkatasubbiah v. Venkatasubbamma</a>, AIR 1925 Mad 1032. The Division  Bench
held that the previous practice of the Court was  to  apply  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_337">Section  98</a>  to
appeals from subordinate Courts and the decision in 23 Bom  LR  623  :  (AIR
1921 PC 6) was not intended to override the rule of law  enshrined  in  this
practice. This decision is plainly  incorrect  for  reasons  which  we  have
already discussed. We need not repeat those reasons. The Madras  High  Court
was again called upon to  consider  this  question  in <a href="/doc/71179/" id="a_338">Dhanaraju v. Motilal</a>,
AIR 1929 Mad 641 (FB) which was  a  Full  Bench  decision.  The  Full  Bench
relied on 23 Bom LB 623 : (AIR  1921  PC  6)  (supra)  and  also  emphasized
<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_339">Section 98</a>. sub-section (3) for taking  the  view  that  Clause  36  is  not
controlled by <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_340">Section 98</a> and it applies  to  all  appeals,  whether  from  a
Single Judge of the High Court or from subordinate Court. This  decision  of
the Full Bench has been consistently followed in the Madras High  Court  and
it supports the view we are taking.
</p><p id="p_169">The view taken by the Calcutta High Court on this point varied from time  to
time,  though  there  was  no  specific  decision  on  the  point  in <a href="/doc/1529477/" id="a_341">Suresh
Chandra v. Shiti Kanta</a>, AIR 1924 Cal 855 (SB), Page  J.,  observed  in  that
case that Clause 36 applies to all  appeals,  whether  intra-High  Court  or
from  subordinate  Courts.  Two  different  views  were  expressed  in   the
subsequent case of <a href="/doc/526291/" id="a_342">Becharam v. Purna Chandra</a>, AIR 1925 Cal 845  (FB).  There
Walmsley, J., took the view that Clause 36 applies not  only  to  intra-High
Court appeals but also to appeals from subordinate Courts  while  Suhrawardy
J., observed that so far as appeals from subordinate Courts  are  concerned,
they are governed by <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_343">Section 98</a>. The next decision which followed  was  that
in <a href="/doc/1749071/" id="a_344">Prafulla Kamini v. Bhabani Nath</a>, AIR 1926 Cal 121.  In  this  case  Page,
J., who was a party to the judgment in AIR 1924 Cal 855 (supra) changed  his
opinion and held that 23 Bom LR 623 :  (AIR  1921  PC  6)  was  confined  to
appeals under  the  Letters  Patent  and  did  not  apply  to  appeals  from
subordinate Courts and Walmsley, J., also allowed himself  to  be  persuaded
to take the same view  as  Page,  J.  Page,  J.,  observed  in  the  opening
paragraph of his judgment that this controversy can  be  satisfactorily  set
at rest “only by the  action  of  the  Legislature  now  long  overdue”  and
invited the legislature to solve the doubts and differences  by  an  express
enactment. There were in fact no  doubts  and  differences.  The  effect  of
<a href="/doc/185363/" id="a_345">Section 4</a>, sub-section (1) was clear and indubitable and in our opinion,  it
saved the full content and operation of Clause  36  notwithstanding  Section
</p><p id="p_170">98. But even so the Legislature in response to the invitation  of  Page  J.,
and with a view to leave no scope for  doubts  or  debate,  introduced  sub-
section (3) in <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_346">Section 98</a> by the Repealing and <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_347">Amendment  Act</a>  18  of  1928.
Since then the Calcutta High Court has taken the view that the procedure  in
case of difference of opinion in appeals from  subordinate  Courts  also  is
governed by Clause 36.
</p><p id="p_171">So far as the Lahore High Court is  concerned,  a  Division  Bench  of  that
Court held in AIR 1926 Lah 65 (supra)  that  appeals  under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_348">  the  Code</a>  were
governed by <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_349">Section 98</a> and those under the  Letters  Patent  by  Clause  36.
Shadilal, C.J., who presided over the Bench pointed out that if  the  matter
were res integra, he would have held that Clause 26 of  the  Letters  Patent
of the Lahore High Court applied to all appeals heard by the High Court  and
it was immaterial whether they were appeals within the High Court itself  or
from Courts of inferior jurisdiction but he felt  compelled  by  authorities
to take a different view. We do  not  think,  for  reasons  “which  we  have
already  discussed,  that  the  learned  Chief  Justice  should  have   felt
constrained to decide  the  case  contrary  to  his  personal  opinion.  The
personal opinion entertained  by  the  learned  Chief  Justice  was  plainly
correct. This question again came up for consideration before a  Full  Bench
of the Lahore High Court in Mt. Sardar Bibi v. Haq Nawaz Khan, AIR 1934  Lah
</p><p id="p_172">371. The Full Bench held relying on AIR 1929 Mad 641 (FB)  (supra)  and <a href="/doc/1127834/" id="a_350">Debi
Prasad v. Gaudham Rai</a>, AIR 1933 Pat 67 that “It  is  now  well-settled  that
with the addition of sub-section (3), Section 98 of the  CPC,  made  by  the
Repealing and <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_351">Amending Act</a>, 18 of 1928, that Section has no  application  to
cases heard by a Division Bench  of  a  Chartered  High  Court,  whether  in
appeals from decrees of subordinate Courts  or  from  decrees  passed  by  a
Judge of the High Court  on  the  original  side,  and  that  all  cases  of
difference of opinion among the Judges  composing  the  Division  Bench  are
governed by Clause 26, Letters Patent”. This  decision  completely  supports
the view we are taking.
</p><p id="p_173">We have no decision of the Patna High Court prior  to  the  introduction  of
sub-section (3) in <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_352">Section 98</a> — at any rate none was cited  before  us.  The
first case where the question of competing claims  between  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_353">Section  98</a>  and
Clause 28 of the Letters Patent of the  Patna  High  Court  in  relation  to
appeals from subordinate Courts came to be  considered  by  the  Patna  High
Court was that in AIR 1933 Pat 67 (supra). The Division Bench held  in  that
case that the introduction of subsection (3) in <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_354">Section 98</a> had resolved  the
controversy and it  was  clear  that  Clause  28  applied  to  all  appeals,
irrespective whether they were intra-High  Court  appeals  or  appeals  from
subordinate Courts. The same view was reiterated by  the  Patna  High  Court
in Rajnarain v.Saligram,  (1948)  ILR  27  Pat  332  and Bokaro  and  Bangur
Ltd. v. State of Bihar, AIR 1966 Pat 154.
</p><p id="p_174">It would, therefore, be seen that there is now a consensus amongst  most  of
the High Courts in the country that the procedure in case of  difference  of
opinion in appeals from subordinate Courts is governed  by  the  appropriate
clause of the Letters Patent and not by <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_355">Section  98</a>  and  the  view  we  are
taking is in accord with the decisions of the other High Courts.”

</p><p id="p_175">47.    The  Gujarat  High  Court’s  Full  Bench  decision,  with  which   we
respectfully concur, is important on  several  counts.   Not  only  does  it
correctly explain what is meant by a “specific provision  to  the  contrary”
in Section 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure, but it also goes  on  to  state
that what was achieved by Section 98(3) of the Code of Civil  Procedure  was
already previously implied in Section 4  of  the  Code  of  Civil  Procedure
inasmuch as <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_356">Section 98</a> being a general provision could not possibly be  said
to be a “specific provision”  which  would  take  away  the  effect  of  the
Letters Patent in that case.  The self same reasoning  would  apply  to  the
question of law presented before us.   If  the  Letters  Patent,  being  the
Charter of the High Courts in British India, was  a  special  law  governing
the High Courts untouched by any specific provision to the contrary  in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_357">  the
Code</a> of Civil Procedure, so would the <a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_358">High Court Act</a>s, being the Charter  of
other High Courts,  similarly  remain  as  special  laws  untouched  by  any
specific provision in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_359"> the Code</a> of Civil Procedure for the self-same  reason.
 Viewed from any angle, therefore, it  is  clear  that  Section  23  of  the
Travancore-Cochin High Court Act, alone is to be applied  when  there  is  a
difference of opinion between two learned Judges of the  Kerala  High  Court
in any appeal, be it civil, criminal, or otherwise, before them.
</p><p id="p_176">48.   At this juncture, we may also point out that  if  we  were  to  accept
Shri Viswanathan’s  argument,  several  anomalous  situations  would  arise.
First and foremost, Section 23  of  the  Travancore-Cochin  High  Court  Act
would not apply to appeals under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_360"> the Code</a>  of  Civil  Procedure  before  the
High Court, but would apply to criminal and other  appeals,  making  appeals
before the same High Court  apply  a  different  procedure,  depending  upon
their subject matter. As  against  this,  having  accepted  Shri  V.  Giri’s
argument, a uniform rule applies down the board to all  appeals  before  the
High Court, whether they  be  civil,  criminal,  or  otherwise  by  applying
Section 23 of the Travancore-Cochin High Court Act to all of them. In  fact,
in Civil Appeal No. 8576 of 2014 which on facts arises out  of  the  Malabar
region of Kerala, Clause 36 of the Letters Patent of the Madras  High  Court
would directly apply.  As we have seen, Clause 36 of the Letters  Patent  is
pari materia to Section 23 of the Travancore Cochin High  Court  Act.   This
being so, even for regions that were governed by a different law  –  namely,
the Letters Patent of the Madras High Court  –  a  uniform  rule  is  to  be
applied to the entire Kerala High  Court.   It  may  be  mentioned  here  in
passing that the Letters Patent of the Madras High Court  which  applied  to
the Malabar region in the State of Kerala has been continued  by  virtue  of
<a href="/doc/26402/" id="a_361">Article 255</a> of the Constitution of India read with  <a href="/doc/1651675/" id="a_362">Sections  5</a>,  <a href="/doc/1276646/" id="a_363">49(2)</a>,  <a href="/doc/1574877/" id="a_364">52</a>
and <a href="/doc/1908655/" id="a_365">54</a> of the States Reorganisation Act, 1956.
</p><p id="p_177">49.   At this juncture it is necessary to refer to the decision in <a href="/doc/1535852/" id="a_366">Tej  Kaur
and another v. Kirpal Singh  and  another</a>,  (1995)  5  SCC  119,  which  was
referred to  in  the  course  of  arguments  by  both  Shri  Giri  and  Shri
Viswanathan.  This judgment only  decided  that  a  difference  between  two
Judges of the Punjab and Haryana High Court would  have  to  be  decided  in
accordance with the provisions  of  Section  98(2)  of  the  Code  of  Civil
Procedure because Section 98(3) of the Code of  Civil  Procedure  would  not
apply, as the Punjab High Court is not governed by the Letters Patent.  What
appears to have been missed by this decision is the  fact  that  the  Punjab
and Haryana High Court continues  to  be  governed  by  the  Letters  Patent
governing the High Court set  up  at  Lahore.   The  Lahore  Letters  Patent
contains a provision similar  to  clause  36  of  the  Letters  Patent  that
governed Bombay and Calcutta  by  a  pari  materia  provision  contained  in
clause 26 of the Lahore Letters Patent.  In accordance  with  our  judgment,
therefore, it is clear that this authority is no longer  good  law  inasmuch
as Section 98(3) of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 would expressly save  the
said Letters Patent, and would thus make clause 26 applicable  in  place  of
Section 98(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure. [1]
</p><p id="p_178">50.    Even between the High Courts themselves another  anomalous  situation
would arise.  Those High Courts, such as Bombay, Calcutta and Madras,  which
are “Letters Patent” High Courts so to  speak,  would  not  be  governed  by
<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_367">Section 98</a> in view of sub-section (3) thereof, but  if  we  were  to  accept
Shri Viswanathan’s argument, High Courts like the Kerala  High  Court  which
are not established by any Letters  Patent,  would  be  so  governed.   This
again would lay down two different rules for different sets of  High  Courts
depending upon a wholly irrelevant  circumstance  –  whether  their  Charter
originated  in  the  Letters  Patent  or  in  a  statute.   Here  again  the
acceptance of Shri V. Giri’s argument leads to  one  uniform  rule  applying
down the board to all the High Courts in this country.
</p><p id="p_179">51.   For the aforesaid  reasons  we  conclude  that  Hemalatha’s  case  was
wrongly decided and answer  Question  1  referred  to  us  by  stating  that
Section 23 of the Travancore-Cochin High Court  Act  remains  unaffected  by
the repealing provision of Section 9 of  the  Kerala  High  Court  Act,  and
that, being in the nature of special provision vis-à-vis  Section  98(2)  of
the Code of Civil Procedure, would apply to the Kerala High Court.
</p><p id="p_180">52.   In view of the answer to Question 1, it is  not  necessary  to  answer
Question 2.  The reference is disposed of accordingly.

KURIAN, J.:


</pre><p id="p_189">1.    I wholly agree with the excellent exposition of  law  by  my  esteemed
brother Rohinton Fali Nariman, J.  I have nothing to add  on  the  reference
part. However, for appropriate guidance at the quarters concerned, I feel  a
few observations would be contextually relevant.
</p><p id="p_190">2.     Legislature has thought it fit to  allocate  certain  matters  to  be
heard by a Single Judge and a few by a Bench of not less  than  two  Judges,
in common parlance what is known as  Single  Bench  and  Division  Bench.  A
matter is stipulated to be heard by a  Division  Bench  on  account  of  the
seriousness of the subject matter and for enabling  two  or  more  heads  to
work together on the same. Sitting in  Division  Bench  is  not  as  if  two
Single Judges sit. In Division Bench or  in  a  Bench  of  larger  strength,
there is a lot of discussion  in-between,  clarifications  made,  situations
jointly analysed and positions in law getting evolved.
</p><p id="p_191">3.    Under Section 98 of The Civil Procedure Code, 1908  (for  short,  ‘the
CPC’), when the Judges differ in opinion on a point of law,  the  matter  is
required to be placed for opinion of  the  third  Judge  or  more  of  other
Judges as the Chief Justice of the High Court deems fit  and  the  point  of
law on which a difference has arisen is decided  by  the  majority  and  the
appeal is decided accordingly. It is to be seen that under  the  proviso  to
<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_368">Section 98</a> (2) of the CPC, hearing by a third Judge or more Judges  is  only
on the point of law on which the Division Bench could not concur.  There  is
no hearing of the appeal by the third Judge or  more  Judges  on  any  other
aspect. Under <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_369">Section 98</a> (2) of the CPC, in case an appeal  is  heard  by  a
Division Bench of two or more Judges, and if there is  no  majority  and  if
the proviso is not attracted, the opinion of that Judge or  of  the  equally
divided strength in the Bench which  concurs  in  a  judgment  following  or
reversing the decree appealed from, such decree shall stand confirmed.
</p><p id="p_192">4.    Kerala High Court Act, 1958 has provided for the powers of a Bench  of
two Judges under <a href="/doc/185363/" id="a_370">Section 4</a>. It is clarified thereunder that  if  the  Judges
in the Division Bench are of opinion that the decision involves  a  question
of law, the Division Bench may order that the matter or question of  law  be
referred to a Full Bench.  Needless to say, it should be a question  of  law
on which there is no binding precedent.
</p><p id="p_193">5.    Under Section 23 of the Travancore-Cochin High  Court  Act,  1125,  if
the Division Bench disagrees either on law or facts, the  Chief  Justice  is
required to refer the matter or matters of disagreement for the  opinion  of
another Judge and the case will be decided on the opinion  of  the  majority
hearing the case.
</p><p id="p_194">6.    Under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_371"> The Code</a> of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short,  ‘the  <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_372">Cr.PC</a>’),
the position is slightly different. <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_373">Section 392</a> reads as follows:
“392. Procedure when Judges of Court of Appeal are equally divided.-When  an
appeal under this Chapter is heard by a High Court before a Bench of  Judges
and they are divided in opinion, the appeal, with their opinions,  shall  be
laid before another Judge of that Court, and that Judge, after such  hearing
as he thinks fit, shall deliver his  opinion,  and  the  judgment  or  order
shall follow that opinion:
</p><p id="p_195">Provided that if one of the Judges constituting the  Bench,  or,  where  the
appeal is laid before another Judge  under  this  section,  that  Judge,  so
requires, the appeal shall be re-heard and decided  by  a  larger  Bench  of
Judges.”

</p><p id="p_196">7.    The emerging position is that there is no uniformity or  clarity  with
regard to the Judge strength in the event  of  difference  of  opinion,  and
according to me, it has affected the  purpose  for  which  the  matters  are
required to be heard by a strength of more than one Judge, be it a  Division
Bench or Full Bench (Larger Bench).
</p><p id="p_197">8.    Under the Travancore-Cochin High Court Act, 1125, <a href="/doc/708192/" id="a_374">Section  23</a>  enables
the Chief Justice to refer for the opinion of another Judge, the  matter  or
matters on which the Division Bench has disagreed either on law or on  facts
and the appeal will be ultimately decided on the view taken  by  that  Judge
sitting and hearing the appeal alone.
</p><p id="p_198">9.    Under <a href="/doc/1090821/" id="a_375">Section 392</a> of the Cr.PC, the situation again is  different.  In
case, the Division Bench is divided in their opinion, the  appeal  with  the
opinions should be laid before another Judge of that Court  and  the  appeal
will be decided clearly on the basis of the opinion rendered by  that  Judge
hearing the matter sitting alone. However, the proviso under <a href="/doc/1090821/" id="a_376">Section 392</a>  of
the Cr.PC enables any one of the Judges of the Division Bench or  the  third
Judge to order the appeal to be heard by a larger Bench of Judges.
</p><p id="p_199">10.   The coram is not dealt with in the CPC or the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_377">Cr.PC</a>. It is  stipulated
by the respective <a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_378">High Court Act</a>s. <a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_379">When the High Court Act</a> provides  for  an
appeal to be heard by a Division Bench in situations where  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_380">Section  98</a>  (2)
without proviso operates, it virtually becomes  a  decision  of  the  Single
Judge since the differing view is  only  to  be  ignored.  When  the  Judges
hearing the appeal differ in opinion on a point of law, under  the  proviso,
the said point of law has to be heard by one or more  of  other  Judges  and
the appeal be decided according to the  opinions  of  the  majority  of  the
Judges who have heard the appeal, including at the initial  stage.  In  such
situations also, unless the Chief Justice decides otherwise, the opinion  on
the point of law is  formed  only  by  one  Judge,  the  third  Judge.  This
position is actually against the very principle of reference on  difference.
Reference is always made  to  a  larger  coram.  Not  only  that,  when  two
judicial minds sitting together could not concur, that difficulty is  to  be
resolved, ideally, if not on common sense, not by a  third  one,  but  by  a
Bench of larger coram.
</p><p id="p_200">11.   In my humble view, if the purpose behind the requirement of  a  matter
to be heard by a Bench of not less than two Judges is  to  be  achieved,  in
the event of the two Judges being unable to agree  either  on  facts  or  on
law, the matters should be heard by a Bench of larger  strength.  Then  only
the members of the Bench of such larger strength would be able  to  exchange
the views, discuss the law and together appreciate the various  factual  and
legal positions.  The conspectus of the  various  provisions,  in  my  view,
calls for a comprehensive legislation for  handling  such  situations  of  a
Bench being equally divided in its opinion,  either  on  law  or  on  facts,
while hearing a case which is otherwise required to be heard by a  Bench  of
not less than two Judges, both civil and criminal. It is for the High  Court
and the Legislature of the State concerned to take  further  steps  in  that
regard.
