HEADNOTE:
     Minerva Mills  Ltd. is  a limited	company	 dealing  in
textiles.  On	August	20,   1970  the	 Central  Government
appointed a  committee under  section <a href="/doc/800551/" id="a_2">IS  of the  Industries
(Development Regulation)  Act</a>,	1951  to  make	a  full	 and
complete investigation	of the	affairs of the Minerva Mills
Ltd as	it was	of the	opinion that  there had	 been or was
likely to  be substantial  fall in the volume of production.
The said  Committee submitted  its  report  to	the  Central
Government in  January 1971,  on  the  basis  of  which	 the
Central Government  passed an  order dated  October 19, 1971
under <a href="/doc/1892928/" id="a_3">section  18A</a> of the 1951 Act, authorising the National
Textile Corporation Ltd., to take over the management of the
Mills on  the ground that its affairs are being managed in a
manner	highly	 detrimental  to   public   interest.	This
undertaking was	 nationalised and  taken over by the Central
Government  under   the	 provisions   of  the  <a href="/doc/1044174/" id="a_4">Sick  Textile
Undertakings (Nationalisation)	Act</a>, 1974.  The	 petitioners
challenged the constitutional validity of certain provisions
of the <a href="/doc/1044174/" id="a_5">Sick Textile Undertakings (Nationalisation) Act</a>, 1974
and   of   the	 order	 dated	 October   19,	 1971,	 the
constitutionality  of	the   Constitution   (Thirty   Ninth
Amendment) Act	which inserted	the impugned <a href="/doc/72652/" id="a_6">Nationalisation
Act</a> as	Entry 105 in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution,
the validity  of <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_7">Article 31B</a> of the Constitution and finally
the  constitutionality	 of  sections	4  and	 55  of	 the
Constitution (Forty Second Amendment) Act, 1976 on the ratio
of the	majority judgment  in  Kesavananda  Bharati's  case,
namely, though by <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_8">Article 368</a> of the Constitution Parliament
is given  the power  to amend  the Constitution,  that power
cannot be  exercised so	 as to	damage the basic features of
the Constitution or so as to destroy its basic structure.
     Opining that  sections 4  and 55  of  the	Constitution
(Forty	Second	Amendment)  Act	 are  void  and	 beyond	 the
amending power of the Parliament, the Court by majority (Per
Chandrachud. C.J.,  on behalf  of himself,  A.	Gupta.	N.L.
Untwalia &amp; P.S. Kailasam, JJ.)
^
     HELD: (1)	The newly introduced clause S of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_9">Article 368</a>
transgresses  the  limitations	on  the	 amending  power  of
Parliament and	is hence unconstitutional. It demolishes the
very pillars  on which	the preamble rests by empowering the
Parliament to  exercise its  constituent power	without	 any
"limitation whatever".	No constituent power can conceivably
go higher  than the  sky-high power conferred by clause (5),
for  it	  even	empowers   the	Parliament  to	"repeal	 the
provisions  of	this  Constitution",  that  is	to  say,  to
abrogate the democracy.
207
and  substitute	 for  it  a  totally  antithetical  form  of
Government. That  can most  effectively be achieved, without
calling a  democracy by any other name, by a total denial of
social, economic  and political	 justice to  the people,  by
emasculating liberty  of thought,  expression, belief, faith
and worship  and by  abjuring commitment  to the magnificent
ideal of  a society of equals. The power to destroy is not a
power to amend. [240C-E]
     Since the Constitution had conferred a limited amending
power on  the Parliament,  the Parliament  cannot under	 the
exercise of  that limited power enlarge that very power into
an absolute  power. Indeed,  a limited amending power is one
of the	basic features of Indian Constitution and therefore,
the limitations	 on that power cannot be destroyed. In other
words, Parliament  cannot, under  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_10">Article  368</a>,	 expand	 its
amending power	so as  to acquire  for itself  the right  to
repeal or  abrogate the Constitution or to destroy its basic
and essential  features. The donee of a limited power cannot
by the exercise of that power convert the limited power into
an unlimited one. [240E- <a href="/doc/1240174/" id="a_11">G]
     Smt. Indira  Nehru Gandhi	v. Raj	Narain</a>, [1976] 2 SCR
347, followed.
     (2) The  newly introduced	clause (4) of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_12">Article 368</a> is
equally unconstitutional  and void  because clauses  (4) and
(5) are	 inter-linked. While  clause (5)  purports to remove
all limitations	 on the	 amending power, clause (4) deprives
the courts  of their power to call in question any amendment
of the Constitution. [241E-F]
     Indian Constitution  is founded  on a  nice balance  of
power among  the  three	 wings	of  the	 State	namely,	 the
Executive, the	Legislature and	 the Judiciary.	 It  is	 the
function of  the Judges,  may their  duty, to pronounce upon
the validity of laws. If courts are totally deprived of that
power, the fundamental rights conferred upon the people will
become a  mere adornment because rights without remedies are
as writ in water. A controlled Constitution will then become
uncontrolled. Clause (4) of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_13">Article 368</a> totally deprives the
citizens of  one of the most valuable modes of redress which
is guaranteed  by <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_14">Article 32.</a> The conferment of the right to
destroy the  identity of  the Constitution  coupled with the
provision that	no court  of law  shall pronounce  upon	 the
validity of  such  destruction	is  a  transparent  case  of
transgression of  the limitations  on  the  amending  power.
[241H, 242A]
     If a  constitutional amendment  cannot be pronounced to
be invalid  even if  it destroys  the basic structure of the
Constitution, a law passed in pursuance of such an amendment
will be	 beyond the  pale of judicial review because it will
receive the protection of the constitutional amendment which
the courts  will be  powerless to strike down. <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_15">Article 13</a> of
Constitution will  then become	a dead	letter because	even
ordinary laws  will escape the scrutiny of the courts on the
ground	that   they  are   passed  on	the  strength  of  a
constitutional amendment  which is  not open  to  challenge.
[242A-C]
     (3) Though	 it is	the settled  practice of the Supreme
Court not  to decide  academic questions  and the  Court has
consistently taken  the view  that it  will not	 formulate a
rule of	 constitutional law  broader than is required by the
precise facts  to which it is to be applied, it is difficult
to uphold  the preliminary objection to the consideration of
the question  raised  by  the  petitioners  as	regards	 the
validity of sections 4 and 55 of the Forty-second Amendment.
In the	instant case,  the question  raised as	regards	 the
constitutionality of  sections 4  and 55 of the Forty Second
Amendment is  not an  academic or  a hypothetical  question.
Further an  order has  been passed  against the	 petitioners
under  <a href="/doc/1892928/" id="a_16">section	 18A</a>  of  the  Industries  (Development	 and
<a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_17">Regulation)  Act</a>,   1951,  by	which  the  petitioners	 are
aggrieved. [248C, E-G]
208
     Besides,  there   is  no  constitutional  or  statutory
inhibition against  the decision  of questions	before	they
actually arise	for consideration.  Here,  in  view  of	 the
importance of  the question  raised and	 in view of the fact
that the  question has been raised in many a petition, it is
expedient in  the interest  of Justice	to settle  the	true
position. Secondly, what the court is dealing with is not an
ordinary law which may or may not be passed so that it could
be said	 that the  court's jurisdiction	 is being invoked on
the hypothetical  consideration that  a law may be passed in
future which will injure the rights of the petitioners. What
the court  is dealing  with is	a  constitutional  amendment
which has  been brought into operation and which, of its own
force, permits	the violation  of certain  freedoms  through
laws passed for certain purposes. [248G, 249A-B]
     Commonwealth of  Massachusetts v.	Andrew W. Mellon, 67
Lawyers' Edition,  1078, 1084; George Ashwander v. Tennessee
Valley Authority, 80 Lawyers' Edition, 688, 711, quoted with
approval.
     (4) The  answer to	 the question whether in view of the
majority decision  in Kesavananda  Bharati it is permissible
to the	Parliament to so amend the Constitution as to give a
position of  precedence to  directive  principles  over	 the
fundamental rights,  must necessarily  depend  upon  whether
Articles 14  and 19,  which must now give way to laws passed
in order  to effectuate	 the policy  of	 the  State  towards
securing all  or any  of the principles of Directive Policy,
are  essential	features  of  the  basic  structure  of	 the
Constitution. It  is only  if the  rights conferred by these
two articles  are not  a part  of the basic structure of the
Constitution that  they can  be allowed to be abrogated by a
constitutional amendment.  If they  are a  part of the basic
structure, they	 cannot be  obliterated. out of existence in
relation tn  a category of laws described in <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_18">Article 31C</a> or,
for  the  matter  of  that,  in	 relation  to  laws  of	 any
description whatsoever,	 passed	 in  order  to	achieve	 any
object or  policy whatsoever.  This will  serve to bring out
the  point  that  a  total  emasculation  of  the  essential
features  of   the  Constitution   is,	by   the  ratio	  in
Keshavananda Bharati,  not permissible	to  the	 Parliament.
[249E-H]
     (5) The  importance  of  Directive	 Principles  in	 the
scheme of  our Constitution  cannot ever be over-emphasized.
Those  principles   project  the   high	 ideal	 which	 the
Constitution aims  to achieve.	In fact Directive Principles
of State Policy are fundamental in governance of the country
and there is no sphere of public life where delay can defeat
justice with  more telling  effect than the one in which the
common man  seeks the realisation of his aspirations. But to
destroy	 the   guarantees  given   by  Part   III  in  order
purportedly to	achieve the  goals of  Part IV is plainly to
subvert the  Constitution by destroying its basic structure.
Fundamental rights  occupy a  unique place  in the lives. of
civilized societies  and have  been variously  described  as
"transcendental", "inalienable" and "primordial" and as said
in Kesavananda	Bharati	 they  constitute  the	ark  of	 the
Constitution. [250B-C, 254H, 255A]
     The significance  of the  perception that Parts III and
IV together  constitute the  core of  commitment  to  social
revolution and	they, together,	 are the  conscience of	 the
Constitution is	 to be traced to a deep understanding of the
scheme of the Indian Constitution. Parts III and IV are like
two wheels  of a  chariot, one	no less	 important than	 the
other. Snap  one and  the other will lose its efficacy. They
are like  a twin formula for achieving the social revolution
which is  the ideal  which the	visionary  founders  of	 the
Constitution set
209
before themselves.  In other  words, the Indian Constitution
is founded  on the bed-rock of the balance between Parts III
and IV. To give absolute primacy to one over the other is to
disturb the  harmony of	 the Constitution.  This harmony and
balance between	 fundamental rights and directive principles
is an  essential feature  of  the  basic  structure  of	 the
Constitution. [255B-D]
     The edifice  of Indian  Constitution is  built upon the
concepts crystallized  in the  Preamble. Having	 resolved to
constitute ourselves  into a  Socialist State  which carried
with it	 the obligation	 to secure  to our  people  justice-
social, economic  and political,  Part IV  has been put into
our Constitution  containing directive	principles of  State
Policy which  specify the  socialistic goal  to be achieved.
Having promised the people a democratic polity which carries
with it	 the obligation of securing to the people liberty of
thought, expression,  belief, faith and worship, equality of
status and of opportunity and the assurance that the dignity
of the	individual will	 at all costs be preserved, Part III
has been put in our Constitution, conferring those rights on
the people.  Those rights  are not  an end in themselves but
are the	 means to  an end.  The end is specified in Part IV.
Therefore, the	rights conferred  by Part III are subject to
reasonable restrictions	 and the  Constitution provides that
enforcement  of	  some	of  them  may,	in  stated  uncommon
circumstances,	be   suspended.	 But   just  as	 the  rights
conferred by Part III would be without a radar and a compass
if they	 were not geared to an ideal, in the same manner the
attainment of  the ideals  set out in Part IV would become a
pretence for  tyranny if  tho price to be paid for achieving
that ideal  is human  freedoms. One  of the  faiths  of	 our
founding fathers  was the purity of means. The goals set out
in Part	 IV have,  therefore, to  be  achieved	without	 the
abrogation of  the means  provided for by Part III. It is in
this sense  that Parts	III and	 IV together  constitute the
core of our Constitution and combine to form its conscience.
Anything that  destroys the  balance between  the two  parts
will ipso  facto destroy  an essential	element of the basic
structure of our Constitution. [253D-H, 256A-B]
     (5A) on  any reasonable interpretation, there can be no
doubt that  by the  amendment introduced by section 4 of the
Forty Second  Amendment, Articles  14 and 19 stand abrogated
at least  in regard  to the  category of  laws described  in
<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_19">Article 31C.</a>  The startling  consequence which the amendment
has produced  is that  even if a law is in total defiance of
the mandate  of <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_20">Article 13</a> read with Articles 14 and 19, its
validity will  not be open to question so long as its object
is to secure a directive principle of State Policy. [256D-E]
     (6) No  doubt, it is possible to conceive of laws which
will not attract <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_21">Article 31C</a>, since they may not bear direct
and  reasonable	 nexus	with  the  provisions  of  Part	 IV.
However, a  large majority of laws, the bulk of them, can at
any rate  be easily  justified as having been passed for the
purpose of  giving effect to the policy of the State towards
securing some  principle or  the other laid down in Part IV.
In respect  of all  such laws, which will cover an extensive
gamut of  the relevant	legislative activity, the protection
of Articles  14 and  19 will  stand wholly  withdrawn. It is
then no	 answer to  say, while determining whether the basic
structure of the Constitution is altered, that at least some
laws will fall outside the scope of <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_22">Article 31C.</a> [256E-H]
     (7) A  total deprivation of fundamental rights, even in
a limited  area, can  amount to	 abrogation of a fundamental
right just  as partial	deprivation in	every area  can. The
fact, therefore that some laws may fall outside the scope of
<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_23">Article	 31C</a>  is  no  answer  to  the  contention  that	 the
withdrawal of  protection of Articles 14 and 19 from a large
number	of   laws  destroys   the  basic  structure  of	 the
Constitution. [256H, 257A-B]
210
     (8) <a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_24">Article  38</a> provides that the State shall strive to
promote the welfare of the people by securing and protecting
as effectively	as it  may a  social order in which justice,
social,	 economic   and	 political,  shall  inform  all	 the
institutions of	 the national  life. It	 is not correct that
all the	 Directive Principles  of State	 Policy contained in
Part  TV  eventually  verge  upon  <a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_25">Article  38.</a>	 <a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_26">Article  38</a>
undoubtedly  contains  a  broad	 guideline,  but  the  other
Directive Principles  are  not	mere  illustrations  of	 the
principle contained  in <a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_27">Article	 38.</a> Secondly, if it be true
that no	 law passed  for the purpose of giving effect to the
Directive principle  in <a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_28">Article 38</a> can damage or destroy the
basic structure	 of the Constitution, there was no necessity
and  more   so	the   justification,  for   providing  by  a
Constitutional amendment  that no  law which  is passed	 for
giving effect  to the  policy of  the State towards securing
any principle  laid down  in Part  IV shall  be deemed to be
void on	 the ground  that it  is inconsistent  with or takes
away or abridges the rights conferred by Articles 14 and 19.
[257C-F]
     The object	 and purpose of the amendment of <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_29">Article 31C</a>
is really  to save  laws which cannot be saved under <a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_30">Article
19(2)</a> to  (6). Laws which fall under those provisions are in
the nature  of reasonable  restrictions on  the	 fundamental
rights in  public interest and therefore they abridge but do
not abrogate the fundamental rights. It was in order to deal
with laws  which do  not get the protection of <a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_31">Article 19(2)</a>
to (6)	that  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_32">Article  31C</a>  was	 amended  to  say  that	 the
provisions of  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_33">Article 19</a>,  inter alia cannot be invoked for
voiding the  laws of  the description  mentioned in  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_34">Article
31C.</a> [257F-G]
     (9) Articles  14 and  19 do  not  confer  any  fanciful
rights. They  confer rights  which are	elementary  for	 the
proper and  effective functioning  of a	 democracy They	 are
universally so	regarded, as  is evident  from the Universal
Declaration of	Human Rights.  If Articles 14 and 19 are put
out of	operation in  regard to	 the bulk  of laws which the
legislatures are  empowered  to	 pass  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_35">Article	32</a>  will  be
drained of its life-blood. [257G-H, 258A]
     Section 4	of the	Forty Second Amendment found an easy
way to	circumvent <a href="/doc/393253/" id="a_36">Article  32(4)</a> by withdrawing totally the
protection of  Articles 14  and 19  in respect	of  a  large
category of  laws, so  that there  will be  no violation  to
complain of  in regard	to which redress can be sought under
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_37">Article 32.</a> The power to take away the protection of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_38">Article
14</a> is  the power  to discriminate  without a valid basis for
classification. By  a long  series of  decisions the Supreme
Court has held that <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_39">Article 14</a> forbids class legislation but
it  does   not	forbid	 classification.  The	purpose	  of
withdrawing the	 protection of	<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_40">Article 14</a>,  therefore,	 can
only be	 to acquire  the power	to enact  class legislation.
Then again,  regional chauvinism  will have  a field  day if
<a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_41">Article 19(1)(d)</a>  is not available to the citizens. Already,
there are disturbing trends on a part of the Indian horizon.
Those trends will receive strength and encouragement if laws
can be	passed with  immunity, preventing  the citizens from
exercising  their   right  to  move  freely  throughout	 the
territory of  India. The nature and quality of the amendment
introduced by  section 4  of the  Forty Second Amendment is,
therefore, such	 that it  virtually tears  away the heart of
basic fundamental freedoms. [258B-E]
     <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_42">Article 31C</a>  speaks of laws giving effect to the policy
of the	"State". <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_43">Article 12</a> which governs the interpretation
of <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_44">Article  31C</a> provides  that the  word "State" in Part III
includes the  Government and  Parliament of  India  and	 the
Government and the Legislature of each of the States and all
local or other
211
authorities within  the territory  of  India  or  under	 the
control of  the Government of India. Wide as the language of
<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_45">Article 31C</a>  is, the  definition  of  the  word	 "State"  in
<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_46">Article 12</a>  gives to  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_47">Article 31C</a> an operation of the widest
amplitude. Even	 if a State Legislature passes a law for the
purpose of  giving effect to the policy by a local authority
towards securing  a directive  principle, the law will enjoy
immunity from  the provisions  of Articles  14 and  19.	 The
State Legislatures  are	 thus  given  an  almost  unfettered
discretion to  deprive the  people of their civil liberties.
[258E-G]
     (10) The  principles enunciated  in Part IV are not the
proclaimed monopoly of democracies alone. They are common to
all polities,  democratic or  authoritarian. Every  State is
goal-oriented and  claims to strive for securing the welfare
of its	people. The  distinction between the different forms
of  Government	consists  in  that  a  real  democracy	will
endeavour to  achieve its  objectives through the discipline
of fundamental	freedoms like those conferred by Articles 14
and 19. Those are the most elementary freedoms without which
a free democracy is impossible and which must, therefore, be
preserved at  all costs.  If the discipline of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_48">Article 14</a> is
withdrawn and if immunity from the operation of that article
is conferred,  not only on laws passed by the Parliament but
on laws passed by the State Legislatures also, the political
pressures exercised by numerically large groups can tear the
country asunder by leaving it to the legislature to pick and
choose favoured areas and favourite classes for preferential
treatment. [259A-D]
     (11) The device of reading down the provisions of a law
for the purpose of saving it from a constitutional challenge
is  not	  to  be   resorted  to	  in  order   to  save	 the
susceptibilities of  the law makers, nor indeed to imagine a
law of	one's liking to have been passed. <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_49">Article 31C</a> cannot
be read	 down so  as  to  save	it  from  the  challenge  of
unconstitutionality because  to do  so will  involve a gross
distortion of  the principle  of reading down depriving that
doctrine of  its only  or true rationale when words of width
are used inadvertently one must at least take the Parliament
at its word when, especially, it undertakes a constitutional
amendment. [259E-G]
     If the  Parliament has  manifested a clear intention to
exercise an  unlimited power,  it is  impermissible to	read
down the  amplitude of	that power so as to make it limited.
The principle  of reading  down cannot be invoked or applied
in opposition  to the clear intention of the legislature. In
the history  of the  constitutional law,  no  constitutional
amendment has ever been read down to mean the exact opposite
of what	 it says  and intends. In fact, reading down <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_50">Article
31C</a> so	as to  make it	conform to the ratio of the majority
decision in  Kesavananda Bharati  is to	 destroy the  avowed
purpose of  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_51">Article 31C</a>	 as indicated  by the  very  heading
"Saving of  certain laws"  under which Articles 31A, 31B and
31C are	 grouped. Since	 the amendment	to <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_52">Article  31C</a>	 was
unquestionably	made   with  a	 view  to   empowering	 the
legislatures to	 pass laws  of a particular description even
if those  laws violate the discipline of Articles 14 and 19,
it is  impossible to  hold that	 the court should still save
<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_53">Article 31C</a>  from the  challenge of  unconstitutionality  by
reading into  that Article words which destroy the rationale
of that	 Article and an intendment which is plainly contrary
to its proclaimed purpose. [259H, 280A-C]
     (12) Reading  the existence  of an	 extensive  judicial
review into  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_54">Article 31C</a>  is really to permit the distortion
of the	very purpose  of that Article. It provides expressly
that no	 law of	 a particular description shall be deemed to
be void on the ground that it violates <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_55">Article 14</a> or <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_56">Article
19.</a> It would be sheer
212
adventurism of a most extraordinary nature to undertake such
a kind of judicial enquiry. [260F-G]
     (13) In the very nature of things it is difficult for a
court to  determine whether a particular law gives effect to
a particular  policy. Whether  a law  is adequate  enough to
give effect  to the  policy of	the State towards securing a
directive principle  is always	a debatable question and the
courts cannot  set aside  the law as invalid merely because,
in their  opinion, tho	law is	not adequate  enough to give
effect to  a certain  policy. The  power to enquire into the
question whether  there is  a direct  and  reasonable  nexus
between the  provisions of  a law  and a Directive Principle
cannot confer  upon the	 Courts the power to sit in Judgment
over the  policy itself of the State. At the highest, courts
can,  under  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_57">Article  31C</a>,  satisfy  themselves	 as  to	 the
identity of the law in the sense whether it bears direct and
reasonable nexus with a Directive Principle. If the court is
satisfied as  to the existence of such nexus, the inevitable
consequence provided for by <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_58">Article 31C</a> must follow. Indeed,
if there  is one  topic	 on  which  all	 the  13  Judges  in
Kesavananda Bharti  were agreed,  it is	 this: that the only
question open to judicial review under tho unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_59">Article
31C</a> was	 whether there	is a  direct and  reasonable  nexus.
between the  impugned law  and tho  provisions	of  Articles
39(b) and  (c). Reasonableness	is evidently  regarding	 the
nexus and  not regarding  the law. The. attempt therefore to
drape <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_60">Article  31C</a> into	 a democratic  outfit under which an
extensive judicial  review would  be permissible  must fail.
[260H, 261A-E]
     (14) The  avowed purpose  of clauses  (4)	and  (5)  of
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_61">Article 368</a>  is to confer power upon the Parliament to amend
the  Constitution   without   any   "limitation	  whatever".
Provisions of  this nature  cannot be  saved by reading into
them  words  and  intendment  of  a  diametrically  opposite
meaning and content. [261F-G]
     (15)  <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_62">Article   31A(1)</a>  can   be  looked	upon  as   a
contemporaneous practical  exposition of  the intendment  of
the Constitution,  but the  same cannot	 be said  of <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_63">Article
31C.</a> Besides  there is	a significant qualitative difference
between the two Articles. <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_64">Article 31A</a>, the validity of which
has been  recognised over  the years, excludes the challenge
under Articles	14 and	19 in regard to a specified category
of laws.  If by	 a constitutional amendment, the application
of Articles  14 and  19 is withdrawn from a defined field of
legislative  activity,	 which	is   reasonable	 in   public
interest, the basic framework of the constitution may remain
unimpaired. If the protection of those articles is withdrawn
in respect  of an  uncatalogued variety of laws, fundamental
freedoms will  become a	 'parchment in	a glass	 case' to be
viewed as a matter of historical curiosity [262A-C]
     (16) There	 is no	merit in  the contention  that since
<a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_65">Art. 31A</a>  was also  upheld on  the ground  of state decisis.
<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_66">Art. 31C</a>  can be upheld on the same ground. The five matters
which are  specified in	 <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_67">Article 31A</a>  are of  such  quality,
nature, content	 and character	that at	 least a  debate can
reasonably arise whether abrogation of fundamental rights in
respect of  those matters  will damage	or destroy the basic
structure of  the Constitution.	 <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_68">Article 31C</a>  does not	deal
with specific subjects. The directive principles are couched
in broad  and' general terms for the simple reason that they
specify the  goals to  be achieved.  The principle  of state
decisis	 cannot	  be  treated	as  a	fruitful  source  of
perpetuating curtailment  of human  freedoms. No  court	 has
upheld the  validity of	 <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_69">Article 31A</a>  on the  ground that it
does not  violate the  basic structure	of the Constitution.
There is  no decision  on the  validity of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_70">Article 31A</a> which
can be	looked upon  as a measuring rod of the extent of the
amending power. To
213
hark  back   to	 <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_71">Article   31A</a>	every	time  that   a	 new
constitutional amendment  is challenged	 is the surest means
of ensuring  a drastic	erosion of  the	 Fundamental  Rights
conferred by  Part III.	 Such  a  process  will	 insidiously
undermine the efficacy of the ratio of the majority judgment
in Kesavananda	Bharati regarding  the inviolability  of the
basic structure.  That ratio  requires that  the validity of
each new  constitutional amendment must be judged on its own
merits. [262C-G]
     (17) It is not correct to say that when <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_72">Article 31A</a> was
upheld on the ground of state decisis, what was upheld was a
constitutional device  by which	 a class of subject-oriented
laws was  considered to be valid. The simple ground on which
<a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_73">Article	 31A</a>   was  upheld,   apart  from   the	 ground	  of
contemporaneous practical  exposition, was that its validity
was accepted  and recognised  over the years and, therefore,
it was	not permissible	 to challenge its constitutionality.
The principle  of stare	 decisis does not imply the approval
of the	device. Or  mechanism  which  is  employed  for	 the
purpose of  framing a  legal  or  constitutional  provision.
[262G-H, 263A-B]
     (18)  Under   clauses  (2)	  to  (6)   of	<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_74">Article	 19</a>,
restrictions can  be imposed only if they are reasonable and
then again,  they can be imposed in the interest of a stated
class of  subjects only.  It is	 for the  courts  to  decide
whether restrictions  are reasonable and whether they are in
the interest  of the  particular subject.  Apart from  other
basic dissimilarities,	<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_75">Article 31C</a>  takes away the power of
judicial  review  to  an  extent  which	 destroys  even	 the
semblance of  a comparison  between its provisions and those
of clauses  (2) to  (6)	 of  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_76">Article  19.</a>  Human  ingenuity,
limitless though  it may be, has yet not devised a system by
which the  liberty of  the people  can be  protected  except
through the intervention of courts of law. [263B-D]
     Three Articles  of the  Indian  Constitution  and	only
three stand  between the heaven of freedom into which Tagore
wanted his  country to	awake and  the abyss of unrestrained
power. They  are Articles  14, 19  and 21.  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_77">Article 31C</a>	 has
removed two  sides of  that golden triangle which affords to
the people  of this  country an	 assurance that	 the promise
held forth  by the Preamble will be performed by ushering an
egalitarian  era   through  the	 discipline  of	 fundamental
rights, that  is, without  emasculation	 of  the  rights  to
liberty and  equality which  alone  can	 help  preserve	 the
dignity of the individual. [263D-E]
     Per Bhagwati, J. (concurring)
     (1) Since	the question in regard to the constitutional
validity of  the amendment made in <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_78">Article 31C</a> did not arise
in the	writ petitions	and the	 counter-affidavits, it	 was
wholly academic	 and superfluous  to decide  it. Once  it is
conceded that  Articles 31A,  31B and  the unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_79">Article
31C</a> are	 constitutionally valid it became wholly unnecessary
to rely	 on the	 unamended <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_80">Article  31</a>	in  support  of	 the
validity of Sick Textiles Undertaking (Nationalisation) Act,
1974 because  <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_81">Article 31B</a>  would, in any event, save it from
invalidation on	 the ground  of infraction  of	any  of	 the
fundamental rights. [268F-H]
     (2) Now  either the  <a href="/doc/72652/" id="a_82">Nationalisation Act</a> was really and
truly a	 law for  giving effect	 to the Directive Principles
set out	 in <a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_83">Article  39</a> clause (b) as declared in <a href="/doc/72652/" id="a_84">section 39</a>
of the	Act or	it was	not such  a law	 and the legislative
declaration contained  in <a href="/doc/72652/" id="a_85">section 39</a> was a colourable device
If it was the
214
former then the unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_86">Article 31C</a> would be sufficient to
protect the <a href="/doc/72652/" id="a_87">Nationalisation Act</a> from attack on the ground of
violation of  Articles	14,  19	 and  31  and  it  would  be
unnecessary to involve the amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_88">Article 31C</a> and if it was
the latter,  then neither  the	unamended  nor	the  amended
<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_89">Article 31C</a>  would have	 any  application.  Thus  in  either
event, the  amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_90">Article  31C</a> would	have no relevance at
all in	adjudicating upon the constitutional validity of the
<a href="/doc/72652/" id="a_91">Nationalisation Act</a>. In these circumstances, the court could
not be	called upon  to examine the constitutionality of the
amendment made in <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_92">Article 31C.</a> [269B-E]
     Dattatraya	 Govind	 Mahajan  v  State  of	Maharashtra,
[1977] 2 SCR 790, followed.
     (3) Clause	 (4) of	 <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_93">Article 368</a>  of the Constitution is
unconstitutional and void as damaging the basic structure of
the Constitution. [288E]
     The words	"on any ground" in clause (4) of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_94">Article 368</a>
are of	the widest  amplitude and they would obviously cover
even a	ground that  the procedure  prescribed in clause (2)
and its	 proviso has  not been	followed. The result is that
even if	 an amendment is purported to have been made without
complying with	the procedure  prescribed in  sub-clause (2)
including its proviso, and is therefore unconstitutional, it
would still be immune from challenge. [284F-F]
     As per  Kesavananda Bharati's case any amendment of the
Constitution  which   did  not	 conform  to  the  procedure
prescribed  by	 sub-clause  (2)  and  its  proviso  was  no
amendment at  all and a court would declare it invalid. Thus
if an amendment was passed by a simple majority in the House
of the	People and  the Council	 of States and the President
assented to the amendment, it would, in law, be no amendment
at all	because the  requirement of  clause (2)	 is that  it
should be  passed by  a	 majority  of  each  of	 the  Houses
separately and	by not	less than  two-third of	 the Members
present and  voting. But  if clause  (4) was  valid it would
become difficult  to  challenge	 the  validity	of  such  an
amendment and  it would prevail though made in defiance of a
mandatory constitutional  requirement. Clause  (2) including
its proviso  would be  rendered completely  superfluous	 and
meaningless and its prescription would become merely a paper
requirement.   Moreover,    apart   from    nullifying	 the
requirements of	 clause (2)  and its proviso, clause (4) has
also the  effect  of  rendering	 an  amendment	immune	from
challenge even if it damages or destroys the basic structure
of the	Constitution and is, therefore, outside the amending
power of  Parliament. So  long	as  clause  (4)	 stands,  an
amendment of  the Constitution,	 though unconstitutional and
void as	 transgressing the  limitation on the amending power
of Parliament  as laid	down in	 Kesavananda Bharati's case,
would be  unchallengeable in a court of law. The consequence
of this	 exclusion of  the power of judicial review would be
that,  in  effect  and	substance,  the	 limitation  on	 the
amending power	of Parliament  would, from a practical point
of view,  become non-existent  and it would not be incorrect
to say,	 for covertly  and indirectly  by the  exclusion  of
judicial review the amending power of Parliament would stand
enlarged  contrary   to	 the   decision	 of  this  Court  in
Kesavananda Bharati's  case. This would, undoubtedly, damage
the basic  structure of	 the Constitution  because there are
two essential features of the basic structure which would be
violated,  namely,   the  limited   amending  power  of	 the
Parliament and	the power  of judicial review with a view to
examining whether  any authority  under the Constitution has
exceeded the limits of its powers. [284F-H, 285A-D]
     Our Constitution  is a  controlled	 constitution  which
confers	 powers	 on  the  various  authorities	created	 and
recognised by it and defines the limits of those
215
powers. The  Constitution is  suprema lex, the paramount law
of the	land and  there is  no authority,  no department  or
branch	of   the  State	  which	 is   above  or	 beyond	 the
Constitution or	 has powers  unfettered and  unrestricted by
the Constitution.  The Constitution  has devised a structure
of power  relationship which  checks and balances and limits
are  placed   on  the	powers	 of   every   authority	  of
instrumentality under  the Constitution.  Every organ of the
State, be  it  the  Executive  or  the	Legislature  or	 the
Judiciary, derives  its authority  from the Constitution and
it  has	  to  act  within  the	limits	of  such  authority.
Parliament too	is a creature of the Constitution and it can
only  have  such  powers  as  are  given  to  it  under	 the
Constitution. It  has no  inherent power of amendment of the
Constitution  and   being  an	authority  created   by	 the
Constitution, it  cannot have  such inherent  power but	 the
power of  amendment is conferred upon it by the Constitution
and it	is a limited power which is so conferred. Parliament
cannot in  exercise of	this power so amend the Constitution
as to  alter its  basic structure or to change its identity.
Now, if	 by constitutional amendment, Parliament was granted
unlimited power	 of amendment,	it  would  cease  to  be  an
authority under	 the Constitution,  but would become supreme
over it	 because it  would have	 power to  alter the  entire
Constitution including	its basic  structure and even to put
an end	to it  by totally  changing its identity. Therefore,
the limited  amending  power  of  Parliament  is  itself  an
essential feature  of the  Constitution, a part of its basic
structure,  for	 if  the  limited  power  of  amendment	 was
enlarged into an unlimited power the entire character of the
Constitution would be changed. It must follow as a necessary
corollary that	any  amendment	of  the	 Constitution  which
seeks, directly or indirectly, to enlarge the amending power
of  Parliament	 by  freeing   it  from	 the  limitation  of
unamendability of  the basic structure would be violative of
the basic structure and, hence, outside the amendatory power
of Parliament. [285E-H, 286A-C]
     It is  a fundamental principle of our Constitution that
every  organ   of  the	State,	every  authority  under	 the
Constitution derives  its powers  from the  Constitution and
has to	act within  the limits of such power. The three main
departments  of	 the  State  amongst  which  the  powers  of
Government are	divided are:  the Executive, the Legislature
and the	 Judiciary. Under our Constitution there is no rigid
separation of  powers  but  there  is  a  broad	 demarcation
though, having	regard to the complex nature of governmental
functions, certain  degree of overlapping is inevitable. The
Constitution has  created an  independent machinery, namely,
the judiciary  which is	 vested with  the power	 of judicial
review to determine the legality of executive action and the
validity of  legislation passed	 by the Legislature. It is a
solemn duty  of the judiciary under the Constitution to keep
the different organs of the State, such as the Executive and
the Legislature,  within the  limits of	 the power conferred
upon them by the Constitution. This power of judicial review
is conferred  on the judiciary by Articles 32 and 226 of the
Constitution. [286D, E, 287B-C].
     It is  a cardinal principle of our Constitution that no
one, howsoever highly placed and no authority however lofty,
can claim  to be  the sole  judge of  its  power  under	 the
Constitution or	 whether its actions are within the confines
of such	 power laid  down by the Constitution. The judiciary
is the	interpreter of the Constitution and the judiciary is
assigned the  delicate task  to determine  what is the power
conferred on  each  branch  of	Government,  whether  it  is
limited, and  if so,  what are	the limits  and whether	 any
action of  that branch	transgresses such  limits. It is for
the judiciary  to uphold  the constitutional  values and  to
enforce the  constitutional limitations. That is the essence
of the	rule of	 law, which  inter alia	 requires that	"the
exercise of powers by
216
the  Government	  whether  it  be  the	legislature  or	 the
executive or  any other	 authority, be	conditioned  by	 the
Constitution and  the law". The power of the judicial review
is an integral part of our constitutional system and without
it, there  will be no Government of Laws and the rule of law
would become  a teasing illusion and a promise of unreality.
If there is one feature of our Constitution which, more than
any other,  is basic  and fundamental  to the maintenance of
democracy and  the rule	 of law, it is the power of judicial
review	and  it	 is  unquestionably  a	part  of  the  basic
structure   of	  the	Constitution.	However,   effective
alternative   institutional   mechanism	  arrangements	 for
judicial review	 cannot	 be  made  by  Parliament.  Judicial
review is  a vital  principle of  our  Constitution  and  it
cannot be abrogated without affecting the basic structure of
the Constitution.  If by  a  constitutional  amendment,	 the
power of  judicial review  is taken  away and it is provided
that the  validity of  any law made by the legislature shall
not be	liable to  be called in question on any ground, even
if  it	 is  outside   the  legislative	 competence  of	 the
legislature or	is violative  of any  fundamental rights, it
would be  nothing short	 of subversion	of the Constitution,
for  it	  would	 make  a  mockery  of  the  distribution  of
legislative powers  between the	 Union and  the	 States	 and
render the  fundamental rights	meaningless and	 futile.  So
also if	 a constitutional  amendment is	 made which  has the
effect of  taking away	the power  of  judicial	 review	 and
providing that	no amendment  made in the Constitution shall
be liable  to be  questioned on	 any ground,  even  if	such
amendment  is	violative  of	the  basic   structure	and,
therefore, outside  the amendatory  power of  Parliament, it
would be  making Parliament sole judge of the constitutional
validity of  what it  has done and that would, in effect and
substance, nullify  the limitation  on the amending power of
Parliament  and	  effect  the	basic  constructure  of	 the
Constitution. [287F-H, 288A-E]
     (4) Clause	 (5) of	 <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_95">Article 368</a>  of the Constitution is
unconstitutional and void. [289E-F]
     After the	decisions of  Kesavananda Bharati's case and
Smt. Indira Gandhi's case there was no doubt at all that the
amendatory power  of Parliament	 was limited  and it was not
competent to  Parliament to alter the basic structure of the
Constitution and clause (5) could not remove the doubt which
did not	 exist. What  clause (5)  really sought to do was to
remove the  limitation on  the amending	 power of Parliament
and correct  it from  a limited power into an unlimited one.
This was  clearly and  indubitably a  futile exercise on the
part of the Parliament. [288G-H, 289A]
     The Constitution  has conferred only a limited amending
power on Parliament, so that it cannot damage or destroy the
basic  structure  of  the  Constitution	 and  Parliament  by
exercise of  that limited  amending power  convert that very
power into  an absolute	 and unlimited	power.	If  it	were
permissible to	Parliament to  enlarge the  limited amending
power conferred upon it into an absolute power of amendment,
then it	 was  meaningless  to  place  a	 limitation  on	 the
original power	of amendment.  Parliament having  a  limited
power of  amendment cannot  get rid  of	 the  limitation  of
exercising that	 very power  and convert it into an absolute
power. Clause  (5) of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_96">Article 368</a> which sought to remove the
limitation on  the amending power of Parliament by making it
absolute,  therefore,  is  outside  the	 amending  power  of
Parliament.  However,	clause	(5)   seeks  to	  convert  a
controlled Constitution into an uncontrolled one by removing
the limitation	on the amending power of Parliament which is
itself an  essential feature  of the Constitution and it is,
therefore, violative of the basic structure. [289B-E]
217
Per contra:
     (5)  Section   4  of   the	 Constitution  (Forty-second
Amendment) Act,	 1976 making  amendments in  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_97">Article 31C</a> and
giving primacy	to  Directive  Principles  over	 Fundamental
Rights, in case of conflict between them, does not damage or
destroy the  basic structure  of  the  Constitution  and  is
within	the  amending  power  of  Parliament  and  therefore
amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_98">Article 31C</a> is constitutional and valid. [342E-F].
     (i) It  is not  correct to	 say that Fundamental Rights
alone are  based on  Human Rights while Directive Principles
fall in	 some category	other than Human Rights. Fundamental
Rights and  Directive Principles  cannot be  fitted  in	 two
distinct and  strictly defined	categories. Broadly  stated,
Fundamental Rights  represent civil  and  political  rights,
while  Directive   Principles  embody  social  and  economic
rights. Both  are clearly  part of  broad spectrum  of human
rights. Even,  the universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights
adopted by  the General	 Assembly of  the United  Nations on
10th December,	1948 contains  not  only  rights  protecting
individual freedom  (Articles 1	 to 21)	 but also social and
economic rights intended to ensure socio-economic justice to
every one  (Articles 22	 to 29). The two other International
Covenants adopted by the General Assembly for securing human
rights, namely,	 the International  Covenant  on  Civil	 and
Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic,
Social and  Cultural Rights are also to the same effect. The
socio-economic rights  embodied in  the Directive Principles
are as	much a	part of	 human	rights	as  the	 Fundamental
Rights.	 Together,  they  are  intended	 to  carry  out	 the
objectives set	out in	the preamble of the Constitution and
to establish  an  egalitarian  social  order  informed	with
political, social  and economic justice and ensuring dignity
of the	individual not	only to a few privileged persons but
to the	entire people of the country including the have-nots
and the handicapped, the lowliest and the lost. [320C-<a href="/doc/257876/" id="a_99">H]
     Kesavananda Bharati  v. State  of Kerala</a>,	[1973] Supp.
SCR, referred to.
     (ii)  Although   Fundamental   Rights   and   Directive
Principles appear  in the Constitution as distinct entities,
there was  no such  demarcation made between them during the
period prior  to the  framing of  the Constitution. From the
point of view of importance and significance, no distinction
was drawn  between justiciable and non-justiciable rights by
the Fathers  of the  Constitution and  both were  treated as
forming part  of the  rubric of Fundamental Rights, the only
difference being  that whereas	the Fundamental	 Rights were
enforceable in	Courts of  Law, the  Directive Principles of
social policy were not to be enforceable. [321A-B, 322C-D]
     (iii) To  limit the  potential of Fundamental Rights on
the  ground   that  they  are  merely  negative	 obligations
requiring the  State to	 abstain  as  distinct	from  taking
positive action is impermissible. [323D-C]
     No doubt,	it is  said that the Fundamental Rights deal
with negative  obligations of  the State  not to encroach on
individual freedom,  while the	Directive principles  impose
positive obligations  on the  State to	take certain kind of
actions. Though	 the  latter  part  may	 be  true  that	 the
Directive Principles  require positive action to be taken by
the State,  it is  not wholly  correct that  the Fundamental
Rights impose  only negative obligations on the State. There
are a  few Fundamental	Rights which  have also	 a  positive
content,  with	 the  result  that  new	 dimensions  of	 the
Fundamental Rights  are being opened up by the Supreme Court
and the entire jurisprudence of Fundamental Rights is in a
218
stage of  resurgent evaluation.	 Moreover, there  are  three
Articles, namely,  <a href="/doc/1952106/" id="a_100">Article 15(2</a>),  <a href="/doc/1987997/" id="a_101">Article 17</a> and <a href="/doc/1071750/" id="a_102">Article 23</a>
within the category of Fundamental Rights which are designed
to protect  the	 individual  against  the  action  of  other
private citizens  and seem to impose positive obligations on
the State  to ensure this protection to the individual. [322

     (iv)   The	   only	  distinguishing   feature   between
Fundamental Rights  and Directive Principles of State Policy
is that	 whereas the  former are made enforceable in a Court
of Law the latter are not. They are not justiciable be cause
the social  and economic rights and other matters dealt with
in  the	 Directive  Principles	are  by	 their	very  nature
incapable  of	judicial  enforcement	and  moreover,	 the
implementation of  many of those rights would depend on the.
state  of   economic  development   in	the   country,	 the
availability. Of  necessary finances  and  the	government's
assessment of  priority of objectives and values. But merely
because the  Directive Principles  are	non-justiciable,  it
does not  follow that  they are	 in any	 way subservient  or
inferior to the Fundamental Rights. [323 B-C, E-F].
     (v) The  Indian Constitution  is first  and foremost  a
social document.  The majority	of its provisions are either
directly aimed at furthering the goals cf the socio-economic
revolution  or	 attempt  to   foster  this   revolution  by
establishing the  conditions necessary	for its achievement.
The Fundamental	 Rights are  no doubt important and valuable
in a  democracy, but  there can be no real democracy without
social and  economic justice to the common man and to create
socio-economic conditions  in which  there can be social and
economic justice  to everyone, is the theme of the Directive
Principles. It is the Directive Principles which nourish the
roots of  a democracy, provide strength and vigour to it and
attempt to make it a real participatory democracy which does
not remain  merely a  political democracy but also becomes a
social	and   economic	democracy  with	 Fundamental  Rights
available to  all irrespective	of their  power, position or
wealth. The  dynamic provisions	 of the Directive Principles
fertilise the  static provisions  of the Fundamental Rights.
The  object   of  the	Fundamental  Rights  is	 to  protect
individual  liberty,   but  individual	 liberty  cannot  be
considered in isolation from the socio-economic structure in
which it  is to	 operate. There is a real connection between
individual liberty  and the shape and form of the social and
economic structure  of the  society.  There  cannot  be	 any
individual liberty at all for the large masses of people who
are suffering  from want  and privation	 and who are cheated
out of	their individual rights by the exploitative economic
system. Their individual liberty would come in conflict with
the liberty  of the  socially and economically more powerful
class and  in the  process get	mutilated or  destroyed. The
real controversies  in	the  present  day  society  are	 not
between power  and freedom  but between	 one form of liberty
and another.  Under the present socio-economic system, it is
the liberty of the few which is in conflict with the liberty
of the	many. The Directive Principles, therefore, impose an
obligation on the State to take positive action for creating
socio-economic	conditions   in	 which	 there	will  be  an
egalitarian social order with social and economic justice to
all so that individual liberty will become a cherished value
and the dignity of the individual a living reality, not only
for a  few privileged  persons but  for the entire people of
the
219
country. Thus,	the Directive  Principles enjoy	 a very high
place in  the constitutional  scheme and  it is	 only in the
framework of  the socio-economic  structure envisaged in the
Directive  Principles	that  the   Fundamental	 Rights	 are
intended to  operate, for  it is  only then  they can become
meaningful and	significant for the millions of our poor and
deprived people,  who do  not have even the bare necessities
of life and who are living below the poverty level. [323F-G,
324C-H, 325A-B].
     (vi) <a href="/doc/76375/" id="a_105">Article  37</a> of  the Constitution  is an Article of
crucial	 importance  unlike  the  Irish	 Constitution  which
provided   the	 inspiration   for   introducing   Directive
Principles in  our Constitution.  <a href="/doc/76375/" id="a_106">Article 37</a>  says that	 the
Directive Principles  shall not be enforceable by any court,
makes the Directive Principles fundamental in the governance
of the	country and  enacts that it shall be the duty of the
State to  apply the Directive Principles in making laws. The
changes made  by the  framers of  the Constitution are vital
and  they   have  the  effect  of  bringing  about  a  total
transformation	 or   metamorphosis   of   this	  provision,
fundamentally altering	the significance  and efficacy.	 The
Directive Principle  are not excluded from the cognizance of
the court,  as under the Irish Constitution; they are merely
made non-enforceable  by a  court of law. Merely because the
Directive Principles  are not enforceable in a court of law,
it does	 not mean that they are of subordinate importance to
any part  of the  Constitution or  that they  cannot  create
obligations or duties binding on the State. The crucial test
which has  to be applied is whether the Directive Principles
impose any  obligations or  duties on the State, if they do,
the State  would be  bound by  a constitutional	 mandate  to
carry  out  such  obligations  or  duties,  even  though  no
corresponding right  is created	 in any	 one  which  can  be
enforced in  a court  of law. On this question <a href="/doc/76375/" id="a_107">Article 37</a> is
emphatic and  make the	point in  no uncertain	terms  There
could not  have been  more explicit  language  used  by	 the
Constitution makers to make the Directive Principles binding
on the	State and  there can  be no  doubt that the State is
under a	 constitutional obligation to carry out this mandate
contained in  <a href="/doc/76375/" id="a_108">Article 37.</a>  In fact,  non-compliance with the
Directive Principles  would be	unconstitutional on the part
of the	State and  it would  not only constitute a breach of
faith  with  the  people  who  imposed	this  constitutional
obligation on  the State  but it  would also  render a vital
part of	 the Constitution  meaningless and  futile. For	 the
purpose of  the Directive  Principles, the  "State" has	 the
same, meaning  as given	 to it	under  <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_109">Article	13</a>  for	 the
purpose of  the Fundamental Rights. This would mean that the
same State  which is  injuncted from  taking any  action  in
infringement  of  the  Fundamental  Rights  is	told  in  no
uncertain terms that it must regard the Directive Principles
as fundamental	in the	governance of  the  country  and  is
positively mandated to apply them in making laws. This gives
rise to a paradoxical situation and its implications are far
reaching. The  State is	 on the	 one hand  prohibited by the
constitutional injunction  in <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_110">Article 13</a> from making any law
or taking  any executive  action which	would  infringe	 any
Fundamental Right and at the same time it is directed by the
constitutional mandate	in <a href="/doc/76375/" id="a_111">Article 37</a> to apply the Directive
Principles in the governance of the country and to make laws
for giving  effect to  the Directive  Principles.  Both	 are
constitutional obligations  of the  State.  When  the  State
makes a	 law for  giving effect to a Directive Principle, it
is carrying out a constitutional obligation under <a href="/doc/76375/" id="a_112">Article 37</a>
and if	it were to be said that the State cannot make such a
law because it comes into conflict with a Fundamental Right,
it can only be on the basis that Fundamental Rights stand on
a  higher   pedestal  and  have	 precedence  over  Directive
Principles. But it is not correct to say that under
220
our constitutional scheme Fundamental Rights are superior to
Directive Principles or that Directive Principles must yield
to Fundamental	Rights. Both are in fact equally fundamental
and the	 courts have,  therefore, tried to harmonise them by
importing the  Directive Principles  in the  construction of
the Fundamental	 Rights. For  the purpose of determining the
reasonableness of  the restriction  imposed  on	 Fundamental
Rights the  court may  legitimately take  into	account	 the
Directive Principles  and where executive action is taken or
legislation enacted  for the  purpose of  giving effect to a
Directive Principle,  the restriction  imposed by  it  on  a
Fundamental Right  may be  presumed to be reasonable. [325C,
E-H, 326A-D, 327H, 328A-H, 329A-B].

     (vii) If  a law  is enacted  for the  purpose of giving
effect to a Directive Principle and it imposes a restriction
on a  Fundamental Right,  it would  be difficult  to condemn
such restriction  as unreasonable or not in public interest.
So also	 where a  law is  enacted for  giving  effect  to  a
Directive Principle  in furtherance  of	 the  constitutional
goal of	 social and  economic justice it may conflict with a
formalistic and doctrinaire view of equality before the law,
but it	would almost  always conform  to  the  principle  of
equality  before   the	law   in  its  total  magnitude	 and
dimension, because  the equality  clause in the Constitution
does not  speak of  mere formal	 equality before the law but
embodies the  concept of real and substantive equality which
strikes at  inequalities arising  on account  of vast social
and economic  differentials and is consequently an essential
ingredient of  social  and  economic  justice.	The  dynamic
principle of egalitarianism fertilises the concept of social
and economic  justice; it  is one  of its essential elements
and there  can be  no real social and economic justice where
there  is   a  breach  of  the	egalitarian  principle.	 If,
therefore, there  is a	law enacted by the legislature which
is really  and genuinely  for giving  effect to	 a Directive
Principle with	a view	to  promoting  social  and  economic
justice,  such	 law  does  not	 violate  the  principle  of
egalitarianism and  is	in  accord  with  the  principle  of
equality before	 the law as understood not in its strict and
formalistic  sense,   but  in	its  dynamic   and  activist
magnitude. In  the circumstances,  the Court  would  not  be
unjustified in	making the  presumption that  a law  enacted
really and  genuinely  for  giving  effect  to	a  Directive
Principle in furtherance of the cause of social and economic
justice, would	not infringe  any  Fundamental	Right  under
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_115">Article 14</a>  or 19.  This being the correct interpretation of
the constitutional  provisions, the amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_116">Article 31C</a> does
no  more   than	 codify	 the  existing	position  under	 the
constitutional scheme by providing immunity to a law enacted
really and  genuinely  for  giving  effect  to	a  Directive
Principle, so  that  needlessly	 futile	 and  time-consuming
controversy whether such law contravenes <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_117">Article 14</a> or 19 is
eliminated.  The   amended  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_118">Article   31C</a>  cannot   in	 the
circumstances  be   regarded  as   violative  of  the  basic
structure of the Constitution. [329F-H, 330A-F].
     (viia) A  law enacted  really and	genuinely for giving
effect	to  a  Directive  Principle,  in  discharge  of	 the
constitutional obligation  laid down  upon the	State  under
<a href="/doc/76375/" id="a_119">Article 37</a>,  would not	be invalid,  because it	 infringes a
fundamental right.  If the  Court takes	 the view that it is
invalid,  it  would  be	 placing  Fundamental  Rights  above
Directive Principles, a position not supported at all by
221
the history of their enactment as also by the constitutional
scheme. The  two A constitutional obligations, one in regard
to Fundamental	Rights and  the other in regard to Directive
Principles, are	 of equal strength and merit and there is no
reason why,  in case of conflict, the former should be given
precedence over	 the latter.  Whether or  not  a  particular
mandate of the Constitution is justiciable has no bearing at
all on its importance and significance and justiciability by
itself can  never be a ground for placing one constitutional
mandate on  a higher  pedestal than the other. The effect of
giving greater	weightage to  the constitutional  mandate in
regard to  Fundamental	Rights	would  be  to  relegate	 the
Directive Principles  to a secondary position and emasculate
the constitutional  command that  the  Directive  Principles
shall be fundamental in the governance of the country and it
shall be the duty of the State to apply them in making laws.
It would  amount to  refusal to	 give effect  to  the  words
fundamental  in	  the  governance  of  the  country"  and  a
constitutional	command	 which	has  been  declared  by	 the
Constitution  to  be  fundamental  would  be  rendered	non-
fundamental. The  result would be that a positive mandate of
the constitution commanding the State to make a law would be
defeated by  a negative	 constitutional	 obligation  not  to
encroach upon  a Fundamental  Right and	 the law made by the
legislature pursuant  to a  positive constitutional  command
would be  delegitimised and  declared unconstitutional. This
plainly would  be  contrary  to	 the  constitutional  scheme
because the Constitution does not accord higher place to the
constitutional obligation  in regard  to Fundamental  Rights
over the  constitutional obligation  in regard	to Directive
Principles and	does not  say that the implementation of the
Directive Principles  shall only  be within  the permissible
limits laid  down in  the  Chapter  on	Fundamental  Rights.
[330A, 331A-F].
     <a href="/doc/9285/" id="a_120">Karimbil Kunhikoman  v. State  of Kerala</a>,	[1962] I SCR
319 (supra) referred to.
     (viii) It	is not correct to say that consequent to the
amendment of  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_121">Article 31C</a>  the Constitution  is now  made to
stand 'on  its head  and not  on its  legs.'  Prior  to	 the
amendments, Fundamental	 Rights had  a superior	 or a higher
position  in   the  constitutional   scheme  than  Directive
Principles and	there is  accordingly no  question at all of
any  subversion	 of  the  constitutional  structure  by	 the
amendment. There  can be  no doubt that the intention of the
Constitution makers  was that  the Fundamental Rights should
operate	 within	 the  socioeconomic  structure	or  a  wider
continuum envisaged  by the  Directive Principle,  for	then
only would  the Fundamental Rights become exercisable by all
and a  proper balance and harmony between Fundamental Rights
and Directive  Principles secured.  The Constitution makers,
therefore, never  contemplated that  a conflict	 would arise
between	 the   constitutional  obligation   in	 regard	  to
Fundamental Rights  and the constitutional mandate in regard
to Directive  Principles.  But	if  a  conflict	 does  arise
between	 these	 two  constitutional   mandates	  of   equal
fundamental  character,	  since	 the  Constitution  did	 not
provide any  answer and	 perhaps for  the reason that such a
situation was  not anticipated, the problem had to be solved
by Parliament  and some	 modus operandi had to be evolved in
order to  eliminate the	 possibility of	 conflict  howsoever
remote it might be. [331G-H, 332A-D].
     Parliament	 took	the  view  that	 the  constitutional
obligation in  regard to  Directive Principles	should	have
precedence over	 the constitutional  obligation in regard to
the Fundamental	 Rights	 in  Articles  14  and	19,  because
Fundamental  Rights   though  precious	 and  valuable	 for
maintaining the	 democratic way	 of life, have absolutely no
meaning for the poor, down trodden and economically
222
backward classes  of people who unfortunately constitute the
bulk of	 the people  of India  and the	only  way  in  which
Fundamental Rights  can be  made meaningful  for them  is by
implementing the  Directive Principles,	 for  the  Directive
Principles are	intended to  bring  about  a  socio-economic
revolution and	to create  a new  socio-economic order where
there will  be social and economic justice for all and every
one, not  only a  fortunate few	 but the teeming millions of
India, would be able to participate in the fruits of freedom
and  development   and	exercise   the	Fundamental  Rights.
Parliament, therefore,	amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_122">Article	 31C</a> with  a view to
providing that	in case	 of  conflict  Directive  Principles
shall  have   precedence  over	the  Fundamental  Rights  in
Articles 14  and 19  and the latter shall yield place to the
former. The positive constitutional command to make laws for
giving effect to the Directive Principles shall prevail over
the negative  constitutional obligation	 not to	 encroach on
the Fundamental	 Rights embodied  in  Articles	14  and	 19.
[333C-F].
     Parliament made the amendment in <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_123">Article 31C</a> because it
realised that  "if the	State fails  to create conditions in
which the  fundamental freedoms could be enjoyed by all, the
freedom of  the few will be at the mercy of the man and then
all freedoms  will vanish"  and	 "in  order,  therefore,  to
preserve their	freedom, the privileged few must part with a
portion of it." Therefore, it cannot at all be said that the
basic structure	 af the	 Constitution is  affected when	 for
evolving a  modus vivandi  for resolving  a possible  remote
conflict between  two  constitutional  mandates	 of  equally
fundamental  character,	  Parliament  decides	by  way	  of
amendment of  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_124">Article 31C</a>  that in case of such conflict the
constitutional mandate	in regard  to  Directive  Principles
shall prevail  over the	 constitutional mandate in regard to
the  Fundamental  Rights  under	 Articles  14  and  19.	 The
amendment  in  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_125">Article	31C</a>  far  from	damaging  the  basic
structure of the Constitution strengthens and re-enforces it
by giving  fundamental	importance  to	the  rights  of	 the
members of  the community  as against  the rights  of a	 few
individuals and furthering the objective of the Constitution
to build  an egalitarian  social order	where there  will be
social and economic justice for all, every one including the
low visibility areas of humanity in the country will be able
to exercise  Fundamental  Rights  and  the  dignity  of	 the
individual and	the worth  of the  human  person  which	 are
cherished  values  will	 not  remain  merely  the  exclusive
privileges of a few but become a living reality for the many
[334H, 335A-D].
     (ix) The  principle of  egalitarianism is	an essential
element of social and economic justice and, therefore, where
a law  is enacted for giving effect to a Directive Principle
with a	view to	 promoting social  and economic	 justice, it
would not run counter to the egalitarian principle and would
not therefore  be violative  of the basic structure, even if
it infringes  equality before  the law	in  its	 narrow	 and
formalistic sense.  No law which is really and genuinely for
giving effect  to a  Directive Principle can be inconsistent
with the  egalitarian principle and therefore the protection
granted	 to   it  under	 the  amended  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_126">Article	31C</a>  against
violation of  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_127">Article 14</a>  cannot have the effect of damaging
the basic structure. Therefore, there is no violation of the
basic structure involved in the amendment of <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_128">Article 31C.</a> In
fact, one  it is accepted that the unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_129">Article 31C</a> was
constitutionally valid,	 it could  only be on the basis that
it did	not damage  or destroy	the basic  structure of	 the
Constitution, it cannot be said that the amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_130">Article 31C</a>
is violative of the basic structure. If the exclusion of the
Fundamental Rights  embodied in	 Articles 14 and 19 could be
legitimately  made   for  giving  effect  to  the  Directive
Principles set	out in	clauses (b)  and (e)  of <a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_131">Article  39</a>
without affecting the basic structure. these
223
Fundamental Rights  cannot be  excluded for giving effect to
the  other   Directive	Principles.  If	 the  constitutional
obligation in  regard to the Directive Principles set out in
clauses (b)  and (c) of <a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_132">Article 39</a> could be given precedence
over  the   constitutional  obligation	 in  regard  to	 the
Fundamental Rights  under Articles  14 and  19, there  is no
reason in  principles why such precedence cannot be given to
the  constitutional   obligation  in  regard  to  the  other
Directive Principles  which stand  on the  same footing.  It
would be incongruous to hold tho amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_133">Article 31C</a> invalid
when the  unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_134">Article 31C</a> has been held to be valid by
the majority  decision in  Kesavananda Bharati's  and by the
order, in  Waman Rao's	case, dated  9th May, 1980. [335E-H,
336A-C].
     (x) It  is clear  from  the  language  of	the  amended
<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_135">Article 31C</a>  that the  law which is protected from challenge
under Articles	14 and 19 is law giving effect to the policy
of the	State towards  securing	 or  any  of  the  Directive
Principles. Whenever,  therefore, any  protection is claimed
for a law under the amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_136">Article 31C</a>, it is necessary for
the Court  to examine  whether the  law has been enacted for
giving effect  to the  policy of  the State towards securing
any one	 or more  of the Directive Principles and it is only
if the	court is  so  satisfied	 as  a	result	of  judicial
scrutiny that  the court  would accord the protection of the
amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_137">Article	 31C</a> to such law. Now it is undoubtedly true
that the  words used  in the amended Article are "law giving
effect to  the policy  of the  State" but  the policy of the
State which  is contemplated  there is	the  policy  towards
securing one  or more  of the Directive Principles it is the
constitutional	obligation   of	 the  State  to	 secure	 the
Directive Principles  and that is the policy which the State
is required  to adopt and when a law is enacted in pursuance
of this	 policy of implementing the Directive Principles and
it seeks  to give  effect to a Directive Principle, it would
both from  the point  of grammar and language, be correct to
say that  it is	 made for giving effect to the policy of the
State towards  securing such  Directive Principle. The words
"law giving  effect to	the policy  of the State" are not so
wide but in the context and collocation in which they occur,
they are  intended to  refer only  to a	 law enacted for the
purpose of  implementing or  giving effect to one or more of
the Directive Principles. [337A-F].
     (xi) The Court before which protection for a particular
law  is	  claimed  under  the  amended	<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_138">Article	 31C</a>  would,
therefore, have	 to examine  whether such law is enacted for
giving effect  to a  Directive Principle,  for genuinely  it
would have  the protection  of the  amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_139">Article  31C.</a>  A
claim that  a particular law is enacted for giving effect to
Directive Principles  put forward by the State would have no
meaning or  value; it  is the  court  which  would  have  to
determine the  question. Again	it is  not enough that there
may be	some connection between a provision of the law and a
Directive Principle.  The connection  has to  be between the
law and	 the Directive Principle and it must G be a real and
substantial connection. To determine whether a law satisfies
this test,  the court  would have  to examine  the pith	 and
substance, the	true nature and character of the law as also
its design  and the subject matter dealt with by it together
with its object and scope. If on such examination, the court
finds that  the dominant object of the law is to give effect
to the	Directive Principle,  it would	accord protection to
the law	 under the  amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_140">Article  31C.</a> But  if the  court
finds that the law though passed seemingly for giving effect
to a Directive Principle, is, in pith and substance, one for
accomplishing an  unauthorised purpose-unauthorised  in	 the
sense of  not being  covered by any Directive Principle such
law would  not have  the protection  of the  amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_141">Article
31C.</a> The amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_142">Article 31C</a> does not give protection to
224
a law  which has  merely some  remote or  tenuous connection
with a Directive. Principle. What is necessary is that there
must be	 a real	 and substantial connection and the dominant
object of  the law  must be  to give effect to the Directive
Principle, and	that is	 a matter which the court would have
to decide  before any claim for protection under the amended
<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_143">Article 31C</a> can be allowed. [337F-H, 338A-B, F-G].
     The words	used in	 the amended  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_144">Article 31C</a>  are: "law
giving effect  to the  policy of  the State towards securing
all or any of the principles laid down in Part IV" and these
words on a plain natural construction do not include all the
provisions of  law but	only those  which give effect to the
Directive Principle. Therefore, it is not every provision of
a statute  which has  been enacted with the dominant' object
of giving  effect to  a Directive Principle that is entitled
to protection but only those provisions of the statute which
are basically and essentially necessary for giving effect to
the Directive  Principles are  protected under	the  amended
<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_145">Article 31C.</a>  If there	are  any  other	 provisions  in	 the
statute which  do not  fall within this category, they would
not be	entitled to protection and their validity would have
to be  judged by  reference to	Articles 14  and 19.  Where,
therefore, protection  is claimed  in respect  of a  statute
under the amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_146">Article 31C</a>, the court would have first to
determine whether  there is  real and substantial connection
between	 the   law  and	  a  Directive	 Principle  and	 the
predominant object  of the  law is  to give  effect to	such
Directive Principle and if the answer to this question is in
the affirmative, the court would then have to consider which
are the	 provisions of	the law	 basically  and	 essentially
necessary for  giving effect  to the Directive Principle and
give protection	 of the	 amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_147">Article  31C</a> only  to those
provisions. The question whether any particular provision of
the law	 is basically  and essentially	necessary for giving
effect to  the Directive Principle, would depend, to a large
extent, on  how closely	 and integrally	 such  provision  is
connected  with	  the  implementation	of   the   Directive
Principle. If the court finds that a particular provision is
subsidiary or  incidental or  not essentially and integrally
connected with the implementation of the Directive Principle
or is  of such	a nature that though seemingly a part of the
general design	of the	main provisions	 of the statute, the
dominant object	 is to	achieve an  unauthorised purpose, it
would not  enjoy the  protection of  amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_148">Article 31C</a> and
would be  liable to be struck down as invalid if it violates
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_149">Article 14</a> or 19. [338-G-H, 339A, D-H, 340A-<a href="/doc/1258563/" id="a_150">D]

of India</a>, [1970] 3 SCR 530, followed.
     (xii) If the Court finds that even in a statute enacted
for giving  effect to  a Directive  Principle,	there  is  a
provision which	 is not essentially and integrally connected
with the  implementation of  the Directive  Principle or the
dominant object	 of which  is  to  achieve  an	unauthorised
purpose it  would be  outside the  protection of the amended
<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_153">Article 31C</a> and would have to meet the challenge of Articles
14 and 19. [340F-H]
     (xiii) Articles  39 to  51 contain Directive Principles
referring to certain specific objectives and in order that a
law should  be for  giving effect  to one of those Directive
Principles, there would be a real and substantial connection
between the  law and  the specific objective set out in such
Directive Principle.  Obviously, the  objectives set  out in
these Directive Principles being specific and limited, every
law made  by a	legislature in	the country  cannot possibly
have a real and substantial connection with one or the other
of these specific
225
objectives. It	is only a limited number of laws which would
have a	real A	and substantial	 connection with  one or the
other  of   the	 specific   objectives	contained  in  these
Directive Principles  and any  and every  law would not come
within this category. [341A-C].
     (xiv) <a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_154">Article  38</a> is  a general  article which stresses
the obligation	of the	State to establish a social order in
which justice-social,  economic and  political-shall  inform
all the	 institutions of national life. It no doubt talks of
the duty  of the  State to promote the welfare of the people
and there can be no doubt that standing by itself this might
cover a	 fairly wide  area but	the objective set out in the
Article is  not merely	promotion  of  the  welfare  of	 the
people? but  there is a further requirement that the welfare
of the	people is  to be  promoted by  the State, not in any
manner it  likes, not  according to  its whim and fancy, but
for securing  and protecting  a particular  type  of  social
order and  that social	order should be such as would ensure
social, economic  and political	 justice  for  all.  Social,
economic and  political justice	 is the objective set out in
the Directive  Principle  in  <a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_155">Article  38</a>  and	it  is	this
objective which is made fundamental in the governance of the
country and  which the	State is laid under an obligation to
realise. This  Directive Principle  forms the  base on which
the entire  structure of  the Directive Principles is reared
and social,  economic and political justice is the signature
tune  of  the  other  Directive	 Principles.  The  Directive
Principles set out in the subsequent Articles following upon
<a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_156">Article 38</a>  merely particularise  and  set  out	 facets	 and
aspects of  the ideal  of  social,  economic  and  political
justice articulated in <a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_157">Article 38.</a> [341C-G].
     (xv) The concept of social and economic justice may not
be very	 easy of definition but its broad contours are to be
found in  some of  the provisions  of the Fundamental Rights
and in	the Directive  Principles and  whenever	 a  question
arises whether	a legislation is for giving effect to social
and  economic	justice,  it  is  with	reference  to  these
provisions that	 the question  would have  to be determined.
There is nothing so vague or indefinite about the concept of
social	or   economic  justice	 that  almost  any  kind  of
legislation could  be justified	 under it. Moreover, where a
claim for  protection is made in respect of a legislation on
the ground  that it  is	 enacted  for  giving  effect  to  a
Directive Principle,  the Directive Principle to which it is
claimed to  be related	would not  ordinarily be the general
Directive Principle  set out in <a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_158">Article 38</a>, but could be one
of  the	  specific  Directive  Principles  set	out  in	 the
succeeding Articles  because these  latter particularise the
concept of  social  and	 economic  justice  referred  to  in
<a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_159">Article 38.</a>  Therefore, it is not correct to say that if the
amendment in  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_160">Article 31C</a> were held valid, it would have the
effect of  protecting every  possible legislation  under the
sun and that would in effect and substance wipe out Articles
14 and	19 from the Constitution. This is a tall and extreme
argument,  not	 justified  in	 the   provisions   of	 the
Constitution. [341H, 342A-D].
HELD further (concurring with the majority):
     6. Clause	(a) of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_161">Article 31A</a> is constitutionally valid
even on the application of the basic structure test. [290D].
     Where any	law  is	 enacted  for  giving  effect  to  a
Directive  Principle   with  the   view	 to  furthering	 the
constitutional goal  of social	and economic  justice, there
would be  no violation	of the	basic structure,  even if it
infringes formal equality before the law under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_162">Article 14</a> or
any fundamental	 right under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_163">Article 19.</a> Here, clause (a) of
<a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_164">Article 31A</a>  protects a	 law of	 agrarian  reform  which  is
clearly in  the context	 of  the  socio-economic  conditions
prevailing in
226
India, a  basic requirement  of social	and economic justice
and 15 covered by the Directive Principals set out in clause
(b) and	 (c) of	 <a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_165">Article 39</a>  and it  cannot be	regarded  as
violating the  basic structure	of the	Constitution. On the
contrary, agrarian  reforms leading  to social	and economic
justice to  the ..  rural population  is an  objective which
strengthens the	 basic structure of the Constitution. [290B-
D].
     Even on  the basis	 of the	 doctrine of stare decisions
the whole of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_166">Article 31A</a> is constitutionally valid. The view
that <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_167">Article  31A</a> is  constitutionally valid has been fallen
in atleast  three decisions  of the  Supreme Court,  namely,
Shankri Prasad's  case, Sajjan	Singh's case and Golaknath's
case and  it has hold the field for over 28 years and on the
faith of  its correctness  millions of acres of agricultural
land have changed hands and now agrarian relations have come
into being  transferring  the  entire  rural  economy.	Even
though the  constitutional . validity of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_168">Article 31A</a> was not
tested	in   these  decisions  by  reference  to  the  basic
structure doctrine,  the court	would not  be  justified  in
allowing the  earlier decisions	 to be	reconsidered and the
question of  constitutional  validity  of  <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_169">Article  31A</a>	 re-
opened.	 These	 decisions  have  given	 a  quietus  to	 the
constitutional challenge against the validity of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_170">Article 31A</a>
and this  quietus should not now be allowed to be disturbed.

followed
     It is no doubt true that the Supreme Court has power to
review its  earlier decisions  or even	depart from them and
the doctrine  of stare	decisions  cannot  be  permitted  to
perpetuate erroneous decisions of the court to the detriment
of  the	  general  welfare  of	the  public.  Certainty	 and
continuity  are	  essential  ingredients  of  rule  of	law.
Certainty and  applicability of	 law would  be	considerably
eroded and suffer a serious set back if the highest court in
the land  were ready  to overrule  the views expressed by it
in! earlier  decisions even  though that  view has  held the
field for  a number  of	 years.	 It  is	 obvious  that	when
constitutional problems are brought before the Supreme Court
for its decision, complete and difficult questions are bound
to arise  and since  the decision  of many of such questions
may depend  upon choice	 between competing values, two views
may be	possible depending  upon the  value judgment  or the
choice of values made by the individual judge. Therefore. if
one  view   has	 been	taken  by  the	court  after  mature
deliberation the fact that another Bench is inclined to take
another view  would not	 justify the  court in reconsidering
the earlier  decision and  overrule it. The law laid down by
the Supreme  Court is  binding on  all	the  courts  in	 the
country and  numerous questions	 all over  the	country	 are
decided in  accordance with  the view  taken by	 the Supreme
Court. Many people arrange their affairs and large number of
transactions also take place on the faith of the correctness
of the	decision given by the Supreme Court. It would create
uncertainty, unstability and confusion if the law propounded
by the	Supreme Court  on the  face of	which numerous cases
have been  decided and many transactions have taken place is
held to	 be not the correct law after a number of years. The
doctrine of stare decisions is evolved from the maxim "stare
decisions et  non  quita  movere"  meaning  "adhere  to	 the
decision and  not unsettle things which are established" and
it is  a useful	 doctrine intended  to bring about certainty
and uniformity	in  the	 law.  But  the	 doctrine  of  stare
decisions cannot be regarded as a rigid
227
and inevitable doctrine which must be applied at the cost of
justice There  may be cases where it may be necessary to rid
the doctrine of its petrifying rigidity. The court may in an
appropriate case  overrule a  previous decision taken by it,
but that  should be done only for substantial and compelling
reasons. The power of review must be exercised with due care
and caution and only for advancing the public well-being and
not merely  because it may appear that the previous decision
was based  on an erroneous view of the law. It is only where
the perpetuation of the earlier decision would be productive
of mischief  or inconvenience  or would	 have the  effect of
deflecting the	nation from the course which has been set by
the Constitution-makers	 or "where  national crisis of great
moment to  the life,  liberty and safety of this country and
its millions  are at  stake or	the basic  direction of	 the
nation itself  is in  peril of	a shake	 up", that the court
would be justified in reconsidering its earlier decision and
departing from	it. It	is  fundamental	 that  the  nation's
constitution should  not be  kept in constant uncertainty by
judicial review	 every now  and then,  because otherwise  it
would paralyse	by perennial  suspense all  legislative	 and
administrative action  on vital issues. The court should not
indulge in judicial stabilisation of State action and a view
which has  been accepted  for a	 long period  of time  in  a
series of  decisions and  on tho  faith of which millions of
people have  acted and	a large	 number of transactions have
been effected  should not  be  disturbed.  [292G-H,  293A-H,
294A-D].
     <a href="/doc/1378494/" id="a_174">Ambika Prasad  Mishra v. State of U.P. and Anr</a>., [1980]
3 SCR p. 1159. followed.
     (7) <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_175">Article 31B</a> was conceived together with <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_176">Article 31A</a>
as part	 of the	 same design  adopted to  give protection to
legislation  providing	for  acquisition  of  an  estate  or
extinguishment or  modification of  any rights in an estate.
[295E-F].
     The Ninth	Schedule of  <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_177">Article 31B</a> was not intended to
include laws  other  than  those  covered  by  <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_178">Article	31A.</a>
Articles 31A  and 31B  were thus  intended to serve the same
purpose of  protecting	the  legislation  falling  within  a
certain category.  It was a double barreled protection which
was intended to be provided to this category of legislation,
since it was designed to carry out agrarian reform which was
so essential  for bringing  about a revolution in the socio-
economic structure of the country: [295F, H, 296A]
     Since all	the earlier  constitutional amendments	were
held valid  on the  basis of  unlimited	 amending  power  of
Parliament recognised  in Shankri  Prasad's case  and Sajjan
Singh's case and were accepted as valid in Golakhnath's case
and the	 Twenty Ninth  Amendment Act  was also held valid in
Kesavananda Bharati's case, though not on the application of
the basic structure test and these constitutional amendments
have been  recognised as  valid over  a number	of years and
moreover, the  statutes intended to be protected by them are
all falling  within <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_179">Article  31A</a> with the possible exception
of only	 four Acts,  it would not be justified in re-opening
the question  of validity  of these constitutional amendment
and hence these amendments are valid. [297F-H].
     But  all	constitutional	amendments  made  after	 the
decision in  Kesavananda Bharati's  case would	have  to  be
decided by  reference to  the basic  structure doctrine, for
Parliament would  then have no excuse for saying that it did
not known  the limitation  on its amending power. Now out of
the statutes  which are	 or may in future be included in the
Ninth Schedule	by subsequent  constitutional amendments, if
there are any which fall within a category covered
228
by  <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_180">Article  31A</a>  or  31C,  they  would	 be  protected	from
challenge under	 Articles 14  and 19  and it  would  not  be
necessary to  consider whether their inclusion. in the Ninth
Schedule is  constitutionally valid,  except in	 those	rare
cases where  protection may  be	 claimed  for  them  against
violation of  any other.  fundamental rights.  This question
would primarily arise only in regard to statutes not covered
by <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_181">Article  31A</a> or  31C and  in case  of such  statutes, the
Court would  have to  consider	whether	 the  constitutional
amendments including  such statutes  in the  Ninth  Schedule
violate the  basic structure of the Constitution in granting
them immunity  from challenge  of the fundamental rights. It
is possible  that in  a given  case even an abridgement of a
fundamental  right   may  involve  violation  of  the  basic
structure. It  would all  depend on the nature of the nature
of the	fundamental right,  the	 extent	 and  depth  of	 the
infringement, the purpose for which the infringement is made
and its	 impact on the basic values of the Constitution. For
example, right	to life	 and personal  liberty enshrined  in
<a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_182">Article 21</a>,  stands on	an altogether different footing from
other fundamental  rights.  If	this  fundamental  right  is
violated by  any legislation, it may be difficult to sustain
a constitutional  amendment  which  seeks  to  protect	such
legislation against  challenge under  <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_183">Article  21.</a>  So	also
where a	 legislation which  has nothing	 to do with agrarian
reform or  any Directive  Principles infringes	the equality
clause contained  in <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_184">Article  14</a>  and  such  legislation  is
sought to  be protected	 by a  constitutional  amendment  by
including it  in the  Ninth Schedule,  it may be possible to
contend that  such constitutional  amendment is violative of
the egalitarian	 principle which  forms part  of  the  basic
structure.  However,   other  situations   may	arise  where
infarction of a fundamental right by a statute, is sought to
be  constitutionally   protected  might	  effect  the  basic
structure of  the Constitution.	 In every  case,  therefore,
where a	 constitutional	 amendment  includes  a	 statute  or
statutes in the. Ninth Schedule, its constitutional validity
would have  to be  considered by  E. reference	to the basic
structured doctrine  and such constitutional amendment would
be liable  to be  declared invalid to the extent to which it
damages or  destroys the basic structure of the Constitution
by according  protection against violation of any particular
fundamental right. [297H, 298C-H, 299A-B].
     (8) Even  on principle, the first part of the unamended
<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_185">Article 31C</a>  is constitutionally  valid. In view of the fact
that the first part of the unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_186">Article 31C</a> was held to
be  constitutionally  valid  by	 the  majority	decision  in
Keshavananda   Bharati's   case,   the	 question   of	 its
constitutional validity	 cannot be  again  reopened.  It  is
true, that  the ratio  decidendi of  Keshavananda  Bharati's
case was  that the  amending power  of Parliament is limited
and Parliament cannot in exercise of the power m f amendment
alter the  basic  structure  of	 the  Constitution  and	 the
validity of  every constitutional  amendment has, therefore,
to be  judged by  applying the test whether or not it alters
the basic  structure of	 the Constitution  and this test was
not  applied   by  the	six  learned  Judges,  though  their
conclusion regarding  constitutionality of the first part of
the unamended  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_187">Article 31C</a>  is valid.  Irrespective  of	 the
reasons which weighed with each one of the Judges who upheld
the validity of the first part of the unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_188">Article 31C</a>,
the reasons for reaching the said conclusion would certainly
have a	bearing on  the determination of the ratio decidendi
of the	case and  the ratio  decidendi	would  certainly  be
important  for	the  decision  of  future  cases  where	 the
validity of  the first	part or the unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_189">Article 31C</a> is
concerned, it  was  in	so  many  terms	 determined  by	 the
majority decision  in Keshavananda  Bharati's case, and that
decision binds. [300E-H, 301A-D, 302C]
229
     What the  first part  of the unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_190">Article 31C</a> does
is merely  to abridge  the fundamental rights in Articles 14
and 19	by excluding the applicability to legislation giving
effect	to   the  policy  towards  securing  the  principles
specified in  clauses (b)  and (c)  of <a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_191">Article 39.</a> The first
part of	 the unamended	<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_192">Article 31C</a> is basically of the same
genre as  <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_193">Article 31A</a> with only this difference that whereas
<a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_194">Article 31A</a>  protects laws relating to certain subjects, the
first part  of the  unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_195">Article  31C</a> deals  with	laws
having	certain	  objectives.  There   is   no	 qualitative
difference between  <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_196">Article 31A</a>	 and the  first part  of the
unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_197">Article 31C</a> in so far as the exclusion of Articles
14 and	19 is concerned. The fact that the provisions to the
first  part   of  the	unamended  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_198">Article   31C</a>  are	more
comprehensive and  have greater	 width compared	 to those of
<a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_199">Article 31A</a>  does not  make any	 difference in principle. If
<a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_200">Article 31A</a> is constitutionally valid, the first part of the
unamended Article cannot be held to be unconstitutional. The
first part  of the unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_201">Article 31C</a>, in fact, stands on
a more	secure footing because it accords protection against
infraction of  Articles 14 and 19 to legislation enacted for
giving effect to the Directive Principles set out in clauses
(b) and	 (c) of <a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_202">Article 39.</a> The legislature in enacting such
legislation acts  upon the  constitutional mandate contained
in <a href="/doc/76375/" id="a_203">Article  37</a> according  to which  the Directive Principles
are fundamental	 in the	 governance of the country and it is
the duty  of the  State to  apply those principles in making
laws. It  is  for  the	purpose	 of  giving  effect  to	 the
Directive Principles  set out  in clauses  (b)	and  (c)  of
<a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_204">Article 39</a>  in discharge  of the  constitutional  obligation
laid upon the State under <a href="/doc/76375/" id="a_205">Article 37</a> that fundamental rights
in Articles  14	 and  19  are  allowed	to  be	abridged.  A
constitutional amendment, therefore, making such a provision
cannot be  condemned as	 violative of the basic structure of
the Constitution. [301E-H, 302A-C].

under the  proviso to  <a href="/doc/1713437/" id="a_214">Article 83(2).</a>  Again the language of
<a href="/doc/1758457/" id="a_215">Article 352  (1)</a> makes	it clear that the President can take
action under  this clause  only if he satisfies that a grave
emergency exists  whereby the  security of India or any part
of the	territory thereof  is threatened,  whether by war or
external   aggression	 or   internal	  disturbance.	 The
satisfaction of the President "that a grave emergency exists
whereby the security of India.. is threatened whether by war
or  external   aggression  or  internal	 disturbance"  is  a
condition precedent  which  must  be  fulfilled	 before	 the
President can  issue a proclamation under <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_216">Article 352</a> clause
(1).  When   this  condition  precedent	 is  satisfied,	 the
President may exercise the power under clause (1) of <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_217">Article
352</a>   and   issue   a	proclamation   of   emergency.	 The
constitutional implications of a
230
declaration of	emergency. under  <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_218">Article 352</a> clause (1) are
vast and  they are provided in Articles 83(2), 250, 353, 358
and  359.  The	emergency  being  an  exceptional  situation
arising out  of a  national crisis certain wide and sweeping
powers have  been conferred  on the  Central Government	 and
Parliament with	 a view	 to combat the situation and restore
normal conditions.  One such  power is that given by <a href="/doc/1713437/" id="a_219">Article
83(2)</a> which  provides that while a proclamation of emergency
is in  operation, Parliament  may by law extend its duration
for a  period not  exceeding one  year at  a  time.  Further
several drastic	 consequences ensue  upon the  making  of  a
declaration of	emergency. The	issue of  a proclamation  of
emergency  makes  serious  inroads  into  the  principle  of
federalism and emasculates the operation and efficacy of the
Fundamental Rights.  The power of declaring an emergency is,
therefore, a  power fraught  with grave	 consequences and it
has the	 effect of  disturbing the  entire  power  structure
under the Constitution. But it is a necessary power given to
the Central  Government with  a view to arming it adequately
to meet	 an exceptional	 situation arising  out of threat to
the security  of the  country on  account of war or external
aggression or internal disturbance or imminent danger of any
such calamity.	It is,	therefore, a  power which  has to be
exercised with	the greatest  care and	caution	 and  utmost
responsibility [303A-B-306E-H, 307E-G].
     (10) There	 is no	bar to	the judicial  review of	 the
validity of  a	proclamation  of  emergency  issued  by	 the
President under <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_220">Article 352</a> clause (1). [308B-C].
     If a  question brought  before the	 court is  purely  a
political question  not involving determination of any legal
or constitutional  right or  obligation, the court would not
entertain  it,	since  the  court  is  concerned  only	with
adjudication of legal rights and liabilities. Merely because
a question  has a political colour the court cannot fold its
hands in  despair and  declare "judicial hands off". So long
as  the	  question  is	 whether  an   authority  under	 the
Constitution has  acted within	the limits  of its  power or
exceeded it,  it can  certainly be  decided  by	 the  court.
Indeed it  would be  its constitutional obligation to do so.
The court  is the  ultimate interpreter	 of the Constitution
and when  there is manifestly unauthorised exercise of power
under the  Constitution, it  is the  duty of  the  court  to
intervene. In  fact, to	 this Court  as	 much  as  to  other
Branches of  Government is  committed the  conservation	 and
furtherance of constitutional values. The Court's task is to
identify those values in the constitutional plan and to work
them into  life in the cases that reach the Court. "Tact and
wise restraint ought to temper any power but courage and the
acceptance of  responsibility have  their  place  too'.	 The
Court  cannot  and  should  not	 shirk	this  responsibility
because	 it   has  sworn  the  oath  of	 allegiance  to	 the
Constitution and  is also  accountable to the people of this
country. It  would not, therefore, be right for the Court to
decline to  examine whether  in a  given case  there is	 any
constitutional violation involved in the President issuing a
proclamation of	 emergency under  clause (1) of <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_221">Article 352.</a>
[308D, F, 309A-C].
     The constitutional	 jurisdiction of this Court does not
extend further	than saying  whether the limits on the power
conferred by  the Constitution	on the	President have	been
observed or  there is transgression of such limits. The only
limit on the power of the President under <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_222">Article 352</a> clause
(1) is	that the  President should be satisfied that a grave
emergency exists  whereby the  security of India or any part
thereof is  threatened whether by war or external aggression
or internal  disturbance. The  satisfaction of the President
is a  subjective one  and cannot  be decided by reference to
any  objective	tests.	It  is	deliberately  and  advisedly
subjective because the matter in respect' to
231
which he  is to	 be satisfied  is of  such a nature that its
decision must necessarily be left to the Executive Branch of
Government. There  may be  a wide  range of situations which
may arise  and their political implications and consequences
may have  to . be evaluated in order to decide whether there
is a  situation of grave emergency by reason of the security
of  the	  country  being   threatened  by  war	or  external
aggression or  internal disturbance.  It would	largely be a
political judgment based on assessment of diverse and varied
factors, fast  changing situations,  potential	consequences
and a  host of other imponderables. It cannot, therefore, by
its very nature, be a fit subject matter for adjudication by
judicial methods  and materials	 and hence it is left to the
subjective satisfaction	 of the	 Central Government which is
best in	 a position  to decide	it. The Court cannot go into
the question  of correctness  or adequacy  of the  facts and
circumstances on  which	 the  satisfaction  of	the  Central
Government is  based. That would ba a dangerous exercise for
the Court,  both because  it is	 not a	fit  instrument	 for
determining a  question of  this land  and also	 because the
Court would. thereby usurp the function of the executive and
in doing  so enter  the "political  thicket" which  it	must
avoid if  it is	 to retain  its legitimacy  with the people.
But, if	 the satisfaction is mala fide or is based on wholly
extraneous and	irrelevant  ground,  the  Court	 would	have
jurisdiction to	 examine it because in that case there would
be no  satisfaction of the President in regard to the matter
on which  he is required to be satisfied The satisfaction of
the President  is a  condition precedent  to the exercise of
power under  <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_223">Article 352</a>  clause (1)  and if it can be shown
that there  is no  satisfaction of the President at all, the
exercise of  the power	would be  constitutionally  invalid.
[309C-H, 310A-B].
     It is  true that  by reason of clause (5)(a) of <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_224">Article
352</a>, the  satisfaction of  the President  is made  final and
conclusive and	cannot be  assailed on	any ground, but, the
power of judicial review is a part of the basic structure of
the Constitution and hence this provision debarring judicial
review would  be open  to attack  on the  ground that  it is
unconstitutional and  void as  damaging	 or  destroying	 the
basic structure.  This attack against constitutionality can,
however, be  averted by	 reading the  provision to mean that
the immunity  from challenge  granted by  it does  not apply
whore the challenge is not that the satisfaction is improper
or unjustified	but that there is no satisfaction at all. In
such a	case it	 is not	 the satisfaction  arrived at by the
President which	 is challenged	but  the  existence  of	 the
satisfaction itself.  Where, therefore,	 the satisfaction is
absurd or  perverse or	mala  fide  or	based  on  a  wholly
extraneous and irrelevant ground it would be no satisfaction
at all	and it	would be  liable to  be challenged  before a
court notwithstanding  clause  (5)(a)  of  <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_225">Article  352.</a>  No
doubt, in most cases it would be difficult if not impossible
to challenge the exercise of' power under <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_226">Article 352</a> clause
(1) even  on this  limited  ground  because  the  facts	 and
circumstances on  which the  satisfaction is based would not
be known,  but where  it is  possible the  existence of	 the
satisfaction can  always be challenged on the ground that it
is mala	 fide or  based on a wholly extraneous or irrelevant
ground. [310C-F].

232
     (11) on  a plain  natural interpreation of the language
of sub-clauses	(a) to (c) of clause (2) that so long as the
proclamation  of   emergency  is   not	revoked	 by  another
proclamation under  sub-clause (2)(a),	it would continue to
be in  operation irrespective  of change  of  circumstances.
[312C].
      Lakhan  Pal v.  Union of	India, [1966] Supp. SCR 209,
applied.
     It is  true that  the power to revoke a proclamation of
emergency is vested only in the Central Government and it is
possible that the Central Government may abuse this power by
refusing to  revoke a  Proclamation of Emergency even though
the circumstances  justifying the issue of Proclamation have
ceased to  exist and  thus prolong  baselessly the  state of
emergency obliterating	the Fundamental	 Rights and this may
encourage totalitarian	trend.	But  the  primary  and	real
safeguard of the citizen against such abuse of power lies in
"the  good  sense  of  the  people  and	 in  the  system  of
representative and responsible Government" which is provided
in the	Constitution. Additionally,  it may  be possible for
the citizen  in a given case to move the court for issuing a
writ of	 mandamus for revoking Proclamation of Emergency, if
he is  able to	show by	 placing clear	and cogent  material
before the  court that	there is no justification at all for
the continuance	 of the	 Proclamation of Emergency. But this
would be  a very heavy onus because it would be entirely for
the Executive Government to be satisfied whether a situation
has arisen  where  the	Proclamation  of  Emergency  can  be
revoked. There	would be so many facts and circumstances and
such diverse  considerations to be taken into account by the
Executive Government  before it	 can be satisfied that there
is no  longer any  grave Emergency  whereby the	 security of
India  is  threatened  by  war	or  external  aggression  or
internal disturbance.  This is not a matter which is fit for
judicial determination	and the	 court would  not  interfere
with the  satisfaction of  the Executive  Government in this
regard unless  it is  clear on	the material  on record that
there is  absolutely no justification for the continuance of
the Proclamation  of Emergency and the Proclamation is being
continued mala	fide or	 for a collateral purpose. The court
may in	such a case, if satisfied, beyond doubt grant a writ
of mandamus  directing the  Central Government to revoke the
Proclamation of	 Emergency.  But  until	 that  is  done	 the
Proclamation of Emergency would continue in operation and it
cannot	be   said  that	  though  not	revoked	 by  another
Proclamation it	 has still  ceased to  be in  force. In	 the
present	 case,	 it  was   common  ground   that  the  first
Proclamation of	 Emergency issued  on 3rd December, 1971 was
not revoked  by another	 Proclamation under clause (2)(a) of
<a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_229">Article 352</a> until 21st March, 1977 and hence at the material
lime when  the <a href="/doc/708220/" id="a_230">House  of People (Extension of Duration) Act</a>,
1976, was  passed the first Proclamation of Emergency was in
operation. [312F-H, 313A-F.].
     If the first Proclamation of Emergency was in operation
at the	relevant time it would be sufficient compliance with
the requirement	 of the	 proviso to clause (2) of <a href="/doc/1463849/" id="a_231">Article 83</a>
and it	would be  unnecessary to consider whether the second
Proclamation  of   Emergency  was   validly  issued  by	 the
President. [313E-F].
     (12) <a href="/doc/708220/" id="a_232">The  House of	 People (Extension of Duration) Act</a>,
1976, was enacted under the proviso to clause (2) of <a href="/doc/1463849/" id="a_233">Article
83</a> for	the purpose  of extending  the duration	 of the	 Lok
Sabha and  it was  a condition	precedent to the exercise of
this power by Parliament that there should be a Proclamation
of Emergency  in operation  at the  date when  the  Act	 was
enacted. The  words "while  the	 Proclamation  of  Emergency
issued on the 3rd day of December, 1971
233
and on	the 25th  day of  June, 1975  are both in operation"
were  introduced   ,  merely   by  way	of  recital  of	 the
satisfaction of	 the condition	precedent for justifying the
exercise of  the power	under the  proviso to  clause (2) of
<a href="/doc/1463849/" id="a_234">Article 83</a>  and	 they  were  not  intended  to	lay  down  a
condition for the operation of <a href="/doc/276070/" id="a_235">section 2</a> of the Act. <a href="/doc/276070/" id="a_236">Section
2</a> clearly  and in so many terms extended the duration of the
Lok Sabha  for a  period of  one year  and extension was not
made dependent	on both the Proclamations of Emergency being
in operation at the date of the enactment of the Act. It was
for a  definite period	of one	year that  the extension was
effected and  it was  not co-extensive with the operation of
both the  Proclamations of  Emergency. The  extension for  a
period of one year was made once for all by the enactment of
<a href="/doc/276070/" id="a_237">section 2</a>  and the  reference to  both the  Proclamations of
Emergency being	 in operation  was merely for the purpose of
indicating that both the Proclamations of Emergency being in
operation, Parliament  had competence to make the extension.
It was,	 therefore, not at all necessary for the efficacy of
the extension  that  both  the	Proclamations  of  Emergency
should be  in operation at the date of enactment of the Act.
Even if	 one Proclamation  of Emergency	 was in operation at
the material  date it  would be	 sufficient to	attract	 the
power of  Parliament under  the proviso to <a href="/doc/1463849/" id="a_238">Article 83</a> clause
(2) to	enact the  Act extending  the duration	of  the	 Lok
Sabha. No doubt, Parliament proceeded on the assumption that
both the  Proclamations of  Emergency were  in force  at the
relevant date  and they	 invested Parliament  with power  to
enact the  Act. but even if this legislative assumption were
unfounded it  would not	 make any difference to the validity
of the	exercise of  the power	so long	 as  there  was	 one
Proclamation of	 Emergency  in	operation  which  authorised
Parliament to extend the duration of the Lok Sabha under the
proviso to  clause (2)	of <a href="/doc/1463849/" id="a_239">Article  83.</a> It  is true that the
proviso to  <a href="/doc/276070/" id="a_240">section 2</a>  enacted that if both or either of the
Proclamations of Emergency cease or ceases to operate before
the expiration	of the	extended period of one year, the Lok
Sabha shall  continue until  six months	 after the ceaser of
operation of  the said	Proclamations or  Proclamation,	 not
going beyond the period of one year, but the opening part of
this proviso  can have	application only  in relation  to  a
Proclamation of Emergency which was in operation at the date
of enactment of the Act. If such a Proclamation of Emergency
which was  in operation	 at  the  material  date  ceased  to
operate before	the expiration of the extended period of one
year, then  the term  of the Lok Sabha would not immediately
come to	 an end,  but it would continue for a further period
of six	months but  not so  to exceed the extended period of
one year. This provision obviously could have no application
in relation  to the  second Proclamation  of Emergency if it
was  void   when  issued.   In	such   a  case,	 the  second
Proclamation not  being valid  at all  at the  date of issue
would not  be in  operation at all and it would not cease to
operate after the date of. enactment of the Act. The proviso
would in  that event have to be read as relating only to the
first Proclamation  of Emergency, and since the Proclamation
of Emergency  continued until  it was revoked on 21st March,
1977, the duration of the Lok Sabha was validly extended for
a period  of one  year from 18th March, 1976 and hence there
was a  validly constituted  Lok Sabha  on the dates when the
Constitution  (Fortieth	  Amendment)  Act,   1976  and	 the
Constitution  (Forty-second   Amendment)  Act,	1976,  were.
passed by Parliament. (314G-H, 315A-H, 316A-C].
     (In view  of the  settled practice of the Supreme Court
not to	say any more than is necessary to get a safe resting
place for  the	decision,  His	Lordship  did  not  consider
whether the  second Proclamation  of Emergency	was  validly
issued.)

According to  the learned  Chief Justice, fundamental rights
conferred  by	Part  III  of  the  Constitution  cannot  be
abrogated, though  a reasonable	 abridgement of those rights
could be  effected in public interest. There is a limitation
on the power of amendment by necessary implication which was
apparent from  a reading  of  the  preamble  and  therefore,
according to  the  learned  Chief  Justice,  the  expression
"amendment of  this Constitution"  in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_260">Article  368</a> means any
addition  or   change  in  any	of  the	 provisions  of	 the
Constitution within the broad contours of the preamble, made
in  order   to	carry	out  the  basic	 objectives  of	 the
Constitution.	Accordingly,	every	provision   of	 the
Constitution  was  open	 to  amendment	provided  the  basic
foundation or  structure of the Constitution was not damaged
or destroyed.
</p><p id="p_25">     Shelat and	 Grover, JJ.  held that	 the preamble to the
Constitution contains  the clue	 to the	 fundamentals of the
Constitution. According to the learned Judges, Parts III and
IV  of	 the  Constitution  which  respectively	 embody	 the
fundamental rights and the directive principles
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">237</span>
have to be balanced and harmonised. This balance and harmony
A between  two integral	 parts of  the Constitution  forms a
basic element  of the  Constitution which cannot be altered.
The word 'amendment' occurring in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_261">Article 368</a> must therefore
be construed in such a manner as to reserve the power of the
Parliament to  amend the  constitution, but  not  so  as  to
result in  damaging or destroying the structure and identity
of the Constitution. There was thus an implied limitation in
the  amending	power  which   precluded   Parliament	from
abrogating or  changing the  identity of the Constitution or
any of its basic features.
</p><p id="p_26">     Hegde and	Mukherjea, JJ. held that the Constitution of
India which  is essentially a social rather than a political
document, is  founded on a social philosophy and as such has
two main  features: basic  and	circumstantial.	 The!  basic
constituent  remained	constant,  the	 circumstantial	 was
subject to  change. According  to the  learned	Judges,	 the
broad contours	of the	basic elements	and the	 fundamental
features of  the Constitution are delineated in the preamble
and the	 Parliament has	 no power  to abrogate or emasculate
those basic  elements or  fundamental features. The building
of a welfare State, the learned Judges said, is the ultimate
goal of	 every Government  but that  does not  mean that  in
order to  build a  welfare state,  human  freedoms  have  to
suffer	a  total  destruction.	Applying  these	 tests,	 the
learned Judges invalidated <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_262">Article 31C</a> even in its unamended
form.
</p><p id="p_27">     Jaganmohan Reddy,	J., held  that the  word 'amendment'
was used  in the  sense of  permitting a  change, in contra-
distinction, to	 destruction, which the repeal or abrogation
brings about. Therefore, the width of the power of amendment
could not be enlarged by amending the amending power itself.
The learned  Judge held	 that the  essential elements of the
basic structure	 of the	 Constitution are  reflected in	 its
preamble and  that some	 of the	 important features  of	 the
Constitution are justice, freedom of expression and equality
of status  and opportunity.  The word  'amendment' could not
possibly embrace  the right to abrogate the pivotal features
and the fundamental freedoms and therefore, that part of the
basic structure could not be damaged or destroyed. According
to the learned Judge, the provisions of <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_263">Article 31C.</a> as they
stood then,  conferring power  on Parliament  and the  State
Legislatures  to   enact  laws	for  giving  effect  to	 the
principles specified  in clauses  (b) and (c) of <a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_264">Article 39</a>,
altogether abrogated  the right given by <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_265">Article 14</a> and were
for that reason unconstitutional. In conclusion, the learned
Judge held  that though	 the power of amendment was wide. it
did  not   comprehend  the  power  to  totally	abrogate  or
emasculate or  damage any  of the  fundamental rights or the
essential  elements   on  the	basic	structure   of	 the
Constitution or to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">238</span>
destroy the  identity of  the Constitution. Subject to these
limitations, Parliament had the right to amend any and every
provision of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_28">     Khanna, J.	 broadly agreed	 with the aforesaid views of
the six	 learned Judges	 and held  that the word 'amendment'
postulated that	 the Constitution  must survive without loss
of its	identity, which	 meant that  the basic	structure or
framework of  the Constitution must survive any amendment of
the Constitution.  According to	 the learned Judge. although
it was	permissible to	the Parliament.	 in exercise  of its
amending  power,  to  effect  changes  so  as  to  meet	 the
requirements of	 changing conditions  it was not permissible
to touch  the foundation or to alter the basic institutional
pattern.   Therefore,	 the   words   "amendment   of	 the
Constitution", in   spite of the width of their sweep and in
spite of  their amplitude,  could not  have  the  effect  of
empowering the	Parliament to  destroy or abrogate the basic
structure or framework of the Constitution.

<p id="p_33">     We	 will	first  take   up   for	 consideration	 the
comparatively easier question as regards the validity of the
amendments made	 by <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_281">section  55</a> of  the 42nd  Amendment.  It
introduces two new clauses in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_282">Article 368</a>, namely, clauses 4
and S.	Clause S  speaks for itself and is self explanatory.
Its avowed  purpose is the "removal of doubts" but after the
decision of this Court in Kesavananda Bharati (Supra), there
could be no doubt as regards the existence of limitations on
the Parliament's  power to  amend the  Constitution. In	 the
context of  the constitutional	history of  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_283">Article 368</a>, the
true object  of the  declaration contained in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_284">Article 368</a> is
the removal  of those limitations. Clause S confers upon the
Parliament  a	vast  and   undefined  power  to  amend	 the
Constitution, even,  so as to distort it out of recognition.
The theme  song	 of  the  majority  decision  in  Keshvanand
Bharati (Supra)	 is: 'Amend  as	 you  may  even	 the  solemn
document which	the founding  fathers have committed to your
care, for  you know  best the needs of your generation. But,
the Constitution  is a	precious  heritage;  therefore,	 you
cannot destroy	its identity'.	The majority conceded to the
Parliament the right to make alterations in the Constitution
so long as they are within its basic framework. And
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">240</span>
what fears can that judgment raise or misgivings generate if
it only	 means this and no more: The Preamble assures to the
people of  India a polity whose basic structure is described
therein as  a Sovereign	 Democratic Republic; Parliament may
make  any   amendments	to  the	 Constitution  as  it  deems
expedient so  long as  they do not damage or destroy India's
sovereignty  and   its	democratic,   republican  character.
Democracy is  not an empty dream. It is a meaningful concept
whose essential	 attributes  are  recited  in  the  preamble
itself: Justice,  social, economic and political; Liberty of
thought, expression, belief, faith and worship, and Equality
of status  and opportunity. Its aim, again as set out in the
preamble, is to promote among the people an abiding sense of
'Fraternity assuring  the dignity  of the individual and the
unity of  the Nation'.	The newly  introduced  clause  S  of
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_285">Article	 368</a>  demolishes  the  very  pillars  on  which	 the
preamble rests	by empowering the Parliament to exercise its
constituent power  without  any	 "limitation  whatever".  No
constituent power  can conceivably  go higher  than the sky-
high power conferred by clause (S), for it even empowers the
Parliament to  "repeal the provisions of this Constitution",
that is to say, to abrogate the democracy and substitute for
it a  totally antithetical form of Government. That can most
effectively be	achieved, without calling a democracy by any
other name,  by a  total  denial  of  social,  economic	 and
political justice  to the people, by emasculating liberty of
thought,  expression,  belief,	faith  and  worship  and  by
abjuring commitment to the magnificent ideal of a society of
equals. The power to destroy is not a power to amend.
</p><p id="p_34">     Since the Constitution had conferred a limited amending
power on  the Parliament,  the Parliament  cannot under	 the
exercise of  that limited power enlarge that very power into
an absolute  power. Indeed,  a limited amending power is one
of the basic features of our Constitution and therefore, the
limitations on	that power  cannot be  destroyed.  In  other
words, Parliament  cannot, under  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_286">Article  368</a>,	 expand	 its
amending power	so as  to acquire  for itself  the right  to
repeal or  abrogate the Constitution or to destroy its basic
and essential  features. The donee of a limited power cannot
by the exercise of that power convert the limited power into
an unlimited one.
</p><p id="p_35">     The very  42nd Amendment which introduced clauses 4 and
5 in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_287">Article 368</a> made amendments to the preamble to which no
exception can be taken. Those amendments are not only within
the framework  of the Constitution but they give vitality to
its philosophy	they  afford  strength	and  succor  to	 its
foundation. By the aforesaid amendments, what was originally
described as  a 'Sovereign  Democratic	Republic'  became  a
"Sovereign Socialist Secular
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">241</span>
Democratic Republic"  and  the	resolution  to	promote	 the
`unity of the Nation' was elevated into a promise to promote
the "unity  and integrity  of the  Nation". These amendments
furnish the  most eloquent example of how the amending power
can  be	  exercised  consistently  with	 the  creed  of	 the
Constitution. They  offer  promise  of	more,  they  do	 not
scuttle a precious heritage.
</p><p id="p_36">     <a href="/doc/1240174/" id="a_288">In Smt.  Indira Nehru  Gandhi v. Raj Narain, Khanna, J</a>.
struck down  clause 4  of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_289">Article  329A</a> of  the Constitution
which abolished	 the forum  for adjucating  upon  a  dispute
relating to  the validity of an election, on the ground that
the  particular	  Article  which   was	   introduced  by  a
constitutional amendment  violated the principle of free and
fair elections	which is an essential postulate of democracy
and which,  in its turn, is a part of the basic structure of
the Constitution. Mathew, J. also struck down the Article on
the  ground   that  it	damaged	 the  essential	 feature  of
democracy. One	of us.	Chandrachud.  J.  reached  the	same
conclusion by  holding that  the provisions  of the  Article
were an outright negation of the right of equality conferred
by <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_290">Article  14</a>, a  right which,	 more than  any other,	is a
basic postulate of the Constitution. Thus whereas amendments
made to	 the preamble by the 42nd Amendment itself afford an
illustration of	 the scope  of the  amending power, the case
last referred  to affords an illustration of the limitations
on the amending power.
</p><p id="p_37">     Since, for	 the reasons  above mentioned,	clause 5  of
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_291">Article 368</a>  , transgresses  the limitations on the amending
power, it must be held to be unconstitutional.
</p><p id="p_38">     The newly	introduced clause  4  of  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_292">Article  368</a>	must
suffer the same fate as clause 5 because the two clauses are
inter-linked. Clause 5 purports to remove all limitations on
the amending  power while  clause 4  deprives the  courts of
their power  to	 call  in  question  any  amendment  of	 the
Constitution. Our  Constitution is founded on a nice balance
of power  among the  three wings  of the  State, namely	 the
Executive, the	Legislature and	 the Judiciary.	 It  is	 the
function of  the Judges,  nay their  duty, to pronounce upon
the validity of laws. If courts are totally deprived of that
power, the fundamental rights conferred upon the people will
become a  mere adornment because rights without remedies are
as writ in water. A controlled Constitution will then become
uncontrolled. Clause (4) of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_293">Article 368</a> totally deprives the
citizens of  one of the most valuable modes of redress which
is guaranteed  by <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_294">Article 32.</a> The conferment of the right to
destroy the  identity of  the Constitution  coupled with the
provision that no court of law
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">242</span>
shall pronounce	 upon the validity of such destruction seems
to us a transparent case of transgression of the limitations
on the amending power.
</p><p id="p_39">     If a  constitutional amendment  cannot be pronounced to
be invalid  even if  it destroys  the basic structure of the
Constitution, a law passed in pursuance of such an amendment
will be	 beyond the  pale of judicial review because it will
receive the protection of the constitutional amendment which
the courts  will be  powerless to strike down. <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_295">Article 13</a> of
the Constitution will then become a dead letter because even
ordinary laws  will escape the scrutiny of the courts on the
ground	that   they  are   passed  on	the  strength  of  a
constitutional amendment which is not open to challenge.
</p><p id="p_40">     Clause 4 of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_296">Article 368</a> is in one sense an appendage of
Clause 5,  though we do not like to describe it as a logical
consequence of	Clause 5. If it be true, as stated in clause
5, that	 the Parliament	 has unlimited	power to  amend	 the
Constitution, courts can have no jurisdiction to strike down
any constitutional  amendment as unconstitutional. Clause 4,
therefore, says	 nothing more  or less	than what  clause  5
postulates. If	clause 5 is beyond the amending power of the
Parliament, clause  4 must  be equally beyond that power and
must be struck down as such.
</p><p id="p_41">     The next  question which we have to consider is whether
the amendment  made by	<a href="/doc/1587307/" id="a_297">section 4</a>  of the  42nd Amendment to
<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_298">Article 31C</a> of the Constitution is valid. Mr. Palkhiwala did
not challenge the validity of the unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_299">Article 31C</a>, and
indeed that  would not	be done.  The unamended	 <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_300">Article 31C</a>
forms the  subject matter of separate proceeding and we have
indicated therein  that it  is constitutionally valid to the
extent	to  which  it  was  upheld  in	Keshvananda  Bharati
(Supra).
</p><p id="p_42">     By the  amendment introduced  by <a href="/doc/1587307/" id="a_301">section  4</a> of the 42nd
Amendment, provision  is made  in <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_302">Article 31C</a> saying that no
law giving  effect  to	the  policy  of	 the  State  towards
securing "all or any of the principles laid down in Part IV"
shall be  deemed to  be	 void  on  the	ground	that  it  is
inconsistent with  or takes  away or  a bridges	 any of	 the
rights conferred by <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_303">Article 14</a>, <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_304">Article 19</a> or <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_305">Article 31.</a> It
is manifest that the scope of laws which fall within <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_306">Article
31C</a> has been expanded vastly by the amendment. Whereas under
the original   <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_307">Article	31C</a>, the challenge was excluded only
in respect  of laws giving effect to the policy of the State
towards securing  "the principles specified in clause (b) or
clause (c) of <a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_308">Article 39"</a> under the amendment.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">243</span>
<p id="p_43">all laws  giving effect	 to the	 policy of the State towards
securing "all or any of the principles laid down in Part IV"
are saved  from a constitutional challenge under Articles 14
and 19. (The reference to <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_309">Article 31</a> was deleted by the 44th
Amendment as  a consequence of the abolition of the right to
property  as   a  fundamental	right).	 The   question	 for
consideration in  the light  of	 this  position	 is  whether
<a href="/doc/1587307/" id="a_310">section 4</a>  of the  42nd Amendment has brought about a result
which is  basically and fundamentally different from the one
arising under	the unamended article. If the amendment does
not bring  about any such result, its validity shall have to
be upheld for the same reasons for which the validity of the
unamended article was upheld.
</p><p id="p_44">     The argument  of Mr.  Palkhivala, who appears on behalf
of the	petitioners, runs thus : The amendment introduced by
<a href="/doc/1587307/" id="a_311">section 4</a> of the 42nd Amendment destroys the harmony between
Parts  III   and  IV  of  the  Constitution  by	 making	 the
fundamental rights  conferred by Part III subservient to the
directive principles  of State	Policy set out in Part IV of
the   Constitution.    The   Constitution-makers   did	 not
contemplate  a	 disharmony   or   imbalance   between	 the
fundamental rights  and the  directive principles and indeed
they were  both meant  to supplement  each other.  The basic
structure of  the Constitution	tests on the foundation that
while the  directive principles	 are the  mandatory ends  of
government,  those   ends  can	 be  achieved  only  through
permissible means  which are  set out  in Part	III  of	 the
constitution. In  other words, the mandatory ends set out in
Part IV can be achieved not through totalitarian methods but
only through those which are consistent with the fundamental
rights conferred  by Part  III. If <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_312">Article 31C</a> as amended by
the 42nd  Amendment is	allowed to  stand, it will confer an
unrestricted licence  on the  legislature and the executive,
both at	 the Centre  and in the States. to destroy democracy
and  establish	an  authoritarian  regime.  All	 legislative
action and every governmental action purports to be related,
directly or indirectly, to some directive principle of State
policy. The protection of the amended article will therefore
be available  to every	legislative action  under  the	sun.
<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_313">Article 31C</a>  abrogates the  right to  equality guaranteed by
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_314">Article 14</a>,  which is  the very	 foundation of	a republican
form of	 government and	 is by itself a basic feature of the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_45">     The  learned   counsel  further   argues  that   it  is
impossible to envisage that a destruction of the fundamental
freedoms guaranteed  by Part  III is necessary for achieving
the object  of some  of the  directive principles like equal
justice and  free legal	 aid, organising  village panchayat,
providing living  wages for  workers  and  just	 and  humane
conditions of work. free and compulsory education for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">244</span>
children, organisation	of agriculture and animal husbandry,
an  protection	of  environment	 and  wild  life.  What	 the
Constituent Assembly  had rejected  by creating a harmonious
balance between Parts III and IV is brought back by the 42nd
Amendment.
</p><p id="p_46">     Finally, it  is urged  that the  Constitution had	made
provision  for	the  suspension	 of  the  right	 to  enforce
fundamental rights  when an  emergency is  proclaimed by the
President. Under  the  basic  scheme  of  the  Constitution,
fundamental rights  were to lose their supremacy only during
the  period   that  the	 proclamation  of  emergency  is  in
operation. <a href="/doc/1587307/" id="a_315">Section  4</a> of  the 42nd  Amendment has robbed the
fundamental  rights   of  their	  supremacy  and  made	them
subordinate to	the directive  principles of State policy as
if there  were a  permanent emergency  in  operation.  While
<a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_316">Article 359</a>  suspends the  enforcement of fundamental rights
during the  Emergency, <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_317">Article	31C</a> virtually abrogates them
in normal  times. Thus,	 apart from  destroying one,  of the
basic features	of the	Constitution,  namely,	the  harmony
between Parts  III and	IV, <a href="/doc/1587307/" id="a_318">section  4</a> of the 42nd Amendment
denies to  the people  the blessings of a free democracy and
lays the  foundation for  the creation	of an  authoritarian
State.
</p><p id="p_47">     These contentions	were stoutly resisted by the learned
Attorney  General   thus:  Securing  the  implementation  of
directive principles by the elimination of obstructive legal
procedures cannot  ever be  said to  destroy or	 damage	 the
basic features	of the	Constitution. Further, laws made for
securing the  objectives of  Part IV would necessarily be in
public interest	 and will  fall within	<a href="/doc/1801593/" id="a_319">Article 19(5)</a> of the
Constitution, in  so far  as clauses  (d) and (e) of <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_320">Article

case. The  history of  the  Constitution.  particularly	 the
incorporation of  Articles 31(4)  and 31(6)  and the various
amendments made	 by Articles  31A,  31B	 and  the  unamended
<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_321">Article 31C</a>,  which were all upheld by this Court, establish
the width  OB the  amending power  under  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_322">Article  368.</a>	 The

abrogating fundamental	freedoms or  of damaging  the  basic

itself is  founded on  the  principle  of  justice,  social,

<p id="p_49">with <a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_325">Article  38</a> cannot conceivably abrogate the fundamental
freedoms   except certain  economic rights and that too, for
the purpose  of minimising  inequalities. A  law which	will
abrogate fundamental freedoms will either bring about social
injustice or  economic injustice  or political injustice. It
will thereby  contravene  <a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_326">Article  38</a>  rather  than  falling
within it and will for that reason be outside the protection

structure of the  Constitution.
</p><p id="p_50">     The learned  Additional Solicitor General has submitted
a carefully  prepared chart  of 11  decisions of  this Court
ranging from  Anvar Ali	 Sarkar to Haji Kader Kutty in order
to show	 the possible impact of amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_329">Article 31C</a> on cases
where this  Court had held provisions of certain statutes to
be violative  of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_330">Article  14.</a> He  urged on  the basis of his
tabulated analysis  that there	can be	many cases which are
not relatable to directive principles and will not therefore
be saved by the amended article. Those cases are reported in
Anwar Ali  Sarkar (Supra), Lachmandas Ahuja, Habib Muhammad,
Moopil Nair,  Jialal, Hazi  Abdul Shakur,  Devi Das, Osmania
University, New	 Manek Chowk, Anandji Haridas and Haji Kader
Kutty (Supra).	He has	also submitted	a chart	 of 13 cases
involving laws relatable to directive principle in which the
fundamental rights  were abridged  but not  abrogated. Since
abridgement of	fundamental rights  in	public	interest  is
permissible as	it does not damage the basic structure, laws
similar to  those involved  in the 13 cases will not have to
seek  the   protection	of   the  amended   article.   These
illustrative  cases   are:  Ram	 Prasad	 Sahi,	Rao  Manohar
Singhji,  Kunhikaman.

</p><p id="p_52">     The  argument   of	 the  learned  Additional  Solicitor
General	 proceeds   thus:  For	 extracting  the   ratio  of
Keshvananda Bharati  (Supra). One  must proceed on the basis
that there  were as  many cases	 as there  were declarations
sought for  by the  petitioners	 therein.  The	majority  in
regard to  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_331">Article 368</a>	is different  from the	majority  in
regard to  the decision	 in  respect  of  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_332">Article  31C.</a>	 The
binding ratio  in regard to <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_333">Article 368</a> as well as the ratio
resulting in  upholding the  validity	of the first part of
the <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_334">Article  31C</a> will both sustain the validity of <a href="/doc/1587307/" id="a_335">section 4</a>
of the	42nd Amendment. In regard to fundamental rights, the
ratio of  the judgments	 of 12	out of	13 Judges, i.e., all
excepting Jagamohan Reddy J., will empower amendment of each
one of	the articles  in part  III, so	long as	 there is no
total abrogation  of the fundamental rights which constitute
essential  features   of  the	basic	structure   of	 the
Constitution. Abrogation  of fundamental rights which do not
constitute essential  features of  the	basic  structure  or
abridgement of	fundamental  rights  which  constitute	such
essential features  is	within	the  permissible  limits  of
amendment. The	unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_336">Article  31C</a> having been upheld by
the majority  in Kesavanada  Bharti both  on the  ground  of
stare  decisis	 and  on   the	ground	of  'contemporaneous
practical exposition'  the amended  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_337">Article 31C</a> must be held
to be  valid, especially  since it  is not  brought about  a
qualitative change  in comparison with the provisions of the
unamended article.  A harmonious  and orderly development of
constitutional	law   would   require	that   the   phrases
'inconsistent with'  or 'take  away' which occur in Articles
31A, 31B  and 31C  should be read down to mean 'restrict' or
'abridge' and  not 'abrogate'. If two constructions of those
expressions  were  reasonably  possible,  the  Court  should
accept	 that	 construction	which	would	render	 the
constitutional amendment valid.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">247</span>
<p id="p_53">     The  learned  counsel  further  argues:  The  directive
principles,   including the  one contained in <a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_338">Article 38</a>, do
not cover  the exercise	 of each and every legislative power
relatable to  the  Seventh  Schedule  of  the  Constitution.
Besides,   the	 directive   principles	  being	  themselves
fundamental in	the governance	of the country, no amendment
of the	Constitution to	 achieve the  ends specified  in the
directive principles  can ever	alter the basic structure of
the Constitution.  If the  unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_339">Article 31C</a> is valid in
reference to  laws relatable  to Articles  39(b) and (c), no
dichotomy can  be  made	 between  laws	relatable  to  those
provisions on  the one	hand and  laws	relatable  to  other
directive principles. A value judgment is not permissible to
the Court in this area.
</p><p id="p_54">     It is finally urged by the learned Additional Solicitor
General that  judicial review is not totally excluded by the
amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_340">Article	 31C</a> because  it will  still be	 open to the
Court to consider:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">     (i)     whether  the   impugned  law  has	'direct	 and
	  reasonable  nexus'   with  any  of  the  directive
	  principles.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">     (ii) whether  the provisions encroaching on fundamental
	  rights are integrally connected with and essential
	  for effectuating  the directive  principles or are
	  at least ancillary thereto;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">      (iii) whether the fundamental right encroached upon is
	  an essential feature of the basic structure of the
	  Constitution; and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">     (iv)  if  so,  whether  the  encroachment,	 in  effect,
	  abrogates that fundamental right.</blockquote>
<p id="p_55">     Besides these  contentions Mr.  R. K.  Garg has filed a
written brief  on behalf of the Indian Federation of Working
Journalists, opposing  the contentions of Mr. Palkhivala. So
have the learned Advocates General of the State of Karnataka
and Uttar Pradesh. Mr. Aruneshwar Gupta has filed a brief on
behalf of  the State of Rajasthan supporting the submissions

Advocates-General of  Maharashtra, Kerala,  West Bengal	 and
Orissa appeared through their respective advocates.
</p><p id="p_56">     Both the  Attorney General and the Additional Solicitor
General	 have	raised	a   preliminary	 objection   to	 the
consideration of  the question	raised by the petitioners as
regards the  validity of  <a href="/doc/1587307/" id="a_341">Sections 4</a>  and  <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_342">55</a>  of  the	42nd
Amendment. It is contended by them that the issue formulated
for consideration  of the  court; "whether the provisions of
the  Forty-Second   Amendment  of   the	 Constitution  which
deprived the  Fundamental Rights  of  their  Supremacy	and,
inter  alia,   made  them   subordinate	 to   the  directive
principles of State Policy are
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">248</span>
ultra vires  the amending  power of Parliament?" is too wide
and academic.  It is  urged that  since it  is	the  settled
practice of  the court	not to decide academic questions and
since property rights claimed by the petitioners under Arts.
19(1)(f) and 31 do not survive after the 44th Amendment, the
court should not entertain any argument on the points raised
by the petitioners.
</p><p id="p_57">     In support of this submission reliance is placed by the
learned counsel	 on the	 decisions of  the American  Supreme
Court in Commonwealth of Massachussetts v. Andrew W. Mellon.
George	Ashwander  v.  Tennesee	 Valley	 Authority,  and  on
Weaver's  Constitutional  Law,	1946  Edition  and  American
Jurisprudence. Reliance	 is also placed on certain decisions
of this	 court to  which it  is unnecessary to refer because
the Attorney-General  and the  Additional Solicitor  General
are right  that it is the settled practice of this Court not
to decide  academic questions.	The American  authorities on
which the  learned counsel  rely  take	the  view  that	 the
constitutionality of  a statute	 will not  be considered and
determined by the courts as a hypothetical question, because
constitutional questions are not to be dealt with abstractly
or in  the manner of an academic discussion. In other words,
the courts  do not anticipate constitutional issues so as to
assume in  advance that	 a certain  law	 may  be  passed  in
pursuance of  a certain	 constitutional amendment  which may
offend	against	  the  provisions   of	 the   Constitution.
Similarly, our Court has consistently taken the view that we
will not formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than
is required  by the  precise facts  to which  it  is  to  be
applied. It  is only when the rights of persons are directly
involved that relief is granted by this Court.
</p><p id="p_58">     But, we  find it  difficult to  uphold the	 preliminary
objection because, the question raised by the petitioners as
regards the  constitutionality of  <a href="/doc/1587307/" id="a_343">sections 4</a>  and <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_344">55</a> of the
42nd  Amendment	  is  not  an  academic	 or  a	hypothetical
question. The 42nd Amendment is there for any one to see and
by its	<a href="/doc/1587307/" id="a_345">sections 4</a>  and <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_346">55</a>  amendments	have  been  made  to
Articles 31C  and 368 of the Constitution. An order has been
passed against	the petitioners	 under <a href="/doc/1892928/" id="a_347">section	18A</a>  of	 the
Industries (Development	 and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_348">Regulation) Act</a>, 1951, by which
the petitioners	 are aggrieved.	 Besides there are two other
relevant considerations	 which must  be taken  into  account
while dealing  with the	 preliminary objection.	 There is no
constitutional or statutory inhibition against the decision
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">249</span>
of questions  before they  actually arise for consideration.
In view of the importance of the question raised and in view
of the	fact that  the question	 has been  raised in  many a
petition, it  is expedient  in the  interest of	 Justice  to
settle the true position. Secondly, what we are dealing with
is not	an ordinary  law which	may or	may not be passed so
that it could be said that our jurisdiction is being invoked
on the	hypothetical consideration  that a law may be passed
in future  which will  injure the rights of the petitioners.
We are	dealing with  a constitutional	amendment which	 has
been brought  into operation  and which,  of its  own force,
permits the  violation	of  certain  freedoms  through	laws
passed for  certain purposes.  We, therefore,  overrule	 the
preliminary objection  and proceed  to determine  the  point
raised by the petitioners.
</p><p id="p_59">     The main  controversy in  these petitions centres round
the question  whether  the  directive  principles  of  State
policy contained  in  Art  IV  can  have  primacy  over	 the
fundamental  rights   conferred	  by   Part   III   of	 the
Constitution. That  is the  heart of the matter. Every other
consideration and all other contentions are in the nature of
by-products of that central theme of the case. The competing
claims of  parts III  and IV constitute the pivotal point of
the case because, <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_349">Article 31C</a> as amended by <a href="/doc/1587307/" id="a_350">section 4</a> of the
42nd Amendment provides in terms that a law giving effect to
any directive  principle cannot be challenged as void on the
ground that  it violates  the rights conferred by <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_351">Article 14</a>
or <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_352">Article  19.</a> The  42nd Amendment  by its  <a href="/doc/1587307/" id="a_353">section 4</a>	thus
subordinates the fundamental rights conferred by Articles 14
and 19 to the directive principles.
</p><p id="p_60">     The question  of questions	 is whether  in view  of the
majority decision  in Kesavananda  Bharati it is permissible
to the	Parliament to so amend the Constitution as to give a
position of  precedence to  directive  principles  over	 the
fundamental  rights.   The  answer  to	this  question	must
necessarily depend  upon whether  Articles 14  and 19  which
must now  give way to laws passed in order to effectuate the
policy of  the State  towards securing	all or	any  of	 the
principles of directive Policy are essential features of the
basic structure	 of the	 Constitution. It  is  only  if	 the
rights conferred by these two articles are not a part of the
basic structure.  Of  the  Constitution	 that  they  can  be
allowed to  be abrogated  by a	constitutional amendment. If
they are  a part  of the  basic	 structure  they  cannot  be
obliterated out	 of existence  in relation  to a category of
laws described in <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_354">Article 31C</a> or, for the matter of that, in
relation to  laws of  any description  whatsoever, passed in
order to  achieve any object or policy whatsoever. This will
serve to  bring out  the point	that a total emasculation of
the essential  features of the Constitution is, by the ratio
in Kesavananda Bharati, not permissible to the Parliament.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">250</span>
<p id="p_61">     There is  no doubt	 that though  the courts have always
attached very  great importance to the preservation of human
liberties, no  less importance	has been attached to some of
the Directive  Principles of State Policy enunciated in Part
IV.  In	  the  words   of  Granville  Austin,.	(The  Indian
Constitution: Corner  Stone of	a Nation,  p. 50) the Indian
Constitution is first and foremost a social document and the
majority of its provisions are aimed at furthering the goals
of  social   revolution	 by   establishing  the	  conditions
necessary for  its achievement.	 Therefore the importance of
Directive Principles  in  the  scheme  of  our	Constitution
cannot ever be over-emphasized. Those principles project the
high ideal  which the  Constitution aims to achieve. In fact
Directive Principles  of State policy are fundamental in the
governance of  the country and the Attorney General is right
that there  is no  sphere of  public life  where  delay	 can
defeat justice	with more  telling effect  than the  one  in
which  the   common  man   seeks  the	realisation  of	 his
aspirations. The  promise of  a	 better	 to-morrow  must  be
fulfilled to-day;  day after  to-morrow it  runs the risk of
being conveniently  forgotten. Indeed so many tomorrows have
come and  gone without	a leaf turning that today there is a
lurking danger	that people  will  work	 out  their  destiny
through the compelled cult of their own "dirty hands". Words
bandied about  in marbled halls say much but fail to achieve
as much.
</p><p id="p_62">     But there	is another competing constitutional interest
which occupies	an equally  important place  in that scheme.
That interest  is reflected  in the  provisions of  Part III
which confer fundamental rights some on citizens as Articles
15, 16	and 19 do and some on. all persons alike as Articles
14, 20, 21 and 22 do. As Granville Austin says: "The core of
the commitment	to the	social revolution  lies in Parts III
and IV.. These are the conscience of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_63">     It is  needless to	 cite decisions	 which have extolled
and upheld  the personal  freedoms  their  majesty,  and  in
certain circumstances,	their inviolability.  It may however
be profitable to see how the American Supreme Court, dealing
with a	broadly comparable  Constitution, has approached the
claim for those freedoms.
</p><p id="p_64">     In Barbara	 Elfbrandt v.  Imogene	Russell	 the  U.  S.
Supreme Court  was considering	the constitutionality  of an
Arizona Statute	 requiring State employees to take a loyalty
oath. Justice  Douglas speaking	 for the  majority, observed
while  striking	  down	the   provision	 that:	 "Legitimate
Legislative goals  'cannot be  pursued by means that broadly
stifle fundamental personal liberties when the end can
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">251</span>
be more	 narrowly  achieved'..	"The  objectionable  quality
of....... overbreadth"	depends	 upon  the  existence  of  a
statute "susceptible  of sweeping and improper application..
These freedoms	are  delicate  and  vulnerable	as  well  as
supremely precious  in our  society. The threat of sanctions
may deter  their exercise  almost as  potently as the actual
application of sanctions".
</p><p id="p_65">     In United	States v.  Herbet Guest, though the right to
travel freely  throughout the territory of the United States
of America does not find an explicit mention in the American
Constitution, it  was held that the right to travel from one
State to  another occupied  a position	fundamental  to	 the
concept of  the Federal	 Union and  the reason why the right
was not	 expressly mentioned  in the  American	Constitution
though it  was mentioned  in the  Articles of Confideration,
was that  "a right  so elementary  was	conceived  from	 the
beginning to  be a  necessary concomitant  of  the  stronger
Union the Constitution created".
</p><p id="p_66">     This position  was reiterated in Winfield Dunn v. James
F. Blumstein.  It was  held therein  that freedom  to travel
throughout the	United States  was a  basic right  under the
Constitution  and   that  the  right  was  an  unconditional
personal  right	 whose	exercise  may  not  be	conditioned.
Therefore, any	classification which  serves to penalize the
exercise of  that right,  unless shown	to be  necessary  to
promote	  a    compelling   governmental    interest,	 was
unconstitutional.
</p><p id="p_67">     In New  York Times	 Company v. United States the United
States	Government   sought  an	  injunction   against	 the
publication, by	 the New York Times, of the classified study
entitled "History  of U.  S. Decision-Making Process on Viet
Nam Policy".  It was  held by  a majority of six Judges that
any system  of prior  restraints of  expression comes to the
United States  Supreme Court  bearing  a  heavy	 presumption
against its  constitutional validity, and a party. who seeks
to have	 such a restraint upheld thus carries a heavy burden
of showing  justification  for	the  imposition	 of  such  a
restraint.

</p><p id="p_70">     In Jesse  Cantwell v.  State  of  Connecticut,  Justice
Roberts who delivered the opinion of the Court observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">	  "In the  realm of  religious faith, and in that of
     political belief,	sharp  differences  arise.  In	both
     fields the tenets of one man may seem the rankest error
     to his  neighbour. To  persuade others to his own point
     of view,  the pleader, as we know, at times, resorts to
     exaggeration, to  vilification of	men who have been or
     are, prominent  in church	or state,  and even to false
     statement. But  the people of this nation have ordained
     in	 the  light  of	 history,  that,  in  spite  of	 the
     probability of  excesses and  abuses,  these  liberties
     are, in the long view, essential to enlightened opinion
     and right	conduct on  the part  of the  citizens of  a
     democracy.	 The   essential  characteristic   of  these
     liberties is,  that under	their shield  many types  of
     life,  character,	 opinion  and	belief	can  develop
     unmolested and  unobstructed, Nowhere  is	this  shield
     more necessary  than in  our own  country for  a people
     composed of  many races  and of  many creeds. There are
     limits to	the exercise  of these liberties. The danger
     in these  times from  the coercive	 activities of those
     who in  the delusion  of racial  or  religious  conceit
     would incite  violence and	 breaches of  the  peace  in
     order to  deprive others  of their	 equal right  to the
     exercise of  their liberties,  is emphasized  by events
     familiar to  all. These  and  other  transgressions  of
     those limits the states appropriately may punish".</blockquote>
<p id="p_71">     In Arthur	Terminiello  v.	 City  of  Chicago,  Justice
Douglas delivering  the majority opinion of the Court, while
dealing with  the importance  of the  right to	free speech,
observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">	  "The vitality	 of civil and political institutions
     in our  society depends  on free  discussion. As  Chief
     Justice Hughes  wrote in De Jonge v. Oregon, it is only
     through free debate and free
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">253</span>
     exchange of ideas that government remains responsive to
     the    will  of  the  people  and	peaceful  change  is
     effected, The  right to  speak freely  and	 to  promote
     diversity of  ideas and  programmes is therefore one of
     the  chief	  distinctions	that   sets  us	 apart	from
     totalitarian regimes.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">	  Accordingly a	 function of  free speech  under our
     system of	government is  to  invite  dispute.  It	 may
     indeed best  serve its  high purpose  when it induces a
     condition of  unrest,  creates    dissatisfaction	with
     conditions as  they are, or even stirs people to anger.
     Speech is	often provocative  and challenging.  It	 may
     strike  at	  prejudices  and  preconceptions  and	have
     profound  unsettling   effects  as	  it   presses	 for
     acceptance of  an idea. That  is why freedom of speech,
     though not	 absolute (Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire),  is
     nevertheless protected against censorship or punishment
     unless shown  likely to,  produce a  clear and  present
     danger of	a serious  substantive evil  that rises	 far
     above public  inconvenience, annoyance,  or unrest. See
     Bridges v.	 California; Craig  v. Horney.	There is  no
     room under	 our Constitution  for	a  more	 restrictive
     view. For the alternative would lead to standardization
     of ideas  either by  legislatures, courts,	 or dominant
     political or community groups."</blockquote>
<p id="p_72">     The history  of India's  struggle for  independence and
the debates  of the Constituent Assembly show how deeply our
people	value	their  personal	  liberties  and  how  those
liberties are regarded as an indispensable and integral part
of our Constitution. It is significant that though Parts III
and IV appear in the Constitution as two distinct fasciculus
of articles,  the leaders  of our independence movement drew
no distinction between the two kinds of State's obligations-
negative and  positive. "Both  types of rights had developed
as a  common demand,  products of  the national	 and  social
revolutions, of	 their almost  inseparable intertwining, and
of the character of Indian politics - itself(4)". The demand
for inalienable	 rights traces	its origin  in	India to the
19th Century  and flowered  into the formation of the Indian
National Congress  in 1885.  Indians demanded  equality with
their British  rulers on  the theory  that the rights of the
subjects cannot	 in a  democracy be inferior to those of the
rulers. Out  of that demand  grew the plants of equality and
free speech.  Those  and  other	 basic	rights	found  their
expression in <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_355">Article 16</a> of The Constitution of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">254</span>
India  Bill,   1895.  A	  series  of   Congress	 resolutions
reiterated that	 demand between 1917 and 1919. The emergence
of Mahatma  Gandhi; on	the  political	scene  gave  to	 the
freedom movement  a new	 dimension: it	ceased to  be merely
anti-British it	 became a  movement for	 the acquisition  of
rights of  liberty for	the Indian  Community. Mrs.  Besan't
Commonwealth of	 India Bill,  1925 and	the Madras  Congress
resolution of  1928 provided  a striking continuity for that
movement. The  Motilal Nehru  Committee	 appointed  by	the.
Madras Congress resolution said at pp. 89-90:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">	  "It is  obvious that	our first  care should be to
     have our  Fundamental Rights  guaranteed  in  a  manner
     which  will  not  permit  their  withdrawal  under	 any
     circumstances.. Another  reason  why  great  importance
     attaches to  a Declaration of Rights is the unfortunate
     existence	of  communal  differences  in  the  country.
     Certain  safeguards   are	necessary   to	create	 and
     establish a sense of security among those who look upon
     each other	 with distrust	and suspicion.	We could not
     better secure  the	 full  enjoyment  of  religious	 and
     communal rights  to all  communities than	by including
     them among the basic principles of the Constitution."
</blockquote><p id="p_73">India represents  a mosaic of humanity consisting of diverse
religious linguistic  and caste groups. The rationale behind
the insistence	on fundamental	rights has  not yet lost its
relevance, alas	 or not,  The Congress	session	 of  Karachi
adopted in 1931 the Resolution on Fundamental Rights as well
as on  Economic and  Social change. The Sapru Report of 1945
said that the fundamental rights should serve as a "standing
warning" to all concerned that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">	  "what the  Constitution  demands  and	 expects  is
     perfect. equality	between one section of the Community
     and another in the matter of political and civic rights
     equality of  liberty and  security in  the enjoyment of
     the freedom of religion, worship and the pursuit of the
     ordinary applications of life". (p. 260).</blockquote>
<p id="p_74">     The  Indian   nation  marched   to	 freedom   in	this
background. The	 Constituent Assembly  resolved to  enshrine
the  fundamental   rights  in	the  written   text  of	 the
Constitution. The  interlinked goals of personal liberty and
economic  freedom  then	 came  to  be  incorporated  in	 two
separate  parts,   nevertheless	 parts	 of   an   integral,
indivisible scheme  which  was	carefully  and	thoughtfully
nursed over  half a  century. The  seeds sown  in  the	19th
Century saw  their fruition  in 1950 under the leadership of
Jawaharlal Nehru and Dr. Ambedkar. To destroy the guarantees
given by  Part III in order purportedly to achieve the goals
of Part	 IV  is	 plainly  to  subvert  the  Constitution  by
destroying its basic structure.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">255</span>
<p id="p_75">     Fundamental rights	 occupy a  unique place in the lives
of civilized  societies and have been variously described in
our  Judgments	 as  "transcendental",	 "inalienable"	 and
"primordial". For us, it has been said in Kesavananda Bharti
(p. 991), they constitute the ark of the constitution.
</p><p id="p_76">     The significance  of the  perception that Parts III and
IV together  constitute the  core of  commitment  to  social
revolution and	they, together,	 are the  conscience of	 the
Constitution is	 to be traced to a deep understanding of the
scheme	of   the  Indian  Constitution.	 Granville  Austin's
observation brings  out the true position that Parts III and
IV are	like two  wheels of a chariot, one no less important
than the  other. You  snap one	and the	 other will lose its
efficacy. They	are like  a twin  formula for  achieving the
social revolution,  which is  the ideal	 which the visionary
founders of the Constitution set before themselves. In other
words, the Indian Constitution is founded on the bed-rock of
the balance  between Parts  III and  IV.  To  give  absolute
primacy to  one over  the other is to disturb the harmony of
the  Constitution.   This  harmony   and   balance   between
fundamental rights  and directive principles is an essential
feature of the basic structure of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_77">     This  is	not  mere  semantics.  The  edifice  of	 our
Constitution is	 built upon the concepts crystallised in the
Preamble.  We	resolved  to  constitute  ourselves  into  a
Socialist State	 which carried	with it	 the  obligation  to
secure to our people justice-social, economic and political.
We, therefore,	put part IV into our Constitution containing
directive principles  of  State	 policy	 which	specify	 the
socialistic goal to be achieved. We promised to our people a
democratic polity  which carries  with it  the obligation of
securing to  the  people  liberty  of  thought,	 expression,
belief,	 faith	and  worship;  equality	 of  status  and  of
opportunity and	 the  assurance	 that  the  dignity  of	 the
individual will	 at all	 costs be  preserved. We, therefore,
put Part, III in our Constitution conferring those rights on
the people.  Those rights  are not  an end in themselves but
are the	 means to  an end.  The end is specified in Part IV.
Therefore, the	rights conferred  by Art  III are subject to
reasonable restrictions	 and the  Constitution provides that
enforcement  of	  some	of  them  may,	in  stated  uncommon
circumstances,	be   suspended.	 But   just  as	 the  rights
conferred by Part III would be without a radar and a compass
if they	 were not geared to an ideal, in the same manner the
attainment of  the ideals  set out in Part IV would become a
pretence for  tyranny if  the price to be paid for achieving
that ideal  is human  freedoms. One  of the  faiths  of	 our
founding fathers  was the purity of means. Indeed, under our
law, even  a dacoit who has committed a murder cannot be put
to death
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">256</span>
in the	exercise of  right of self-defence after he has made
good his  escape. So  great is	the insistence	of civilised
laws on	 the purity  of means.	The goals set out in Part IV
have, therefore,  to be	 achieved without  the abrogation of
the means provided for by Part III. It is in this sense that
Parts III  and	IV  together  constitute  the  core  of	 our
Constitution and  combine to  form its	conscience. Anything
that destroys  the balance  between the	 two parts will ipso
facto destroy an essential element of the basic structure of
our Constitution.
</p><p id="p_78">     It is  in this  light that the validity of the. amended
<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_356">Article 31C</a>  has to be examined. <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_357">Article 13(2)</a> says that the
State shall  not make  any law	which takes away or abridges
the rights  conferred by  Part	Ill  and  any  law  made  in
contravention of  that clause  shall to	 the extent  of	 the
contravention be  void.	 <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_358">Article  31C</a>  begins  with  a	non-
obstante clause	 by putting <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_359">Article 13</a> out of harm's way. It
provides for  a certain consequence notwithstanding anything
contained in  <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_360">Article 13.</a> It then denudes Articles 14 and 19
of their  functional utility  by providing  that the  rights
conferred by  these Articles  will  be	no  barrier  against
passing laws  for giving  effect to the principles laid down
in Part	 IV. On	 any reasonable interpretation, there can be
no doubt  that by  the amendment  introduced by <a href="/doc/1587307/" id="a_361">section 4</a> of
the 42nd  Amendment, Articles  14 and  19 stand abrogated at
least in regard to the category of laws described in <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_362">Article
31C.</a> The  startling  consequence  which	 the  amendment	 has
produced is  that even	if a law is in total defiance of the
mandate of  <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_363">Article 13</a>	read with  Articles 14	and 19,	 its
validity will  not be open to question so long as its object
is to  secure a	 directive principle of state Policy. We are
disposed to  accept, the submission of the learned Solicitor
General, considering  the two  charts of  cases submitted by
him, that  it is possible to conceive of laws which will not
attract <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_364">Article	 31C</a> since  they may  not  bear	 direct	 and
reasonable nexus  with the provisions of Part IV. But, that,
in our	opinion, is  beside the	 point. A  large majority of
laws, the  bulk of them, can at any rate be easily justified
as having  been passed	for the	 purpose of giving effect to
the policy  of the  State towards securing some principle or
the other laid down in Part IV. In respect of all such laws,
which  will   cover  an	 extensive  gamut  of  the  relevant
legislative activity,  the protection  of Articles 15 and 19
will stand  wholly withdrawn.  It is  then no answer to say,
while  determining   whether  the  basic  structure  of	 the
Constitution is	 altered, that at least. some laws will fall
outside the scope of <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_365">Article 31C.</a>
</p><p id="p_79">     We	 have	to  decide  the	 matter	 before	 us  not  by
metaphysical subtlety,	nor as a matter of semantics, but by
a broad	 and liberal approach. We must not miss the wood for
the trees. A total
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">257</span>
deprivation of	fundamental rights,  even in a limited area,
can amount  to abrogation  of a	 fundamental right  just  as
partial deprivation in every area can. An author, who writes
exclusively on	foreign matters,  shall	 have  been  totally
deprived of the right of free speech and expression if he is
prohibited  from   writing  on	foreign	 matters.  The	fact
therefore that	some laws  may fall.  Outside the  scope  of
<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_366">Article	 31C</a>  is  no  answer  to  the  contention  that	 the
withdrawal of  protection of Articles 14 and 19 from a large
number	of   laws  destroys   the  basic  structure  of	 the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_80">     It was  repeatedly impressed upon us, especially by the
Attorney General, that <a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_367">Article 38</a> of the Constitution is the
king-pin of  the directive  principles and  no law passed in
order to  give effect to the principle contained therein can
ever  damage   or  destroy   the  basic	  structure  of	 the
Constitution. That  Article provides  that the	State  shall
strive to  promote the welfare of the people by securing and
protecting as  effectively as it may a social order in which
justice, social,  economic and	political, shall  inform all
the institutions  of the  national life.  We are  unable  to
agree that  all the  directive Principles  of  State  Policy
contained in  part IV  eventually  verge  upon	<a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_368">Article	 38.</a>
<a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_369">Article 38</a>  undoubtedly contains  a broad guideline, but the
other directive principles are not mere illustrations of the
principle contained  in <a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_370">Article	 38.</a> Secondly, if it be true
that no	 law passed  for the purpose of giving effect to the
directive principle  contained in  <a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_371">Article 38</a>  can damage or
destroy the  basic structure  of the  Constitution, what was
the necessity,	and more so the justification. for providing
by a  constitutional amendment	that no	 law which is passed
for giving  effect  to	the  policy  of	 the  State  towards
securing any  principle laid down in Part IV shall be deemed
to be  void on	the ground  that it  is inconsistent with or
takes away  or abridges	 the rights conferred by Articles 14
and 19	? The object and purpose of the amendment of <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_372">Article
31C</a> is	really to  save laws  which cannot  be	saved  under
<a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_373">Article 19(2)</a> to (6). Laws which fall under those provisions
are  in	  the  nature  of  reasonable  restrictions  on	 the
fundamental rights  in public  interest and  therefore	they
abridge but do not abrogate the fundamental rights It was in
order to  deal with  laws which do not get the protection of
<a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_374">Article 19(2)</a> to (6) that <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_375">Article 31</a> was amended to say that
the provisions	of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_376">Article 19</a>, inter alia, cannot be invoked
for voiding the laws of the description mentioned in <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_377">Article
31C.</a>
</p><p id="p_81">     Articles 14  and 19  do not confer any fanciful rights.
They confer  rights which  are elementary for the proper and
effective functioning  of a  democracy. They are universally
so regarded, as is evident from the universal Declaration of
Human Rights.  Many countries  in the  civilised world	have
parted with their sovereignty in the hope and belief
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">258</span>
that their  citizens will  enjoy human	freedoms.  And	they
preferred to  be bound	by  the	 decisions  and	 decrees  of
foreign tribunals  on matters  concerning human freedoms. If
Articles 14 and 19 are put out of operation in regard to the
bulk of	 laws which  the legislatures are empowered to pass,
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_378">Article 32</a>  will be drained of its life-blood. <a href="/doc/393253/" id="a_379">Article 32(4)</a>
provides that  the right. guaranteed by <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_380">Article 32</a> shall not
be  suspended  except  as  otherwise  provided	for  by	 the
Constitution. <a href="/doc/1587307/" id="a_381">Section  4</a> of the 42nd Amendment found an easy
way to	circumvent <a href="/doc/393253/" id="a_382">Article  32(4)</a> by withdrawing totally the
protection of  Articles 14  and 19  in respect	of  a  large
category of  laws, so  that there  will be  no violation  to
complain of  in regard	to which redress can be sought under
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_383">Article 32.</a> The power to take away the protection of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_384">Article
14</a> is  the power  to discriminate  without a valid basis for
classification. By a long series of decisions this Court had
held that  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_385">Article 14</a>  forbids class legislation but it does
not forbid  classification. The	 purpose of  withdrawing the
protection of  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_386">Article 14</a>, therefore, can only be to acquire
the power  to enact  class legislation. Then again, regional
chauvinism will	 have a field day if <a href="/doc/1024002/" id="a_387">Article 19(1)(d)</a> is not
available to  the citizens.  Already, there  are  disturbing
trends on  a part  of the  Indian horizon. Those trends will
receive strength  and encouragement  if laws  can be  passed
with immunity, preventing the citizens from exercising their
right to  move freely throughout the territory of India. The
nature and  quality of the amendment introduced by <a href="/doc/1587307/" id="a_388">section 4</a>
of the	42nd Amendment	is therefore  such that it virtually
tears away the heart of basic fundamental freedoms.
</p><p id="p_82">     <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_389">Article 31C</a>  speaks of laws giving effect to the policy
of the	"State". <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_390">Article 12</a> which governs the interpretation
of <a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_391">Article  3</a> LC  provides that the word "State" in Part III
includes the  Government and  Parliament of  India  and	 the
Government and the Legislature of each of the States and all
local or  other authorities within the territory of India or
under the  control of  the Government  of India. Wide as the
language of  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_392">Article 31C</a>  is, the  definition  of  the	word
"State" in  <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_393">Article 12</a>	gives to <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_394">Article 31C</a> an operation of
the widest  amplitude. Even  if a State Legislature passes a
law for	 the purpose  of giving	 effect to  the policy	by a
local authority	 towards securing a directive principle, the
law will  enjoy immunity  from the provisions of Articles 14
and 19.	 The State  Legislatures are  thus given  an  almost
unfettered discretion  to deprive  the people of their civil
liberties.
</p><p id="p_83">     The learned  Attorney General  argues that the State is
under an  obligation to take steps for promoting the welfare
of the	people by  bringing about  a social  order in  which
social, economic  and political justice shall inform all the
institutions  of   the	national  life.	 He  says  that	 the
deprivation of	some  of  the  fundamental  rights  for	 the
purpose
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">259</span>
of  achieving	this  goal   cannot  possibly  amount  to  a
destruction of	the  basic structure of the Constitution. We
are  unable   to  accept  this	contention.  The  principles
enunciated in  Part IV	are not	 the proclaimed	 monopoly of
democracies  alone.   They  are	  common  to  all  polities,
democratic or  authoritarian. Every  State is  goal-oriented
and claims to strive for securing the welfare of its people.
The distinction	 between the  different forms  of Government
consists in  that a real democracy will endeavour to achieve
its  objectives	  through  the	 discipline  of	 fundamental
freedoms like  those conferred	by Articles 14 and 19. Those
are the	 most  elementary  freedoms  without  which  a	free
democracy  is	impossible  and	  which	 must  therefore  be
preserved at  all Costs.  Besides, as  observed by Brandies,
J., the	 need  to  protect  liberty  is	 the  greatest	when
Government's purposes  are beneficent.	If the discipline of
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_395">Article 14</a>  is withdrawn  and if immunity from the operation
of that article is conferred, not only on laws passed by the
Parliament but	on laws	 passed by  the	 State	Legislatures
also, the political pressures exercised by numerically large
groups can  tear the  country asunder  by leaving  it to the
legislature to	pick and choose favoured areas and favourite
classes for preferential treatment.
</p><p id="p_84">     The learned  Attorney General and the learned Solicitor
General strongly  impressed upon  us that <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_396">Article 31C</a> should
be read	 down so  as  to  save	it  from  the  challenge  of
unconstitutionality.  It   was	urged	that  it   would  be
legitimate to  read into  that Article	the intendment	that
only such  laws would  be immunised from the challenge under
Articles 14  and 19  as do  not damage	or destroy the basic
structure of the Constitution. The principle of reading down
the provisions	of a law for the purpose of saving it from a
constitutional challenge  is  well-known.  But	we  find  it
impossible to  accept the  contention of the learned counsel
in this	 behalf because,  to do	 so  will  involve  a  gross
distortion of  the principle of reading down, depriving that
doctrine of  its only  or true rationale when words of width
are used inadvertently. The device of reading down is not to
be resorted  to in order to save the susceptibilities of the
law makers,  nor indeed	 to imagine a law of one's liking to
have been  passed. One	must at least take the Parliament at
its word  when, especially,  it undertakes  a constitutional
amendment.
</p><p id="p_85">     Mr. Palkhivala  read out  to us  an  extract  from	 the
speech of  the then  Law Minister who, while speaking on the
amendment to <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_397">Article 31</a> C, said that the amendment was being
introduced because  the government did not want the "let and
hindrance" of  the fundamental rights. If the Parliament has
manifested a clear intention to exercise an unlimited power,
it is impermissible to read down the amplitude of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">260</span>
that power  so as  to make  it	limited.  The  principle  of
reading down  cannot be	 invoked or applied in opposition to
the clear  intention of	 the legislature. We suppose that in
the history  of the  constitutional law,  no  constitutional
amendment has ever been read down to mean the exact opposite
of what it says and intends. In fact, to accept the argument
that we	 should read  down <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_398">Article  31C</a>, so  as to  make  it
conform to  the ratio  of the majority decision in Kesavanda
Bharti, is  to destroy the avowed purposes of <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_399">Article 31C</a> as
indicated by the very heading "Saving of certain laws" under
which Articles	31A, 31B  and 31C  are	grouped.  Since	 the
amendment to <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_400">Article 31C</a> was unquestionably made with a view
to empowering  the legislatures to pass laws of a particular
description even  if those  laws violate  the discipline  of
Articles 14  and 19,  it seems to us impossible to hold that
we should  still save  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_401">Article 31C</a>  from  the  challenge  of
unconstitutionality by reading into that Article words which
destroy the  rationale of  that Article	 and  an  intendment
which is plainly contrary to its proclaimed purpose.
</p><p id="p_86">     A part  of the same argument was pressed upon us by the
learned Additional  Solicitor General  who contended that it
would still  be open  to the  Courts under  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_402">Article  31C</a>  to
decide four  questions: (1)  Does the  law secure any of the
directive  principles  of  the	Stats  policy?	(ii)  Is  it
necessary to  encroach upon  fundamental rights	 in order to
secure the object of the directive principles? (iii) what is
the extent  of such encroachment, if any? and (iv) Does that
encroachment   violate	  the	basic	structure   of	 the
Constitution?
</p><p id="p_87">     This argument  is open  to the  same criticism to which
the argument  of the  learned Attorney	General is  open and
which we  have just disposed of. Reading the existence of an
extensive judicial  review into	 <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_403">Article 31C</a>  is  really  to
permit the  distortion of  the very purpose of that article.
It  provides   expressly  that	 no  law   of  a  particular
description shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it
violate	 <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_404">Article  14</a>  or  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_405">Article  19.</a>	It  would  be  sheer
adventurism of	a most extraordinary nature to undertake the
kind of	 judicial enquiry  which, according  to the  learned
Additional  Solicitor	General,  the  courts  are  free  to
undertake.
</p><p id="p_88">     We	 must  also  mention,  what  is	 perhaps  not  fully
realised, that	<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_406">Article 31C</a>  speaks of laws giving effect to
the "Policy  of the  State", "towards securing all or any of
the principles laid down in Part IV."' In the very nature of
things it  is difficult	 for a	court to determine whether a
particular law	gives effect to a particular policy. Whether
a law is adequate enough to give effect to the policy of the
State towards  securing a  directives principle	 is always a
debatable question
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">261</span>
and the	 courts cannot	set aside  the law as invalid merely
because, in their opinion, the law is not adequate enough to
give effect  to a  certain policy. In fact, though the clear
intendment of  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_407">Article 31C</a>  is	to  shut  out  all  judicial
review, the  argument of  the learned  Additional  Solicitor
General calls  for a  doubly or	 trebly	 extensive  judicial
review than  is even  normally permissible to the courts. Be
it be remembered that the power to enquire into the question
whether there  is a  direct and	 B. reasonable nexus between
the provisions	of a  law and  a directive  principle cannot
confer upon the courts the power to sit in judgment over the
policy itself  of the  State. At  the highest,	courts	can,
under <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_408">Article  31C</a>, satisfy themselves as to the identity of
the law	 in the sense whether it bears direct and reasonable
nexus with  a directive principle. If the court is satisfied
as  to	 the  existence	  of  such   nexus,  the  inevitable
consequence provided for by <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_409">Article 31C</a> must follow. Indeed,
if there  is one  topic	 on  which  all	 the  13  Judges  in
Kesavananda Bharati  were agreed,  it is this: that the only
question open to judicial review under the unamended <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_410">Article
31</a> was	whether there  is  a  direct  and  reasonable  nexus
between the impugned law and the provisions of <a href="/doc/1200546/" id="a_411">Article 39(b)</a>
and <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_412">(c).</a> Reasonableness is evidently regarding the nexus and
not regarding  the law. It is therefore impossible to accept
the contention	that it	 is open  to the courts to undertake
the kind  of enquiry  suggested by  the Additional Solicitor
General. The  attempt therefore	 to drape <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_413">Article 31C</a> into a
democratic outfit  under which	an extensive judicial review
would be permissible must fail.
</p><p id="p_89">     We should	have mentioned	that a	similar argument was
advanced in  regard to	the amendment effected by <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_414">section 55</a>
of the	42nd Amendment	to <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_415">Article  368</a>, by  the addition of
clauses (4)  and (5) therein. It was urged that we should so
construe the  word "amendment"	in clause  (4) and  the word
"amend" in clause 5 as to comprehend only such amendments as
do not destroy the basic structure of thy Constitution. That
argument provides a striking illustration of the limitations
of the	doctrine of  reading down.  The avowed	purpose.  Of
clauses (4)  and (5)  of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_416">Article 368</a> is to confer power upon
the  Parliament	  to  amend  the  Constitution	without	 any
"limitation whatever".	Provisions of  this nature cannot be
saved by  reading  into	 them  words  and  intendment  of  a
diametrically opposite meaning and content.
</p><p id="p_90">     The learned Attorney General then contends that <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_417">Article
31C</a> should  be upheld for the same reasons for which <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_418">Article
31A(1)</a> was  upheld. <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_419">Article  31A (1)</a>  was  considered  as  a
contemporaneous practical  exposition  of  the	Constitution
since it  was inserted by the very First Amendment which was
passed in  1951 by the same body of persons who were members
of the Constituent Assembly. We can understand:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">262</span>
<p id="p_91">that <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_420">Article  31A</a> can  be looked  upon as  a contemporaneous
Practical exposition  of the intendment of the Constitution,
but the	 same cannot  be said of <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_421">Article 31C.</a> Besides, there
is a  significant qualitative  difference  between  the	 two
Articles. <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_422">Article  31A</a>,	 the  validity	of  which  has	been
recognised over	 the  years  excludes  the  challenge  under
Articles 14  and 19  in regard	to a  specified category  of
laws. If  by a	constitutional amendment, the application of
Articles 14  and 19  is withdrawn  from a  defined field  of
legislative  activity,	 which	is   reasonably	 in   public
interest, the basic framework of the constitution may remain
unimpaired. But	 if the	 protection  of	 those	articles  is
withdrawn in  respect of  an uncatalogued  variety of  laws,
fundamental freedoms  will become  a 'parchment	 in a  glass
case' to be viewed as a matter of historical curiosity.
</p><p id="p_92">     An attempt was made to equate the provisions of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_423">Article
31</a> with	 those of  <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_424">Article 31A</a> in order to lend plausibility
to the	contention that since <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_425">Article 31A</a> was also upheld on
the ground  of stare decisis <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_426">Article 31</a> can be upheld on the
same ground.  We see  no merit	in this	 contention. In	 the
first place,  as we  have indicated  above. the five matters
which are  specified in	 <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_427">Article 31A</a>  are of  such  quality,
nature, content	 and character	that at	 least a  debate can
reasonably arise whether abrogation of fundamental rights in
respect of  those matters  will damage	or destroy the basic
structure of  the Constitution.	 <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_428">Article 31C</a>  does not	deal
with specific subjects. The directive principles are couched
in broad  and general  terms for the simple reason that they
specify the goals to be achieved. Secondly, the principle of
stare decisis  cannot be  treated as  a fruitful  source  of
perpetuating curtailment  of human  freedoms. No  court	 has
upheld the  validity of	 <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_429">Article 31A</a>  on the  ground that it
does not  violate the  basic structure	of the Constitution.
There is  no decision  on the  validity of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_430">Article 31A</a> which
can be	looked upon  as a measuring rod of the extent of the
amending power.	 To hark back to <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_431">Article 31A</a> every time that
a new  constitutional amendment	 is challenged is the surest
means of  ensuring a  drastic  erosion	of  the	 fundamental
rights	conferred   by	Part   III.  Such   a  process	will
insidiously undermine  the efficacy  of	 the  ratio  of	 the
majority  judgment  in	Kesavananda  Bharati  regarding	 the
inviolability of  the basic  structure. That  ratio requires
that the  validity of each new constitutional amendment must
be judged on its own merits.
</p><p id="p_93">     Nor indeed	 are we	 impressed by  a limb  of  the	same
argument that  when <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_432">Article  31A</a> was upheld on the ground of
stare decisis,	what was  upheld was a constitutional device
by which  a class of subject-oriented laws was considered to
be valid. The simple ground on which <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_433">Article 31A</a> was upheld,
apart  from   the  ground   of	 contemporaneous   practical
exposition,  was   that	 its   validity	 was   accepted	 and
recognised  over  the  years  and,  therefore,	it  was	 not
permissible
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">263</span>
to challenge  its constitutionality.  The principle of stare
decisis does  not  imply  the  approval	 of  the  device  or
mechanism which	 is employed  for the  purpose of  framing a
legal or constitutional provision.
</p><p id="p_94">     It was  finally urged  by the  learned Attorney General
that if	 we uphold  the challenge to the validity of <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_434">Article
31C</a>, the  validity or  clauses (2) to (6) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_435">Article 19</a> will
be gravely  imperilled because	those clauses will also then
be liable  to  be  struck  down	 as  abrogating	 the  rights
conferred by <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_436">Article 19(1)</a> which are an essential feature or
the Constitution.  We are  unable to accept this contention.
Under clauses  (2) to (6) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_437">Article 19</a>, restrictions can be
imposed only if they are reasonable and then again, they can
be imposed  in the  interest of	 a stated  class of subjects
only. It  is for  the courts  to decide whether restrictions
are reasonable	and whether  they are in the interest of the
particular subject.  Apart from other basic dissimilarities,
<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_438">Article 31C</a>  takes away	 the power  of judicial review to an
extent which  destroys even  the semblance  of a  comparison
between its  provisions and  those of  clauses (2) to (6) of
<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_439">Article 19.</a> Human ingenuity, limitless though it may be, has
yet not	 devised a system by which the liberty of the people
can be	protected except  through the intervention of courts
of law.
</p><p id="p_95">     Three Articles  of our  Constitution, and	only  three,
stand between the heaven of freedom into which Tagore wanted
his country  to awake  and the	abyss of unrestrained power.
They are Articles 14, 19 and 21. <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_440">Article 31C</a> has removed two
sides of that golden triangle which affords to the people of
this country an assurance that the promise held forth by the
preamble will  be performed  by ushering  an egalitarian era
through the  discipline	 of  fundamental  rights,  that	 is.
without emasculation  of the  rights to liberty and equality
which alone can help preserve the dignity of the individual.

<p id="p_97">     BHAGWATI, J.  (His	 Lordship's  Judgment  is  a  common
judgment for  Waman Rao's  case and Minerva Mill's case. The
petitioners in	Writ Petitions	Nos. 656  to  660  of  1977-
Wamanrao &amp;  others  etc,  v.  The  Union  of  India  &amp;	ors.
(hereinafter referred  to  as  Wamanrao's  case)  and  other
allied petitions have challenged the constitutional validity
of the	Maharashtra Agricultural Lands (Ceiling on Holdings)
Act 1961  (herein after referred to as the principal Act) as
amended by  the Maharashtra  Agricultural Lands (Lowering of
Ceiling on  Holdings and  <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_447">(Amendment Act</a>  1972	(hereinafter
referred  to   as  Act	21  of	1975)  and  the	 Maharashtra
Agricultural Lands  (Lowering of  Ceiling on  Holdings)	 and
<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_448">(Amendment) Act</a>	 1975 (hereinafter  referred to as Act 47 of
1975) and  the Maharashtra  Agricultural Lands	(Ceiling  on
Holdings) Amendment Act 1975 (hereinafter referred to as Act
2 of  1976) on the ground that the amended provisions of the
Act are	 violative of  Articles 14,  19(1)(f), 31 and 31A of
the  Constitution.  We	shall  hereafter  for  the  sake  of
convenience refer  to the  principal Act  as duly amended by
the subsequent	Acts 21 of 1975, 47 of 1975 and 2 of 1976 as
"the impugned  legislation". It	 is not	 necessary  for	 the
purpose of  this opinion  to set out the relevant provisions
of the	impugned legislation  but it  is sufficient to state
that  it  imposed  a  maximum  ceiling	on  the	 holding  of
agricultural land  in the  State of Maharashtra and provided
for acquisition	 of land  held in  excess of the ceiling and
for the	 distribution of  such excess  land to	landless and
other persons  with a  view to	securing the distribution of
agricultural land  in a manner which would best subserve the
common	good   of  the	 people.  The  impugned	 legislation
recognised two	units for  the purpose of ceiling on holding
of agricultural land. One was person which by its definition
in <a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_449">section 2</a>, sub-section (2) included a family and 'family'
by virtue  of <a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_450">section  2</a>, sub-section  (11) included a Hindu
Undivided Family  and in  the case of other persons, a group
or unit	 the members  of which by custom or usage, are joint
in-estate or  possession or  residence	and  the  other	 was
'family unit'  which according	to its definition in <a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_451">section
2(11A)</a> read  with <a href="/doc/1587307/" id="a_452">section  4</a>, meant  a person and his spouse
and their  minor sons  and  minor  unmarried  daughters	 The
impugned legislation  created an  artificial  concept  of  a
'family unit'  for  the	 purpose  of  applicability  of	 the
ceiling and  provided that  all lands held by each member of
the family  unit whether  jointly  or  separately  shall  be
aggregated together  and by  a fiction	of law	deemed to be
held by	 the family unit. There were also certain provisions
in the	impugned legislation  which prohibited transfers and
acquisitions
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">265</span>
of agricultural	 land with a view to effectuating the social
policy	and  economic  mission	of  the	 law.  The  impugned
legislation  also   contained  provisions   prescribing	 the
machinery for  implementation of its substantive provisions.
Now  plainly   and  unquestionably   this  was	a  piece  of
legislation relating  to agrarian  reform and  was immunised
against challenge  under Articles  14,	19  and	 31  by	 the
protective cloak  of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_453">Article  31A</a> but  even so,	 by  way  of
abundant caution,  it was  given  additional  protection  of
<a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_454">Article	 31B</a>   by  including   the  Principal  Act  and	 the
subsequent amending  Acts in  the  9th	Schedule:  vide	 the
Constitution  (Seventeenth   Amendment)	 Act  1964  and	 the
Constitution (Fortieth	Amendment) Act,	 1976.	The  drastic
effect of  the impugned legislation was to deprive many land
holders of  large areas	 of agricultural lands held by them.
Some of	 them, therefore.  preferred writ  petitions in	 the
High   Court   of   Bombay   at	  Nagpur   challenging	 the
constitutional validity	 of the	 impugned legislation and on
the challenge  being  negatived	 by  the  High	Court,	they
preferred  appeals   in	 this  Court.  The  only  contention
advanced on  behalf of	the land  holders in  support of the
appeals was  that the  impugned legislation  in so far as it
introduced an  artificial concept  of a	 'family  unit'	 and
fixed ceiling  on holding  of land  by such  family unit was
violative of  the second  proviso to  cl. (1) of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_455">Article 31A</a>
and was not saved from invalidation by the protective armour
of  <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_456">Article  31B.</a>  This	 contention  was  negatived  by	 the
Constitution  Bench  and  it  was  held	 that  the  impugned
legislation did	 not, by creating an artificial concept of a
family unit  and fixing	 ceiling on  holding of land by such
family unit,  conflict with the second proviso to clause (1)
of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_457">Article  31A</a> and  even if it did contravene that proviso,
it was	protected by  <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_458">Article 31B</a> since the principal Act as
well as	 the subsequent	 amending Acts	were included in the
9th Schedules  vide <a href="/doc/417020/" id="a_459">Dattatraya	Govind Mahajan	v. State  of
Maharashtra</a>. Now  at the  time when  this hatch of cases was
argued before  the Court, the emergency was in operation and
hence it was not possible for the land-holders to raise many
of the	contentions which  they could  otherwise have raised
and, therefore,	 as soon  as the  emergency was revoked, the
landholders filed review petitions in this Court against the
decision  in  Dattatraya  Govind  Mahajan's  case  and	also
preferred direct  writ petitions  in this  Court challenging
once again  the	 constitutional	 validity  of  the  impugned
legislation. Now,  concededly, <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_460">Article 31A</a> provided complete
immunity to  the impugned  legislation against	violation of
Articles 14,  19 and  31 and  <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_461">Article 31B</a>  read with he 9th
Schedule protected the impugned legislation not only against
violation of Articles 14, 19 and 31 but
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">266</span>
also against  infraction of the second proviso to Clause (1)
of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_462">Article  31A.</a> Moreover,  the impugned  legislation  being
manifestly one for giving effect to the Directive Principles
contained in  <a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_463">Article 39</a>  clauses (b)  and (c),	 it was also
protected  against   invalidation  by	<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_464">Article	  31C.</a>	 The
petitioners could  not	therefore  successfully	 assail	 the
constitutional validity	 of the	 impugned legislation unless
they first  pierced the	 protective armour  of Articles 31A,
31B and 31C. The petitioners sought to get Articles 31A, 31B
and 31C	 out of	 the way  by contending	 that they  offended
against the  basic structure  of the  Constitution and were.
therefore, outside the constituent power of Parliament under
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_465">Article	 368</a>   and  hence  unconstitutional  and  void.	 The
argument of  the petitioners  was that	these constitutional
amendments in  the shape  of Articles 31A, 31B and 31C being
invalid, the  impugned legislation  was required to meet the
challenge of Articles 14, 19(1)(f), 31 and 31A and tested on
the  touchstone	 of  these  constitutional  guarantees.	 the
impugned legislation  was  null	 and  void.  The  first	 and
principal question which, therefore, arose for consideration
in these  cases was  whether Articles  31A, 31B	 and 31C are
ultra vires  and void  as damaging  or destroying  the basic
structure of the Constitution. We may point out here that we
were  concerned	 in  these  cases  with	 the  constitutional
validity of  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_466">Article 31C</a>  as it stood prior to its amendment
by the	Constitution  (Forty-Second  Amendment)	 Act,  1976.
because it  was the unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_467">Article 31C</a> which was in force
at the	dates when.  the amending  Acts were  passed by	 the
legislature amending  the principal  Act. These	 cases	were
heard at  great length	with arguments	ranging over a large
areas and  lasting for	over  five  weeks  and	we  reserved
judgment on  8th March	]979. Unfortunately. we could not be
ready with  our judgment and hence on 9th May 1980 being the
last working  day of the Court before the summer vacation we
made an	 order expressing our conclusion but stating that we
would give  our reasons	 later. By  this order	we held that
<a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_468">Article 31A</a>  does not  damage any  of the basic or essential
features of  the Constitution  or its basic structure and is
therefore valid	 and constitutional and so is <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_469">Article 31C</a> as
it stood  prior to  its amendment by the Constitution (Forty
Second	Amendment)   Act,  1976	 valid	to  the	 extent	 its
constitutionality was  upheld in Kesavananda Bharati's case.
So far	as <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_470">Article 31B</a> is concerned, we said that <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_471">Article 31</a>
as originally  introduced was  valid and  so  also  are	 all
subsequent amendments including various Acts and Regulations
in the	9th Schedule from time to time upto 24th April, 1973
when Kesavananda  Bharati's case  was decided.	We  did	 not
express any  final opinion on the constitutional validity of
the amendments	made in	 the 9th  Schedule on  or after 24th
April 1973 but we made it clear that, these amendments would
be open to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">267</span>
challenge on the ground that they or any one or more of them
damage the  basic or  essential features of the Constitution
or its	basic structure.  and  are  therefore.	Outside	 the
constituent power  of Parliament. This was The order made by
us on  9th May.	 1980 and  for reasons which I shall mention
presently. I  propose to set out in this Judgment my reasons
for subscribing to this order.
</p><p id="p_98">     So	 far   as  Minerva  Mills  Case	 is  concerned,	 the
challenge of  the petitioners was directed primarily against
an order dated 19th October, 1971 by which the Government of
India, in  exercise of the power conferred under Sec. 18A of
the  Industries	 (Development  and  <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_472">Regulation)	 Act</a>,  1951,
authorised  the	  taking  over	of  the	 management  of	 the
industrial undertaking	of the	petitioners by	the National
Textile Corporation  under  the	 <a href="/doc/1044174/" id="a_473">Sick  Textile	Undertakings
(Nationalisation) Act</a>  1974 (hereinafter  referred to as the
<a href="/doc/72652/" id="a_474">Nationalisation	 Act</a>)	by  which   the	 entire	  Industrial
undertaking  and  the  right,  title  and  interest  of	 the
petitioners in	it stood  transferred to  and vested  in the
Central	 Government  on	 the  appointed	 date.	We  are	 not
concerned for  the purpose  of the  present opinion with the
challenge against  the validity	 of  the  Order	 dated	19th
October, 1971, for the question which has been argued before
us   arises   only   out   of	the   attack   against	 the
constitutionality   of	  the	<a href="/doc/72652/" id="a_475">Nationalisation	  Act</a>.	 The
petitioners challenged	the constitutional  validity of	 the
<a href="/doc/72652/" id="a_476">Nationalisation Act</a>  inter alia	 on the ground of infraction
of Articles  14, 19(1)(f)  and (g)  and 31  Clause (2),	 but
since the  <a href="/doc/72652/" id="a_477">Nationalisation Act</a>	has been included in the 9th
Schedule by  the Constitution  (Thirty-ninth Amendment) Act,
1975, the petitioners also attacked the constitutionality of
the Constitution  (Thirty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1975, for it
is only	 if they  could get the <a href="/doc/72652/" id="a_478">Nationalisation Act</a> out from
the protective	wing of	 <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_479">Article 31B</a> by persuading the Court
to strike  down the  Constitution (Thirty-  ninth <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_480">Amendment)
Act</a>, 1975,  that they  could proceed  with  their  challenge
against the  constitutional validity  of the <a href="/doc/72652/" id="a_481">Nationalisation
Act</a> Now clauses (4) and (5) which were introduced in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_482">Article
368</a>  by	  section  55	of  the	 Constitution  (Forty-second
Amendment) Act,	 1976 and which were in force at the date of
the filing  of the writ petitions provided that no amendment
of the	Constitution made  or purported	 to have  been	made
whether before	or after  the commencement  of that  section
shall be  called in  question in any Court on any ground and
barred judicial	 review of  the validity of a constitutional
amendment (obviously,  if these	 two  clauses  were  validly
included in  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_483">Article 368</a>, they would stand in the way of the
petitioners challenging	 the constitutional  validity of the
Constitution  (Thirty-ninth   Amendment)  -Act,	  1975.	 The
petitioners were,  therefore, compelled	 to go	further	 and
impugn the  constitutional validity  of <a href="/doc/1164414/" id="a_484">section	 55</a>  of	 the
Constitution
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">268</span>
(Forty-second Amendment)  Act, 1976. This much challenge, as
shall presently	 point out,  would have	 been sufficient  to
clear  the   path  for	the  petitioners  in  assailing	 the
constitutional validity	 of the <a href="/doc/72652/" id="a_485">Nationalisation Act</a>, but the
petitioners, not  resting content  with	 what  was  strictly
necessary, proceeded  also to  challenge section  4  of	 the
Constitution  (Forty-second   Amendment)  Act,	 1976  which
amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_486">Article 31C.</a> There were several grounds on which the
constitutional validity	 of the	 Constitution  (Forty-second
Amendment) Act,	 1976 was impugned in the writ petitions and
I shall	 refer to  them	 when  I  deal	with  the  arguments
advanced on  behalf of	the parties. Suffice it to state for
the present,  and this	is extremely important to point out.
that when  the writ petitions reached hearing before us, Mr.
Palkhiwala, learned  counsel  appearing	 on  behalf  of	 the
petitioners  requested	 the  Court   to  examine  only	 one
question, namely, whether the amendments made in <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_487">Article 31C</a>
and <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_488">Article  368</a> by  <a href="/doc/340185/" id="a_489">section 4</a>	and SS	of the	Constitution
(Forty-second Amendment)  Act, 1976  were constitutional and
valid and  submitted that if these constitutional amendments
were held  invalid, then  the  other  contentions  might  be
examined by  the Court	at a  later date. He conceded before
us, in	the course  of the  arguments, that he was accepting
the constitutional  validity of	 Articles 31A,	31B and	 the
unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_490">Article  31C</a> and  his	 only  contention  vis-a-vis
<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_491">Article 31C</a>  was that  it was  the amendment made in <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_492">Article
31C</a> which had the effect of damaging or destroying the basic
structure  of  the  Constitution  and  that  amendment	was,
therefore, beyond  the constituent  power of Parliament. The
learned Attorney  General on  behalf of	 the Union  of India
opposed this  plea of  Mr. Palkhiwala  and urged  by way  of
preliminary  objection	 that	though	 the   question	  of
constitutional validity	 of clauses  (4) and  (S) of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_493">Article
368</a> introduced	by way	of amendment  by section  SS of	 the
Constitution (Forty-second  Amendment Act,  1976 undoubtedly
arose before the Court and it was necessary for the Court to
pronounce upon	it, the	 other question	 in  regard  to	 the
constitutional validity of the amendment made in <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_494">Article 31C</a>
did not	 arise	on  the	 writ  petitions  and  the  counter-
affidavits and	it was	wholly academic	 and superfluous  to
decide it.  This preliminary objection raised by the learned
Attorney General was in my opinion well founded and deserved
to be  sustained. Once	Mr. Palkhiwala	conceded that he was
not  challenging   the	constitutionality  of  <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_495">Article	31A</a>,
<a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_496">Article 31B</a>  and the  unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_497">Article 31C</a> and was prepared
to accept  them as  constitutionally valid, it became wholly
unnecessary to rely on the amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_498">Article 31C</a> in support of
the validity of the <a href="/doc/72652/" id="a_499">Nationalisation Act</a>, because <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_500">Article 31B</a>
would, in any event, save it from invalidation on the ground
of infraction  of any of the Fundamental Rights. In fact, if
we look	 at the counter-affidavit filed by Mr. T. S. Sahani,
Deputy Secretary, Government of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">269</span>
India in  reply to  the writ  petitions,  we  find  that  no
reliance has  been placed on behalf of the Government on the
amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_501">Article	 31C.</a> The  case of the Union of India is and
that is	 supported by  the legislative declaration contained
in <a href="/doc/72652/" id="a_502">section  39</a> of the Nationalisation Act, that this Act was
enacted for giving effect to the policy of the State towards
securing the  principles specified  in clause (b) of <a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_503">Article
39</a> of  the Constitution.  Neither the  Union of India in its
counter- affidavit  nor the  learned Attorney General in the
course of  his	arguments  relied  on  any  other  Directive
Principle except  that contained  in <a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_504">Article  39</a> clause (b).
Mr. Palkhiwala	also did  not make any attempt to relate the
<a href="/doc/72652/" id="a_505">Nationalisation Act</a>  to any  other  Directive  Principle  of
State Policy.  Now either the <a href="/doc/72652/" id="a_506">Nationalisation Act</a> was really
and truly a law for giving effect to the Directive Principle
set out	 in <a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_507">Article  39</a> clause (b) as declared in <a href="/doc/72652/" id="a_508">section 39</a>
or it  was not	such a	law and	 the legislative declaration
contained in  <a href="/doc/72652/" id="a_509">section 39</a>  was a colourable device. If it was
the  former,   then  the  unamended  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_510">Article  31C</a>  would  be
sufficient to protect the <a href="/doc/72652/" id="a_511">Nationalisation Act</a> from attack on
the ground  of violation  of Articles  14, 19  and 31 and it
would be  unnecessary o	 invoke the amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_512">Article 31C</a> and
if it  was the	latter, then  neither the  unamended nor the
amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_513">Article	 31C</a> would  have any  application. Thus,  in
either	event,	 the  amended  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_514">Article	31C</a>  would  have  no
relevance at  all in  adjudicating upon	 the  constitutional
validity of  the <a href="/doc/72652/" id="a_515">Nationalisation Act</a>. It is difficult to see
how, in	 these circumstances, the Court could be called upon
to examine  the constitutionality  of the  amendment made in
<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_516">Article	 31C:</a>	that  question	 just  did   not  arise	 for
consideration and  it was  wholly unnecessary  to decide it.
Mr. Palkhiwala	could reach the battle front for challenging
the constitutional  validity of	 the <a href="/doc/72652/" id="a_517">Nationalisation  Act</a> as
soon as	 he cleared the road blocks created by the unamended
<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_518">Article 31C</a>  and the  Constitution (Thirty-ninth  Amendment)
Act,  1975  bringing  the  <a href="/doc/72652/" id="a_519">Nationalisation  Act</a>	 within	 the
protective wing	 of <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_520">Article 31B</a> and it was not necessary for
him to put the amendment in <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_521">Article 31C</a> out of the way as it
did not	 block his  challenge against  the validity  of	 the
<a href="/doc/72652/" id="a_522">Nationalisation Act</a>.  I am,  therefore, of the view that the
entire argument	 of Mr.	 Palkhiwala raising  the question of
constitutionality  of  the  amendment  in  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_523">Article  31C</a>	 was
academic and  the Court	 could have very well declined to be
drawn into it, but since the Court did, at the invitation of
Mr. Palkhiwala, embark upon this academic exercise and spent
considerable time over it, and the issues raised are also of
the gravest  significance to  the future  of the  nation,  I
think, I  will be  failing in my duty if I do not proceed to
examine this question on merits.
</p><p id="p_99">     I may  point out  at this	stage (that the arguments on
this question were spread over a period of about three weeks
and considerable
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">270</span>
learning and  scholarship  were	 brought  to  bear  on	this
question  on  both  sides.  The	 hearing  of  the  arguments
commenced on 22nd October 1979 and it ended on 16th November
1979. I	 hoped after  the completion  of  the  arguments  on
questions of  such momentous  significance, there would be a
'free  and   frank  exchange  of  thoughts'  in	 a  judicial
conference either  before or  after the	 draft judgment	 was
circulated by  my Lord	the Chief Justice and I would either
be able	 to share  the views of my colleagues or if that was
not possible,  atleast try to persuade them to agree with my
point of view. But, I find myself in the same predicament in
which  the   learned  Chief   Justice	found	himself	  in
Keshavananda Bharti  v. State  of Kerala.  The learned Chief
Justice started	 his judgment  in that	case by observing "I
wanted to  avoid writing  a separate  judgment of my own but
such a	choice seems no longer open. We sat in full strength
of 13  to hear	the case  and I	 hoped that after a free and
frank exchange	of thoughts,  I would  be able	to share the
views of  someone or  the other of my esteemed brothers, but
we were	 over-taken by	adventitious circumstances," namely,
so much	 time was  taken up  by	 counsel  to  explain  their
respective points  of view that very little time was left to
the Judges  "after the	conclusion  of	the  arguments,	 for
exchange of  draft judgments".	Here also, I am compelled by
similar circumstances, though not adventitious, to hand down
a separate  opinion without  having had	 an  opportunity  to
discuss with  my colleagues  the reasons  which weighed with
them  in   striking   down   the   impugned   constitutional
amendments.  Some   how	  or   other,	perhaps	  owing	  to
extraordinary pressure	of work	 with which  this  Court  is
over-burdened. no judicial conference or discussion was held
nor was	 any draft  judgment circulated which could form the
basis of  discussion, though.  as  pointed  out	 above,	 the
hearing of  the arguments  concluded as	 far  back  as	16th
November, 1979.	 It was only on 8th May, 1980, just two days
before the  closing of	the Court  for the  summer vacation,
that I was informed by the learned Chief Justice that he and
the other  three learned  Judges, who  had heard  this	case
along with  me, had  decided. to pass an order declaring the
impugned constitutional	 amendments ultra  vires and void on
the ground  that they  violated the  basic features  of	 the
Constitution and  that the  reasons for	 this order would be
given by them later. I found it difficult to persuade myself
to adopt  this procedure, because there had been no judicial
conference or  discussion amongst  the	Judges	where  there
could be  free and frank exchange of views nor was any draft
judgment circulated  and hence I did not have the benefit of
knowing the  reasons why  the learned  Chief Justice and the
other three learned judges were
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">271</span>
inclined to  strike down  the constitutional  amendments. If
there had  been a  judicial conference	or discussion or the
draft judgment	setting out  the  reasons  for	holding	 the
impugned constitutional	 amendments Ultra vires and void had
been circulated,  it would  have been  possible for me, as a
result of full and frank discussion or after considering the
reasons given  in the  draft judgment,	either to agree with
the view  taken by  my Lord  the Chief Justice and the other
three learned  judges or  if I was not inclined so to agree,
then persuade them to change their view and agree with mine.
That is	 the essence  of judicial collectivism. It is, to my
mind, essential	 that a	 judgment of  a Court  should be the
result of  collective deliberation  of the  judges composing
the Court  and it  would, in  my humble	 opinion, not  be in
consequence with  collective decision making, if one or more
of the	judges constituting  the Bench	proceed to  say that
they will  express their  individual opinion, ignoring their
colleagues and	without discussing the reasons with them and
even without  circulating their	 draft judgment	 so that the
colleagues have	 no  opportunity  of  participating  in	 the
collective decision-making  process. This  would introduce a
chaotic situation in the judicial process and it would be an
unhealthy precedent which this Court as the highest Court in
the land  -as a model judicial institution which is expected
to set	the tone  for the  entire judiciary  in the country-
should not  encourage Moreover, I felt that it was not right
to  pronounce	an  order  striking  down  a  constitutional
amendment without  giving a reasoned judgment. Ordinarily, a
case can  be disposed of only by a reasoned judgment and the
order must  follow  upon  the  judgment.  lt  is  true	that
sometimes where the case involves the liberty of the citizen
or the execution of a death sentence or where the time taken
in preparing a reasoned judgment might pre-judicially affect
the winning party, this Court, does, in the larger interests
of justice,  pronounce an  order and give reasons later, but
these  are  exceptional	 cases	where  the  requirements  of
justice	 induces  the  Court  to  depart  from	the  legally
sanctioned course.  But, there	the court had in fact waited
for about 5 1/2 months after the conclusion of the arguments
and there  was clearly	no urgency  which required  that  an
order should  be made  though reasons  were not	 ready,	 the
delay of  about 22  months in making the order was not going
to injure  the interests  of any  party, since the order was
not going  to dispose  of the  writ petition and many issues
would still  remain to	be decided which could be dealt only
after the  summer vacation.  Thus there	 would have  been no
prejudice to  the interests of justice if the order had been
made on he re-opening of the Court after the summer vacation
supported by  a reasoned  judgment. These  were the  reasons
which compelled	 me to	make my	 order dated  9th May,	1980
declining to  pass an  unreasoned order	 pronouncing on	 the
validity of the impugned constitutional
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">272</span>
amendments and	stating that I would "prefer to pass a final
order in  this case  when I  deliver my	 reasoned judgment".
This	order	  unfortunately	   led	  to	considerable
misunderstanding of my position and that is the reason why I
have thought  it necessary to explain briefly why I acted in
the manner I did.
</p><p id="p_100">     There is also one other predicament from which I suffer
in the	preparation of	this opinion. It is obvious that the
decision of  the questions  arising in	Wamanrao's  case  is
closely and  integrally connected  with the  decision of the
questions in Minerva Mill's case and therefore, logically as
also from  the point  of view  of aesthetics  and  practical
pragmatics, there  should be  one opinion  dealing with	 the
questions in  both the	cases.	But,  unfortunately  Minerva
Mill's case  was heard	by a  Bench of five judges different
from the  Bench which heard Wamanrao's case. Wamanrao's case
was heard  by  a  Bench	 consisting  of	 the  learned  Chief
Justice, myself, Krishna Iyer, J., Tulzapurkar, J. and A. P.
Sen, J.	 while Krishna	Iyer, J.,  Tulzapurkar, J. and A. P.
Sen, J.	 were not  members of  the  Bench  which  heard	 the
Minerva Mill's case. Since two different Benches heard these
cases, there  would ordinarily	have to be two opinions, one
in each	 case. I. however, propose to write a single opinion
dealing with the questions arising in both cases, since that
is the only way in which I think I can present an integrated
argument in  support of my view, without becoming unduly and
unnecessarily repetitive.
</p><p id="p_101">     The principal question that arises for consideration in
these two  cases is  whether <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_524">Article  31A</a>, <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_525">Article  31B</a> read
with the  9th Schedule	as amended  from time  to  time	 and
particularly by	 the  Constitution  (Seventeenth  Amendment)
Act, 1964  and the  Constitution (Fortieth  Amendment)	Act,
1976, <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_526">Article  31C</a> as it stood prior to its amendment by the
Constitution (Forty-second  Amendment)	Act,  1976  and	 the
amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_527">Article 31C</a> are constitutionally valid; do they fall
within the  scope of  the amending power of Parliament under
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_528">Article 368.</a>  The determination	 of this question depends on
the answer  to the  larger question  as lo whether there are
any limits on the amending power of Parliament under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_529">Article
368</a> and	 if so,	 what are  the limits. This question came up
for consideration before a Bench of 13 Judges of this Court-
the largest  Bench that	 ever sat-and  after a hearing which
lasted for 68 days-the longest hearing that ever took place-
eleven	judgments  were	 delivered  which  are	reported  in
Keshavananda Bharti  v. State of Kerala (supra). The earlier
decision of  this Court in l.<a href="/doc/120358/" id="a_530">C. Golaknath &amp; Ors. v. State of
Punjab</a> where,  by  a  majority	of  six	 against  five,	 the
fundamental
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">273</span>
rights were  held to  be  unamendable  by  Parliament  under
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_531">Article 368</a>,  was over-ruled  as a result of the decision in
Keshavananda Bharti's  case. But,  six out  of the  thirteen
learned Judges	(Sikri, C.  J. Shelat,	Grover, Hegde, Reddy
and  Mukharjea,	  JJ.  accepted	  the  contention   of	 the
petitioners that though <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_532">Article 368</a> conferred power to amend
the Constitution, there were inherent or implied limitations
on the	power of amendment and therefore <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_533">Article 368</a> did not
confer power  on Parliament  to amend the Constitution so as
to destroy  or emasculate the essential or basic elements or
features  of   the  Constitution.  The	fundamental  rights,
according to  the view	taken by  these six  learned Judges,
constituted basic  or essential features of the Constitution
and they  could not  be, therefore, abrogated or emasculated
in the	exercise of  the amending power conferred by <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_534">Article
368</a>, though a reasonable abridgment of those rights could be
effected  in  the  public  interest.  Khanna,  J.  found  it
difficult in  the face	of the clear words of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_535">Article 368</a> to
exclude	 from	their	operation   Articles   relating	  to
fundamental rights and he held that "the word 'amendment' in
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_536">Article	 368</a>   must  carry  the	 same  meaning	whether	 the
amendment relates  to taking  away or  abridging Fundamental
rights in Part II of the Constitution or whether it pertains
to  some   other  provision   outside  Part   III   of	 the
Constitution." But proceeding to consider the meaning of the
word 'amendment',  the learned	Judge held that the power to
amend  does   not  include   the  power	  to  abrogate	 the
Constitution, that  the word 'amendment' postulates that the
existing Constitution must survive without loss of identity,
that it	 must be  retained though  in an  amended from.	 and
therefore. the power of amendment does not include the power
to destroy  or abrogate	 the basic structure or framework of
the Constitution.  The remaining  six Judges  took the	view
that there  were no  limitations of any kind on the power of
amendment, though  three of  them seemed  willing to foresee
the limitation	that the  entire Constitution  could not  be
abrogated, leaving  behind a  State without  a Constitution.
Now some  scholars have	 expressed the	view that  from	 the
welter of confusion created by eleven judgments running over
a thousand  pages, it  is not  possible to extract any ratio
decidendi which	 could be said to be the law declared by the
Supreme Court.	It is  no doubt true that the six judges led
by Sikri. C.J., have read a limitation on the amending power
of Parliament  under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_537">Article 368</a> and so has Khanna, J., have
employed the  formulations "basic  features" and  "essential
elements" while	 Khanna. J.  has  employed  the	 formulation
"basic structure  and framework"  to indicate  what in	each
view is	 immune from the amendatory process and it is argued
that "basic  features" and  "essential elements"  cannot  be
regarded as synonymous with "basic structure and framework".
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">274</span>
<p id="p_102">These scholars	have sought  to draw  support for their view
from the  following observation of Khanna, J. at page 706 of
the Report:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">	  "It is  then argued  on behalf  of the petitioners
     that essential  features of  the Constitution cannot be
     changed as	 a  result  of	amendment.  So	far  as	 the
     expression	 "essential   features"	 means	 the   basic
     structure or  framework of	 the  Constitution.  I	have
     already dealt with the question as to whether the power
     to amend  the Constitution	 would include within itself
     the power to change the basic structure or framework of
     the Constitution.	Apart from  that, all  provisions of
     the Constitution  are subject to amendatory process and
     cannot claim  exemption  from  that  process  by  being
     described essential features."
</blockquote><p id="p_103">Whatever be  the justification for this view on merits, I do
not think  that this observation can be read as meaning that
in the opinion of Khanna, J. "basic structure or frame work"
as contemplated	 by him	 was different from "basic features"
or "essential  elements" spoken	 of by the other six learned
judges. It was in the context of an argument urged on behalf
of the	petitioners that  the "essential  features"  of	 the
Constitution cannot  be changed	 that this  observation	 was
made  by  Khanna,  J.  clarifying  that	 if  the  "essential
features" meant	 the "basic  structure or  framework" of the
Constitution, the  argument  of	 the  petitioners  would  be
acceptable, but	 if the	 "essential features"  did not	form
part of	 the "basic structure or framework'' and went beyond
it, then  they would  not  be  immune  from  the  amendatory
process. But  it does  appear from this observation that The
six Judges  led by Sikri C.J. On the one hand and Khanna, J.
On the	other were  not completely  ad idem  as regards	 the
precise scope  of the  limitation on the amendatory power of
Parliament. This  might have raised a serious argument as to
whether there,	any ratio decidendi at all can be culled out
from the  judgments in	this case in so far as the scope and
ambit of  the amendatory power of Parliament is concerned. A
debatable question  would have	arisen	whether	 "basic	 and
essential features"  can be equated with "basic structure or
framework" of  the Constitution	 and if they cannot be, then
can the	 narrower of  these two	 formulations  be  taken  to
represent the  common ratio.  But it  is  not  necessary  to
examine this  rather  difficult	 and  troublesome  question,
because l  find that  in <a href="/doc/1240174/" id="a_538">Smt. Indira Gandhi vs. Raj Narain</a> a
Bench of  five Judges  of this	Court accepted	the majority
view in	 Keshavanand Bharti's  case to	be that the amending
power conferred	 under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_539">Article 368</a>, though wide in its sweep
and reaching  every provision  of the Constitution, does not
enable Parliament to alter the basic structure or framework
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">275</span>
of the	Constitution. Since  this is  how the  judgments  in
Keshavananda Bharti's case have been read and a common ratio
extracted by  a 'Bench	of five	 Judges of this Court, it is
binding upon  me and  hence I  must proceed  to	 decide	 the
questions arising  in  these  cases  in	 the  light  of	 the
principle emerging  from the  majority decision that <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_540">Article
368</a> does  not confer  power on Parliament to alter the basic
structure or framework of the Constitution. I may mention in
the passing  that the summary of the judgments given by nine
out of	the  thirteen  Judges  after  the  delivery  of	 the
judgments also	states the majority view to be that "<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_541">Article
368</a> does  not enable Parliament to alter the basic structure
or framework  of the  Constitution." of	 course, in  my view
this summary  signed by	 nine Judges  has no legal effect at
all and	 cannot be  regarded as	 law declared by the Supreme
Court under  <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_542">Article 141.</a> It is difficult to appreciate what
jurisdiction or	 power these  nine  Judges  had	 to  give  a
summary setting out the legal effect of the eleven judgments
delivered in  the case.	 Once the  judgments were delivered,
these nine  Judges as also the remaining four became functus
officio and thereafter they had no authority to cull out the
ratio of  the judgments	 or  to	 state	what,  on  a  proper
analysis of  the judgments,  was the  view of  the majority.
What was  the law laid down was to be found in the judgments
and that task would have to be performed by the Court before
whom the  question would  arise as  to what  is the law laid
down in	 Keshavananda Bharti's	case. The  Court would	then
hear the  arguments and dissect the judgments as was done in
Smt. Indira Gandhi's case (supra) and then decide as to what
is the	true ratio  emerging from  the	judgments  which  is
binding upon  the Court as law laid down under <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_543">Art. 141.</a> But
here it	 seems that  nine judges set out in the summary what
according to  them was the majority view without hearing any
arguments. This	 was a rather unusual exercise, though well-
intentioned. But  quite apart  from  the  validity  of	this
exercise embarked  upon by  the nine  judges, it is a little
difficult to  understand how  a proper	and accurate summary
could be  prepared by these judges when there was not enough
time, after the conclusion of the arguments, for an exchange
of draft  judgments amongst  the Judges and many of them did
not even  have the  benefit of	knowing fully  the views  of
others. I  may, therefore,  make it  clear  that  I  am	 not
relying on  the statement  of the majority view contained in
The  Summary   given  at   the	end   of  the  judgments  in
Keshavananda Bharti's case, but I am proceeding on the basis
of the	view taken  in Smt.  Indira Gandhi's case as regards
the ratio  of the majority decision in Keshavananda Bharti's
case.
</p><p id="p_104">     I may  also at this stage refer to an argument advanced
before its  on the  basis of  certain  observations  in	 the
judgment of Khanna, J.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">276</span>
<p id="p_105">that he	 regarded fundamental  rights as not forming part of

Parliament by  an amendment  made under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_544">Article 368.</a> If this
argument were  correct, the  majority holding  in Keshavanda
Bharti's case  would  have  to	be  taken  to  be  that	 the
fundamental  rights  could  be	abrogated  or  destroyed  in
exercise  of  the  power  of  amendment.  because  Ray,	 J.,
Palekar,  J.,	Mathew,	 J.,   Beg,  J.,   Dwivedi,  J.	 and
Chandrachud, J.	 took the  view that  the power of amendment
being unlimited,  it was competent to Parliament in exercise
of this	 power to  abrogate or	emasculate  the	 Fundamental
Rights and  adding the	view of Khanna, J., there would be 7
Judges as  against 6  in holding that the Fundamental Rights
could  be  abrogated  or  taken	 away  by  Parliament  by  a
constitutionally amendment.  But we  do not  think that this
submission urged  or  behalf  of  the  respondents  is	well
founded. It  is undoubtedly  true. that	 there	are  certain
observations in	 the judgment of Khanna, J. at the bottom of
page  688  of  the  Report  which  seem	 into  suggest	that
according to the learned Judge, the fundamental rights could
be abridged or taken away by an amendment under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_545">Article 368.</a>
For example,  he says:	"No serious  objection is  taken  to
repeal,	 addition   or	alteration   of	 provisions  of	 the
Constitution other than those in Part III under the power of
amendment conferred  by <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_546">Article 368.</a> The same approach in my
opinion	 should	 hold  good  when  we  deal  with  amendment
relating to  Fundamental Rights contained in Part III of the
Constitution. It  would be  impermissible  to  differentiate
between the  scope and	width of the power of amendment when
it deals  with Fundamental Rights and the scope and width of
that power  when it deals with provisions not concerned with
Fundamental Rights."  Then again  at page 707 of the Report,
the learned  Judge rejects  the argument  that the  core and
essence of a Fundamental Right is immune from the amendatory
process. These	observations might  at first blush appear to
support	 the   view  that,  according  to  Khanna,  J.,	 the
amendatory power  under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_547">Article 368</a> was sufficiently wide to
comprehend not	only addition or alternation but also repeal
of a  Fundamental Right	 resulting in  its total abrogation.
But if we look art the judgment of Khanna, J. as a whole, we
do not	think this  view can  be sustained. It is clear that
these observations  were made  by the  learned Judge  with a
view to	 explaining the	 scope and  width of  the  power  of
amendment under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_548">Article 368.</a> The learned Judge held that the
amendatory power  of Parliament	 was wide  enough  to  reach
every  provision   of	the   Constitution   including	 the
Fundamental Rights  in Part  Ill of  the  Constitution.	 but
while so holding, he proceeded to make it clear that despite
all this  width the  amendatory	 power	was  subject  to  an
overriding limitation.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">277</span>
<p id="p_106">namely, that  it could	not be	exercised so as to alter the
basic  structure  or  framework	 of  the  Constitution.	 The
learned Judge  stated in  so many  words at  page 688 of the
Report that  though "the  power of  amendment is plenary and
would include  within itself,  the power  to add,  alter  or
repeal the  various articles  including	 those	relating  lo
fundamental rights", it is "subject to the retention, or the
basic structure	 or framework of the Constitution." The same
reservation was	 repeated by  the learned Judge in cl. (vii)
of the	summary of  his conclusions  given at the end of his
judgment. It  will, therefore,	be seen	 that  according  to
Khanna, J.  the power  of  amendment  can  be  exercised  by
Parliament so as even to abrogate or take away a fundamental
right, so  long as  it does not alter the basic structure or
framework  of	the  Constitution.  But	 if  the  effect  of
abrogating or taking away such fundamental right is to alter
or  affect   the  basic	  structure  or	  framework  of	 the
Constitution, the  amendment would  be void as being outside
the amending  power of	Parliament. It is precisely for this
reason that  the learned Judge proceeded to consider whether
the right  to property	could be  said to  appertain to	 the
basic structure	 or framework  of the  Constitution. If	 the
view of	 Khanna, J.  where that	 no fundamental	 right forms
part of the basic structure or framework of the Constitution
and it	can therefore be abrogated or taken away in exercise
of the	amendatory power  under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_549">Article	 368</a>, it was totally
unnecessary for	 the learned  Judge to	consider whether the
right to  property could  be said  to appertain to the basic
structure or  framework of  the Constitution.  The very fact
that Khanna,  J. proceeded  to consider	 this question shows
beyond doubt  that he  did not	hold that fundamental rights
were not  a part  of the  basic structure.  The only limited
conclusion reached by him was that the right to property did
not form  part of  the basic  structure, but  so far  as the
other  fundamental   rights  were  concerned,  he  left	 the
question open.	Therefore, it  was that	 he  took  pains  to
clarify in his judgment in Smt. Indira Gandhi's case (supra)
that what  he laid  down in  Keshavananda Bharati's case was
"that no  Article of  the Constitution	is immune  from	 the
amendatory process  because of	the fact  that it relates to
fundamental right  and is  contained  in  Part	III  of	 the
Constitution", and  that he  did not  hold in That case that
"fundamental rights are not a part of the basic structure of
the Constitution".  Now if  this be  so, it  is difficult to
understand how	he could hold the Constitution (Twenty-ninth
Amendment) Act,	 1972  unconditionally	valid.	Consistently
with his  view, he  should have	 held that  the Constitution
(Twenty-ninth Amendment) Act 1972 would be valid only if the
protection afforded by it to the Kerala Acts included in the
9th Schedule was not violative of the basic structure or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">278</span>
framework  of  the  Constitution.  But	merely	because	 the
learned Judge  wrongly held  the Constitution  (Twenty-ninth
Amendment) Act, 1972 to be unconditionally valid and did not
uphold its  validity subject  to the  scrutiny of the Kerala
Acts added  in the  9th Schedule,  it cannot  follow that he
regarded the  fundamental rights  as not forming part of the
basic  structure   of  the  Constitution.  If  the  law	 was
correctly laid	down by	 him, it did not become incorrect by
being wrongly applied. It is not customary to quote from the
writing of a living author, but departing from that practice
which, I  believe, is  no  longer  strictly  adhered  to  or
followed, I  may point out that what I have said above finds
support from  the comment  made by  Mr. Seervai	 in the	 3rd
Volume of  his book on Constitutional Law, where the learned
author says: "The conflict between Khanna, J.'s views on the
amending power	and on	the unconditional  validity  of	 the
Twenty Ninth  Amendment is  resolved by	 saying that he laid
down  the   scope  of  the  amending  power  correctly.	 but
misapplied that	 law in	 holding <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_550">Article  31B</a> and Schedule 9
unconditionally	 valid."   l  entirely	 agree	 with	this
perceptive remark of the learned author.
</p><p id="p_107">     The true  ratio emerging  from the majority decision in
Keshavananda Bharati's case being that the Parliament cannot
in the	exercise of  its amendatory  power under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_551">Article 368</a>
alter the  basic structure or framework of the Constitution.
I must	proceed to consider whether <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_552">Article 31A</a>, <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_553">Article 31B</a>
read with 9th Schedule, <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_554">Article 31C</a> as it stood prior to its
amendment and  the amended  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_555">Article 31C</a> are violative of the
basic structure	 or framework  of the  Constitution, for  if
they are,  they would be unconstitutional and void. Now what
are the	 features or  elements which  constitute  the  basic
structure of  framework of  the Constitution  or  which.  if
damaged or  destroyed, would  rob the  Constitution  of	 its
identity  so   that  it	 would	cease  to  be  the  existing
Constitution but  would become a different Constitution. The
majority decision  in Keshavananda  Bharati's case  no doubt
evolved the  doctrine of basic structure or framework but it
did not	 lay down  that any particular named features of the
Constitution  formed   part  of	  its  basic   structure  or
framework.  Sikri,   C.J.   mentioned	supremacy   of	 the
Constitution, republican  and democratic form of government.
secular character  of the Constitution, separation of powers
among the  legislature executive  and judiciary,  federalism
and dignity  and freedom  of  the  individual  as  essential
features of  the Constitution.	Shelat and Grover, JJ. added
to the	list two  other features;  justice- social, economic
and political  and unity  and integrity of the nation. Hegde
and Mukherjee,	JJ. added  sovereignty of  India as  a basic
feature	 of   the  Constitution.   Reddy,  J.  thought	that
sovereign
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">279</span>
democratic republic, parliamentary form of democracy and the
three organs  of the State formed the basic structure of the
Constitution, Khanna, J. held that basic structure indicated
the broad  contours and	 outlines or  the  Constitution	 and
since the  right to  property was a matter of detail, it was
not a  part of	that structure. But he appeared to be of the
view that  the democratic  form of  government. the  secular
character of  the State	 and judicial  review formed part of
the basic  structure. It  is obvious  that these were merely
illustrations of  what each of the six learned Judges led by
Sikri. C.J.  thought to	 be the	 essential features  of	 the
Constitution and  they were  not intended  to be exhaustive.
Shelat and Grover, JJ. Hegde and Mukherjea JJ. and Reddy, J.
in fact said in their judgments that their list of essential
features which	form the basic structure of the Constitution
was illustrative  or incomplete.  This	enumeration  of	 the
essential features  by the  six learned Judges had obviously
no binding  authority: first.  because the  Judges were	 not
required  to   decide  as   to	what  features	or  elements
constituted  the   basic  structure   or  framework  of	 the
Constitution and  what each  of them said in this connection
was in	the nature  of obiter and could have only persuasive
value; secondly,  because the  enumeration was merely by way
of illustration	 and thirdly,  because the  opinion  of	 six
Judges that  certain specified	features formed	 part of the
basic structure	 of the	 Constitution did  not represent the
majority opinion  and hence  could not	be regarded  as	 law
declared by  this Court	 under <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_556">Article	141.</a>  Therefore,  in
every case  where  the	question  arises  as  to  whether  a
particular feature  of the  Constitution is  a part  of	 its
basic structure,  it  would  have  to  be  determined  on  a
consideration of  various factors  such as  the place of the
particular feature  in the  scheme of  the Constitution, its
object and  purpose and the consequence of its denial on the
integrity of the Constitution as a fundamental instrument of
country's governance.  Vide the observations of Chandrachud,
J. (as he then was) in Smt. Indira Gandhi's case at page 658
of the Report.

Indira Gandhi's case (supra) which came up for consideration
within a  short period	of four	 years after the delivery of
the   Judgments	   in	Keshvananda   Bharti's	 case.	 The
constitutional amendment  which was  challenged in that case
was the	 Constitution (Thirty-ninth  Amendment)	 Act.  1975,
which introduced  <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_557">Article 329A</a>	and the	 argument  was	that
clause (4)  of this newly added article was constitutionally
invalid on  the ground	that it violated the basic structure
or  framework	of  the	 Constitution.	This  challenge	 was
unanimously upheld  by a  Constitution Bench which consisted
of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">280</span>
the Chief Justice and four senior most Judges of this Court.
It is not necessary for our purpose to analyse the judgments
given by  the five  Judges in  this case  as they  deal with
various matters	 which are  not relevant  to  the  questions
which arise before us. But it may be pointed out that two of
the learned Judges, namely, Khanna and Mathew, JJ. held that
democracy was an essential feature forming part of the basic
structure and  struck down clause (4) of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_558">Article 329A</a> on the
ground that  it damaged	 the  democratic  structure  of	 the
Constitution. Chandrachud,  J. (as he then was) emphatically
asserted that,	in his	opinion, there were four unamendable
features which	formed part  of the basic structure, namely,
"(i) India is a sovereign democratic republic; (ii) Equality
of status  and opportunity  shall  be  secured	to  all	 its
citizens; (iii)	 The State shall have no religion of its own
and all	 persons shall	be equally  entitled to	 freedom  of
conscience and	the right  freely to  process, practise	 and
propagate religion  and (iv) The nation shall be governed by
a government  of laws, not of men." These, according to him,
were "the  pillars of  our  constitutional  philosophy,	 the
pillars,  therefore,   of  the	 basic	structure   of	 the
Constitution." He  then proceeded to hold that clause (4) of
<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_559">Article 329A</a>  was "an  outright negation  of  the  right  of
equality conferred  by <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_560">Article	14</a>, a  right which more than
any other  is a	 basic postulate of our Constitution" and on
that account  declared it  to be  unconstitutional and void,
Mathew, J.  however, expressed	his dissent  from  the	view
taken by  Chandrachud, J.  as regards  the right of equality
conferred by  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_561">Article 14</a>  being an  essential feature of the
Constitution and stated inter alia the following reason:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">	  "The majority	 in Bharati's case did not hold that
     <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_562">Article 14</a>	 pertains to  the  basic  structure  of	 the
     Constitution. The	Majority upheld	 the validity of the
     first part	 of <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_563">Article  31C;</a> this	would  show  that  a
     constitutional amendment  which takes  away or abridges
     the right	to challenge the validity of an ordinary law
     for violating  the fundamental right under that Article
     would not	destroy or  damage the	basic structure. The
     only logical  basis  for  supporting  the	validity  of
     <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_564">Article 31A</a><a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_565">, 31B</a> and the first part of 31C is that <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_566">Art.
     14</a> is not a basic structure."
</blockquote><p id="p_109">I shall	 have occasion	to  discuss  later  the	 concept  of
equality under the Constitution and whether it forms part of
the basic  structure. But,  one	 position  of  a  basic	 and
fundamental nature I may make clear at this stage, and there
I agree	 with Mathew,  J., that whether a particular feature
forms part  of the  basic structure  has necessarily  to  be
determined on  the basis  of the  specific provisions of the
Constitution. To  quote the  words of  Mathew,	J.  in	Smt.
Indira Gandhi's	 case (supra)  "To be  a basic	structure it
must be a terrestrial concept having its
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">281</span>
habitat within	the four  corners of the Constitution." What
Constitutes basic structure is not like "a twinkling star up
above  the  Constitution."  "It	 does  not  consist  of	 any
abstract ideals	 to be	found outside  the provisions of the
Constitution.  The,   Preamble	no  doubt  enumerates  great
concepts'  embodying  the  ideological	aspirations  of	 the
people but  these  concepts  are  particularised  and  their
essential features  delineated in  the various provisions of
the Constitution.  It is  these specific  provisions in	 the
body  of  the  Constitution  which  determine  the  type  or
democracy which the founders of that instrument established;
the quality  and nature	 of justice,  political, social	 and
economic which they aimed to realise, the content of liberty
of thought  and expression  which they	entrenched  in	that
document  and  the  scope  of  equality	 of  status  and  of
opportunity which  they	 enshrined  in	it.  These  specific
provisions enacted  in the  Constitution alone can determine
the basic  structure of	 the  Constitution.  These  specific
provisions, either  separately or  in combination. determine
the content  of the  great concepts set out in the Preamble.
It is  impossible to  spin out any concrete concept of basic
structure out  of the  gossamer	 concepts  set	out  in	 the
Preamble. 'The	specific provisions  of the constitution are
the  stuff   from  which  the  basic  structure	 has  to  be
woven.(')"
</p><p id="p_110">     Now, in  Wamanrao's case  the  broad  argument  of	 Mr.
Phadke on  behalf of the petitioners founded on the doctrine
of basic structure was, and this argument was supported by a
large number  of  other	 counsel  appearing  in	 the  allied
petitions, that the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles
14  and	  19  form  part  of  the  basic  structure  of	 the
Constitution and  therefore <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_567">Article  31A</a>, <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_568">Article  31B</a>	read
with 9th Schedule and the unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_569">Article 31C</a> in so far as
they exclude  the applicability	 of Articles  14 and  19  to
certain kinds  of legislation  emasculate those	 fundamental
rights	and  thereby  damage  the  basic  structure  of	 the
Constitution and they must accordingly be held to be outside
the amending  power of Parliament and hence unconstitutional
and void.  I have  not made any reference here to <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_570">Article 31</a>
and treated  the argument  of Mr. Phadke as confined only to
Articles 14 and 19, because, though <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_571">Article 31</a> was very much
in the	Constitution when  the arguments  in Wamanrao's case
were  heard,   it  has	subsequently  been  deleted  by	 the
Constitution  (Forty-Fourth   Amendment)   Act,	  1978	 and
reference to  it has  also been omitted in Articles 31A, 31B
and  31C   and	we   are  therefore   concerned	  with	 the
constitutional validity	 of these Articles only in so far as
they grant  immunity against  challenge	 on  the  ground  of
infraction of  Articles 14  and 19.  Mr. Phadke on behalf of
the petitioners also challenged
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">282</span>
the constitutional  validity of	 the Constitution  (Fortieth
Amendment). Act. 1976 which included the amending Acts 21 of
1975, 41  of 1975  and 2 of 1976 in the 9th Schedule. On the
ground that  the Lok  Sabha was not in existence at the date
when it	 was enacted.  But obviously. in view of clauses (4)
and (5)	 introduced in	<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_572">Article 368</a>  by <a href="/doc/72652/" id="a_573">section	 55</a> , of the
Constitution (Forty-second  Amendment) Act, 1976, it was not
possible for  Mr. Phadke  on behalf  of the  petitioners  to
assail the  constitutional validity  of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_574">Article 31A</a>, <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_575">Article
31B</a>  read   with  the	9th  Schedule	as  amended  by	 the
Constitution  (Fortieth	  Amendment)  Act.   1976  and	 the
unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_576">Article  31C.</a> since  these two  clauses of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_577">Article
368</a> barred  challenge to  the validity	of a  constitutional
amendment on  any ground  whatsoever and declared that there
shall be  no limitation whatever on the constituent power of
Parliament to amend by way of addition. variation or repeal,
any provision  of  the	Constitution.  He  therefore.  as  a
preliminary   step    in   his	 argument   challenged	 the
constitutional validity	 of clauses  (4) and  (S) of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_578">Article
368</a> on	the ground  that these	clauses	 damaged  the  basic
structure of  the Constitution and were outside the amending
power of  Parliament. The  argument  of	 Mr.  Palkhiwala  on
behalf of  the petitioners  in the Minerva Mills' case was a
little different.  He too  attacked the vires of clauses (4)
and (5)	 of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_579">Article  368</a> since	they barred at the threshold
any challenge  against the  constitutional validity  of	 the
amendment made	in <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_580">Article  31C</a>, but  so far as <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_581">Article 31A</a>,
<a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_582">Article 31B</a> and the unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_583">Article 31C</a> were concerned, he
did not	 dispute their	validity and,  as pointed  out by me
earlier, he conceded and in fact gave cogent reasons showing
that they  were constitutionally  valid. His only attack was
against the validity of the amendment made in <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_584">Article 31C</a> by
section 4  of the  Constitution (Forty-second Amendment Act.
]976 and  he contended	that this  amendment, by  making the
Directive Principles  supreme over  the fundamental  rights.
damaged	 or   destroyed	  the	basic	structure   of	 the
Constitution. He  urged that  the  basic  structure  of	 the
Constitution  rests   on  the	foundation  that  while	 the
Directive Principles  are the  mandatory ends of government,
those ends  have to be achieved only through the permissible
means set  out in the Chapter on fundamental rights and this
balance and  harmony between  the fundamental rights and the
directive Principles  was  destroyed  by  the  amendment  in
<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_585">Article 31C</a>  by making the fundamental rights subservient to
the Directive  Principles  and	in  consequence,  the  basic
structure of  the Constitution was emasculated. A passionate
plea was  made by  Mr.	Palkhiwala  with  deep	emotion	 and
feeling that if <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_586">Article 31C</a> as amended was allowed to stand,
it would  be an	 open licence  to the  legislature  and	 the
executive, both	 at the Centre and in the States, to destroy
democracy and  establish an  authoritarian  or	totalitarian
regime, since almost every legislation could be related,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">283</span>
directly or  indirectly, to  some  Directive  Principle	 and
would thus  be able  to earn  immunity from the challenge of
Articles 14  and 19  and the fundamental rights enshrined in
these two  Articles would be rendered meaningless and futile
and  would   become  mere   rope  of  sand.  Mr.  Palkhiwala
vehemently urged that Justice, liberty and equality were the
three pillars  of the Constitution and they were embodied in
Articles 14  and 19  and therefore  if the  supremacy of the
fundamental rights enshrined in these Articles was destroyed
and they  were made subservient to the directive Principles,
it would result in the personality of the Constitution being
changed	 beyond	  recognition  and  such  a  change  in	 the
personality  would   be	 outside   the	amending   power  of
Parliament.  Mr.  Palkhiwala  likened  the  situation  to  a
permanent state	 of emergency  and pointed  out	 by  way  of
contrast that  whereas under  an emergency the people may be
precluded from	enforcing  their  fundamental  rights  under
Articles 14  and 19  for the duration of the emergency, here
the  people   were  prevented  from  moving  the  court	 for
enforcement of these fundamental rights for all time to come
even without any emergency where a law was passed purporting
to give	 effect to  any of  the	 Directive  Principles.	 The
amendment  in	<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_587">Article	 31C</a>  was  thus,  according  to	 Mr.
Palkhiwala, outside the amending power of Parliament and was
liable to be struck down as unconstitutional and void.
</p><p id="p_111">     Logically I  must first  consider the challenge against
the constitutional  validity of	 clauses (4) and (5) of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_588">Art.
368</a>, because  it is  only if  they can be put out of the way
that Mr.  Phadke and Mr. Palkhiwala can proceed further with
their respective  challenges against  the  validity  of	 the
other constitutional provisions impugned by them. Both these
clauses were  inserted in  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_589">Article 368</a>	by section 55 of the
Constitution (Forty-second Amendment), Act, 1976 with a view
to  overcoming	the  effect  of	 the  majority	decision  in
Keshavananda Bharati's	case. Clause  (4)  enacted  that  no
amendment of  the Constitution	"made or  purporting to have
been made  under this  Article [whether	 before or after the
commencement of section 55 of the Constitution (Forty-second
Amendment) Act,	 1976] shall  be called	 in question  in any
court on any ground" while clause (5), which begins with the
words "For  the removal	 of doubts",  declared	that  "there
shall be  no limitation whatever on the constituent power of
Parliament to  amend by way of addition, variation or repeal
the provisions of this Constitution under this Article." The
question  is   whether	these  two  clauses  transgress	 the
limitations on	the amending  power of	Parliament  and	 are
therefore void.	 I will	 first	take  up  for  consideration
clause (4)  which seeks to throw a cloak of protection on an
amendment made or purporting to have been made in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">284</span>
Constitution and  makes it unchallengeable on any ground. It
is rather  curious in its wording and betrays lack of proper
care and  attention in drafting. It protects every amendment
made or	 purporting to	have been  made "whether  before  or
after the  commencement of  section S  of  the	Constitution
(Forty-second Amendment	 Act. 1976."  But would an amendment
made by	 any other section of the Constitution (Forty second
<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_590">Amendment) Act</a>,	 1976 such  as section	(4). which  would be
neither before nor after the commencement of <a href="/doc/72652/" id="a_591">section 55</a>, but
simultaneous  with   it.  be   covered	by  this  protective
provision? This	 is purely  a problem  of  verbal  semantics
which arises  because of  slovenliness in  drafting that  is
becoming rather	 common these  days and	 I need not dwell on
it, for	 there are  more important questions which arise out
of the	challenge to  the constitutional  validity of clause
(4) and	 they require  serious consideration. I will proceed
on the	basis that  the protection  sought to  be  given  by
clause (4)  extends to	every amendment	 whatsoever and that
the  parenthetical   words  "whether  before  or  after	 the
commencement of section SS of the Constitution (Forty-second
Amendment) Act,	 1976" were  introduced	 merely	 by  way  of
abundant  caution  with	 a  view  to  indicating  that	this
protection was	intended to  cover even	 amendments made  or
purporting to  have been  made before  the enactment  of the
constitution (Forty-second  Amendment) Act. 1976. Now even a
cursory look  at the language of clause (4) is sufficient to
demonstrate  that   this  is  a	 case  of  zeal	 overrunning
discretion. Clause  (4) provides  that no  amendment to	 the
Constitution made  or purporting  to have  been	 made  under
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_592">Article 368</a>  shall be called in question in any court on any
ground.	 The  words  'on  any  ground'	are  of	 the  widest
amplitude and  they would obviously cover even a ground that
the procedure  prescribed in  clause (2) and its proviso has
not been  followed. The	 result is that even if an amendment
is purported  to have  been made  without complying with the
procedure  prescribed	in  sub-clause	 (2)  including	 its
proviso, and  is therefore  unconstitutional. it would still
be immune  from challenge.  It was  undisputed common ground
both at	 the Bar and on the Bench, in Keshavananda Bharati's
case that  any amendment  of the  Constitution which did not
conform to  the procedure  prescribed by  sub-clause (2) and
its proviso  was no  amendment at  all	and  a	court  would
declare it  invalid. Thus  if an  amendment were passed by a
simple majority	 in the	 House of the People and the Council
of States  and the  President assented	to the amendment, it
would in  law be no amendment at all because the requirement
of clause  (2) is  that it should be passed by a majority of
each of	 the two Houses separately and by not less than two-
thirds of  the members present and voting. But if clause (4)
were valid,  it would  become  difficult  to  challenge	 the
validity of  such an  amendment and  it would prevail though
made in defiance of a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">285</span>
mandatory constitutional  requirement. Clause  (2) including
its proviso  A would  be rendered completely superfluous and
meaningless and its prescription would become merely a paper
requirement. Moreover, apart from nullifying the requirement
of clause  (2) and  its proviso,  clause (4)  has  also	 the
effect of  rendering an amendment immune from challenge even
if it  damages	or  destroys  the  basic  structure  of	 the
Constitution and  is therefore outside the amending power of
Parliament. So	long as	 clause (4)  stands, an amendment of
the  Constitution   though  unconstitutional   and  void  as
transgressing  the  limitation	on  the	 amending  power  of
Parliament as  laid down  in  Keshavananda  Bharati's  case,
would be  unchallengeable in a court of law. The consequence
of this	 exclusion of  the power of judicial review would be
that,  in  effect  and	substance,  the	 limitation  on	 the
amending power of Parliament would from a practical point of
view, become  non-existent and	it would not be incorrect to
say that,  covertly and	 indirectly,  by  the  exclusion  of
judicial review,  the amending	power  of  Parliament  would
stand enlarged	contrary to  the decision  of this  Court in
Keshavananda Bharati's	case. This  would undoubtedly damage
the basic  structure of	 the Constitution, because there are
two essential features of the basic structure which would be
violated, namely,  the limited	amending power of Parliament
and the	 power of  judicial review  with a view to examining
whether any  authority under  the Constitution	has exceeded
the limits  of its  powers. I  shall immediately  proceed to
state the  reasons why	I think that these two features form
part of the basic structure of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_112">     It is  clear from the majority decision in Keshavananda
Bharati's  case	  that	our  Constitution  is  a  controlled
Constitution which confers powers on the various authorities
created and recognised by it and defines the limits of those
powers. The  Constitution is  supreme lex, the paramount law
of the	land and  there is  no authority,  no department  or
branch	of   the  State,   which  is  above  or	 beyond	 the
Constitution or	 has powers  unfettered and  unrestricted by
the Constitution.  The Constitution  has devised a structure
of power  relationship with  checks and	 balances and limits
are  placed   on  the	powers	 of   every   authority	  or
instrumentality under  the Constitution.  Every organ of the
State, be  it  the  executive  or  the	legislature  or	 the
judiciary, derives  its authority  from the Constitution and
it  has	  to  act  within  the	limits	of  such  authority.
Parliament too, is a creature of the Constitution and it can
only  have  such  powers  as  are  given  to  it  under	 the
Constitution. It  has no  inherent power of amendment of the
Constitution  and   being  an	authority  created   by	 the
Constitution, it  cannot have  such inherent  power, but the
power of  amendment is conferred upon it by the Constitution
and it	is a limited power which is so conferred. Parliament
cannot in exercise of this power so
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">286</span>
amend the Constitution as to alter its basic structure or to
change its  identity. Now,  if by  constitutional amendment,
Parliament were	 granted unlimited  power of  amendment,  it
would cease  to be  an authority under the Constitution, but
would become supreme over it, because it would have power to
alter the  entire Constitution including its basic structure
and even  to put  an end  to  it  by  totally  changing	 its
identity.  It  will  therefore	be  seen  that	the  limited
amending power	of Parliament is itself an essential feature
of the	Constitution, a	 part of its basic structure, for if
the  limited  power  of	 amendment  were  enlarged  into  an
unlimited power,  the entire  character of  the Constitution
would be  changed. It  must follow  as a necessary corollary
that any amendment of the Constitution which seeks, directly
or indirectly,	to enlarge  the amending power of Parliament
by freeing  it from  the limitation of unamendability of the
basic structure	 would be  violative of	 the basic structure
and hence outside the amendatory power of Parliament.
</p><p id="p_113">     It is  a fundamental  principle of	 our  constitutional
scheme, and  I	have  pointed  this  out  in  the  preceding
paragraph, that	 every organ  of the  State, every authority
under  the   Constitution.  derives   its  power   from	 the
Constitution and has to act within the limits of such power.
But then  the question	arises as  to which  authority	must
decide what  are the limits on the power conferred upon each
organ or  instrumentality of  the  State  and  whether	such
limits are  transgressed or  exceeded. Now  there are  three
main departments  of the  State amongst	 which the powers of
Government are	divided; the  Executive, the Legislature and
the Judiciary.	Under our  Constitution	 we  have  no  rigid
separation of powers as in the United States of America, but
there is  a broad  demarcation, though, having regard to the
complex nature	of governmental functions, certain degree of
overlapping  is	  inevitable.  The  reason  for	 this  broad
separation of powers is that "the concentration of powers in
any one	 organ may"  t(t quote	the words of Chandrachud, J.
(as he	then was)  in Smt.  Indira Gandhi's case (supra) "by
upsetting  that	 fine  balance	between	 the  three  organs,
destroy the  fundamental premises of a democratic Government
to which  were pledged."  Take for example, a case where the
executive which	 is in	charge of administration acts to the
prejudice of  a citizen and a question arises as to what are
the powers  of the  executive and  whether the executive has
acted within  the scope	 of  its  powers.  Such	 a  question
obviously cannot  be left to the executive to decide and for
two very  good reasons.	 First, the decision of the question
would depend upon the interpretation of the Constitution and
the laws  and this would pre-eminently be a matter fit to be
decided by  the judiciary, because it is the judiciary which
alone would  be possessed  of expertise	 in this  field	 and
secondly, the constitutional
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">287</span>
and legal  protection afforded	to the	citizen would become
illusory. A  if it  were left  to the executive to determine
the legality  of its  own action. So also if the legislature
makes a	 law and  a dispute arises whether in making the law
the  legislature   has	acted	outside	 the   area  of	 its
legislative competence	or  the	 law  is  violative  of	 the
fundamental  rights  or	 of  any  other	 provisions  of	 the
Constitution, its  resolution cannot,  for the same reasons,
be, left  to  the  determination  of  the  legislature.	 The
Constitution  has,   therefore,	  created   an	 independent
machinery for  resolving these disputes and this independent
machinery is the judiciary which is vested with the power of
judicial review	 to  determine	the  legality  of  executive
action	and  the  validity  of	legislation  passed  by	 the
legislature. It	 is the	 solemn duty  of the judiciary under
the Constitution  to keep  the different organs of the State
such as	 the executive and the legislature within the limits
of the	power conferred	 upon them by the Constitution. This
power of  judicial review  is conferred	 on the judiciary by
Articles 32  anc! 226  of the  Constitution. Speaking  about
draft <a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_593">Article 25</a>, corresponding to present <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_594">Article 32</a> of the
Constitution, Dr.  Ambedkar, the  principal architect of our
Constitution,  said  in	 the  Constituent  Assembly  on	 9th
December, 1948:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_18">	  "If I	 was asked to name any particular article in
     this Constitution	as  the	 most  important-an  article
     without which  this Constitution  would be	 a nullity-I
     could not	refer to  any other article except this one.</blockquote>
<p id="p_114">     It is  the very  soul of  the Constitution and the very
     heart of  it and  I am glad that the House has realised
     its importance". (CAD debates, Vol. VII, p, 953)
It is  a cardinal  principle of our Constitution that no one
howsoever highly  placed and  no authority however lofty can
claim  to   be	the  sole  judge  of  its  power  under	 the
Constitution or whether its action is within the confines of
such power  laid down  by the Constitution. The judiciary is
the interpreter	 of the Constitution and to the judiciary is
assigned the  delicate task  to determine  what is the power
conferred on  each  branch  of	Government,  whether  it  is
limited, and  if so,  what are	the limits  and whether	 any
action of  that branch	transgresses such  limits. It is for
the judiciary  to uphold  the constitutional  values and  to
enforce the  constitutional limitations. That is the essence
of the	rule of	 law, which  inter alia	 requires that	"the
exercise of  powers by	the Government	whether	 it  be	 the
legislature or	the executive  or any  other  authority,  be
conditioned by	the Constitution  and the law". The power of
judicial review	 is an	integral part  of our constitutional
system and  without it,	 there will be no Government of laws
and the	 rule of  law would  become a teasing illusion and a
promise of  unreality. I am of the view that if there is one
feature of our
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">288</span>
Constitution which,  more  than	 any  other,  is  basic	 and
fundamental to	the maintenance of democracy and the rule of
law,  it   is  the  power  of  judicial	 review	 and  it  is
unquestionably, to  my mind,  part of the basic structure of
the Constitution. Of course, when I say this I should not be
taken  to   suggest  that   however  effective	 alternative
institutional mechanisms or arrangements for judicial review
cannot be  made by  Parliament. But what I wish to emphasise
is  that  judicial  review  is	a  vital  principle  of	 our
Constitution and  it cannot  be abrogated  without affecting
the  basic   structure	of   the  Constitution.	  If  by   a
Constitutional amendment,  the power  of judicial  review is
taken away  and it  is provided that the validity of any law
made by	 the Legislature shall not be liable to be called in
question  on   any  ground,   even  if	it  is	outside	 the
legislative competence of the legislature or is violative of
any fundamental	 rights, it  would be  nothing short of sub-
version of  the Constitution, for it would make a mockery of
the distribution of legislative powers between the Union and
the States and render the fundamental rights meaningless and
futile. So also if a. constitutional amendment is made which
has the	 effect of  taking away the power of judicial review
and providing  that no	amendment made	in the	Constitution
shall be liable to be questioned on any ground, even if such
amendment  is	violative  of	the  basic  structure.	and,
therefore, outside  the amendatory  power of  Parliament, it
would be  making Parliament sole judge of the constitutional
validity of  what it  has done and that would. in effect and
substance, nullify  the limitation  on the amending power of
Parliament  and	  affect  the	basic	structure   of	 the
Constitution.  The   conclusion	 must  therefore  inevitably
follow that  clause (4)	 of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_595">Article 368</a> is unconstitutional.
and  void   as	damaging   the	basic	structure   of	 the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_115">     That takes us to clause (S) of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_596">Article 368.</a> This clause
opens with  the	 words	"For  the  removal  of	doubts"	 and
proceeds to  declare  that  there  shall  be  no  limitation
whatever on  the amending  power of Parliament under Article
</p><p id="p_116">368. It	 is difficult  to appreciate  the.  meaning  of	 the
opening words  "For  the  removal  of  doubts"	because	 the
majority decision  in Keshavananda  Bharati's  case  clearly
laid down  and left no doubt that the basic structure of the
Constitution was  outside the  competence of  the  mandatory
power of Parliament and in Smt. Indira Gandhi's case all the
Judges unanimously accepted theory of the basic structure as
a theory  by which  the validity  of the  amendment impugned
before them,  namely, <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_597">Article  329A(4)</a>	was  to	 be  judged.
Therefore, after  the decisions	 in  Keshavananda  Bharati's
case and  Smt. Indira  Gandhi's case,  there was no doubt at
all that the amendatory. power of Parliament was limited and
it was	not competent  to  Parliament  to  alter  the  basic
structure of the Constitution
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">289</span>
and clause  (5) could  not remove  the doubt  which did	 not
exist. What  A clause  (S) really sought to do was to remove
the limitation	on the	amending  power	 of  Parliament	 and
convert it  from a limited power into an unlimited one. This
was clearly and indubitably a futile exercise on the part of
Parliament. I  fail to	see how	 Parliament which has only a
limited power  of amendment and which cannot alter the basic
structure of  the  Constitution	 can  expand  its  power  of
amendment so as to confer upon itself the power of repeal or
abrogate the  Constitution or to damage or destroy its basic
structure. That	 would clearly	be in  excess of the limited
amending power possessed by Parliament. The Constitution has
conferred only	a limited  amending power  on Parliament  so
that it	 cannot damage or destroy the basic structure of the
Constitution and  Parliament  cannot  by  exercise  of	that
limited amending  power convert	 that  very  power  into  an
absolute and  unlimited power.	If it  were  permissible  to
Parliament to  enlarge the  limited amending power conferred
upon it	 into an  absolute power  of amendment,	 then it was
meaningless to	place a	 limitation on the original power of
amendment. It  is difficult  to	 appreciate  how  Parliament
having a  limited power	 of amendment  can get	rid  of	 the
limitation by exercising that very power and convert it into
an absolute power. Clause (S) of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_598">Article 368</a> which sought to
remove the limitation on the amending power of Parliament by
making it absolute must therefore be held to be outside the-
amending power	of Parliament.	There is also another ground
on which  the validity	of this	 clause can  be successfully
assailed.  This	  clause  seeks	  to  convert  a  controlled
Constitution  into  an	uncontrolled  one  by  removing	 the
limitation on  the amending  power of  Parliament which,  as
pointed out  above, is	itself an  essential feature  of the
Constitution and  it is	 therefore violative  of  the  basic
structure would	 in the	 circumstances hold  clause  (5)  of
<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_599">Article 368</a> to be unconstitutional and void.
</p><p id="p_117">     With clauses (4) and (S) of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_600">Article 368</a> out of the way,
I must	now proceed  to examine	 the challenge	against	 the
constitutional validity	 of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_601">Article  31A</a>, <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_602">Article  31B</a>	read
with the  9th Schedule and the unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_603">Article 31C.</a> So far
as <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_604">Article  31A</a> is concerned, Mr. Phadke appearing on behalf
of the petitioners contended that, tested by the doctrine of
basic structure,  <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_605">Art. 31A</a>  was unconstitutional  and  void,
since it  had the effect of abrogating Articles 14 and 19 in
reference  to  legislation  falling  within  the  categories
specified in  the various clauses of that Article. He argued
that the  Fundamental Rights enshrined in Articles 14 and 19
were part of the basic structure of the Constitution and any
constitutional amendment  which had the effect of abrogating
or  damaging   these  Fundamental  Rights  was	outside	 the
amendatory power of Parliament. While considering this
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">290</span>
argument, I  may make it clear that I am concerned here only
with constitutional  validity of  clause (a)  of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_606">Article 31A</a>
since the  protection of  <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_607">Article 31A</a>  has been	 claimed  in
respect of  Maharashtra Land  Ceiling Acts only under clause
</p><p id="p_118">(a) of	that Article  and I need not enter upon a discussion
of the	constitutional validity	 of clauses  (b) to  (e)  of
<a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_608">Article 31A.</a>  I do not think that the argument of Mr. Phadke
challenging the	 constitutional validity  of clause  (a)  of
<a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_609">Article 31A</a>  is well-founded. I shall have occasion to point
out in	a later	 part of this judgment that where any law is
enacted for  giving effect  to a  Directive Principle with a
view to	 furthering the	 constitutional goal  of social	 and
economic justice,  there would	be no violation of the basic
structure, even	 if it	infringes formal equality before the
law under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_610">Art. 14</a> or any Fundamental Right under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_611">Article 19.</a>
Here clause  (a) of  <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_612">Article 31A</a>  protects a law of agrarian
reform which  is clearly.  in  the  context  of	 the  socio-
economic conditions prevailing in India, a basic requirement
of social  and	economic  justice  and	is  covered  by	 the
Directive Principles  set out  in clauses  (b)	and  (c)  of
<a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_613">Article 39</a> and it is difficult to see how it can possibly be
regarded  1)   as  violating  the  basic  structure  of	 the
Constitution. On  the contrary,	 agrarian reform  leading to
social and  economic justice  to the  rural population is an
objective which	 strengthens  the  basic  structure  of	 the
Constitution. Clause  (a) of  <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_614">Article 31A</a>  must therefore be
held to be constitutionally valid even on the application of
the basic structure test.
</p><p id="p_119">     But, apart	 from this  reasoning on  principle which in
our opinion  clearly sustains the constitutional validity of
clause (a)  of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_615">Article	31A.</a> we think that even on the basis
of the doctrine of stare decisions, the whole of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_616">Article 31A</a>
must be upheld as constitutionally valid. The question as to
the constitutional  validity of	 <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_617">Article 31</a>  A first came up
for consideration  before this	Court in  <a href="/doc/1706770/" id="a_618">Shankari Prasad v.
Union of  India</a>.  There	 was  a	 direct	 challenge  levelled
against the constitutionality of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_619">Article 31A</a> in this case on
various	 grounds  and  this  challenge	was  rejected  by  a
Constitution Bench  of this  Court. The	 principal ground on
which the  challenge was  based was that if a constitutional
amendment takes	 away or  abridges any	of  the	 Fundamental
Rights conferred  by Part  III of  the Constitution it would
fall within  the prohibition  of  <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_620">Article  13(2)</a>  and  would
therefore be void. Patanjali Shastri, J., speaking on behalf
of the	Court, did not accept this contention and taking the
view that  in the context of <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_621">Article 13</a>, 'law' must be taken
to mean	 rules or  regulations made  in exercise of ordinary
legislative power  and not  amendments to  the	constitution
made in exercise of constituent power, be held that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">291</span>
<a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_622">Article 13(2)</a>  does not	 affect	 constitutional	 amendments.
This view  in regard to the interpretation of the word 'law'
in <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_623">Article 13(2)</a> has now been affirmed by this Court sitting
as a  full Court of 13 Judges in Keshavananda Bharati's case
and  it	  is  no  longer  possible  to	argue  the  contrary
proposition.  It   is  true   that  in,	  this	 case,	 the
constitutional validity	 of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_624">Article  31A</a> was not assailed on
the ground  of in  fraction of	the basic feature since that
was a doctrine which came to be evolved only in Keshavananda
Bharati's case,	 but the  fact remains	that whatever be the
arguments advanced  or omitted	to be  advanced. <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_625">Article 31A</a>
was held  to be constitutionally valid by this Court. Nearly
13 years  after this decision was given in Shankari Prasad's
case, a	 strong plea  was made	before this  Court in <a href="/doc/1308308/" id="a_626">Sajjan
Singh v.  State of  Rajasthan</a> that  Shankari  Prasad's	case
should be  reconsidered, but  after a detailed discussion of
the various arguments involved in the case, the Constitution
Bench of  this Court  expressed concurrence  with  the	view
expressed in  Shankari Prasad's	 case  and  in	the  result,
upheld the  constitutional validity  of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_627">Article	 31A</a>, though
the question  which arose  for consideration  was  a  little
different and  did not	directly involve  the constitutional
validity  of   <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_628">Article	31A.</a>  Thereafter,  came	 the  famous
decision of  this Court	 in Golak  Nath's case	where a full
Court of  11 Judges.  while holding  that  the	Constitution
(First Amendment  Act  exceeded	 the  constituent  power  or
Parliament, still  categorically declared  on, the  basis of
the doctrine prospective overruling that the said amendment,
and a  few other  like amendments  subsequently made, should
not be	disturbed and  must be	held to be valid. The result
was that even the decision in Golak Nath's case accepted the
constitutional validity	 of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_629">Article  31A.</a> The  view taken in
Golak  Nath's	case  as   regards  the	 amending  power  of
Parliament was reversed in Keshavananda Bharati's case where
the entire  question as	 to the	 nature and  extent  of	 the
constituent power  of Parliament  to amend  the Constitution
was discussed  in all its dimensions and aspects uninhibited
by any	previous  decisions,  but  the	only  constitutional
amendments which  were directly challenged in that case were
the  Twenty-fourth   and   Twenty-fifth	  and	Twenty-ninth
Amendments. The	 constitutional validity of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_630">Art. 31A</a> was not
put in	issue in Keshavananda Bharati's case and the learned
Judges who  decided  that  case	 were  not  called  upon  to
pronounce on  it and  it cannot	 therefore be said that this
Court uphold the vires of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_631">Article 31A</a> in that Case. It is no
doubt true  that Khanna,  J. held <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_632">Article 31A</a> to be valid on
the principle  of stare	 decisis. but  that was only for the

<p id="p_120">because he  took the  view that	 <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_634">Article 31C</a>  was merely  an
extension of  the principle accepted in <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_635">Article 31A</a> and "the
ground which sustained the validity of clause (1) of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_636">Article
31A</a>, would equally sustain the validity of the first part of
<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_637">Article 31C".</a>  So far  as  the	other  learned	Judges	were
concerned, they did not express any view specifically on the
constitutional validity	 of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_638">Article  31A</a>, since that was not
in issue before them. Ray, J., Palekar, J., Mathew, J., Beg,
J., Dwiwedi,  J. and Chandrachud, J., held <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_639">Article 31C</a> to be
valid  and  if	that  view  be	correct,  <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_640">Article  31A</a>	must
fortiorari be  held to	be valid  But it  must be  said that
there is  no decision of the Court in Keshavananda Bharati's
case  holding	<a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_641">Art.  31A</a>  as  constitutionally	 valid,	 and
logically, therefore,  it should  be open to the petitioners
in the	present case  to contend  that. tested	by the basic
structure doctrine,  <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_642">Article 31A</a>  is constitutional. We have
already pointed	 out that  on merits  this argument  has  no
substance and  even on an application of the basic structure
doctrine. <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_643">Article 31A</a> cannot be condemned as invalid. But in
any event,  I do not think that it would be proper to reopen
the question of constitutional validity of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_644">Article 31A</a> which
has already  been decided  and silenced	 by the decisions of
this Court  in Shankari	 Prasad's case,	 Sajjan Singh's case
and Golak  Nath's case.	 Now for  over 28  years, since	 the
decision in  Shankari Prasad's	case <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_645">Article  31A</a>  has	been
recognised as valid and on this view, laws of several States
relating to  agrarian reform  have been held to be valid and
as pointed  out by Khanna, J. in Keshavananda Bharati's case
"millions of  acres of	land have changed hands and millions
of new	titles in  agricultural lands have been created". If
the question  of validity  of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_646">Article  31A</a> were reopened and
the  earlier   decisions   upholding   its   validity	were
reconsidered in	 the light  of the basic structure doctrine,
these various  agrarian reform laws which have brought about
a near	socio-economic revolution  in the  agrarian,  sector
might be  exposed . to jeopardy and that might put the clock
back by	 settling at  naught  all  changes  that  have	been
brought about  in agrarian  relationship during	 these years
and create chaos in the lives of millions of people who have
benefitted by  these laws.  It is  no doubt  true that	this
Court has  power to  review its	 earlier decisions  or	even
depart from them and the doctrine of stare decisis cannot be
permitted to perpetuate erroneous decisions of this Court to
the detriment of the general welfare of the public. There is
indeed a  school of thought which believes with Cardozo that
"the precedents	 have turned  upon us and they are engulfing
and annihilating  us, engulfing	 and annihilating  the	very
devotees that worshipped at their shrine" and that the Court
should not  be troubled	 unduly if it has to break away from
precedents in  order to	 modify old  rules and if need be to
fashion new  ones to meet the challenges and problems thrown
upon
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">293</span>
by a dynamic society. But at the same time, it must be borne
in A  mind  that  certainty  and  continuity  are  essential
ingredients of	rule of	 law. Certainty	 in applicability of
law would  be considerably  eroded and suffer a serious set-
back if	 the highest  court in	the  land  were	 readily  to
overrule the  view expressed by it in earlier decisions even
though that  view has  held the field for a number of years.
It is  obvious that when constitutional problems are brought
before this  Court for	its decision,  complex and difficult
questions are  bound to arise and since the decision on many
of such	 questions may	depend upon choice between competing
values, two  views. may be possible depending upon the value
judgment or  the choice	 of values  made by  the  individual
Judge. Therefore,  if one  view has  been taken by the Court
after mature  deliberation, the	 fact that  another Bench is
inclined to take another view would not justify the Court in
reconsidering the  earlier decision  and overruling  it. The
law laid  down by this Court is binding on all Courts in the
country and  numerous cases all over the country are decided
in accordance with the view taken by this Court. Many people
arrange their  affairs and large number of transactions also
take place  on the  faith of the correctness of the decision
given  by   this  Court.   It  would   create	uncertainty,
instability and	 confusion if  the law	propounded  by	this
Court on the faith of which numerous cases have been decided
and many transactions have taken place is held to be not the
correct law  after a  number of years. The doctrine of stare
decisis has  evolved from  the maxim  "stare decisis  et non
quita movere"  meaning "adhere	to the	decision and  do not
unsettle things	 which are  established", and it is a useful
doctrine intended to bring about certainty and uniformity in
the law. But when I say this, let me make it clear that I do
not regard  the doctrine  of stare  decisis as	a rigid	 and
inevitable doctrine  which must	 be applied  at the  cost of
justice. There may be cases where it may be necessary to rid
the doctrine  of its petrifying rigidity. "Stare decisis" as
pointed out  by Brandeis  "is always  a desideratum, even in
these constitutional  cases, but  in them,  it	is  never  a
command". The  Court may  in an	 appropriate case overrule a
previous decision  taken by it, but that should be done only
for substantial	 and compelling reasons. The power of review
must be-  exercised with  due care  and caution and only for
advancing the public well-being and not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">294</span>
merely because	it may appear that the previous decision was
based on  an erroneous view of the law. It is only where the
perpetuation of	 the earlier decision would be productive of
mischief or  inconvenience  or	would  have  the  effect  of
deflecting the	nation from the course which has been set by
the Constitution makers or to use the words of Krishna Iyer,
J. in  <a href="/doc/1378494/" id="a_647">Ambika Prasad  Misra v.	State of  U.P. &amp; Ors</a>. "where
national crisis	 of great  momenta to  the life, liberty and
safety of  this country and its millions are at stake or the
basic direction of the nation itself is in peril of a shake-
up" that  the Court  would be justified in reconsidering its
earlier decision  and departing	 from it.  It is fundamental
that  the  nation's  Constitution  should  not	be  kept  in
constant uncertainty  by judicial review every now and then,
because otherwise  it would  paralyse by  perennial suspense
all legislative	 and administrative  action on vital issues.
The Court  should not  indulge in  judicial stabilisation of
State action  and a  view which has been accepted for a long
period of  time in a series of decisions and on the faith of
which millions	of people  have acted  and a large number of
transactions have  been effected,  should not  be disturbed.
Let us not forget the words of Justice Roberts of the United
States Supreme	Court-words which  are equally applicable to
the decision making process in this Court:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_19">	  "The reason  for my  concern is  that the  instant
     decision, overruling  that announced  about nine  years
     ago, tends to bring adjudications of this tribunal into
     the same days as a restricted rail road ticket good for
     this day  and train only.. It is regrettable that in an
     era  marked  by  doubt  and  confusion,  an  era  whose
     greatest need  is steadfastness of thought and purpose,
     this Court	 which has  been  looked  to  as  exhibiting
     consistency in  adjudication, and	a  steadiness  which
     would hold	 the balance  even in  the face of temporary
     ebbs and flows of opinion, should now itself become the
     breeder of fresh doubt and confusion in the public mind
     as to the stability of out institutions."
</blockquote><p id="p_121">Here the view that <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_648">Article 31A</a> is constitutionally valid has
been taken in atleast three decisions of this Court, namely,
Shankari Prasad's case, Sajjan Singh's case and Golak Nath's
case and  it has held the field for over 28 years and on the
faith of  its correctness, millions of acres of agricultural
land have changed hands and new agrarian relations have come
into being,  transforming the  entire  rural  economy.	Even
though the  constitutional validity  of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_649">Article	 31A</a> was not
tested	in   these  decisions  by  reference  to  the  basic
structure doctrine,  I do  not	think  the  Court  would  be
justified in allowing the earlier decisions to be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">295</span>
reconsidered and  the question of constitutional validity of
<a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_650">Article 31A</a>  A	re-opened.  These  decisions  have  given  a
quietus to the constitutional challenge against the validity
of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_651">Article 31A</a> and this quietus should not now be allowed to
be disturbed.  I may  point that this view which I am taking
is supported  by the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1378494/" id="a_652">Ambika Prasad
Misra v. State of U.P. and ors</a>. (supra).
</p><p id="p_122">     I may now turn to consider the constitutional challenge
against the  validity of  <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_653">Article  31B</a>	read  with  the	 9th
Schedule. This	Article was  introduced in  the Constitution
alongwith <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_654">Article  31A</a> by the Constitution (First Amendment)
Act, 1951. <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_655">Article 31A</a> as originally introduced was confined
only  to   legislation	for  acquisition  of  an  estate  or
extinguishment or  modification of  any rights	in an estate
and it saved such legislation from attack under Articles 14,
19 and 31. Now once legislation falling within this category
was protected  by <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_656">Art.	31A</a>, it	 was not  necessary to enact
another saving	provision in  regard to	 the  same  kind  of
legislation. But, presumably, having regard to the fact that
the constitutional  law was  still in the stage of evolution
and it	was not	 clear whether	a law, invalid when enacted,
could  be   revived  without  being  re-enacted.  Parliament
thought that  <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_657">Article 31A</a>,  even if retrospectively enacted.
may  not   be  sufficient   to	ensure	the  validity  of  a
legislation which was already declared void by the courts as
in Kameshwar  Singh's  case,  and  therefore  considered  it
advisable to  have a  further provision	 in <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_658">Article  31B</a>  to
specifically   by-pass	  judgments   striking	 down	such
legislation. That seems to be the reason why <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_659">Article 31B</a> was
enacted	 and   statutes	 falling  within  <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_660">Article  31A</a>	were
included in  the 9th  Schedule. <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_661">Article	 31B</a>  was  conceived
together with <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_662">Article 31A</a> as part of the same design adopted
to give	 protection to legislation providing for acquisition
of an estate or extinguishment or modification of any rights
in an  estate. The  9th Schedule  of l?	 <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_663">Article 31B</a> was not
intended to include laws other than those covered by <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_664">Article
31A.</a> That  becomes  clear  from	 the  speeches	of  the	 Law
Minister and the Prime Minister during the discussion on the
Constitution  (First  Amendment)  Act,	1951.  Dr.  Ambedkar
admitted of  the 9th  Schedule that  prima facie  "it is  an
unusual procedure"  but he went on to add that "all the laws
that have  been saved  by this	 Schedule are laws that fall
under <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_665">Article  31."</a> Jawaharlal	Nehru also  told Parliament:
"It is	not with  any great satisfaction or pleasure that we
have produced  this long  Schedule. We do not wish to add to
it for	two reasons.  One is that the Schedule consists of a
particular type	 of  legislation,  generally  speaking,	 and
another type  should not  come in..  " (emphasis  supplied).
Articles 31A and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">296</span>
31B  were  thus	 intended  to  serve  the  same	 purpose  of
protecting legislation falling within a certain category. It
was a  double barelled	protection which  was intended to be
provided to  this category  of	legislation,  since  it	 was
designed to carry out agrarian reform which was so essential
for  bringing  about  a	 revolution  in	 the  socio-economic
structure  of	the  country.	This  was  followed  by	 the
Constitution (Fourth  Amendment)  Act,	1956  by  which	 the
categories of legislation covered by <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_666">Article 31A</a> were sought
to be  expanded by  adding certain  new clauses after clause
</p><p id="p_123">(a). Originally,  in the  draft bill  in addition  to  these
clauses, there was one more clause, namely, clause (d) which
sought to  give	 protection  to	 a  law	 providing  for	 the
acquisition or	requisitioning of any immovable property for
the rehabilitation  of displaced persons and, as a corollary
to the	proposed amendment  of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_667">Art.  31A</a>, it was proposed in
Clause (S)  of the  Bill to add in the 9th Schedule two more
<a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_668">State Act</a>s and four <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_669">Central Act</a>s which fell within the scope
of clauses  (d) and (f) of the revised <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_670">Article 31A.</a> Vide cl.
(4) of	the Statement  of objects  and Reasons-The two <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_671">State
Act</a>s which  were proposed to be included in the 9th Schedule
were the Bihar Displaced Persons Rehabilitation (Acquisition
of Land) Act. 1950 and the United Provinces Land Acquisition
(Rehabilitation of Refugees) Act, 1948. The West Bengal Land
Development and Planning Act, 1948, which was struck down by
this Court in <a href="/doc/1890860/" id="a_672">State of West Bengal v. Bela Banerjee</a>, and the
invalidity of  which really  started the  entire exercise of
the Constitution  (Fourth Amendment) Act. 1955, was however,
left-out of  the 9th  Schedule in  the draft Bill because it
included certain  purposes of acquisition which fell outside
the proposed  clause (d)  of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_673">Article  31A.</a>  But,  while	 the
Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1955 was being debated,
an ordinance  was issued  by the  Governor  of	West  Bengal
omitting with  retrospective effect  all the  items  in	 the
definition of  "public purpose"	 except	 the  settlement  of
displaced persons  who had  migrated into  the State of West
Bengal, with  the result that the <a href="/doc/688958/" id="a_674">West Bengal Act</a> as amended
by the	ordinance came	within the  category of	 legislation
specified in the proposed clause (d) of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_675">Art. 31A.</a> In view of
this amendment,	 the <a href="/doc/688958/" id="a_676">West Bengal Act</a> was included in the 9th
Schedule by  way of  amendment of  the	draft  Bill.  It  is
significant  to	 note  that  similar  Orissa  Statute  which
provided for  acquisition of  land for purposes going beyond
the proposed  clause (d)  of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_677">Article  31A</a> and  which was not
amended in  the same  manner as the <a href="/doc/688958/" id="a_678">West Bengal Act</a>, was not
included in  the 9th  Schedule. <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_679">A  Central Act</a>,	 namely, the
Resettlement of	 Displaced Persons  (Land Acquisition)	Act,
1948 fell  within the proposed clause (d) of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_680">Art. 31A</a> and it
was therefore included in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">297</span>
9th Schedule  in the  draft Bill.  The link between Articles
31A and	 A 31B	was thus  maintained in	 the draft Bill, but
when the  draft Bill  went before  the Joint  Committee. the
proposed clause	 (d) of	 <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_681">Article 31A</a>  was  deleted  and	 the
Bihar, U.P. and <a href="/doc/688958/" id="a_682">West Bengal Act</a>s as also the above-mentioned
<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_683">Central Act</a>  which were originally intended to be within the
scope and  ambit of  <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_684">Article 31A</a>,  became unrelated  to that
Article. Even  so, barring  these four	Acts, all  the other
statutes included in the 9th Schedule fell within one or the
other clause  of the  amended <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_685">Art.  31A.</a> Subsequent  to this
amendment. several  other  statutes  dealing  with  agrarian
reform were included in the 9th Schedule by the Constitution
(Seventeenth Amendment)	 Act, 1964  and no  complaint can be
made in	 regard to such addition, because all these statutes
partook of  the character of agrarian reform legislation and
were covered  by clause	 (a) Of	 <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_686">Article 31A</a>  in view of the
extended definition  of "estate"  substituted  by  the	same
amending Act.  The validity of the Constitution (Seventeenth
Amendment) Act,	 1964 was  challenged before  this Court  in
Golak Nath's case (supra) and though the Court by a majority
of six	against five  took the	view that  Parliament has no
power to  amend any  fundamental right,	 it held  that	this
decision would	not affect  the validity of the Constitution
(Seventeenth  Amendment)   Act,	 1964	and  other   earlier
amendments to  the  Constitution  and  thus  recognised	 the
validity of  the  various  constitutional  amendments  which
included statutes in the 9th Schedule from time to time upto
that  date.   Then  came   the	Constitution  (Twenty  Ninth
Amendment) Act,	 1972 by  which two  Kerala agrarian  reform
statutes were  included in the 9th Schedule. The validity of
the  Twenty   Ninth  Amendment	 Act   was   challenged	  in
Keshavananda Bharati's case, but by a majority consisting of
Khanna. J.  and the  six learned Judges led by Ray. C.J., it
was held  to be	 valid. Since all the earlier constitutional
amendments  were  held	valid  on  the	basis  of  unlimited
amending power of Parliament recognised in Shankari Prasad's
case and  Sajjan Singh's  case and were accepted as valid in
Golak Nath's  case and	the Twenty  Ninth Amendment  Act was
also held  valid in  Keshavananda Bharati's case. though not
on the	application of	the basic  structure test, and these
constitutional amendments have been recognised as valid over
a number  of years and moreover, the statutes intended to be
protected by  them are	all falling  within <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_687">Article 31A</a> with
the possible  exception of only four Acts referred to above,
I do  not think,  we would  be justified  in re-opening	 the
question of  validity of these constitutional amendments and
hence we  hold them  to be  valid. But,	 all  constitutional
amendments made after the decision in Keshavananda Bharati's
case would  have to  be tested	by reference  to  the  basic
structure doctrine, for Parliament would then have no excuse
for saying that it did not know the limitation
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">298</span>
on its	amending power.	 It may	 be pointed out that quite a
large number  of statutes  have been  included	in  the	 9th
Schedule by  the subsequent  constitutional  amendments	 and
strangely enough,  we find  for the first time that statutes
have been  included which  have no  connection at  all	with
<a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_688">Article 31A</a> or 31C and this device of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_689">Article 3113</a> which was
originally adopted only as a means of giving a more definite
and assured  protection	 to  legislation  already  protected
under  <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_690">Article	31A</a>,  has  been	 utilised  for	the  totally
different  purpose   of	 excluding   the  applicability	  of
Fundamental Rights  to	all  kinds  of	statute	 which	have
nothing to  do with agrarian reform or Directive Principles.
This is	 rather a  disturbing phenomenon.  Now	out  of	 the
statutes which	are or	may in future be included in the 9th
Schedule by  subsequent constitutional	amendments. if there
are any	 which fall within a category covered by <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_691">Article 31A</a>
or  31C,  they	would  be  protected  from  challenge  under
Articles 14 and 19 and it would not be necessary to consider
whether	 their	 inclusion  in	 the  9th   Schedule  J'  is
constitutionally valid,	 except in  those rare	cases  where
protection may	be claimed for them against violation of any
other fundamental]  rights. This  question  would  primarily
arise only  in regard to statutes not covered by <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_692">Article 31A</a>
or 31C	and in case of such statutes the Court would have to
consider whether  the  constitutional  amendments  including
such  statutes	 in  the  9th  Schedule	 violate  the  basic
structure of the Constitution in granting them immunity from
challenge of  the fundamental rights. It is possible that in
a given case, even an abridgement of a fundamental right may
involve violation  of the  basic  structure.  It  would	 all
depend on  the nature  of the  fundamental right, the extent
and depth  of the  infringement, the  purpose for  which the
infringement is	 made and  its impact on the basic values of
the Constitution.  Take	 for  example,	right  to  life	 and
personal liberty  enshrined in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_693">Article 21.</a> This stands on an
altogether different  footing from other fundamental rights.
I do  not wish	to express  any definite  opinion, but I may
point out  that if this fundamental right is violated by any
legislation. it may be difficult to sustain a constitutional
amendment which	 seeks to  protect such	 legislation against
challenge under	 <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_694">Art. 21.</a>  So also where a legislation which
has nothing  to do  with agrarian  reform or  any  Directive
Principles  infringes	the  equality  clause  contained  in
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_695">Article 14</a> and such legislation is sought to be protected by
a constitutional  amendment  by	 including  it	in  the	 9th
Schedule,  it	may  be	  possible  to	 contend  that	such
constitutional amendment  is violative	of  the	 egalitarian
principle which	 forms par of the basic structure. But these
are only  examples which I am giving by way of illustration.
for other situations may arise where infraction.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">299</span>
<p id="p_124">of a  fundamental right	 by  a	statute,  if  sought  to  be
constitutionally  A   protected,  might	  affect  the  basic
structure of  the Constitution.	 In every  case,  therefore,
where a	 constitutional	 amendment  includes  a	 statute  or
statutes in  the 9th  Schedule, its  constitutional validity
would have  to be  considered  by  reference  to  the  basic
structure doctrine  and such  constitutional amendment would
be liable  to be  declared invalid to the extent to which it
damages or  destroys the basic structure of the Constitution
by according  protection against violation of any particular
fundamental right.

validity of  the unamended  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_703">Art. 31C</a> was the same as in case
of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_704">Art.	 31A</a>, namely,  that it	emasculated the	 fundamental
rights in Articles 14 and 19 and was, therefore, destructive
of  the	  basic	 structure  of	the  Constitution.  I  shall
presently examine  this argument  on merits  and demonstrate
that it	 is unsustainable,  but before	I do so, I may point
out at	the outset  that it  is wholly unnecessary to embark
upon a	discussion of  the merits  of this argument, because
the first  part of  the unamended  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_705">Art. 31C</a>  was held  to be
constitutionally  valid	  by  the   majority   decision	  in
Keshavananda Bharti's  case and	 that decision being binding
upon as,  it is	 not open  to Mr.  Phadke to  reagitate this
question. Out of the thirteen Judges who sat on the Bench in
Keshavananda  Bharti's	case,  Ray,  J.,  as  he  then	was,
Palekar, J.,  Dwivedi, J.,  Khanna, J., Mathew. J., Beg, J.,
and Chandrachud,  J., (as he then was took the view that the
first part  of the  unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_706">Art.  31C</a> was constitutionally
valid, because the amending power of parliament was absolute
and unlimited.	Khanna, J.  did not  subscribe to the theory
that Parliament had an absolute and unlimited right to amend
the  Constitution  and	his  view  was	that  the  power  of
amendment  conferred  on  Parliament  was  a  limited  power
restricting Parliament	from so amending the Constitution as
to alter  its basic structure, but even on the basis of this
limited power,	he upheld the constitutional validity of the
first part  of the  unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_707">Article  31C.</a> There  were thus
seven
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">300</span>
out of	thirteen Judges	 who held that the first part of the
unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_708">Art.	31C</a> was	 constitutionally valid,  though the
reasons which prevailed with Khanna, J. for taking this view
were different from those which prevailed with the other six
learned Judges.	 The issue  as	regards	 the  constitutional
validity of  the first	part of the unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_709">Art. 31C</a> which
directly  arose	 for  consideration  before  the  Court	 was
accordingly answered in favour of the Government and the law
laid down  by the  majority decision was that the first part
of the	unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_710">Art.	31C</a> was constitutional and valid and
this declaration  of the  law must be regarded as binding on
the  court  in	the  present  writ  petitions.	Mr.  Phadke,
however, disputed  the correctness  of this  proposition and
contended that	what was binding on the court was merely the
ratio decidendi	 of Keshavananda  Bharati's case and not the
conclusion that	 the first part of the unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_711">Article 31C</a>
was valid.  The ratio  decidendi  of  Keshavananda  Bharti's
case, according to Mr. Phadke, was that the amendatory power
of Parliament  is limited  and. it cannot be exercised so as
to alter  the basic structure of the Constitution and it was
this ratio  decidendi which was binding upon us and which we
must apply  for the purpose of determining whether the first
part of	 the  unamended	 <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_712">Article  31C</a>  was  constitutionally
valid. It is no doubt true, conceded Mr. Phadke that the six
learned Judges	headed by  Ray, J. (as he then was) held the
first  part   of   the	 unamended   <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_713">Article   31C</a>   to	  be
constitutionally valid	but  that  was	on  the	 basis	that
Parliament had	absolute and unrestricted power to amend the
Constitution, which  basis was,	 according to  the  majority
decision, incorrect.  lt was  impossible to  say, argued Mr.
Phadke, what would have been the decision of the six learned
Judges headed by Ray, J. (as he then was if they had applied
the correct test and examined the constitutional validity of
the first  part of the unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_714">Article 31C</a> by reference to
the yardstick  of the  limited power of amendment, and their
conclusion upholding  the validity  of the first part of the
unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_715">Article  31C</a> by  applying the wrong test could not
therefore be  said to  be binding  . On	 the  Court  in	 the
present writ  petitions. This  argument of Mr. Phadke is, in
my opinion, not well founded and cannot be accepted. I agree
with Mr.  Phadke that  the ratio  decidendi of	Keshavananda
Bharati's case	was that the amending power of Parliament is
limited and,  Parliament cannot	 in exercise of the power of
amendment alter	 the basic structure of the Constitution and
the validity of every constitutional amendment has therefore
to be  judged by  applying the test whether or not it alters
the basic  structure of	 the constitution  and this test was
not applied  by the six learned Judges headed by Ray, J. (as
he
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">301</span>
then was),  but there  my agreement ends and I cannot accept
further	  argument of  Mr. Phadke  that for this reason, the
conclusion reached by the six learned Judges and Khanna, J.,
as regards  the constitutionality  of the  first part of the
unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_716">Article  31C</a> has no validity. The issue before the
court in  Keshavananda Bharti's	 case was  whether the first
part of the unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_717">Article 31C</a> was constitutionally valid
and this issue was answered in favour of the Government by a
majority of seven against six. It is not material as to what
were the  reasons which	 weighed with each one of the Judges
who upheld  the validity  of the first part of the unamended
<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_718">Article 31C.</a>  The reasons for reaching this conclusion would
certainly have	a bearing  on the determination of the ratio
decidendi  of	the  case  and	the  ratio  decidendi  would
certainly be  important for  the decision  of  future  cases
where the  validity of	some other  constitutional amendment
may come  to be	 challenged, but  so far  as the question of
validity of  the first	part of the unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_719">Article 31C</a> is
concerned, it  was  in	so  many  terms	 determined  by	 the
majority decision  in Keshavananda  Bharati's case  and that
decision must  be held	binding upon  us. Mr.  Phadke cannot
therefore be  allowed to  reopen this  question and  I	must
refuse to entertain the challenge against the Constitutional
validity of the unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_720">Art. 31C</a> preferred by Mr. Phadke.
</p><p id="p_127">     But even  if it  were open to Mr. Phadke to dispute the
decision in  Keshavananda  Bharti's  case  and	to  raise  a
challenge against  the constitutional  validity of the first
part of	 the unamended	<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_721">Article 31C</a>,  I	 do  not  think	 the
challenge can  succeed. What the first pari of the unamended
<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_722">Article 31C</a> does is merely to abridge the Fundamental Rights
in Articles  14 and  19 by  excluding their applicability to
legislation giving effect to the policy towards securing the
principles specified  in clauses  (b) and (c) of <a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_723">Article 39.</a>
The first  part of the unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_724">Article 31C</a> is basically of
the same genre as <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_725">Article 31A</a> with only this difference that
whereas	 <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_726">Article  31A</a>  protects	 laws  relating	 to  certain
subjects, the  first part of the unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_727">Article 31C</a> deals
with laws having certain objectives. There is no qualitative
difference between  <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_728">Article 31A</a>	 and the  first part  of the
unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_729">Article 31C</a> in so far as the exclusion of Articles
14 and	19 is concerned. The fact that the provisions to the
first  part   of  the	unamended  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_730">Article   31C</a>  are	more
comprehensive and  have greater	 width compared	 to those of
<a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_731">Article 31A</a>  does not  make any	 difference in principle. If
<a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_732">Article	 31A</a>   is  constitutionally   valid,  it  is  indeed
difficult to see how the first part of the unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_733">Article
31C</a> can	 be held-to  be unconstitutional.  It may be pointed
out that the first part of the unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_734">Article 31C</a> in fact
stands	on   a	more   secure  footing	because	 it  accords
protection against  infraction of  Articles  14	 and  19  to
legislation enacted  for  giving  effect  to  the  Directive
Principles set out in clauses (b) and (c) of <a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_735">Article 39.</a>
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_68">302</span>
<p id="p_128">     The legislature  in enacting such legislation acts upon
the constitutional mandate contained in <a href="/doc/76375/" id="a_736">Article 37</a> according
to which  the Directive	 Principles are	 fundamental in	 the
governance of the country and it is the duty of the State to
apply those principles in making laws. lt is for the purpose
of giving  effect to  the Directive  Principles set  out  in
clause	(b)   and  (c)	of  <a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_737">Art.  39</a>  in  discharge  of	 the
constitutional obligation  laid upon the State under <a href="/doc/76375/" id="a_738">Article
37</a> that	 Fundamental Rights,  in  Articles  14	and  19	 are
allowed	 to   be  abridged   and  I   fail  to	 see  how  a
constitutional amendment  making such  a  provision  can  be
condemned  as  violative  of  the  basic  structure  of	 the
Constitution. Therefore	 even on first principle, I would be
inclined to  hold that	the  first  part  of  the  unamended
<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_739">Article 31C</a> is constitutionally valid.
</p><p id="p_129">     That takes	 us to	the next ground of challenge against
the constitutional  validity of	 the Constitution  (Fortieth
Amendment) Act,	 1956 in  so far as it included the amending
Acts 21	 of 1975,  47 of  1975 and  2 of  1976	in  the	 9th
Schedule and  the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act,
1976 in	 so far	 as it	introduced cls.	 (4) and (5) in Art.
</p><p id="p_130">368. The  petitioners contended under this head of challenge
that the  Constitution (Fortieth  Amendment) Act,  1976	 was
passed	by  the	 Lok  Sabha  on	 2nd  April,  1976  and	 the
Constitution Forty-Second  Amendment) Act,  1976 sometime in
November, 1976,	 but on	 these dates  the Lok  Sabha was not
validly in  existence because  it automatically dissolved on
18th March,  1976 on  the expiration of its term of 5 years.
It is  no doubt	 true that the <a href="/doc/708220/" id="a_740">House of People (Extension of
Duration) Act</a>,	1976 was  enacted by  Parliament  under	 the
Proviso to  <a href="/doc/1713437/" id="a_741">Art. 83(2)</a>	extending the  duration of  the	 Lok
Sabha for  a period  of one  year, but	the argument  of the
petitioners was	 that this  Act was  ultra vires  and  void,
because the  duration of,  the Lok  Sabha could	 be extended
under the proviso to <a href="/doc/1713437/" id="a_742">Art. 83(2)</a> only during the operation of
a Proclamation of an Emergency and, in the submission of the
petitioners, there  was	 no  Proclamation  of  Emergency  in
operation at the time when the <a href="/doc/708220/" id="a_743">House of People (Extension of
Duration) Act</a>,	1976 was passed. It may be conceded straight
away  that,   strictly	speaking,   it	is  superfluous	 and
unnecessary to	consider this  argument because, even if the
Constitution   (Fortieth    Amendment)	  Act,	  1976	  is
unconstitutional and  void and the <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_744">Amending Act</a>s 21 of 1975,
47 of  1975 and	 2 of 1976 have not been validly included in
the 9th	 Schedule so  as to earn the protection of <a href="/doc/396535/" id="a_745">Art. 318</a>,
they  are   still  as	pointed	 out   earlier,	 saved	from
invalidation by	 <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_746">Art. 31A</a>  and so  far as  the	Constitution
Forty-second Amendment)	 Act,  1976  is	 concerned,  I	have
already held  that it  is outside  the constituent  power of
Parliament in  so far as it seeks to include clauses (4) and
(5) in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_747">Art. 368.</a> But since a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_69">303</span>
long argument  was addressed  to us  seriously pressing this
ground of   challenge, I do not think I would be unjustified
in dealing briefly with it.
</p><p id="p_131">     It is  clear on  a plain  natural construction  of	 its
language that  under the Proviso to <a href="/doc/1713437/" id="a_748">Art. 83(2</a>), the duration
of the Lok Sabha could be extended only during the operation
of  a  Proclamation  of	 Emergency  and	 if,  therefore,  no
Proclamation of	 Emergency was	in operation at the relevant
time, the  <a href="/doc/708220/" id="a_749">House of People (Extension of Duration) Act</a>, 1976
would be  outside the  competence of  Parliament  under	 the
Proviso to  <a href="/doc/1713437/" id="a_750">Art. 83(2).</a>	 The question which thus requires to
be  considered	is  whether  there  was	 a  Proclamation  of
Emergency was  in operation  at the  date when	the <a href="/doc/708220/" id="a_751">House of
People (Extension  of Duration	Act</a>, 1976  was enacted.	 The
learned Solicitor  General appearing  on behalf of the Union
of India  contended that  not one  but two  Proclamations of
Emergency were	in operation  at  the  material	 date..	 One
Proclamation issued  by the  President on 3rd December, 1971
and the other Proclamation issued on 25th June, 1976. By the
first Proclamation,  the President in exercise of the powers
conferred under	 cl. (1)  of <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_752">Art.  352</a> declared that a grave
emergency  existed   whereby  the   security  of  India	 was
threatened by  external aggression.  This  Proclamation	 was
approved by  Resolutions of both the Houses of Parliament of
4th December,  1971 as	contemplated under  cl. 2(c) of <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_753">Art.
352</a> and	 it continued  in operation  until 21st	 March, 1977
when  it  was  revoked	by  a  Proclamation  issued  by	 the
President  under   clause  2(a)	  of  <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_754">Art.  352.</a>  The  first
Proclamation of	 Emergency was thus in operation at the date
when the  <a href="/doc/708220/" id="a_755">House of  People Extension  of Duration) Act</a>, 1976
was  enacted  by  Parliament.  The  second  Proclamation  of
Emergency was issued by the President under <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_756">Art. 352</a> cl. (1)
and by	this Proclamation,  the President  declared  that  a
grave emergency	 existed whereby  the security	of India was
threatened by  internal disturbance.  This Proclamation	 was
also in	 operation at  the date of enactment of the <a href="/doc/708220/" id="a_757">House of
People (Extension  of Duration)	 Act</a>, 1976  since it was not
revoked by  another Proclamation  issued under	cl. 2(a)  of
<a href="/doc/448465/" id="a_758">Art.  35</a>  until	 21st  March,  1977.  The  argument  of	 the
petitioners however, was that, though the first Proclamation
of Emergency  was validly issued by the President on account
of external  aggression committed by Pakistan against India,
the circumstances  changed soon thereafter and the emergency
which justified	 the issue  of the  Proclamation  ceased  to
exist and  consequently the  continuance of the Proclamation
was malafide  and colourable  and  hence  the  Proclamation,
though not  revoked until 21st March, 1972, ceased in law to
continue in  force and	could not be said to be in operation
at the material date, namely, 16th February, 1976. So far as
the second  Proclamation  of  Emergency	 is  concerned,	 the
petitioners contended that it was illegal and void on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_70">304</span>
three grounds,	namely;	  whilst the  first Proclamation  of
Emergency was  in operation,  it was  not competent  to	 the
President under	 <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_759">Art.  352.</a>  clause  (1)  to  issue  another
Proclamation of	 Emergency; (2)	 the second  Proclamation of
Emergency was  issued by  the President on the advice of the
Prime Minister	and since this advice was given by the Prime
Minister without  consulting the Council of Ministers, which
alone  was   competent	under	the  Government	  of   India
(Transaction of	 Business  Rules,  1961	 to  deal  with	 the
question of issue of a Proclamation of Emergency, the second
Proclamation of	 Emergency could  not be  said to  have been
validly issued	by the	President; and	(3)  there  was	 not
threat to  the security	 of India  on  account	of  internal
disturbance, which could justify the issue of a Proclamation
of Emergency and the second Proclamation was issued, not for
a legitimate  purpose sanctioned  by clause  (1) of <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_760">Art. 352</a>
but with  a view to perpetuating the Prime Minister in power
and it	was clearly  malafide and for collateral purpose and
hence outside  the power  of the  President under  <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_761">Art.	 352</a>
cl.(1). The  petitioners had  to attack the validity of both
the Proclamations  of Emergency,  the continuance of one and
the issuance of another, because even if one Proclamation of
Emergency was in operation at the relevant time, it would be
sufficient to  invest Parliament  with power  to  enact	 the
<a href="/doc/708220/" id="a_762">House  of   People  (Extension	 of  Duration)	 Act</a>,  1976.
Obviously, therefore, if the first Proclamation of Emergency
was found  to continue in operation at the date of enactment
of the <a href="/doc/708220/" id="a_763">House of People (Extension of Duration) Act</a>, 1976, it
would  be   unnecessary	 to   consider	whether	 the  second
Proclamation  of   Emergency  was   validly  issued  by	 the
President. I  will  accordingly	 first	proceed	 to  examine
whether	 the  first  Proclamation  of  Emergency  which	 was
validly issued	by the	President ceased  to be	 in force by
reason of  the alleged	change in  circumstances and was not
operative at  the relevant time. It is only if this question
is answered  in favour	of the	petitioners  that  it  would
become necessary to consider the question of validity of the
second proclamation of Emergency.
</p><p id="p_132">     I think  it is  necessary to emphasize even at the cost
of repetition  that it	was not	 the case of the petitioners
that the  first Proclamation  of emergency  when issued, was
invalid. It  is a  historical fact  which cannot be disputed
that Pakistan  committed aggression  against  India  on	 3rd
December, 1971	and a  grave threat to the security of India
arose on  account of this external aggression. The President
was, therefore,	 clearly  justified  in	 issuing  the  first
Proclamation of	 Emergency under  cl. (1)  of <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_764">Art.  352.</a> The
petitioners, however, contended that the circumstances which
warranted the  issue of	 the first Proclamation of Emergency
ceased to  exist and  put forward  various facts such as the
termination of	hostilities with  Pakistan on 16th December,
1971, the  signing of  the Simla Pact on 2nd June, 1972, the
resumption of postal and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_71">305</span>
telecommunication  links  on  4th  November,  1974  and	 the
conclusion  of trade agreement between India and Pakistan on
24th November,	1974 as	 also several statements made by the
Prime Minister and other Ministers from time to time to show
that the  threat to  the security  of India  on	 account  of
external aggression  ceased long  before 1975  and there was
absolutely  no	justification  whatsoever  to  continue	 the
Proclamation and  hence the  continuance of the Proclamation
was mala-fide and in colourable exercise of power and it was
liable to be declared as unconstitutional and void. I do not
think this contention of the petitioners can be sustained on
a proper  interpretation of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_765">Art. 352.</a> This
Article	 originally  consisted	of  three  clauses,  but  by
section 5 of the Constitution (Thirty-eighth Amendment) Act,
1975. clauses  (4) and	(5) were  added in  this Article and
thereafter, by	a further  amendment made  by sec. 48 of the
Constitution  Forty-second  Amendments	Act,  1976,  another
clause (2A)  was introduced after cl. (2). The whole of this

only the material provisions thereof which have a bearing on
the controversy between the parties;

grave emergency	 exists whereby the security of India or any
part of	 the territory thereof is threatened, whether by war
or  external   aggression  or	internal  disturbance.	 The
satisfaction of the President "that a grave emergency exists
whereby the  security of  India... is  threatened whether by
war or	external aggression  or internal  disturbance" is  a
condition precedent  which  must  be  fulfilled	 before	 the
President can  issue a	Proclamation under <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_767">Art. 352</a> cl. (1).
When this  condition precedent	is satisfied,  the President
may exercise the power under cl. (1) of <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_768">Art. 352</a> and issue a
Proclamation of	 Emergency. The	 constitutional implications
of a  declaration of  emergency under  <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_769">Art. 352</a>	 cl. (1) are
vast and they are provided in Articles 83(2), 250, 353, 354,
358 and	 359. The  emergency being  an exceptional situation
arising out  of a  national crisis certain wide and sweeping
powers have  been conferred  on the  Central Government	 and
Parliament with	 a view	 to combat the situation and restore
normal conditions.  One such  power is that given by <a href="/doc/1713437/" id="a_770">Art. 83
(2</a>), which  provides that  while a Proclamation of Emergency
is in  operation, Parliament  may by law extend its duration
for a period not exceeding, one year at a time. Then another
power conferred	 is that  under <a href="/doc/497125/" id="a_771">Art.  250</a> which	 says  that,
while  a   Proclamation	 of   Emergency	 is   in  operation,
Parliament shall have the power to make laws for the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_73">307</span>
whole or  any part of the territory of India with respect to
any of	the matters enumerated in the State List. The effect
of this	 provision is  that the	 federal structure  based on
separation of  powers is  put out  of action  for  the	time
being. Another	power of a similar kind is given by <a href="/doc/818031/" id="a_772">Art. 353</a>
which provides	that during  the time when a Proclamation of
Emergency is  in force,	 the executive	powers of  the Union
shall extend  to the giving of directions to any State as to
the manner  in which  the executive  power thereof  is to be
exercised. This	 provision also	 derogates from	 the federal
principle which forms the basis of the Constitution. Then we
come to	 <a href="/doc/1457920/" id="a_773">Art. 354</a>  which confers  power	 on  the  President,
during the  operation of  a Proclamation  of  Emergency,  to
direct that  provisions relating to distribution of revenues
under Arts.  268 to  270 shall	have effect  subject to such
modifications  or  exceptions  as  he  thinks  fit.  Another
drastic consequence of the Proclamation of Emergency is that
provided in  <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_774">Article 358</a> which suspends the operation of the
Fundamental  Rights   guaranteed  under	  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_775">Art.	19</a>  while  a
Proclamation of	 Emergency is  in operation. <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_776">Art. 359</a> cl (1)
em  powers   the  President   during  the   operation  of  a
Proclamation of	 Emergency to  make an	order suspending the
enforcement of	any of	the Fundamental	 Rights conferred by
Part III  and cl. (A) introduced by the Constitution (Thirty
Eighth Amendment)  Act, 1975 suspends the operation of those
Fundamental  Rights   of  which	 the  enforcement  has	been
suspended by  the President  by an  order made	under clause
(1). These are the drastic consequences which ensue upon the
making of  a  declaration  of  emergency.  The	issue  of  a
Proclamation of	 Emergency makes  serious inroads  into	 the
principle of  federalism and  emasculates the  operation and
efficacy of  the Fundamental  Rights. The power of declaring
an  emergency  is  therefore  a	 power	fraught	 with  grave
consequences and  it has the effect of disturbing the entire
power  structure   under  the  Constitution.  But  it  is  a
necessary power	 given to the Central Government with a view
to arming  it adequately  to meet  an exceptional  situation
arising out  of threat	to the	security of  the country  on
account	 of   war  or	external  aggression   or   internal
disturbance or	imminent danger	 of any such calamity. It is
therefore a  power  which  has	to  be	exercised  with	 the
greatest care and caution and utmost responsibility.
</p><p id="p_134">     It will  be convenient  at this  stage to	consider the
question as  to whether	 and if so to what extent, the Court
can  review  the  constitutionality  of	 a  Proclamation  of
Emergency issued  under <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_777">Article	 352</a> cl. (1). There were two
objections put	forward on behalf of the respondents against
the competence	of the	Court to  examine  the	question  of
validity of  a Proclamation  of Emergency. One objection was
that the  question whether  a grave emergency exists whereby
the security  of India	or any part thereof is threatened by
war or external aggression
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_74">308</span>
or internal  disturbance is essentially a political question
entrusted by  the Constitution to the Union Executive and on
that account, it is not justiciable before the court. It was
urged that  having regard  to the  political nature  of	 the
problem, it  was not  amenable to judicial determination and
hence the  court must  refrain from  inquiring into  it. The
other objection	 was that  in any event by reason of clauses
(4 and	5) of  <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_778">Article 352</a>, the Court had no jurisdiction to
question the  satisfaction of  the President  leading to the
issue of  a Proclamation  of Emergency	or to  entertain any
question regarding  the	 validity  of  the  Proclamation  of
Emergency or  its continued operation. Both these objections
are in my view unfounded and they do not bar judicial review
of the validity of a Proclamation of Emergency issued by the
President under	 <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_779">Article 352</a>  cl. (1). My reasons for saying
so are as follows:
</p><p id="p_135">     It is  axiomatic that  if a question brought before the
court  is   purely  a	political  question   not  involving
determination  of  any	legal  or  constitutional  right  or
obligation, the	 court would  not entertain  it,  since	 the
court is  concerned only  with adjudication  of legal rights
and  liabilities.  But	merely	because	 a  question  has  a
political complexion,  that by	itself is  no ground why the
court should  shrink from  performing  its  duty  under	 the
Constitution,  if  it  raises  an  issue  of  constitutional
determination. There  are a large number of decisions in the
United	States	where  the  Supreme  Court  has	 entertained
actions having	a political  complexion because	 they raised
constitutional issue.  Vide Gomallion v. Lightfoot and Baker
v. Carr.  The controversy  before the court may be political
in character,  but so long as it involves determination of a
constitutional	question,   the	 court	 cannot	 decline  to
entertain it.  This is	also the view taken by Gupta, J. and
myself in  <a href="/doc/174974/" id="a_780">State of  Rajasthan v.  Union of India</a>. I pointed
out in	my judgment  in that  case and	I still stand by it,
that merely  because a	question has a political colour, the
court cannot fold its hands in despair and declare "Judicial
hands off".  So long as the question is whether an authority
under the  Constitution has  acted within  the limits of its
power or  exceeded it,	it can	certainly be  decided by the
court. Indeed  it would	 be its constitutional obligation to
do  so.	  I  have  said	 before	 I  repeat  again  that	 the
Constitution is	 suprema lex  the paramount law of the land,
and there  is no department or branch of government above or
beyond it. Every organ of government, be it the executive or
the legislature or the judiciary, derives its authority from
the Constitution  and it has to act within the limits of its
authority and whether it has done so or not is for the Court
to decide. The Court is H
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">309</span>
the ultimate  interpreter of the Constitution and when there
is manifestly  unauthorised  exercise  of  power  under	 the
Constitution, it  is the duty of the Court to intervene. Let
it not	be forgotten, that to this Court as much as to other
branches of  government, is  committed the  conservation and
furtherance of	constitutional values.	'the Court's task is
to identify  those values  in the constitutional plan and to
work them into life in the cases that reach the court. "Tact
and wise restraint ought to temper any power but courage and
the acceptance	of responsibility have their place too." The
Court cannot  and  should  not	shirk  this  responsibility,
because	 it   has  sworn  the  oath  of	 allegiance  to	 the
Constitution and  is also  accountable to the people of this
country. It  would not	therefore, be right for the Court to
decline to  examine whether  in a  given case  there is	 any
constitutional violation involved in the President issuing a
Proclamation of Emergency under cl. ( I) of <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_781">Article 352.</a>
</p><p id="p_136">     But when  I say  this, I  must make  It clear  that the
constitutional jurisdiction  of this  Court does  not extend
further	 than	saying	whether	 the  limits  on  the  power
conferred by  the Constitution	on the	President have	been
observed or  there is transgression of such limits. Here the
only limit  on the  power of  the President under <a href="/doc/448465/" id="a_782">Article 35</a>
cl. (1)	 is that  the President	 should be  satisfied that a
grave emergency	 exists whereby the security of India or any
part thereof  is  threatened  whether  by  war	or  external
aggression or  internal disturbance. The satisfaction of the
President is  a subjective,  one and  cannot be	 decided  by
reference to  any objective  tests. It	is deliberately	 and
advisedly subjective  because the matter in respect to which
he is  to be satisfied is of such a nature that its decision
must  necessarily   be	left  to  the  Executive  branch  of
Government. There  may be  a wide  range of situations which
may arise  and their political implications and consequences
may have to be evaluated in order to decide whether there is
a situation  of grave emergency by reason of the security of
the country  being threatened  by war or external aggression
or internal  disturbance. It  is not a decision which can be
based on  what the  Supreme Court  of the  United States has
described  as	"judiciably  discoverable   and	  manageable
standards". It	would largely  be a political judgment based
on assessment  of diverse  and varied factors, fast-changing
situations. potential  consequences  and  a  host  of  other
imponderables. It cannot therefore, by its very nature, be a
fit subject  matter for adjudication by judicial methods and
materials  and	 hence	it   is	 left	to  the	  subjective
satisfaction of	 the Central  Government which	is best in a
position to decide it. The court cannot go into the question
of correctness or adequacy of the facts and circumstances on
which the  satisfaction of  the Central Government is based.
That would  be a  dangerous exercise  for  the	Court,	both
because it  is	not  a	fit  instrument	 for  determining  a
question of  this kind	and also  because  the	court  would
thereby usurp
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">310</span>
the function  of the  executive and  in doing  so, enter the
"political thicket"  which it must avoid, if it is to retain
its legitimacy	with the  people. But  one thing  is certain
that if	 the satisfaction is mala fide or is based on wholly
extraneous and	irrelevant grounds,  the  court	 would	have
jurisdiction to examine it, because in that case there would
be no  satisfaction of the President in regard to the matter
on which he is required to be satisfied. The satisfaction of
the President  is a  condition precedent  to the exercise of
power under  <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_783">Art. 352</a>  cl. (1)	and if	it can be shown that
there is  no satisfaction  of  the  President  at  all,	 the
exercise of  the power would be constitutionally invalid. It
is true	 that by reason of clause (5)(a) of <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_784">Article 352</a>, the
satisfaction of	 the President is made final and conclusive,
arid cannot  be assailed  on any  ground, but,	as  I  shall
presently point	 out, the power of judicial review is a part
of the	basic structure	 of the	 Constitution and hence this
provision debarring  judicial review would be open to attack
on the	ground that  it	 is  unconstitutional  and  void  as
damaging or  destroying the  basic  structure.	This  attack
against	 constitutionality   can,  however,  be	 averted  by
reading the  provision to  mean and  that is  how I think it
must be	 read that the immunity from challenge granted by it
does  not   apply  where  the  challenge  is  not  that	 the
satisfaction is improper or unjustified but that there is no
satisfaction  at  all.	In  such  a  case,  it	is  not	 the
satisfaction arrived at by the President which is challenged
but  the   existence  of   the	satisfaction  itself.  Where
therefore the	satisfaction  is absurd	 or perverse or mala
fide or	 based on a wholly extraneous and irrelevant ground,
it would be no satisfaction at all and it would be liable to
be challenged  before a court, notwithstanding clause (5)(a)
of <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_785">Article 352.</a> It must, of course, be conceded that in most
cases it  would be difficult if not impossible, to challenge
the exercise  of power	under <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_786">Article 352</a> clause (1) even on
this limited  ground, because the facts and circumstances on
which the  satisfaction is  based would	 not be	 known,	 but
where it  is possible, the existence cf the satisfaction can
always be  challenged on  the ground that it is mala fide or
based on a wholly extraneous or irrelevant ground.
</p><p id="p_137">     It is  true that  so far  there is	 no decision of this
court taking the view that the validity of a Proclamation of
Emergency can  be examined  by the court though within these
narrow limits. But merely because there has been no occasion
for  this   Court  to	pronounce   on	 the   question	  of
justiciability of  a Proclamation  of Emergency no inference
can be drawn that a Proclamation of Emergency is immune from
judicial  scrutiny.   The  question   whether	or   not   a
Proclamation  of Emergency can be judicially reviewed on the
ground that  it is  mala fide  or an  abuse of	power of the
President did  arise before  this Court	 in Gulam  Sarwai v.
Union of India. but the court declined to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">311</span>
express any  opinion on	 this question since no material was
placed before	the Court making out a case of mala fides or
abuse of  power. Undoubtedly,  in the subsequent decision of
this Court  in Bhutnath	 Mato v.  State of West Bengal there
are one	 or two	 observations which might seem to suggest at
first  blush  that  a  Proclamation  of	 Emergency  being  a
political matter  is "de  hors our  ken", but  if one  looks
closely at the judgment of Krishna Iyer, J. in that case, it
will  be   apparent  that  he  does  not  lay  down  that  a
Proclamation  of   Emergency  cannot   be  reviewed  by	 the
judiciary even	on a limited ground and leaves that question
open  and   rejects  the   contention  of   the	  petitioner
challenging the	 continuance of Emergency only on the ground
that "the onus of establishing the continuation of Emergency
and absence  of	 any  ground  whatever	for  the  subjective
satisfaction of	 the President,	 heavy as  it is, has hardly
been discharged,  "and consequently  it would be an academic
exercise in  constitutional law to pronounce on the question
of judicial  reviewability of  a Proclamation  of Emergency.
There is  thus no  decision of	this court  holding  that  a
Proclamation of	 Emergency is  beyond the judicial ken and I
am not fettered by any such decision compelling me to take a
view different	from the  one which  I have expounded in the
preceding paragraph  of this  opinion. In fact, the judgment
of Gupta,  J. and  myself in  <a href="/doc/174974/" id="a_787">State of Rajasthan v. Union of
India</a> (supra)  completely supports  me	in  the	 view  I  am
taking. A  Proclamation of Emergency is undoubtedly amenable
to judicial  review though  on the  limited ground  that  no
satisfaction as	 required by  <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_788">Article 352</a>  was arrived at by
the President  in law or that the satisfaction was absurd or
perverse  or   mala  fide  or  based  on  an  extraneous  or
irrelevant ground.
</p><p id="p_138">     Now the  question arises  whether the  continuance of a
Proclamation  of   Emergency  valid   when  issued   can  be
challenged  before   the  court	  on  the  ground  that	 the
circumstances which  necessitated or  justified its issuance
have ceased to exist. Can the court be asked to declare that
the Proclamation  of Emergency has ceased to exist and is no
longer in  force or  does the Proclamation continue to be in
force until  it is  revoked by	another	 Proclamation  under
clause 2(a)  of <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_789">Article	 352.</a> The  answer to  this  question
depends on  the interpretation of clause (2) of <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_790">Article 352.</a>
That clause  says in  sub-clause (a)  that a Proclamation of
Emergency issued  under clause	(1)  may  be  revoked  by  a
subsequent  Proclamation.  Sub-clause  (b)  of	that  clause
requires that  a Proclamation  issued under clause (1) shall
be laid before each House of Parliament and under sub-clause
</p><p id="p_139">(c) such  a Proclamation ceases to operate at the expiration
of two months, unless it has been approved by both Houses of
Parliament before the expiration of two
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_78">312</span>
months. It  is clear from this provision that a Proclamation
of Emergency  validly issued under clause (1) would continue
to operate at least for a period of two months and if before
the expiration	of that	 period, it  has  been	approved  by
resolutions of	both Houses of Parliament, it would continue
to operate further even beyond the period of two months, and
the only  way in  which it  can be  brought to	an end is by
revoking it  by another	 Proclamation  issued  under  clause
2(a). There  is no  other way  in  which  it  can  cease  to
operate. Neither  <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_791">Article 352</a>  nor any	other Article of the
Constitution  contains	 any   provision   saying   that   a
Proclamation of	 Emergency validly  issued under  clause (1)
shall  cease   to  operate  as	soon  as  the  circumstances
warranting  its	 issuance  have	 ceased	 to  exist.  It	 is,
therefore, clear  on a	plain natural  interpretation of the
language of sub-clauses (a) to (c) of clause (2 that so long
as the	Proclamation of	 Emergency is not revoked by another
Proclamation under  sub-clause (2) (a), it would continue to
be in  operation irrespective of change of circumstances. It
may be pointed out that this interpretation of the provision
of clause (2) of <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_792">Article 352</a> is supported by the decision of
this Court  in Lakhan  Pal v.  Union of	 India where dealing
with a	similar contention urged on behalf of the petitioner
that the  continuance of the emergency which was declared on
26th October,  1962 was	 a fraud  on the  Constitution. this
Court speaking	through Sarkar,	 C. J. pointed out that "the
only way  a proclamation  ceases to have effect is by one of
the events  mentioned in  this clause" and since neither had
happened, the Proclamation must be held to have continued in
operation. The	petitioner urged  in that  case	 that  armed
aggression which  justified the issue of the Proclamation of
Emergency had  come to	an end	and the	 continuance of	 the
Proclamation was  therefore unjustified. But this contention
was negatived  on the  ground that  the Proclamation  having
been approved  by the  two Houses  of  Parliament  within  a
period of two months of its issuance, it could cease to have
effect only  if revoked by another Proclamation and that not
having happened,  the Proclamation continued to be in force.
It is  true that  the power  to	 revoke	 a  Proclamation  of
Emergency is vested only in the Central Government and it is
possible that the Central Government may abuse this power by
refusing to  revoke a  Proclamation of Emergency even though
the circumstances  justifying the issue of Proclamation have
ceased to  exist and  thus prolong  baselessly the  state of
emergency obliterating	the Fundamental	 Rights and this may
encourage a  totalitarian trend.  But the  Primary and	real
safeguard of the citizen against such abuse of power lies in
"the  good  sense  of  the  people  and	 in  the  system  of
representative and responsible Government" which is provided
in the	Constitution. Additionally,  it may  be possible for
the citizen in a given case to move
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_79">313</span>
the court  for issuing	a writ	of mandamus for revoking the
Proclamation of	 Emergency if  he is able to show by placing
clear and  cogent material before the court that there is no
justification at all for the continuance of the Proclamation
of Emergency. But this would be a very heavy onus because it
would  be  entirely  for  the  executive  Government  to  be
satisfied  whether   a	situation   has	 arisen	  where	 the
Proclamation of	 Emergency can be revoked. There would be so
many facts and circumstances and such diverse considerations
to be  taken into account by the executive Government before
it can	be satisfied  that there  is  no  longer  any  grave
emergency whereby the security of India is threatened by war
or external aggression or internal disturbance. 'this is not
a  matter  which  is  a	 fit  subject  matter  for  judicial
determination and  the court  would not	 interfere with	 the
satisfaction of	 the executive	Government  in	this  regard
unless it  is clear  on the material on record that there is
absolutely no  justification  for  the	continuance  of	 the
Proclamation of	 Emergency and	the  Proclamation  is  being
continued mala	fide or	 for a collateral purpose. The court
may in	such a case, if satisfied beyond doubt, grant a writ
of mandamus  directing the  Central Government to revoke the
Proclamation of	 Emergency. But	 until	that  is  done,	 the
Proclamation of Emergency would continue in operation and it
cannot	be   said  that,   though  not	revoked	 by  another
Proclamation, it  has still  ceased to be in force. Here, in
the present  case  it  was  common  ground  that  the  first
Proclamation of	 Emergency issued  on 3rd  December 1971 was
not revoked  by another	 Proclamation under  clause 2(a)  of
<a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_793">Article 352</a>  until 21st March 1977 and hence at the material
time when  the <a href="/doc/708220/" id="a_794">House  of People (Extension of Duration) Act</a>,
1976 was  passed, the first Proclamation of Emergency was in
operation.
</p><p id="p_140">     Now if  the first	Proclamation  of  Emergency  was  in
operation at  the relevant  time,  it  would  be  sufficient
compliance with the requirement of the proviso to clause (2)
of <a href="/doc/1463849/" id="a_795">Article  83</a> and  it	would  be  unnecessary	to  consider
whether the  second Proclamation  of Emergency	was  validly
issued by the President. But, contended the petitioners, the
<a href="/doc/708220/" id="a_796">House of  People (Extension  of Duration)  Act</a>,	 1976  on  a
proper	interpretation	 of   <a href="/doc/276070/" id="a_797">section	2</a>   postulated	 the
operational existence of both the Proclamations of Emergency
and if	either of  them was not in existence at the material
date, the  Act would  be inoperative  and would not have the
effect of  extending the  duration of  the Lok Sabha. It was
therefore not  enough for  the respondents to establish that
the first  Proclamation of Emergency was in operation at the
relevant date, but it was further necessary to show that the
second Proclamation  of Emergency  was also in operation and
hence it  was  necessary  to  consider	whether	 the  second
Proclamation  of   Emergency  was   validly  issued  by	 the
President. The respondents sought to answer this contention
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_80">314</span>
of the	petitioners by	saying that on a proper construction
of the	language of  <a href="/doc/276070/" id="a_798">section  2</a>,  it  was  not	a  condition
precedent  to	the  operation.	  of  the  <a href="/doc/708220/" id="a_799">House  of  People
(Extension of Duration Act</a>, 1976 that both the Proclamations
of Emergency should be in operation at the date when the Act
was enacted.  <a href="/doc/708220/" id="a_800">The House	 of People  (Extension of  Duration)
Act</a>, 1976  no doubt  referred to  both the  Proclamations of
Emergency being	 in operation  but that was merely, said the
respondents, by way of recital and it was immaterial whether
this recital  was correct  or in correct, because so long as
it could  be objectively established that on Proclamation of
Emergency at  least was in operation, the requirement of the
proviso to  <a href="/doc/1463849/" id="a_801">Article 83</a> clause (2) would be satisfied and the
Act would  be within  the competence of Parliament to enact.
These rival contentions raised a question of construction of
<a href="/doc/1438938/" id="a_802">section 2</a>  of the  House of  People (Extension	of Duration)
Act, 1976.  It is  a simple question which does not admit of
much doubt  or debate  and a  plain grammatical	 reading  of
<a href="/doc/276070/" id="a_803">section 2</a> is sufficient to answer it. It would be convenient
to reproduce  <a href="/doc/276070/" id="a_804">section 2</a>	 which co-incidentally happens to be

     under clause  (2) of  <a href="/doc/1463849/" id="a_806">Article 83</a>  of the Constitution,.
     continue until six months after the cesser of operation
     OF the  said  Proclamations  or  Proclamation  but	 not
     beyond the said period of one year."
</blockquote><p id="p_141">While interpreting  the language  of  this  section,  it  is
necessary  to	bear  in  mind	that  the  <a href="/doc/708220/" id="a_807">House  of  People
(Extension of  Duration) Act</a>,  1976 was	 enacted  under	 the
proviso to  clause (2)	of <a href="/doc/1463849/" id="a_808">Article  83</a> for  the	 purpose  of
extending the  duration of  the	 Lok  Sabha  and  it  was  a
condition  precedent  to  the  exercise	 of  this  power  by
Parliament that	 there should be a Proclamation of Emergency
in operation  at the  date when	 the Act  was  enacted.	 Now
according to  Parliament there	were  two  Proclamations  of
Emergency which	 were in operation at the material date, one
issued on  3rd December 1971 and the other on 25th June 1975
and the	 condition precedent  for the  exercise of the power
under the  proviso to  cl. (2)	of <a href="/doc/1463849/" id="a_809">Article  83</a> to  enact the
House of People (Extension
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_81">315</span>
of <a href="/doc/99408546/" id="a_810">Duration) Act</a>, 1976 was satisfied. It was, from the point
of view of legislative drafting, not necessary to recite the
fulfillment of	this condition	precedent, but the draftsman
of the	Act, it	 seems, thought	 it advisable  to  insert  a
recital that  this condition precedent was satisfied and he,
therefore, introduced  the words "while the Proclamations of
Emergency issued on the 3rd day of December, 1971 and on the
25th day  of June,  1975 are  both in  operation" before the
operative part	in sec.	 2 of  the  Act.  These	 words	were
introduced merely  by way  of recital of the satisfaction of
the condition  precedent for  justifying the exercise of the
power under the proviso to clause (2) of <a href="/doc/1463849/" id="a_811">Article 83</a> and they
were not  intended to lay down a condition for the operation
of sec. 2 of the Act. <a href="/doc/276070/" id="a_812">Section 2</a> clearly and in so many terms
extended the  duration of  the Lok Sabha for a period of one
year and  this extension  was not made dependent on both the
Proclamations of Emergency being in operation at the date of
the enactment  of the  Act. It	was for a definite period of
one year  that the extension was effected and it was not co-
extensive with	the operation  of both	the Proclamations of
Emergency. The	extension for  a period of one year was made
once and  for all  by the  enactment of	 <a href="/doc/276070/" id="a_813">section 2</a>  and	 the
reference to  both the	Proclamations of  Emergency being in
operation was merely for the purpose of indicating that both
the  Proclamations   of	 Emergency   being   in	  operation.
Parliament had	competence to  make the	 extension.  It	 was
therefore not  at all  necessary for  the  efficacy  of	 the
extension that both the Proclamations of Emergency should be
in operation  at the  date of  enactment of the Act. Even if
one Proclamation  of  Emergency	 was  in  operation  at	 the
material date,	it would  be sufficient to attract the power
of Parliament  under the  proviso to  <a href="/doc/1463849/" id="a_814">Art. 83</a>  clause (2) to
enact the  Act extending  the duration	of the Lok Sabha. Of
course, it  must be  concerned that  Parliament proceeded on
the assumption that both the Proclamations of Emergency were
in force  at the  relevant date and they invested Parliament
with power  to enact  the Act,	but even if this legislative
assumption were	 unfounded, it would not make any difference
to the	validity of  the exercise  of the  power, so long as
there was  one Proclamation  of Emergency in operation which
authorised Parliament  to extend  the duration	of  the	 Lok
Sabha wader  the proviso  to clause (2) of <a href="/doc/1463849/" id="a_815">Article 83.</a> It is
true that  the proviso	to sec.	 2 enacted  that if  both or
either of  the Proclamations of Emergency cease or ceases to
operate before	the expiration of the extended period of one
year, the  Lok Sabha  shall continue  until six months after
the  cesser  of	 operation  of	the  said  Proclamations  or
Proclamation, not  going beyond	 the period of one year, but
the opening  part of  this proviso can have application only
in relation  to a  Proclamation of  Emergency which  was  in
operation at  the date	of enactment  of the  Act. If such a
Proclamation of Emergency which was in operation at the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_82">316</span>
material date ceased to operate before the expiration of the
extended period	 of one year, then the term of the Lok Sabha
would not  immediately come to an end, but it would continue
for a  further period of six months but not so to exceed the
extended period	 of one year. This provision obviously could
have no	 application in	 relation to the second Proclamation
of emergency if it was void when issued. In such a case, the
second Proclamation  not being	valid at  all at the date of
issue would  not be  in operation  at all  and it  could not
cease to operate after the date of enactment of the Act. The
proviso would in that event have to be read as relating only
to the	first Proclamation  of	Emergency,  and	 since	that
Proclamation of	 Emergency continued until it was revoked on
21st March, 1977, the duration of the Lok Sabha	 was validly
extended for  a period of one year from 18th March, 1976 and
hence there was a validly constituted Lok Sabha on the dates
when the Constitution (Fortieth Amendment) Act, 1976 and the
Constitution (Forty-second  Amendment) Act, 1976 were passed
by Parliament.	On this	 view it  is not at all necessary to
consider whether  the second  Proclamation of  Emergency was
validly issued	by the President. It is the settled practice
of this	 Court not  to say  more than  is necessary to get a
safe resting  place for the decision and I do not think that
any useful  purpose will  be served by examining the various
grounds of  challenge urged  against  the  validity  of	 the
second Proclamation  of Emergency, particularly since clause
(3) has	 been introduced  in <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_816">Art.  352</a> by  the	Constitution
(Forty-Fourth  Amendment)   Act,  1978	 requiring  that   a
Proclamation  of  Emergency  shall  not	 be  issued  by	 the
President  unless   the	 decision   of	the   Union  Cabinet
recommending  the   issue  of  such  Proclamation  has	been
communicated to him in writing and clause (9) of <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_817">Article 352</a>
introduced by  the  Constitution  (Thirty-eighth  Amendment)
Act. 1975  and renumbered  by the Constitution (Forty-Fourth
Amendment)  Act,   1978	 empowers  the	President  to  issue
different  Proclamations  on  different	 grounds.  I  would,
therefore. reject  the challenge against the validity of the
Constitution  (Fortieth	  Amendment)  Act,   1976  and	 the
Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976 based on the
ground that  on the  dates when	 these Constitution Amending
Acts  were  enacted,  the  Lok	Sabha  was  not	 validly  in
existence.
</p><p id="p_142">     That  takes   me	to   the   challenge   against	 the
constitutional validity of the amendment made in <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_818">Article 31.</a>
by section  4 of  the Constitution  (Forty-second Amendment)
Act, 1976.  This amendment substitutes the words "all or any

by <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_822">Article  14</a> or <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_823">Article 19".</a> The amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_824">Article 31C</a> gives
primacy to  Directive Principles  over Fundamental Rights in
case of	 conflict between  them and  the question is whether
this amendment	is in  any  way	 destructive  of  the  basic
structure of  the  Constitution.  To  answer  this  question
satisfactorily, it  is necessary  to appreciate	 the  inter-
relationship  between	Fundamental  Rights   and  Directive
Principles and for this purpose it would be  useful to trace
briefly the  history of their enactment in the Constitution.
The genesis  of Fundamental  Rights and Directive Principles
is to  be found	 in the freedom struggle which the people of
India waged  against the British rule under the aegis of the
Indian National	 Congress led  by Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal
Nehru and  other national    leaders.  These  great  leaders
realised the  supreme importance  of the political and civil
rights of  the individual.  because  they  knew	 from  their
experience of  the repression under the British rule as also
from the  recent events	 of history  including the two World
Wars that  these rights	 are absolutely	 essential  for	 the
dignity of man and development of his full personality. But,
at the	same time, they were painfully conscious that in the
socio-economic conditions  that prevailed  in  the  country.
only an	 infinitesimal fraction	 of the people would be able
to enjoy  these	 civil	and  political	rights.	 There	were
millions of  people in	the  country  who  were	 steeped  in
poverty and  destitution  and  for  them,  these  civil	 and
political rights had no meaning. It was realised that to the
large majority	of people who are living an almost sub-human
existence in  conditions of object poverty and for whom life
is one	long unbroken story of want and destitution, notions
of individual  freedom and liberty, though representing some
of the most cherished values of free society, would sound as
empty words  bandied about  only in the drawing rooms of the
rich and  well-to-do and  the only solution for making these
rights meaningful  to  them  was  to  re-make  the  material
conditions and	usher in  a new	 social order  where  socio-
economic justice will inform all institutions of public life
so that	 the pre-conditions of fundamental liberties for all
may be	secured. It  was necessary  to create socio-economic
conditions in  which every  citizen of	the country would be
able to	 exercise civil and politically rights and they will
not remain  the	 preserve  of  only  a	fortunate  few.	 The
national leaders, therefore, laid the greatest stress on the
necessity of  bringing about socio-economic regeneration and
ensuring social	 and economic  justice. Mahatma	 Gandhi, the
father of the nation, said in his inimitable style in words,
full of poignancy:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_34">	  "Economic equality  is  the  master  key  to	non-
     violent   independence.   A   non-violent	 system	  of
     Government is an impossibility so long as the wide gulf
     between the rich and the hungry
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_84">318</span>
     millions persists.	 The contrast between the palaces of
     New  Delhi	  and  the  miserable  hovels  of  the	poor
     labouring class  cannot last one day in a free India in
     which the poor will enjoy the same power as the rich in
     the  land.	  A  violent  and  bloody  revolution  is  a
     certainty one day, unless there is voluntary abdication
     of riches	and the	 power that  riches give and sharing
     them for common good".
</blockquote><p id="p_143">Jawaharlal Nehru also said in the course of his presidential
address to the Lahore Congress Session of 1929:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_35">	  "The	philosophy   of	 socialism   has   gradually
     permeated the  entire structure  of  the  society,	 the
     world over	 and almost the only point in dispute is the
     phase and	methods of  advance to its full realisation.
     India will	 have to go that way too if she seeks to end
     her poverty  and inequality,  though she may evolve her
     own methods  and may  adapt the  ideal to the genius of
     her race.
</blockquote><p id="p_144">Then  again,   emphasizing  the	  intimate  and	 inseverable
connection between  political independence  and	 social	 and
economic freedom, he said:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_36">	  "If an indigenous Government took the place of the
     foreign Government	 and kept  all the  vested interests
     intact, this  would not  be even  the shadow of freedom
     .......................................................
     .................... India's immediate goal can only be
     considered in  terms of  the ending of the exploitation
     of her  people. Politically,  it must mean independence
     and cession of the British connection, economically and
     socially, it  must mean the ending of all special class
     privileges and vested interests."
</blockquote><p id="p_145">The Congress  Resolution of  1929 also	emphasized the	same
theme of socio-economic reconstruction when it declared:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_37">	  "The great poverty and misery of the Indian people
     are due, not only to foreign exploitation in India, but
     also to  the economic  structure of  society, which the
     alien rulers  support so  that their  exploitation	 may
     continue. In order therefore to remove this poverty and
     misery and	 to ameliorate	the condition  of the Indian
     masses, it	 is essential  to make revolutionary changes
     in the present economic and social structure of society
     and to remove the gross inequalities."</blockquote>
<p id="p_146">     The Resolution passed by the Congress in 1931 proceeded
to declare  that in order to end the exploitation of masses,
political freedom  must include	 social and economic freedom
of the	starving mil  lions. The Congress Election Manifesto
of 1945	 also reiterated  the same  thesis when it said that
"the most vital and urgent of India's
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_85">319</span>
problems is how to remove the curse of poverty and raise the
standard     of	 masses"   and	for   that  purpose   it  is
"necessary...........................	to    prevent	 the
concentration  of   wealth  and	  power	 in   the  hands  of
individuals and	 groups	 and  to  prevent  vested  interests
inimical to  society from  "growing". This  was	 the  socio-
economic  philosophy  which  inspired  the  framers  of	 the
Constitution to	 believe that  the guarantee  of  individual
freedom was  no	 doubt	necessary  to  be  included  in	 the
Constitution, but  it was  also essential to make provisions
for restructuring  the	socio-economic	order  and  ensuring
social	and   economic	justice	 to  the  people.  This	 was
emphasized  by	 Jawaharlal  Nehru  when,  speaking  on	 the
resolution regarding  the aims	and  objectives	 before	 the
Constituent Assembly, he said:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_38">	  "The first  task of this Assembly is to free India
     through a new Constitution, to feed the starving people
     and clothe	 the naked  masses  and	 give  every  Indian
     fullest opportunity to develop himself according to his
     capacity.
</blockquote><p id="p_147">In fact,  as  pointed  out  by	K.  Santhanan,	a  prominent
southern member	 of the	 Constituent  Assembly,	 there	were
three revolutions running parallel in India since the end of
the first World War. The political revolution came to an end
on 15th	 August, 1947  when  India  became  independent	 but
clearly political freedom cannot be an end in itself. it can
only be	 a means  to an	 end, "that end being" as eloquently
ex-  pressed   by  Jawaharlal  Nehru  "the  raising  of	 the
people,................. to  higher  levels  and  hence	 the
general advancement of humanity." It was therefore necessary
to carry  forward and  accomplish the  social  and  economic
revolutions. The  social revolution  was meant	to get India
"out of the mediavalism based on birth, religion, custom and
community and  reconstruct her	social structure  on  modern
foundations of law, individual merit and secular education,"
while the  economic revolution	was intended  to bring about
"transition from  primitive rural  economy to scientific and
planned agriculture and industry." Dr. Radhakrishnan who was
a member  of the  Constituent Assembly	and who later became
the President  of India also emphasised that India must have
a socio-economic revolution designed not only to bring about
the real satisfaction of the fundamental needs of the common
man hut	 to go	much deeper  and bring	about "a fundamental
change in  the structure  of Indian society." It was clearly
realised by  the framers  of the  Constitution that  on	 the
achievement  of	  this	great  social  and  economic  change
depended the  survival of  India. "If  we cannot  solve this
problem	 soon",	 Jawaharlal  Nehru  warned  the	 Constituent
Assembly "all  our paper  Constitutions will  become useless
and purposeless."  The objectives  Resolution which  set out
the and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_86">320</span>
objectives before  the Constituent  Assembly in	 framing the
Constitution  and   which  was	passed	by  the	 Constituent
Assembly in  January 1947  before embarking  upon the actual
task  of   Constitution	 making,  therefore,  expressed	 the
resolve of  the Constituent Assembly to frame a constitution
"wherein shall	be guaranteed  and secured to all the people
of India  justice, social,  economic and political, equality
of status  and of  opportunity before  the law;	 freedom  of
thought,  expression,	belief,	 faith,	 worship,  vocation,
association and	 action subject	 to law	 and public morality
and  wherein  adequate	safeguards  shall  be  provided	 for
minority, backward  and trial  areas and depressed and other
backward classes." These objectives were incorporated by the
Constitution makers  in the Preamble of the Constitution and
they were  a sought  to be  secured by	enacting Fundamental
Rights in Part III and Directive Principles in Part IV.
</p><p id="p_148">     It is  not	 possible  to  fit  Fundamental	 Rights	 and
Directive Principles  in two  distinct and  strictly defined
categories, but	 it may	 be  stated broadly that Fundamental
Rights represent  civil and political rights while Directive
Principles embody  social  and	economic  rights.  Both	 are
clearly part  of the  broad spectrum  of human rights. If we
look at the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by
the General  Assembly of the United Nations on 18th December
1948. we  find that  it contains  not only rights protecting
individual freedom  (See Articles  1 to	 21) but also social
and  economic	rights	intended  to  ensure  socio-economic
justice to every one (See Articles 22 to 29). There are also
two International  Covenants adopted by the General Assembly
for securing human rights, one is the International Covenant
on  Civil   and	 Political  Rights  and	 the  other  is	 the
International Covenant	on  Economic,  Social  and  Cultural
Rights. Both are international instruments relating to human
rights.	 It   is  therefore   not  correct  to	t  say	that
Fundamental Rights  alone are  based on	 human rights  while
Directive Principles  fall in some category other than human
rights. The  socio-economic rights embodied in the Directive
Principles are	as much	 a  part  of  human  rights  as	 the
Fundamental Rights.  Hegde and	Mukherjea, JJ.	were. to  my
mind, right in saying in Keshavananda Bharati's case at page
312 of	the Report  that "the  Directive Principles  and the
Fundamental Rights  mainly proceed  on the  basis  of  human
Rights." Together,  they  are  intended	 to  carry  out	 the
objectives set	out in	the Preamble of the Constitution and
to establish  an  egalitarian  social  order  informed	with
political, social  and	economic  justice  and	II  ensuring
dignity of  the individual  not only  to  a  few  privileged
persons but  to the  entire people  of the country including
the have-nots  and the	handicapped, the  lowliest  and	 the
lost,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_87">321</span>
     Now it is interesting to note that although Fundamental
Rights and  Directive Principles  appear in the Constitution
as distinct  entities, there  was no  such demarcation	made
between them  during the  period prior to the framing of the
Constitution. If  we may quote the words of Granville Austin
in his book; "Both types of rights had developed as a common
demand, products  of the national and social revolutions, of
their almost  inseparable intertwining. and of the character
of Indian  politics itself".  They were	 both placed  on the
same  pedestal	and  treated  as  falling  within  the	same
category compendiously	described as  "Fundamental  Rights".
The Sapru  Committee in its Constitutional Proposals made in
1945, recommended that the declaration of Fundamental Rights
in its	wider sense  was absolutely  necessary and envisaged
these rights  as falling in two classes; one justiciable and
the other  non-justiciable-the former  being enforceable  in
Courts of  law and  the latter,	 not. The Committee however,
felt difficulty	 in dividing  the  Fundamental	Rights	into
these two classes and. left the whole issue to be settled by
the  Constitution-making  body	with  the  observation	that
though	the   task  was	  difficult,  it  was  by  no  means
impossible. This  suggestion of	 the Sapru Committee perhaps
drew its  inspiration from  the Irish  Constitution of 1937,
which  made  a	distinction  between  justiciable  and	non-
justiciable rights  and designated the former as Fundamental
Rights and  the latter	as Directive  Principles  of  Social
Policy. Dr.  Lauter-pacht also	made a	similar	 distinction
between	 justiciable   and  non-justiciable  rights  in	 his
"International Bill  of the  Rights of Men". The substantial
provisions of this Bill were in two parts; Part I dealt with
personal or  individual rights	enforceable in Courts of Law
while Part  II set  out social and economic rights incapable
of or  unsuitable for  such enforcement.  Sir B. N. Rau, who
was the	 Constitutional Adviser	 to the Government of India,
was considerably  impressed by	these ideas and he suggested
that the best way of giving effect to the objectives set out
in the	objectives Resolution was to split-up the objectives
into Fundamental  Rights and Fundamental Principles of State
Policy, the former relating to personal and political rights
enforceable in	Courts of  Law and  the latter	relating  to
social	and  economic  rights  and  other  matters,  not  so
enforceable and	 proposed that	the Chapter  on	 Fundamental
Rights may  be split- up into two parts; Part A dealing with
the latter  kind of  rights under  the heading	"Fundamental
Principles of  Social Policy"  and  Part  dealing  with	 the
former	under	the  heading   "Fundamental   Rights".	 The
Fundamental Rights  Sub-Committee also recommended that "the
list of	 fundamental rights should be prepared in two parts,
the  first   part  consisting	of  rights   enforceable  by
appropriate legal  process  and	 the  second  consisting  of
Directive Principles  of Social Policy". A week later, while
moving for  consideration, the Interim Report of Fundamental
Rights, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel said:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_88">322</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_39">	  "This is a preliminary report or an interim report
     because the  Committee when it sat down to consider the
     question of  fixing  the  fundamental  rights  and	 its
     incorporation  into   the	Constitution.  came  to	 the
     conclusion	 that	the  Fundamental  Rights  should  be
     divided into  two parts-the  first part justiciable and
     the other non-justiciable."
</blockquote><p id="p_149">This position  was reiterated  by Sardar  Vallabhbhai  Patel
when he said while presenting the Supplementary Report:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_40">	  "There were two parts of the Report; one contained
     Fundamental Rights which were justiciable and the other
     part of the Report referred to Fundamental Rights which
     were not justiciable but were directives.. "
</blockquote><p id="p_150">It will,  therefore, be	 seen that from the point of view of
importance and significance no distinction was drawn between
justiciable and non-justiciable rights and both were treated
as forming  part of  the rubric	 of Fundamental	 Rights, the
only difference	 being that  whereas the  former were  to be
enforceable in	Courts of  Law, the latter were not to be so
enforceable.  This  proposal  of  dividing  the	 fundamental
rights into  two parts,	 one part  justiciable and the other
non-justiciable, was  however not  easy of adoption, because
it was	a difficult  task to  decide  in  which	 category  a
particular  fundamental	  right	 should	  be  included.	 The
difficulty may	be illustrated	by pointing  out that at one
time the  right to  primary education  was included  in	 the
draft list  of Fundamental Rights, while the equality clause
figured in  the draft  list  of	 Fundamental  Principles  of
Social Policy.	But ultimately a division of the Fundamental
Rights	into  justiciable  and	non-justiciable	 rights	 was
agreed-upon by	the Constituent Assembly and the former were
designated  as	 "Fundamental  Rights"	and  the  latter  as
"Directive Principles  of State	 Policy". It  has  sometimes
been said  that the  Fundamental Rights	 deal with  negative
obligations of	the State  not	to  encroach  on  individual
freedom, while	the  Directive	Principles  impose  positive
obligations on	the State  to take  certain kind  of action.
But, I	find it	 difficult to  subscribe to this proposition
because, though	 the  latter  part  may	 be  true  that	 the
Directive Principles  require positive action to be taken by
the State,  it	is  not	 wholly	 correct  to  say  that	 the
Fundamental Rights  impose only	 negative obligations on the
State. There  are a few fundamental rights which have also a
positive content and that has been. to some extent, unfolded
by the	recent decisions of this Court in <a href="/doc/1007347/" id="a_825">Hussainara Khatton
v. State  of Bihar</a>,  Madhav Hayawadanrao  Hoskot v. State of
Maharashtra and	 Sunil Batra  etc. v. Delhi Administration &amp;
Ors. etc.. There are new dimensions of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_89">323</span>
the Fundamental	 Rights which  are being  opened-up by	this
Court and  the entire jurisprudence of Fundamental Rights is
in a stage of resurgent evolution. Moreover, there are three
Articles, namely, <a href="/doc/1952106/" id="a_826">Art. 15(2</a>), <a href="/doc/1987997/" id="a_827">Art. 17</a> and <a href="/doc/1071750/" id="a_828">Art. 23</a> within the
category of Fundamental Rights which are designed to protect
the individual	against the action of other private citizens
and seem  to impose  positive obligations  on the  State  to
ensure this  protection to  the	 individual.  I	 would	not,
therefore, limit  the potential of the Fundamental Rights by
subscribing to	the theory  that they  are  merely  negative
obligations requiring  the State to abstain as distinct from
taking positive	 action. The only distinguishing feature, to
my mind, between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles
is that	 whereas the  former are  enforceable in  a Court of
Law, the  latter, are  not.  And  the  reason  for  this  is
obvious; it  has been  expressed succinctly  by the Planning
Commission in the following words:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_41">	  "The non-justiciability  clause only provides that
     the infant	 State shall  not be immediately called upon
     to account	 for not fulfilling the new obligations laid
     upon it. A State just awakened to freedom with its many
     pre-occupations  might  be	 crushed  under	 the  burden
     unless it	was free  to decide the order, the time, the
     place and the mode of fulfilling them."
</blockquote><p id="p_151">The social  and economic rights and other matters dealt with
in  the	 Directive  Principles	are  by	 their	very  nature
incapable  of	judicial  enforcement	and  moreover,	 the
implementation of  many of  those rights would depend on the
state  of   economic  development   in	the   country,	 the
availability of	 necessary  finances  and  the	Government's
assessment of  priority of objectives and values and that is
why they  are made  non-justiciable. But  merely because the
Directive Principles are non-justiciable, it does not follow
that they  are in  any way  subservient or  inferior to	 the
Fundamental Rights.
</p><p id="p_152">The Indian  Constitution is  first  and	 foremost  a  social
document. The majority of its provisions are either directly
aimed  at   furthering	the   goals  of	 the  socio-economic
revolution  or	 attempt  to   foster  this   revolution  by
establishing the  conditions necessary	for its achievement.
Yet despite the permeation of the entire Constitution by the
aim of national renascence, says Granville Austin, "the core
of the	commitment to the social revolution lies ...........
in the	Fundamental Rights  and the  Directive Principles of
State Policy."	These are the conscience of the Constitution
and, according to Granville Austin, "they are designed to be
the Chief instruments in bringing
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_90">324</span>
about the great reforms of the socio-economic revolution and
realising the  constitutional goals  of social, economic and
political  justice   for   all.	  The	Fundamental   Rights
undoubtedly provide  for  political  justice  by  conferring
various	 freedoms   on	the  individual,  and  also  make  a
significant contribution  to the  fostering  of	 the  social
revolution by  aiming at a society which will be egalitarian
in texture  and where  the rights of minority groups will be
protected. But	it is  in the  Directive Principles  that we
find the clearest statement of the socioeconomic revolution.
The Directive  Principles aim  at making  the Indian  masses
free  in   the	positive  sense,  free	from  the  passivity
engendered by  centuries  of  coercion	by  society  and  by
nature, free  from the	object physical	 conditions that had
prevented  them	 from  fulfilling  their  best	salves.	 The
Fundamental Rights  are no doubt important and valuable in a
democracy. but there can be no real democracy without social
and economic  justice to the common man and to create socio-
economic  conditions  in  which	 there	can  be	 social	 and
economic justice to every one, is the theme of the Directive
Principles. It is the Directive Principles which nourish the
roots of  our democracy,  provide strength  and vigour to it
and attempt  to make it a real participatory democracy which
does not  remain  merely  a  political	democracy  but	also
becomes	 social	 and  economic	democracy  with	 Fundamental
Rights	available   to	all  irrespective  of  their  power,
position or  wealth. The dynamic provisions of the Directive
Principles  fertilise	the   static   provisions   of	 the
Fundamental Rights.  The object of the Fundamental Rights is
to protect individual liberty, but can individual liberty be
considered in isolation from the socio-economic structure in
which it  is to	 operate. There is a real connection between
individual liberty  and the shape and form of the social and
economic  structure   of  the  society.	 Can  there  be	 any
individual liberty at all for the large masses of people who
are suffering  from want  and privation	 and who are cheated
out of	their individual rights by the exploitative economic
system ? Would their individual liberty not come in conflict
with the  liberty of  the  socially  and  economically	more
powerful  class	  and  in  the	process,  get  mutilated  or
destroyed ?  It is  axiomatic that the real controversies in
the present  day society  are not  between power and freedom
but between  one form  of liberty  and	another.  Under	 the
present socio-economic	system, it is the liberty of the few
which is  in conflict  with the	 liberty of  the  many.	 The
Directive Principles  therefore, impose an obligation on the
State to take positive action
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_91">325</span>
for creating  socio-economic conditions	 in which there will
be an  egalitarian social  order with  social  and  economic
justice to  all, so  that individual  liberty will  become a
cherished value	 and the  dignity of the individual a living
reality, not  only for	a few privileged persons but for the
entire people  of the country. It will thus be seen that the
Directive  Principles	enjoy  a  very	high  place  in	 the
constitutional scheme and it is only in the framework of the
socio-economic	structure   envisaged	in   the   Directive
Principles that	 the  Fundamental  Rights  are	intended  to
operate, for  it is only then they can become meaningful and
significant for the millions of our poor and deprived people
who do	not have  even the  bare necessities of life and who
are living below the poverty level.
</p><p id="p_153">     The Directive  Principles are set out in Part IV of the
Constitution and  this Part starts with <a href="/doc/76375/" id="a_829">Article 37</a> which, to
my mind,  is an Article of crucial importance. It says: "The
provisions contained  in this  Part shall not be enforceable
in any	court but  the	principles  therein  laid  down	 are
nevertheless fundamental  in the  governance of	 the country
and it	shall be  the duty  of	the  State  to	apply  these
principles in  making laws."  It is  necessary, in  order to
appreciate the full implications of this Article, to compare
it  with   the	corresponding	provision   in	 the   Irish
Constitution which,  as pointed	 out above, provided to some
extent the  inspiration for introducing Directive Principles
in the	Constitution. <a href="/doc/1791268/" id="a_830">Article  45</a> of  the Irish Constitution
provides:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_42">	  "The principles of social policy set forth in this
     Article are  E intended for the general guidance of the
     Directives. The  application of those principles in the
     making of	laws shall  be the  care  of  the  Direchtas
     exclusively and  shall not	 be cognizable for any court
     under any of the provisions of this Constitution."
</blockquote><p id="p_154">It is  interesting to  note that  our <a href="/doc/76375/" id="a_831">Article 37</a> makes three
significant departures	from the  language  of	<a href="/doc/1791268/" id="a_832">Article	 45;</a>
first whereas  Articles 4.  provides that the application of
the principles	of social  policy shall not be cognizable by
any court,  <a href="/doc/76375/" id="a_833">Article 37</a>	says that  the Directive  Principles
shall not  be enforceable  by any  court:  secondly  whereas
<a href="/doc/1791268/" id="a_834">Article 45</a> provides that the principles of social policy are
intended for  the general guidance of the Direchtas, <a href="/doc/76375/" id="a_835">Article
37</a>  makes   the	 Directive  Principles	fundamental  in	 the
governance of  this country;  and lastly, whereas <a href="/doc/1791268/" id="a_836">Article 45</a>
declares that the application of principles of social policy
in the	making of  laws shall  be the  care of the Direchtas
exclusively, <a href="/doc/76375/" id="a_837">Article  37</a> enacts that it shall be the duty of
the State  to apply the Directive Principles in making laws.
The changes  made by  the framers  of the  Constitution	 are
vital and  they have  the effect  of bringing  about a total
transformation	or   metamorphosis  o	f  this	  provision,
fundamentally altering its significance and efficacy,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_92">326</span>
     It will  be noticed  that the  Directive Principles are
not excluded  from the cognizance of the court, as under the
Irish Constitution:  they are merely made non-enforceable by
a court	 of law	 for reasons  already discussed	 But  merely
because they  are not  enforceable by  the judicial  process
does not mean that they are of subordinate importance to any
other part  of the  Constitution. I  have already  said this
before, but  I am  emphasizing it again, even at the cost of
repetition, because  at one  time a  view was  taken by this
Court in State of Madras v. Champkan Dorairajan that because
Fundamental Rights  are made  enforceable in  a court of law
and Directive  Principles are not. "the Directive Principles
have to	 conform to  and run as subsidiary to the Chapter on
Fundamental Rights." This view was patently wrong and within
a few  years, an  opportunity was found by this Court in the
Kerala	Education   Bill,  1959	  SCR  995  to	introduce  a
qualification by  stating that: "Nevertheless in determining
the scope  and ambit  of the Fundamental Rights relied on by
or on  behalf of  any person  or body,	the  court  may	 not
entirely ignore	 these Directive  Principles of State Policy
laid down  in Part  IV of  the Constitution but should adopt
the principle  of harmonious construction and should attempt
to give	 effect to  both as much as possible." But even this
observation seemed to give greater importance to Fundamental
Rights	as   against  Directive	  Principles  and  that	 was
primarily because  the Fundamental Rights are enforceable by
the Judicial  process while  the  Directive  Principles	 are
expressly made non-enforceable I am however, of the opinion,
and on	this point  I agree entirely with the observation of
Hegde,	J.  in	his  highly  illuminating  Lectures  on	 the
"Directive Principles of State Policy" that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_43">	  "Whether  or	not  a	particular  mandate  of	 the
     Constitution is enforceable by court, has no bearing on
     the  importance   of  that	 mandate.  The	Constitution
     contains many  important  mandates	 which	may  not  be
     enforceable by  the courts	 of law.  That does not mean
     that those	 Articles  must	 render	 subsidiary  to	 the
     Chapter on	 Fundamental Rights ...... it would be wrong
     to say  that those	 positive  mandates",  that  is	 the
     positive	mandates    contained	in   the   Directive
     Principles,  "are	 of  lesser  significance  than	 the
     mandates under Part III."
</blockquote><p id="p_155">Hegde, J.  in fact  pointed out	 at  another  place  in	 his
Lectures that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_44">	  "Unfortunately an  impression has gained ground in
     the organs	 of the	 State not  excluding judiciary that
     because the Directive Principles set out in Part IV are
     expressly made by <a href="/doc/76375/" id="a_838">Article 37</a> non-enforceable by courts,
     these directives are mere pious hopes
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_93">327</span>
     not deserving  immediate attention.  I emphasize  again
     that no Part of the Constitution is more important that
     Part IV  To ignore	 Part IV is to ignore the sustenance
     provided for in the Constitution, the hopes held out to
     the  nation   and	the   very  ideals   on	 which	 our
     Constitution is built up." (Emphasis supplied).
</blockquote><p id="p_156">I wholly endorse this view set forth by Hegde, J and express
my full concurrence with it.
</p><p id="p_157">     I may  also point out that simply because the Directive
Principles do  not create  rights enforceable  in a court of
law, it	 does  not  follow  that  they	do  not	 create	 any
obligations on	the State.  We are  so much  Obsessed by the
Hohfeldian Classification  that we  tend to think of rights,
Liberties, powers  and privileges as being invariably linked
with the  corresponding concept of duty, no right, liability
and  immunity.	 We  find   it	difficult   to	conceive  of
obligations or	duties which  do  not  create  corresponding
rights in  others.  But	 the  Hohfeldian  concept  does	 not
provide a  satisfactory	 analysis  in  all  kinds  of  jural
relation ships and breaks down in some cases where it is not
possible to  say that the duty in one creates an enforceable
right in  another. There  may be  a rule  which	 imposes  an
obligation on  an individual or authority and yet it may not
be enforceable in a court of law and therefore not give rise
to a  corresponding enforceable right in another person. But
it would  still be a legal rule because it prescribes a norm
or con	duct to be followed by such individual or authority.
The law	 may provide  a mechanism  for enforcement  of	this
obligation, but	 the existence	of the	obligation does	 not
depend upon  the creation  of such mechanism. The obligation
exists	prior	to  and	 independent  of  the  mechanism  of
enforcement. A rule imposing an obligation or duty would not
therefore cease	 to be	a rule	of law	because there  is no
regular judicial  or quasi-judicial machinery to enforce its
command. Such  a rule  would exist  despite of	any  problem
relating to  its enforcement.  Otherwise the  conventions of
the Constitution  and even  rules of International Law would
no longer  be liable  to be  regarded as  rules of law. This
view is	 clearly supported by the opinion of Professor A. L.
Goodhart who, while commenting upon this point, says:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_45">	  "I have  always argued  that	if  a  principle  is
     recognised as,  binding on the legislature, then it can
     be correctly described as a legal rule even if there is
     no court that can enforce it. Thus most of Dicey's book
     on the  British Constitution  is concerned with certain
     general  principles   which  Parliament  recognises  as
     binding on it."</blockquote>
<p id="p_158">     It is  therefore. to  my mind,  clear beyond doubt that
merely because	the Directive Principles are not enforceable
in a  court of law, it does not mean that they cannot create
obligations or duties binding on the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_94">328</span>
State. The  crucial test  which has to be applied is whether
the Directive Principles impose any obligations or duties on
the State;  if they  do, the  State  would  be	bound  by  a
constitutional	mandate	 to  carryout  such  obligations  or
duties, even though no corresponding right is created in any
one which can be enforced in a court of law.
</p><p id="p_159">     Now on  this question  <a href="/doc/76375/" id="a_839">Article 37</a> is emphatic and makes
the point  in no uncertain terms. It says that the Directive
Principles are	"nevertheless fundamental  in the governance
of the	country and  it shall  be the  duty of	the State to
apply these principles in making laws." There could not have
been more  explicit language used by the Constitution makers
to make	 the Directive	Principles binding  on the State and
there  can   be	 no   doubt  that   the	 State	is  under  a
constitutional	obligation   to	 carry	 out  this   mandate
contained in  <a href="/doc/76375/" id="a_840">Article 37.</a>  In fact,  non-compliance with the
Directive Principles  would be	unconstitutional on the part
of the	State and  it would  not only constitute a breach of
faith  with  the  people  who  imposed	this  constitutional
obligation on  the State  but it  would also  render a vital
part of	 the Constitution  meaningless and futile. Now it is
significant to	note that  for the  purpose of the Directive
Principles, the	 "State" has the same meaning as given to it
under <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_841">Article  13</a> for the purpose of the Fundamental Rights.
This would  mean that the same State which is injuncted from
taking any  action in infringement of the Fundamental Rights
is told	 in no	uncertain terms	 that  it  must	 regard	 the
Directive Principles as fundamental in the governance of the
country and  is positively  mandated to apply them in making
laws. This  gives rise	to a  paradoxical situation  and its
implications are for reaching. The State is on the one hand,
prohibited by  the constitutional  injunction in  <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_842">Article 13</a>
from making  any law  or taking	 any executive	action which
would infringe any Fundamental Right and at the same time it
is directed  by the  constitutional mandate in <a href="/doc/76375/" id="a_843">Article 37</a> to
apply the  Directive Principles	 in the	 governance  of	 the
country and  to make laws for giving effect to the Directive
Principles. Both are constitutional obligations of the State
and the	 question is, as to which must prevail when there is
a conflict  between the	 two. When the State makes a law for
giving effect to a Directive Principle, it is carrying out a
constitutional obligation under <a href="/doc/76375/" id="a_844">Article 37</a> and if it were to
be said	 that the  State cannot	 make such  a law because it
comes into conflict with a Fundamental Right, it can only be
on the	basis that  Fundamental Rights	stand  on  a  higher
pedestal and have precedence over Directive Principles. But,
as we  have pointed out above, it is not correct to say that
under our  constitutional  scheme,  Fundamental	 Rights	 are
superior  to   Directive  Principles   or   that   Directive
Principles must	 yield to  Fundamental Rights.	Both are  in
fact equally  fundamental and  the courts  have therefore in
recent times tried to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_95">329</span>
harmonise them	by importing the Directive Principles in the
construction of	 the Fundamental  Rights. It  has been	laid
down in	 recent decisions of this Court that for the purpose
of determining the reasonableness of the restriction imposed
on Fundamental	Rights, the Court may legitimately take into
account the  Directive Principles and where executive action
is taken  or legislation  enacted for  the purpose of giving
effect to  a Directive Principle, the restriction imposed by
it on  a Fundamental Right may be presumed to be reasonable.
I do  not propose  to burden  this opinion with reference to
all  the  decided  cases  where	 this  principles  has	been
followed by  the Court, but I may refer only to one decision
which, I  believe, is  the  latest  on	the  point,  namely,
<a href="/doc/1959928/" id="a_845">Pathumma v.  State of Kerala</a>, where Fazal Ali, J. summarised
the law	 in the following words: "one of the tests laid down
by this	 Court is  that in judging the reasonableness of the
restrictions imposed by clause (5) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_846">Art. 19</a>, the Court has
to bear	 in mind  the Directive Principles of State Policy".
So also in the <a href="/doc/41868/" id="a_847">State of Bihar v. Kameshwar Singh</a>, this Court
relied upon  the Directive Principle contained in <a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_848">Art. 39</a> in
arriving at  its decision  that the  purpose for  which	 the
Bihar Zamindary	 Abolition legislation had been passed was a
public purpose.	 The principle	accepted by  this Court	 was
that if	 a purpose  is	one  falling  within  the  Directive
Principles, it	would definitely be a public purpose. It may
also be	 pointed out that in a recent decision given by this
Court in  M/s Kasturi Lal Lakshmi Reddy etc. v. The State of
Jammu &amp;	 Kashmir &amp;  Anr, has  been held that every executive
action of  the Government,  whether in	pursuance of  law or
otherwise, must	 be  reasonable	 and  informed	with  public
interest   and	  the	yardstick   for	  determining	both
reasonableness and  public interest  is to  be found  in the
Directive Principle  and therefore,  if any executive action
is taken  by the Government for giving effect to a Directive
Principle, it  would prima facie be reasonable and in public
interest. It  will, therefore,	be seen	 that if  a  law  is
enacted for  the purpose  of giving  effect to	a  Directive
Principle and  it imposes  a restriction  on  a	 Fundamental
Right, it  would be difficult to condemn such restriction as
unreasonable or	 not in public interest. So also where a law
is enacted  for giving	effect to  a Directive	Principle in
furtherance  of	  the  constitutional  goal  of	 social	 and
economic justice  it may  conflict with	 a  formalistic	 and
doctrinaire view  of equality  before the  law, but it would
almost always  conform to  the principle  of equality before
the law	 in its	 total magnitude  and dimension, because the
equality clause	 in the	 Constitution does not speak of more
formal equality	 before the  law but embodies the concept of
real and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_96">330</span>
substantive equality  which strikes  at inequalities arising
on account  of vast social and economic differentials and is
consequently an	 essential ingredient of social and economic
justice. The  dynamic principle of egalitarianism fertilises
the concept of social and economic justice; it is one of its
essential elements  and there  can be  no  real	 social	 and
economic justice  where there is a breach of the egalitarian
principle. If,	therefore, there  is a	law enacted  by	 the
legislature which  is really and genuinely for giving effect
to a Directive Principle with a view to promoting social and
economic justice. it would be difficult to say that such law
violates the  principle of  egalitarianism  and	 is  not  in
accord with  the principle  of equality	 before the  law  as
understood not	in its	strict and formalistic sense, but in
its dynamic  and activist  magnitude. In  the circumstances,
the Court would not be unjustified in making the presumption
that a law enacted really and genuinely for giving effect to
a Directive  Principle in furtherance of the cause of social
and economic  justice, would  not infringe  any	 Fundamental
Right under  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_849">Article 14</a>	 or 19.	 Mr. C. H. Alexandrowick, an
eminent jurist,	 in fact,  says:  "Legislation	implementing
Part IV	 must be  regarded as permitted restrictions on Part
III". Dr.  Ambedkar, one  of the  chief	 architects  of	 the
Constitution, also  made it  clear while  intervening during
the discussion	on the Constitution (First Amendment Bill in
the Lok	 Sabha on 18th May 1951 that in his view "So" far as
the doctrine  of implied powers is concerned, there is ample
authority  in	the  Constitution  itself,  namely,  in	 the
Directive  Principles	to   permit   Parliament   to	make
legislation, although it will not be specifically covered by
the provisions contained in the Part on Fundamental Rights".
If this	 be the correct interpretation of the constitutional
provisions, as	I think	 it is, the amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_850">Article 31C</a> does
no  more   than	 codify	 the  existing	position  under	 the
constitutional scheme by providing immunity to a law enacted
really and  genuinely  for  giving  effect  to	a  Directive
Principle, so  that  needlessly	 futile	 and  time-consuming
controversy whether such law contravenes <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_851">Article 14</a> or 19 is
eliminated.  The   amended  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_852">Article   31C</a>  cannot   in	 the
circumstances  be   regarded  as   violative  of  the  basic
structure of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_160">     But I  may in  the	 alternative,  for  the	 purpose  of
argument. assume  that there may be a few cases where it may
be found  by the  court. perhaps on a narrow and doctrinaire
view of	 the scope  and applicability of a Fundamental Right
as in  <a href="/doc/9285/" id="a_853">Karimbil Kunhikoman  v. State  of Kerala</a>	 where a law
awarding compensation  at a  lower rate to holders of larger
blocks of  land and  at higher	rate to	 holders of  smaller
blocks of land was struck down by this Court as violative of
the equality clause, that a law enacted really and genuinely
for giving effect to a Directive Principle is violative of a
Fundamental Right  under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_854">Article  14</a> or 19. Would such a law
enacted in discharge of the.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_97">331</span>
<p id="p_161">constitutional obligation  laid upon the State under <a href="/doc/76375/" id="a_855">Article
37</a> be invalid, because it infringes a Fundamental Right ? If
the court takes the view that it is invalid, would it not be
placing Fundamental  Rights above  Directive  Principles,  a
position not  supported at  all	 by  the  history  of  their
enactment as  also  by	the  constitutional  scheme  already
discussed by  me. The two constitutional obligations, one in
regard to  Fundamental Rights  and the	other in  regard  to
Directive Principles,  are of  equal strength  and merit and
there is  no reason  why, in  case or  conflict. the  former
should be  given precedence  over the latter. I have already
pointed out  that whether or not a particular mandate of the
Constitution is	 justiciable has  no bearing  at all  on its
importance and significance and justiciability by itself can
never be  a ground for placing one constitutional mandate on
a higher  pedestal than	 the other.  The  effect  of  giving
greater weightage to the constitutional mandate in regard to
Fundamental  Rights  would  be	to  relegate  the  Directive
Principles  to	a  secondary  position	and  emasculate	 the
constitutional command	that the  Directive Principles shall
be fundamental in the governance of the country and it shall
be the	duty of	 the State  to apply them in making laws. It
would  amount  to  refusal  to	give  effect  to  the  words
"fundamental  in  the  governance  of  the  country"  and  a
constitutional	command	 which	has  been  declared  by	 the
Constitution  to   be  fundamental  would  be  rendered	 not
fundamental. The  result would be that a positive mandate of
the Constitution commanding the State to make a law would be
defeated; by  a negative  constitutional obligation  not  to
encroach upon  a Fundamental  Right and	 the law made by the
legislature pursuant  to a  positive constitutional  command
would be  delegitimised and  declared unconstitutional. This
plainly would  be  contrary  to	 the  constitutional  scheme
because, as already pointed out by me, the Constitution does
not accord  a higher  place to the constitutional obligation
in regard  to  Fundamental  Rights  over  the  contractional
obligation in  regard to  Directive Principles	and does not
say that  the implementation  of  the  Directive  Principles
shall only be within the permissible limits laid down in the
Chapter on  Fundamental	 Rights.  The  main  thrust  of	 the
argument of  Mr.  Palkhiwala  was  that	 by  reason  of	 the
amendment of  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_856">Article 31C</a>,  the harmony	 and balance between
Fundamental Rights  and Directive  Principle  are  disturbed
because	 Fundamental   Rights  which   had.  prior   to	 the
amendment, precedence  over Directive Principles are now, as
a result  of the  amendment, made  subservient to  Directive
Principles.  Mr.   Palkhiwala  picturesquely  described	 the
position emerging  as a	 result of  the amendment  by saying
that the  Constitution is  now made  to stand  on  its	head
instead of  its legs.  But in  my view the entire premise on
which this argument of Mr. Palkhiwala is based is fallacious
because it  is not  correct  to	 say,  and  I  have  in	 the
preceding portions
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_98">332</span>
of this	 opinion, given	 cogent reasons	 for this view, that
prior to the amendments Fundamental Rights had a superior or
higher position	 in the constitutional scheme than Directive
Principles and	there is  accordingly no  question at all of
any  subversion	 of  the  constitutional  structure  by	 the
amendment. There  can be  no doubt that the intention of the
Constitution makers  was that  the Fundamental Rights should
operate within	the  socio-economic  structure	or  a  wider
continuum envisaged  by the  Directive Principles,  for then
only would  the Fundamental Rights become exercisable by all
and a  proper balance and harmony between Fundamental Rights
and Directive  Principles secured.  The Constitution  makers
therefore never	 contemplated that  a conflict	would  arise
between	 the   constitutional  obligation   in	 regard	  to
Fundamental Rights  and the constitutional mandate in regard
to Directive  Principles.  But	if  a  conflict	 does  arise
between	 these	 two  constitutional   mandates	  of   equal
fundamental character  how is  the conflict to be resolved ?
The Constitution  did not  provide any answer because such a
situation was not anticipated by the Constitution makers and
this problem  had therefore  to be  solved by Parliament and
some modus  operandi had to be evolved in order to eliminate
the possibility	 of conflict  howsoever remote	it might be.
The way	 was shown in no uncertain terms by Jawaharlal Nehru
when he said in the Lok Sabha in the course of discussion on
the Constitution (First Amendment) Bill:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_46">	  "The	Directive   Principles	 of   State   Policy
     represent a  dynamic move	towards a certain objective.
     The Fundamental  Rights represent	something static, to
     preserve certain  rights which  exist. Both  again	 are
     right. But somehow and sometime it might so happen that
     dynamic movement  and that	 static	 standstill  do	 not
     quite fit into each other.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_47">	  The dynamic  movement towards	 a certain objective
     necessarily means certain changes taking place: that is
     the essence  of movement.	Now it	may be	that in	 the
     process   of    dynamic   movement	  certain   existing
     relationships are altered, varied or affected. In fact,
     they are  meant to	 affect those  settled relationships
     and yet if you come back to the Fundamental Rights they
     are meant	to preserve, not indirectly, certain settled
     relationships. There  is a	 certain conflict in the two
     approaches, not inherently. because that was not meant,
     I am  quite sure.	But there  is that slight difficulty
     and naturally  when the  courts of	 the  land  have  to
     consider these  matters they have to lay stress more on
     the  Fundamental	Rights	 than	on   the   Directive
     Principles. The result is that the whole purpose behind
     the Constitution,	which was  meant  to  be  a  dynamic
     Constitution leading to a certain goal step
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_99">333</span>
     by step,  is somewhat  hampered  and  hindered  by	 the
     static element  A being  emphasized a  little more than
     the dynamic  element......... . If in the protection of
     individual liberty you protect also individual or group
     inequality, then  you  come  into	conflict  with	that
     Directive Principle  which wants, according to your own
     Constitution. a  gradual advance,	or let	us put it in
     another way,  not so  gradual but	more rapid  advance,
     whenever possible	to a State where ..  . there is less
     and less  inequality and more and more equality. If any
     kind of  an appeal to individual liberty and freedom is
     construed to  mean as  an appeal to the continuation of
     the   existing    inequality,   then   you	  get	into
     difficulties. Then you become static, unprogressive and
     cannot change  and you  cannot realize  the ideal of an
     egalitarian society which I hope most of us aim at"
</blockquote><p id="p_162">Parliament took	 the view that the constitutional obligation
in regard  to Directive	 Principles should  have  precedence
over  the   constitutional  obligation	 in  regard  to	 the
Fundamental  Rights   in  Articles   14	 and   19,   because
Fundamental  Rights   though  precious	 and  valuable	 for
maintaining the	 democratic way	 of life, have absolutely no
meaning for the poor, down trodden and economically backward
classes of  people who	unfortunately constitute the bull of
the people  of India  and the  only way in which Fundamental
Rights can  be made  meaningful for  them is by implementing
the Directive  Principles, for	the Directive Principles are
intended to  bring about  a socio-economic revolution and to
create a new socio-economic order where there will be social
and economic  justice for  all and  every one,	not  only  a
fortunate few  but the	teeming millions  of India, would be
able to participate in the fruits of freedom and development
and exercise  the Fundamental  Rights. Parliament  therefore
amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_857">Article 31C</a> with a view to providing that in case of
conflict Directive Principles shall have precedence over the
Fundamental Rights  in Articles	 14 and	 19 and	 the  latter
shall yield place to the former. The positive constitutional
command to  make laws  for giving  effect to  the  Directive
Principles shall  prevail over	the negative  constitutional
obligation  not	  to  encroach	on  the	 Fundamental  Rights
embodied in  Articles 14  and 19.  Parliament in making this
amendment was  moved  by  the  noble  philosophy  eloquently
expressed in  highly in spiring and evocative words. full of
passion and  feeling. by Chandrachud, J. (as he then was) in
his judgment  in Keshavananda  Bharati's case at page 991 of
the Report 1 may quote here what Chandrachud, J. (as he then
was) said  on that,  occasion, for it sets out admirably the
philosophy  which   inspired  Parliament   in  enacting	 the
amendment in <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_858">Article 31C</a> The learned Judge said:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_48">	  "I have  stated in the earlier part of my judgment
     that the  Constitution accords  a	place  of  pride  to
     Fundamental Rights and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_100">334</span>
     a place  of permanence  to the  Directive Principles. I
     stand  by	what  I	 have  said.  The  Preamble  of	 our
     Constitution recites  that the  aim of the Constitution
     is to  constitute India  into  a  Sovereign  Democratic
     Republic and  to secure to "all its citizens", Justice-
     Social, economic  and political-liberty  and  equality.
     Fundamental Rights	 which are  conferred and guaranteed
     by Part  III of the Constitution undoubtedly constitute
     the ark  of the  Constitution and	without them a man's
     reach will	 not exceed  his grasp.	 But  it  cannot  be
     overstressed that,	 the Directive	Principles of  State
     Policy  are   fundamental	in  the	 governance  of	 the
     country. What  is fundamental  in the governance of the
     country cannot  surely be less significant than what is
     fundamental in  the life  of an individual. That one is
     justiciable and  the other	 not may  show the intrinsic
     difficulties in  making the  latter enforceable through
     legal processes  but that	distinction does not bear on
     their relative  importance. An  equal right  of men and
     women to  an adequate means of livelihood; the right to
     obtain humane  conditions of  work	 ensuring  a  decent
     standard of  life and  full enjoyment  of leisure,	 and
     raising the  level of  health  and	 nutrition  are	 not
     matters for  compliance with  the Writ of a Court. As I
     look at  the provisions  of Parts IIl and IV, I feel no
     doubt That	 the basic  object of conferring freedoms on
     individuals is  the ultimate  achievement of the ideals
     set out  in Part  IV. A circumspect use of the freedoms
     guaranteed by  Part III is bound to subserve the common
     good  but	voluntary  submission  to  restraints  is  a
     philosopher's dream.  Therefore, <a href="/doc/76375/" id="a_859">article  37</a> enjoys the
     State to apply the Directive Principles in making laws.
     The freedom  of a few have them to be abridged in order
     to ensure	the freedom of all. It is in this sense that
     Parts,  III  and  IV,  as	said  by  Granville  Austin,
     together	constitute    "the   conscience	   of	 the
     constitution". The	 Nation stands	today at  the cross-
     roads of history and exchanging the time honoured place
     of the  phrase, may I say that the Directive Principles
     of State  Policy should  not be  permitted to become "a
     mere rope	of sand."  If  the  State  fails  to  create
     conditions in  which the  Fundamental freedoms could be
     enjoyed by	 all, the  freedom of the few will be at the
     mercy of the many and then all freedoms will vanish. In
     order,  therefore,	  to  preserve	their  freedom,	 the
     privileged few must part with a portion of it."
</blockquote><p id="p_163">This is	 precisely  what  Parliament  achieved	by  amending
<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_860">Article 3lC.</a>  Parliament made  the amendment  in <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_861">Article 31C</a>
because it  realised that  "if the  State  fails  to  create
conditions  in	which  the  fundamental	 freedoms  could  be
enjoyed by all, the freedom of the few will be at
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_101">335</span>
the mercy  of then  manly and then all freedoms will vanish"
and "in	  order,  therefore, to	 preserve their freedom, the
privileged few	must part  with a  portion of it." I find it
difficult to  understand how  it can at all be said that the
basic structure	 of the	 Constitution its  affected when for
evolving a  modus vivandi.  for resolving  a possible remote
conflict between  two  constitutional  mandates	 of  equally
fundamental  character,	  Parliament  decides	by  way	  of
amendment of  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_862">Article 31C</a> that in case of such conflict, the
constitutional mandate	in regard  to  Directive  Principles
shall prevail  over the	 constitutional mandate in regard to
the  Fundamental  Rights  under	 Articles  14  and  19.	 The
amendment  in  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_863">Article	31C</a>  far  from	damaging  the  basic
structure of  the Constitution strengthens and reenforces it
by giving  fundamental	importance  to	the  rights  of	 the
members of  the community  as against  the rights  of a	 few
individuals and furthering the objective of the Constitution
to build  an egalitarian  social order	where there  will be
social and  economic justice for all, every on including the
low visibility areas of humanity in the country will be able
to exercise  Fundamental  Rights  and  the  dignity  of	 the
individual and	the worth  of the  human  person  which	 are
cherished  values  will	 not  remain  merely  the  exclusive
privileges of a few but become a living really for the many.
Additionally, this  question may  also	be  looked  at	from
another point  of view	so far	as  the	 protection  against
violation, of  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_864">Article 14</a>  is concerned.  The  principle  of
egalitarianism, as I said before, is an essential element of
social and  economic justice  and, therefore, where a law is
enacted for,  giving effect  to a Directive Principle with a
view to	 promoting social and economic justice, it would not
run counter  to the  egalitarian  principle  and  would	 not
therefore be  violative of  the basic  structure, even if it
infringes  equality   before  the  law	in  its	 narrow	 and
formalistic sense.  No law which is really and genuinely for
giving effect  to a  Directive Principle can be inconsistent
with the  egalitarian principle and therefore the protection
granted	 to   it  under	 the  amended  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_865">Article	31C</a>  against
violation of  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_866">Article 14</a>  cannot have the effect of damaging
the  basic  structure.	I  do  not  therefore  see  how	 any
violation  of	the  basic  structure  is  involved  in	 the
amendment of  <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_867">Article 31C.</a>  In	fact.  Once  we	 accept	 the
proposition  laid   down  by   the  majority   decision	  in
Keshavananda Bharati's	case that  the unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_868">Article 31C</a>
was constitutionally  valid, it	 could only  be on the basis
that it did not damage or destroy the basic structure of the
Constitution and  moreover in  the order made in Waman Rao's
case on	 9th May,  1980 this  Court expressly  held that the
unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_869">Article  31C "</a>does  not damage any of the basic or
essential  features   of  the	Constitution  or  its  basic
structure," and if that be so, it is difficult to appreciate
how the amended
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_102">336</span>
<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_870">Article 31C</a>  can be  said  to  be  violative  of  the  basic
structure. If  the  exclusion  of  the	Fundamental  Rights.
embodied in  Articles 14  and 19  could be legitimately made
for giving  effect to  the Directive  Principles set  out in
clauses (b)  and (c)  of <a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_871">Article  39</a> without  affecting	 the
basic. structure. I fail to see why these Fundamental Rights
cannot be  excluded for giving effect to the other Directive
Principles. If	the constitutional  obligation in  regard to
the Directive  Principles set  out in clauses (b) and (c) of
<a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_872">Article 39</a> could be given precedence over the constitutional
obligation  in	 regard	 to  the  Fundamental  Rights  under
Articles 14 and 19, there is no reason in principle why such
precedence cannot  be given to the constitutional obligation
in regard.  to the other Directive Principles which stand on
the same  footing. It  would, to  my mind, be incongruous to
hold the  amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_873">Article  31C</a> invalid	when  the  unamended
Articles 31C  has been	held to	 be valid  by  the  majority
decision in  Keshavananda Bharati's  case and  by the  order
made on 9th May, 1980 in Waman Rao's case.
</p><p id="p_164">     Mr. Palkhiwala  on behalf	of the	petitioners  however
contended that	there was a vital difference between <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_874">Article
31C</a> as	it stood  prior to  its amendment  and	the  amended
<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_875">Article 31C</a>,  in as  much as under the unamended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_876">Article 31C</a>
only certain  categories of  laws, namely, those enacted for
the purpose of giving effect to the Directive Principles set
out in	clauses (b)  and (c)  of <a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_877">Article  39</a> were  protected
against challenge  under  Articles  14	and  19,  while	 the
position under	the amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_878">Article 31C</a> was that practically
every law  would be  immune from  such challenge  because it
would be  referable to	one Directive Principle or the other
and the	 result would  be that	the  Fundamental  Rights  in
Articles 14  and 19  would become meaningless and futile and
would, for  all practical  purposes, be	 dead letter  in the
Constitution. The  effect of giving immunity to laws enacted
for the	 purpose of  giving effect to any one or more of the
Directive Principles  would, according to Mr. Palkhiwala, be
in reality and substance to wipe out Articles 14 and 19 from
the Constitution  and that  would affect the basic structure
of the	Constitution. Mr. Palkhiwala also urge that the laws
which were  protected by  the amended <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_879">Article 31</a> C were laws
for giving  effect  to	the  policy  of	 the  State  towards
securing any  one or  more of  the Directive  Principles and
every law  would be   comprehended  within this	 description
since it  would not  be competent to the court to enter into
questions of policy and determine whether the policy adopted
in a  particular law  is calculated  to secure any Directive
Principle as claimed by the State. The use of the words "law
giving	effect	to  the	 policy	 of  the  State",  said	 Mr.
Palkhiwala,  introduced	 considerable  uncertainty  in	the,
yardstick with	which to  decide whether  a  particular	 law
falls within the description in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_103">337</span>
amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_880">Article	 31C</a> and widened the scope and applicability
of the	A amended  Article so as to include almost every law
claimed by  the State  to all  within such description. This
argument was  presented by  Mr. Palkhiwala  with great force
and persuasiveness  but it  does not  appeal to	 me  and  I.
cannot. accept	it. It	is clear  from the  Language of	 the
amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_881">Article	 31C</a> that  the law  which is  protected from
challenge under	 Articles 14  and 19 is law giving effect to
the policy  of the State towards securing all or any of this
Directive Principles. Whenever, therefore, any protection is
claimed for  a law  under the  amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_882">Article	31C</a>,  it  is
necessary for the court to examine whether this law has been
enacted for giving effect to the policy of the State towards
securing any  one or more of the Directive Principles and ii
is only if the court is so satisfied as a result of judicial
scrutiny, that the court would accord the protection of, the
amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_883">Article	 31C</a> to such law. Now it is undoubtedly true
that the  words used  in the amended Article are "law giving
effect to  the policy  of the  Stale", but the policy of the
State which  is contemplated  there is	the  policy  towards
securing one  or more of the Directive Principles. It is the
constitutional	obligation   of	 the  State  to	 secure	 the
Directive Principles  and that is the policy which the State
is required  to adopt and when a law is enacted in pursuance
of this	 policy on implementing the Directive Principles and
it seeks  to give effect to a Directive Principle, it would,
both from;  the point  of view	of grammar  and language, be
correct to  say that  it is  made for  giving effect  to the
policy	of   the  State	  towards  securing  such  Directive
Principle. The words "law giving effect to the policy of the
State" are not sc. wide as Mr. Palkhiwala would have it, but
in the context and collocation in which they occur, they are
intended to  refer only	 to a law enacted for the purpose on
implementing  or  giving  effect  to  one  or  more  of	 the
Directive Principles. The Court before which, protection for
a particular  law is  claimed under  the amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_884">Article 31C</a>
would therefore	 have to examine whether such law is enacted
for giving effect to a Directive Principle, for then only it
would have  the protection  of the  amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_885">Article 31C.</a> Now
the question  is what  should be  the  test  or	 determining
whether a  law is  enacted for	giving effect to a Directive
Principle. One	thing is  clear that  a claim to that effect
put forward  by the State would have no meaning or value; it
is the	court which  would have	 to determine  the question.
Again it  is not  enough that  there may  be some connection
between a  provision of	 the law  and a Directive Principle.
The concoction	has to	be between the law and the Directive
Principle  and	 it  must  be  a  real	HE  and	 substantial
connection. To	determine whether a law satisfies this test,
the court  would have to examine the pith and substance, the
true
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_104">338</span>
nature and  character of  the law as also its design and the
subject matter dealt with by it together with its object and
scope. If  on such  examination, the  court finds  that	 the
dominant object	 of  the  law  is  to  give  effect  to	 the
Directive Principle,  it would	accord protection to the law
under the  amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_886">Article  31C.</a> But if the court finds that
the law	 though passed	seemingly for  giving  effect  to  a
Directive Principle,  is, in  pith and	substance.  One	 for
accomplishing an  unauthorised purpose	unauthorised in	 the
sense of  not being covered by any Directive Principle, such
law would  not have  the protection  of the  amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_887">Article
31C.</a> To	 take  the  illustration  given	 by  Khanna,  J.  in
Keshavananda Bharati's	case' at  page 745 of the Report, "a
law might be made that as the old residents in the State are
economically backward  and those who have not resided in the
State for  more than  three  generations  have	an  affluent
business in the Stale or have acquired property in the State
they shall be deprived of their business and property with a
view to vest the same in the old residents of the State." It
may be	possible,  after  performing  what  I  may  call  an
archaeological	operation,   to	 discover  some	 remote	 the
tenuous connection  between  such  law	and  some  Directive
Principle, but	the dominant object of such law would be, as
pointed out  by Mr  H. M. Seeravi at Page 1559 of the second
Volume of  his book  on "Constitutional	 Law of	 India",  to
implement "the	policy of  the State to discriminate against
citizens who  hail from	 another State,	 and in	 a practical
sense, to  drive them  out of it", and such law would not be
protected by the amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_888">Article 31C.</a> Many such examples can
be given  but I	 do not	 wish to  unnecessarily burden	this
opinion. The  point I  wish to emphasize is that the amended
<a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_889">Article 31</a>  does not  give protection  to a  law  which	 has
merely some  remote or	tenuous connection  with a Directive
Principle. What	 is necessary  is that	there must be a real
and substantial	 connection and	 the dominant  object of the
law must  be to	 give effect to the Directive Principle, and
that is a matter which the court would have to decide before
any claim  for protection  under the amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_890">Article 31C</a> can
be allowed.
</p><p id="p_165">     There is  also one	 other aspect  which requires  to be
considered before protection can be given to a law under the
amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_891">Article 31C.</a> Even where the dominant object of a law
is to given effect to a Directive Principle. it is not every
provision af  the law which is entitled to claim protection.
The words  used in  the amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_892">Article 31C</a> are: "Law giving
effect to  the policy  of the  State towards securing all or
any of the principles laid down in Part IV" and these words,
on a  plain natural  construction. do  not include  all	 the
provisions on  the law	but only  those which give effect to
the Directive
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_105">339</span>
Principle.  But	 the  question	is  how	 to  identify  these
provisions giving effect to the Directive Principle in order
to accord to them the protection of the amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_893">Article 31C.</a>
The answer  to this question is analogically provided by the
decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1258563/" id="a_894">Akadasi Padhan v. State of Orissa</a>.
There  the   question  was   as	 to  what  was	the  precise
connotation of	the  expression	 la  relating  to"  a  State
monopoly which occurs in <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_895">Article 19(6).</a> This Court held that
"a law	relating to" a State monopoly cannot include all the
provisions contained in such law but it must be construed to
mean, "the  law relating  to the  monopoly in its absolutely
essential features"  and it  is only those provisions of the
law "which  are	 basically  and	 essentially  necessary	 for
creating the  State monopoly" which are protected by <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_896">Article
19(6).</a>	This  view  was	 reiterated  in	 several  subsequent
decisions of  this Court which include inter alia Rashbihari
Pande etc. v. State of Orissa, Vrajla Manilal &amp; Co. &amp; ors v.
State of  Madhya Pradesh  &amp; Ors and R. C. Cooper v. Union of
India. I  would adopt  the same approach in the construction
of <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_897">Article  31C</a> and hold that it is not every provision of a
statute which , has been enacted with the dominant object of
giving effect  to a Directive Principle, that it entitled to
protection. but	 only those  provisions of the statute which
are basically and essentially necessary for giving effect to
the. Directive	Principles are	protected under	 the amended
<a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_898">Article 31C.</a>  If there	are  any  other	 provisions  in	 the
statute which  do not  fall within this category, they would
not be	entitled to protection and their validity would have
to be  judged	reference to  Articles	14  and	 19.  Where,
therefore, protection  is claimed  in respect  of a  statute
under the amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_899">Article 31C</a>, the court would have first to
determine whether  there is  real and substantial connection
between	 the   law  and	  a  Directive	 Principle  and	 the
predominant object  of the  law is  to give  effect to	such
Directive Principle and if the answer to this question is in
the affirmative, the court would then have to consider which
are the	 provisions of	the law	 basically  and	 essentially
necessary for  giving effect  to the Directive Principle and
give protection	 of the	 amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_900">Article  31C</a> only  to those
provisions. The question whether any particular provision of
the law	 is basically  and essentially	necessary for giving
effect to  the Directive Principle. would depend, to a large
extent, on  how closely	 and integrally	 such  provision  is
connected  with	  the  implementation	on   the   Directive
Principle. If the court finds That a particular provision is
subsidiary
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_106">340</span>
or incidental  or not  essentially and	integrally connected
with the  implementation of the Directive Principle or is of
such a	nature that,  though seemingly a part of the general
design of  the main  provisions of the statute, its dominant
object is  to achieve  an unauthorised purpose, it would not
enjoy the protection of the amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_901">Article 31C</a> and would be
liable to be struck down as invalid if it violates.  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_902">Article
14</a> or 19
     These  considerations  which  I  have  discussed  above
completely answer  some of  the difficulties  raised by	 Mr.
Palkhiwala. He	said that  if the  amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_903">Article  31C</a> were
held to	 be valid,  even provision,  like Section  23(e) and
24(1)(a) of  the Bombay	 Prohibition Act,  1949 C which were
struck down in <a href="/doc/334293/" id="a_904">State of Bombay v. F. N. Balsari</a> as violating
freedom of  speech guaranteed  under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_905">Article 19(1)(a</a>), would
have to be held to be valid. I do not think that freedom and
democracy in  this  country  would  be	imperilled  if	such
provisions were	 held valid. In fact, after the amendment of
<a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_906">Article 19(2)</a>  by the  Constitution  (First  Amendment	Act,
1951, it  is highly arguable that both such provisions would
fall within  the protection  of <a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_907">Article	 19(2)</a> and  would be
valid. And  even otherwise,  it is  difficult to see how any
violation of  the basic structure is involved if a provision
of  a	law  prohibiting   a  person   from  commending	 any
intoxicant, the	 consumption or use of which is forbidden by
the  law  (except  under  a  licence  issued  by  the  State
Government)  is	 protected  against  infraction	 of  <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_908">Article
19(1)(a).</a> The  position would  perhaps	be  different  if  a
provision is  introduced in  the <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_909">Prohibition Act</a> saying that
no  one	 shall	speak  against	the  prohibition  policy  or
propagate for the repeal of the <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_910">Prohibition Act</a> or plead for
removal of  <a href="/doc/1551554/" id="a_911">Article 47</a>	from the Directive Principle. Such a
provision may  not and	perhaps would not be entitled to the
protection of  the amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_912">Article 31C</a>, even though it finds
a place	 in the <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_913">Prohibition Act</a>, because its dominant object
would not  be to  give effect  to the Directive Principle in
<a href="/doc/1551554/" id="a_914">Article 47</a>  but to  stifle freedom of speech in respect of a
particular matter  and it  may run  the risk of being struck
down as	 violative of  <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_915">Article 19(1)(a).</a>  If the Court finds
that even  in a	 statute enacted  for  giving  effect  to  a
Directive Principle,  there is	a  provision  which  is	 not
essentially and integrally connected with the implementation
of the	Directive Principle  or the dominant object of which
is to  achieve an  unauthorised purpose, it would be outside
the protection	of the amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_916">Article 31C</a> and would have to
meet the challenge of Articles 14 and 19.
</p><p id="p_166">     Lastly, I	must consider the argument of Mr. Palkhiwala
that almost any and every law would be within the protection
of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_107">341</span>
amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_917">Article	 31C</a> because  it would	be referable to some
Directive Principle  or	 the  other.  I	 think	this  is  an
argument of  despair. Articles	39 to  51 contain  Directive
Principles referring  to certain  specific objectives and in
order that a law should be for giving effect to one of those
Directive Principles.  there would  have to  be a  real	 and
substantial connection	between the  law  and  the  specific
objective set  out in  such Directive  Principle. Obviously,
the objectives	set out	 in these Directive Principles being
specific and limited, every law made by a legislature in the
country	 cannot	  possibly  have   a  real  and	 substantial
connection  with   one	or   the  other	 of  these  specific
objectives. It	is only a limited number of laws which would
have a real and substantial connection with one or the other
of  specific   objectives  contained   in  these   Directive
Principles and	any and every law would not come within this
category. Mr.  Palkhiwala then	contended that in any event,
the Directive  Principle contained  in <a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_918">Article	38</a> was	very
wide and  it  would  cover  almost  any	 law  enacted  by  a
legislature. This  contention  is  also	 not  well  founded.
<a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_919">Article	 38</a>   is  a   general  article	which  stresses	 the
obligation of the State to establish a social order in which
justice-social, economic  and political shall inform all the
institutions of national life. It no doubt talks of the duty
of the	State to promote the welfare of the people and there
can be	no doubt  that standing by itself this might cover a
fairly wide  area but it may be noted that the objective set
out in the Article is not merely promotion of the welfare of
the people,  but there	is a  further requirement  that	 the
welfare of the people is to be promoted by the State, not in
any manner  it likes,  not according  to its whim and fancy,
but for	 securing and protecting a particular type of social
order and  that social	order should be such as would ensure
social, economic  and political	 justice  for  all.  Social,
economic and  political justice	 is the objective set out in
the Directive  Principle  in  <a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_920">Article  38</a>  and	it  is	this
objective which is made fundamental in the governance of the
country and  which the	State is laid under an obligation to
realise. This  Directive Principle  forms the  base on which
the entire  structure of  the Directive Principles is reared
and social,  economic and political justice is the signature
tune  of  the  other  Directive	 Principles.  The  Directive
Principles set out in the subsequent Articles following upon
<a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_921">Article 38</a>  merely particularise  and  set  out	 facets	 and
aspects of  the ideal  of  social,  economic  and  political
justice	 articulated   in  <a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_922">Article   38.</a>  Mr.	Palkhiwala's
complaint was  not directed  against the  use of  the  words
'political justice'  in <a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_923">Article	 38</a> but	 his contention	 was
that the  concept of social and economic justice referred to
in that	 Article was  so wide  that almost  any	 legislation
could come within it. I do not agree. The concept
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_108">342</span>
of social  and economic	 Justice may  not be  very  easy  of
definition but its broad contours are to be found in some of
the  provisions	  of  the  Fundamental	Rights	and  in	 the
Directive Principles  and whenever a question arises whether
a legislation  is for  giving effect  to social and economic
justice, it  is with  reference to these provisions that the
question would	have to	 be determined.	 There is nothing so
vague or  indefinite about the concept of social or economic
justice	 that  almost  any  kind  of  legislation  could  be
justified under	 it. Moreover,	where a claim for protection
is made in respect of a legislation on the ground that it is
enacted for  giving effect  to a  Directive  Principle,	 the
Directive Principle  to which  it is  claimed to  be related
would not  ordinarily be the general Directive Principle set
out in	<a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_924">Article	 38</a>,  but  would  be  one  of  the  specific
Directive Principles  set out  in the  succeeding  Articles,
because as  I said  before, these  latter particularise	 the
concept of  social  and	 economic  justice  referred  to  in
<a href="/doc/1673816/" id="a_925">Article 38.</a>  I cannot therefore subscribe to the proposition
that if	 the Amendment	in <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_926">Article  31C</a> were  held valid, it
would  have   the  effect   of	protecting   every  possible
legislation under  the sun  and that  would  in	 effect	 and
substance  wipe	  out  Articles	  14  and   19	 from,	 the
Constitution. This  is a tall and extreme argument for which
I  find	  no  justification   in  the	provisions  of	 the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_167">     I	would	therefore  declare   Section   55   of	 the
Constitution  (Forty   second  <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_927">Amendment)  Act</a>,	 1976  which
inserted  sub-sections	 (4)  and  (5)	in  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_928">Article  368</a>  as
unconstitutional and  void on the ground that it damages the
basic structure	 of the	 Constitution and  goes	 beyond	 the
amending power of Parliament. But so far as Section 4 of the
Constitution   (Forty-second   Amendment)   Act,   1976	  is
concerned. I  hold that, on the interpretation placed on the
amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_929">Article 31C</a> by me, it does not damage or destroy the
basic structure	 of  the  Constitution	and  is	 within	 the
amending power	of Parliament  and I would therefore declare
the amended <a href="/doc/198382/" id="a_930">Article 31C</a> to be constitutional and valid.
</p><p id="p_168">     I have  also given	 my reasons  in	 this  judgment	 for
subscribing to	the order  dated 9th May, 1980 made in Waman
Rao's case and this judgment ill so far as it sets out those
reasons will  be formally  pronounced by me when Waman Rao's
case is set down on board for judgment.
