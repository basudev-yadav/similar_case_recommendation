<p id="p_3">By the impugned judgment a learned Single Judge of the 
Delhi High Court while upholding that the respondent-
accused's conviction under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_1">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, 
1988 (in short the 'Act'), was in order, further held him to 
be entitled to the benefits available under <a href="/doc/755395/" id="a_2">Section 360</a> of 
the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short the 'Code').   
The State has questioned legality of latter view.
</p>
<p id="p_4">Factual background in short is as follows :
</p>
<p id="p_5">Respondent-accused was serving as Commercial 
Superintendent of the erstwhile DESU office.  Proceedings 
under the Act were initiated against him for alleged 
commission of offence punishable under <a href="/doc/324254/" id="a_3">Sections 7</a>, <a href="/doc/1259316/" id="a_4">13(2)</a> 
read with <a href="/doc/1101716/" id="a_5">Section 13(1)(d)</a> of the Act for demanding and 
accepting bribe of Rs.1,500/- from a consumer Mahabir Prasad 
(hereinafter referred to as the 'complainant'). After trial 
by the Special Judge, Delhi, he was found guilty and 
sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 20 months and 
a fine of Rs.2,000/- with default stipulation for offence 
under <a href="/doc/324254/" id="a_6">Section 7</a> and <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_7">40</a> months and a fine of Rs.2,000/- with 
default stipulation for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1259316/" id="a_8">section 
13(2)</a> of the Act. An appeal bearing Criminal Appeal No. 471 
of 1999 was filed before Delhi High Court. By the impugned 
judgment the High Court held that the offences were clearly 
made out, and upheld convictions, but extended benefits of 
<a href="/doc/755395/" id="a_9">Section 360</a> of the Code taking note of the fact that the 
respondent-accused has remained in custody for about 22 
days. It was held that bar relating to the applicability of 
<a href="/doc/167447/" id="a_10">Probation of Offenders Act</a>, 1958(in short the `<a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_11">Probation 
Act</a>') was not operative in respect of offences under the Act 
though there was a prohibition under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_12">Prevention of 
Corruption Act</a>, 1947 (in short the ' old Act'). It was noted 
that the minimum sentence prescribed was one year. 
Purportedly taking into account the age, character, 
behaviour and the situation in which the offence was found 
committed, the respondent-accused was directed to be 
released on probation of good conduct instead of suffering 
sentence.
</p>
<p id="p_6">Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the 
approach of the High Court is clearly erroneous.  This Court 
has clearly held that where a statute prescribed a minimum 
sentence the Court cannot reduce the sentence any further. 
Reference was made to a decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/492051/" id="a_13">State of J 
&amp; K vs. Vinay Nanda</a> [2001(2) SCC 504].  The severity of the 
offence and the chain reaction of any offence under the Act 
generated clearly makes <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_14">Section 360</a> inapplicable. The 
statutory object cannot be diluted by indirectly reducing 
the minimum sentence. By operation of <a href="/doc/556678/" id="a_15">Section 8</a> of the 
General Clauses Act, 1897 (in short the '<a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_16">General Clauses 
Act</a>'), the bar as contained in the old Act clearly applies 
to the Act also.
</p> 
<p id="p_7">In response, learned counsel for the respondent-accused 
submitted that the High Court having invoked powers under a 
beneficial provision i.e. <a href="/doc/755395/" id="a_17">Section 360</a> of the Code no 
interference is called for while exercising jurisdiction 
under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_18">Article 136</a> of the Constitution of India, 1950 (In 
short the 'Constitution').  In the absence of any bar in the 
Act for extending the benefits under the provisions of 
<a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_19">Probation Act</a> provisions of the said Act could have also 
been applied, as has been noted by the High Court.  In any 
event <a href="/doc/755395/" id="a_20">Section 360</a> of the Code has been rightly applied by 
the High Court by taking note of the extenuating 
circumstances. <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_21">Section 18</a> of the Probation Act stipulated 
that the Act was inapplicable to offences under the Old Act.  
Specific reference was made to <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_22">Section 5(2)</a> of the old Act 
which corresponds to <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_23">Section 13</a> of the Act.  But no change 
was made in the <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_24">Probation Act</a> after the Act was enacted and 
brought into force in 1988. Reference has been made to 
decisions of this Court in <a href="/doc/209971/" id="a_25">S. Natarajan vs. State of Mysore</a> 
[1979 (4) SCC 542], in <a href="/doc/1595290/" id="a_26">N.M. Parthasarathy vs. State</a> by 
S.P.E. [1992 (2) SCC 198] and in <a href="/doc/835358/" id="a_27">Balaram Swain vs. State of 
Orissa</a> [1991 suppl. (1) SCC 510] to contend that after long 
passage of time it would not be proper to send the accused 
back to jail.
</p>
<p id="p_8">Much stress was laid on the non-amendment of the 
<a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_28">Probation Act</a> which referred to the old Act and not the 
present Act. It was submitted that since there has been no 
corresponding change in the <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_29">Probation Act</a>, therefore, the 
provisions of said Act cannot be applied to cases under the 
Act. The argument overlooks the principles underlying 
<a href="/doc/556678/" id="a_30">Section 8</a> of the General Clauses Act. When an Act is 
repealed and re-enacted unless a different intention is 
expressed by the legislature, the reference to the repealed 
Act would be considered as reference to the provisions so 
re-enacted.     
</p>
<p id="p_9">	The decisions referred to by learned counsel for the 
respondent to show that this Court had on account of delay 
extended benefits under <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_31">Probation Act</a> or <a href="/doc/755395/" id="a_32">Section 360</a> of the 
Code cannot have any precedent value being without reference 
to statutory bars and shall have to be treated as having 
been rendered per incuriam. 
</p>
<p id="p_10">The commission of the offending Act was on 20.1.95 by 
the respondent who was an employee of the Delhi Vidyut Board 
and by a judgment dated 8.9.99 in C.C.No.59/99, the Special 
Judge Delhi convicted the respondent under <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_33">Section 7</a> of the 
Act and passed a sentence of 20 months RI in addition to the 
payment of a fine of Rs. 2,000/- with a default stipulation.  
Further under <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_34">Section 13(2)</a> of the Act he was also convicted 
and sentenced to 40 months RI, in addition to the payment of 
a fine of Rs.2,000/- with a default stipulation.  The claim 
of the respondent for extending the benefit of <a href="/doc/755395/" id="a_35">Section 360</a> 
of the Code, which found favour of acceptance with the 
learned Single Judge in the High Court seems to have been 
for the reasons that unlike the provisions of the old Act, 
which prohibited release of the convict on probation, the 
Act did not contain any such embargo and taking into certain 
extenuating circumstances noticed, (a) that the demand and 
acceptance was of a paltry sum of Rs. 1500/-, (b) that the 
respondent retired during trial itself from service, (c) 
that he had turned 64 years of age, (d) that his family 
circumstances were unhappy and he remained in custody for 22 
days. The above facts were in the opinion of the learned 
Single Judge sufficient for extending the benefit of 
probation.  It is this approach and the conclusions that are 
under challenge in this appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_11">	The Parliament has enacted the <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_36">Probation Act</a> and 
<a href="/doc/174546551/" id="a_37">Section 1(3)</a> thereof stipulated that it shall come into 
force in a State on such date as the State Government may by 
notification in the official gazette appoint. By a 
notification in the Gazette of India dated 23.12.1961 this 
Act was made to apply and enforceable in the whole State of 
Delhi w.e.f. 29.12.1960. <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_38">Section 19</a> of this Act lays down 
that, subject to the provisions of <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_39">Section 18</a>, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_40">Section 562</a> 
of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 (hereinafter referred 
to as `Old Code') shall cease to apply to the States or 
parts in which the <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_41">Probation Act</a> is brought into force.  Old 
Code came to be repealed and replaced by<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_42"> the Code</a> and 
<a href="/doc/755395/" id="a_43">Section 360</a> of the Code is the corresponding provision to 
<a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_44">Section 562</a> in the Old Code. <a href="/doc/198117/" id="a_45">In Bishnu Deo Shaw v. State of 
West Bengal</a> (AIR 1979 SC 964), this Court ruled that <a href="/doc/755395/" id="a_46">Section 
360</a> of the Code re enacts in substance Section 562 of the 
Old Code. That apart <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_47">Section 18</a> of the Probation Act 
stipulates that nothing in the said Act shall affect the 
provisions of <a href="/doc/950075/" id="a_48">Section 31</a> of the Reformatory Schools Act, 
1897 or sub-Section (2) of Section 5 of the Old Act.  This 
Court in the decisions reported in <a href="/doc/763947/" id="a_49">Isher Das vs. The State 
of Punjab</a> (AIR 1972 SC 1295) and <a href="/doc/1790376/" id="a_50">Som Nath Puri vs. State of 
Rajasthan</a> (AIR 1972 SC 1490) has held specifically adverting 
to <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_51">Section 18</a> that the said provision renders the <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_52">Probation 
Act</a> inapplicable to an offence under sub-Section (2) of 
Section 5 of the Old Act, by expressly excluding its 
operation. <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_53">Section 13</a> of the re-enacted Act is the 
corresponding provision to Section 5(2) of the Old Act.
</p>
<p id="p_12">	The impact of the above provisions, in view of the new 
enactment<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_54"> of the Code</a> and the Act requires and has to be 
considered in the light of <a href="/doc/556678/" id="a_55">Section 8</a> of the General Clauses 
Act which reads as under:
</p>
<p id="p_13">"8. Construction of references to repealed 
enactments. [(1) Where this Act, or any 
[<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_56">Central Act</a>] or Regulation made after the 
commencement of this Act, repeals and re-
</p><p id="p_14">enacts, with or without modification, any 
provision of a former enactment, then 
references in any other enactment or in any 
instrument to the provision so repealed 
shall, unless a different intention appears, 
be construed as references to the provision 
so re-enacted.
</p>
<p id="p_15">[(2) [Where before the fifteenth day of 
August, 1947, any Act of Parliament of the 
United Kingdom repealed and re-enacted], 
with or without modification, any provision 
of a former enactment, then references in 
any [<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_57">Central Act</a>] or in any Regulation or 
instrument to the provision so repealed 
shall, unless a different intention appears, 
be construed as references to the provision 
so re-enacted.]"
</p>
<p id="p_16">	The object of the said provision, obvious and patently 
made known is that where any Act or Regulation is repealed 
and re-enacted, references in any other enactment to 
provisions of the repealed former enactment must be read and 
construed as references to the re-enacted new provisions, 
unless a different intention appears.  In similar situations 
this Court had placed reliance upon <a href="/doc/556678/" id="a_58">Section 8</a> of the General 
Clauses Act to tide over the situation.  In New Central Jute 
Mills Co. Ltd. vs. The Astt. Collector of Central Excise, 
Allahabad and others (AIR 1971 SC 454), this Court held it 
to be possible to read the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_59">Customs Act</a>, 
1962 in the place of Sea Customs Act, 1878 found mentioned 
in <a href="/doc/121712332/" id="a_60">Section 12</a> of the Central Excise and <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_61">Salt Act</a>, 1944.  <a href="/doc/1990704/" id="a_62">In 
State of Bihar vs S.K. Roy</a> (AIR 1966 SC 1995), this Court 
held that by virtue of <a href="/doc/556678/" id="a_63">Section 8</a> of the General Clauses Act, 
references to the definition of the word 'employer' in 
Clause (e) of Section 2 of the Indian Mines Act, 1923 made 
in Coal Mines Provident Fund and Bonus Schemes Act, 1948 
should be construed as references to the definition of 
'owner' in Clause (1) of <a href="/doc/276791/" id="a_64">Section 2</a> of the Mines Act, 1952, 
which repealed and re-enacted 1923 Act. Consequently, the 
references to Section 562 of Old Code in <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_65">Section 19</a> of the 
Probation Act and to Section 5(2) of the Old Act in <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_66">Section 
18</a> of the Probation Act, respectively have to be inevitably 
read as references to their corresponding provisions in the 
newly enacted Code and the Act. Consequently, for the 
conviction under <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_67">Section 13(2)</a> of the Act the principles 
enunciated under the <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_68">Probation Act</a> cannot be extended at all 
in view of the mandate contained in <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_69">Section 18</a> of the said 
Act.  So far as <a href="/doc/755395/" id="a_70">Section 360</a> of the Code is concerned, on and 
from the date of extension and enforcement of the provisions 
of the <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_71">Probation Act</a> to Delhi powers under Section 562 of 
the Old Code and after its repeal and replacement powers 
under <a href="/doc/755395/" id="a_72">Section 360</a> of the Code, cannot be invoked or applied 
at all, as has been done in the case on hand.  The view 
taken to the contra is not legally sustainable and cannot 
have our approval.
</p>
<p id="p_17">	That apart <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_73">Section 7</a> as well as <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_74">Section 13</a> of the Act 
provide for a minimum sentence of six months and one year 
respectively in addition to the maximum sentences as well as 
imposition of fine.  <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_75">Section 28</a> further stipulates that the 
provisions of the Act shall be in addition to and not in 
derogation of any other law for the time being in force.  In 
the case of <a href="/doc/1109851/" id="a_76">Superintendent Central Excise, Bangalore vs 
Bahubali</a>, (AIR 1979 SC 1271), while dealing with Rule 126-P 
(2) (ii) of the Defence of India Rules which prescribed a 
minimum sentence and Section 43 of the Defence of India Act, 
1962 almost similar to the purport enshrined in <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_77">Section 28</a> 
of the Act in the context of a claim for granting relief 
under the <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_78">Probation Act</a>, this Court observed that in cases 
where a specific enactment, enacted after the <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_79">Probation Act</a> 
prescribes a minimum sentence of imprisonment, the 
provisions of <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_80">Probation Act</a> cannot be invoked if the special 
Act contains any provision to enforce the same without 
reference to any other Act containing a provision, in 
derogation of the special enactment, there is no scope for 
extending the benefit of the <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_81">Probation Act</a> to the accused.  
Unlike, the provisions contained in <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_82">Section 5(2)</a> proviso of 
the Old Act providing for imposition of a sentence lesser 
than the minimum sentence of one year therein for any 
"special reasons" to be recorded in writing, the Act did 
not carry any such power to enable the Court concerned to 
show any leniency below the minimum sentence stipulated.  
Consequently, the learned Single Judge in the High Court 
committed a grave error of law in extending the benefit of 
probation even under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_83"> the Code</a>.  At the same time we may 
observe that though the reasons assigned by the High Court 
to extend the benefits of probation may not be relevant, 
proper or special reasons for going below the minimum 
sentence prescribed  which in any event is wholly 
impermissible, as held supra, we take them into account to 
confine the sentence of imprisonment to the minimum of six 
months under <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_84">Section 7</a> and minimum of one year under <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_85">Section 
13(2)</a> of the Act, both the sentences to run concurrently.  
So far as the levy of fine in addition made by the learned 
Trial Judge with a default clause on two separate courts are 
concerned, they shall remain unaffected and are hereby 
confirmed.
</p>
<p id="p_18">	The appeal shall stand allowed, but with due 
modification of the sentences of imprisonment alone, as 
indicated supra.  The respondent shall surrender to custody 
to undergo the remaining period of sentence.
</p>
