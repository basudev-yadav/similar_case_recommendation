HEADNOTE:
The  petitioners  were dealers carrying on business  in	 the
City  of  Madras  in the sale and  purchase  of	 yarn.	 The
dealers in the State of Andhra used to place orders for	 the
purchase  of yarn with the petitioners in Madras, where	 the
contracts  were concluded and the goods were  delivered	 ex-
godown at Madras and thereafter despatched to the purchasers
who  would  take delivery of them within their	State.	 The
present	 dispute related to sales in which property  in	 the
goods sold passed outside the State of
1423
Andhra, but the goods themselves were actually delivered  as
a  result  of the sale for consumption	within	that  State.
After the coming into force of the Constitution of India the
President  in the exercise of the powers conferred  by	<a href="/doc/251565/" id="a_3">Art.
372(2)</a>	made Adaptation Orders with reference to  the  Sales
Tax  Laws  of  all the States, and  as	regards	 the  Madras
General	 Sales	Tax  Act,  1939,  he  issued  an   Amendment
inserting  a  new section,<a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_4"> S. 22</a> in that Act,  which  was  a
verbatim reproduction of the Explanation to <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_5">Art. 286  (i)(a)</a>
of  the	 Constitution.	 Oil July 13,  1954,  the  Board  of
Revenue (Commercial Taxes) in the State of Andhra, acting on
the  decision  in  <a href="/doc/424874/" id="a_6">The State of Bombay and  another  v.	 The
United Motors (India) Ltd., and others</a>, [1953] S.C.R.  1069,
called upon dealers in the State of Madras to submit returns
of their turnover of sales in which goods were delivered  in
the  State of Andhra for consumption.  Thereupon they  filed
the  present  petitions under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_7">Art. 32</a>  Of  the	Constitution
challenging the demand on the grounds, inter alia, that	 the
sales  proposed to be taxed were inter-State sales and	that
they  were  immune from taxation under <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_8">Art.  286(2)</a>  Of	 the
Constitution.  While the petitions were pending the  Supreme
Court  pronounced on September 6, 1955, its judgment in	 The
Be  gal <a href="/doc/608874/" id="a_9">Immunity Company Limited v. The State of  Bihar	 and
others</a>,	 [1055]	 2  S.C.R.  603,  according  to	 which	 the
petitioners  were not liable to be taxed.  But before  final
orders were passed on the petitions Parliament passed  <a href="/doc/1920625/" id="a_10">Sales
Tax Laws Validation Act</a>, 1956,<a href="/doc/1573122/" id="a_11"> S. 2</a> whereof provided that no
law of a State imposing or authorising the imposition of tax
on  inter-State	 sales during the period  between  April  1,
1951, and September 6, 1955, shall be deeme to be invalid or
ever to have been invalid merely by reason of the fact	that
the sales took place in the course of the inter-State trade.
That section further provided that taxes levied or collected
on such sales during the aforesaid period shall be deemed to
have  been  validly levied or collected.  It  was  the	con-
tention	 of  the  State	 of Andhra that	 by  reason  of	 the
aforesaid provision it had the right to impose tax on inter-
State sales during the aforesaid period.  On the other	hand
the petitioners contended, inter alia, that (I) S. 22 Of the
Madras	General Sales Tax Laws Validation Act,	1956,  which
gave validity to laws which imposed a tax, did not authorise
the  imposition, (2) the <a href="/doc/1920625/" id="a_12">Sales Tax Laws Validation  Act</a>	 was
ultra vires <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_13">Art. 286(2</a><a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_14">), (3)</a> S. 22 of the Madras Act was not
a  "law	 of  a State" within <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_15">Art. 286(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/1573122/" id="a_16"> S.  2</a>  of	 the
impugned  Act,	(4) the impugned Act only  validated  levies
already	 made and did not authorise the initiation of  fresh
proceedings  for  imposing  tax,  (5) <a href="/doc/1920625/" id="a_17"> S.  22</a>  having	been
unconstitutional when it was enacted and therefore void,  no
proceedings  could be taken thereunder on the basis  of	 the
<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_18">Validation Act</a>, as the effect of unconstitutionality of	 the
law  was to efface it out of the statute book, and  (6)	 the
proposed levy was bad as infringing the Rule which  provided
that the sale of yarn could be taxed only at one point.	  It
was  also contended that under the Constitution it was	only
the  Parliament	 that has the competence to  impose  tax  on
inter-State sales and that the <a href="/doc/1920625/" id="a_19">Sales Tax Laws Validation Act</a>
1424
was  bad in that it gave validity, to the laws of the  State
to impose the tax :
Held  (Sarkar  J.  dissenting), that S.	 22  of	 the  Madras
General Sales Tax Act, 1939, did in fact impose a tax on the
class of sales covered by the Explanation to <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_20">Art.  286(1)(a)</a>
but  that  it  was conditional on the ban  enacted  on	<a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_21">Art.
286(2)</a>	being  lifted  by  law	of  Parliament	as  provided
therein, and that it was therefore validated by<a href="/doc/1573122/" id="a_22"> S. 2</a> of	 the
Sales Tax Laws Validation Act, 1956.
The construction put upon the Explanation to <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_23">Art.  286(1)(a)</a>
of the Constitution in The Bengal Immunity Company case that
it merely prohibited the outside States from imposing a	 tax
on the class of sales falling within the Explanation and did
not  confer on the delivery State any power to impose a	 tax
on  such sales has no application to a taxing statute  of  a
State  the object of which was primarily to confer power  on
the State to levy and collect tax.
<a href="/doc/1920625/" id="a_24">Section	 22</a> and S. 2(h) of the Madras General Sales Tax	 Act
must  be  read	together as' defining the  sales  which	 are
taxable under the Act.

Held (Per S. R. Das, C. J., Venkatarama Aiyar, S. K. Das and

Act</a>,  1956, is in substance one lifting the ban on  taxation
of interState sales and is within the authority conferred on
Parliament  tinder <a href="/doc/1858991/" id="a_31">Art. 2 6(2)</a> and further that	 under	that
provision it was competent to Parliament to enact a law with
retrospective operation.

(2)  the  Adaptation Order made by the President under	<a href="/doc/251565/" id="a_33">Art.
372(2)</a> is valid and is not open to attack on the ground that
it goes beyond the limits contemplated by that Article.
(3)the expression " law of a State " in <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_34">Art. 286(2)</a> and<a href="/doc/1573122/" id="a_35"> S. 2</a>
of the Sales Tax Laws Validation Act means whatever operates
as  law in the State, and that S. 22 of the  Madras  General
Sales Tax Act is a law within those enactments.
1425
(4) <a href="/doc/1573122/" id="a_36"> s. 2</a> of the Sales Tax Laws Validation Act validates not
only  the levies already collected but also  authorises	 the
imposition  of tax on sales falling within  the	 Explanation
which  had taken place during the period specified in<a href="/doc/1573122/" id="a_37"> S.  2</a>.
<a href="/doc/1920625/" id="a_38">The  Act</a>  is  not a temporary Act though  its  operation  is
limited to sales taking place within a specified period.
Dial Das v. P. S. Talwalkay, A.I.R. 1937 Bom. 71, in so	 far
as  it held that it was not competent to the State to  start
fresh proceedings for assessment, disapproved.
(5)  though  S. 22 of the Madras General Sales Tax  Act	 was
unconstitutional when enacted the effect of the	 unconstitu-
tionality  was	not to efface it out of	 the  statute  book.
Unconstitutionality might arise either because the law is in
respect	 of  a	matter	not within  the	 competence  of	 the
legislature  or because the matter itself being	 within	 the
competence,   its  provisions  offend  some   constitutional
restrictions.	 Which	a  law	which  is  not	within	 the
competence of the legislature is a nullity a law on a  topic
within	its competence but repugnant to	 any  constitutional
prohibition  is only unenforceable.  In the latter class  of
legislation  when  once the  constitutional  prohibition  is
removed	 the law becomes enforceable  without  re-enactment.
Where an enactment is unconstitutional in part but valid  as
to  the rest, assuming that the two portions are  severable,
it  cannot  be held to have been wiped out  of	the  statute
book, as admittedly it must remain there for the purpose  of
enforcement of the valid portion.  Moreover in the view that
the  impugned  law is conditional legislation it  cannot  be
held to have become non est.

(6)  under   Entry   42	 in  List  1,  Sch.   VII   of	 the
Constitution, legislation with respect to inter-State  trade
and  commerce  is  exclusively	within	the  competence	  of
Parliament.  Under Entry 54, List 11, taxes on sale of goods
is within the exclusive competence of the State Legislature,
and  reading  the  two Entries together	 Entry	42  must  be
construed as excluding the power to tax sale of goods.	 The
scheme	of  the	 Entries in the Lists is  that	taxation  is
regarded  as  a distinct matter and is separately  set	out.
Entry  42,  List  1,  must therefore  be  construed  as	 not
including the power to impose tax on inter-State sales.
(7)  the proposed imposition does not infringe the rule that
the sales of yarns should be subject to taxation at a single
point  because the proposed levy is by the State  of  Andhra
and the rule in question prohibits only multiple taxation in
the same State.
Per  Sarkar  J.-The  Sales Tax Act does	 not  authorise	 the
taxation  of a sale under which goods are delivered  in	 the
State of
1426
Andhra	but the property in them passes outside that  State.
The  Explanation  in<a href="/doc/1920625/" id="a_42"> S. 22</a> of the Act  only  contemplates  a
State  other  than Andhra as the State inside which  a	sale
shall  be deemed to have taken place.  The words "  for	 the
purposes  of  clause (a)(i) " have the same meaning  in	 the
Explanation in <a href="/doc/1232505/" id="a_43">Art. 286(1)</a> as in the Explanation in<a href="/doc/1920625/" id="a_44"> S. 22</a> of
the  Act, and the present case is not  distinguishable	from
the  decision in <a href="/doc/608874/" id="a_45">The Bengal Immunity Company Limited v.	 The

the petitions.	]
K.   S. Krishnaswami Iyengar, N. Srinivasan and R.     Ganapathy
Iyer, for the petitioners.  The Andhra (Madras) Act does not
seek to tax Explanation sales
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">1427</span>
at  all.  It talks of " property passing " only and as	such
Andhra	can  tax only such sales where	property  passes  in
Andhra. <a href="/doc/1266379/" id="a_47">See Poppatlal Shah v. State of' Madras</a>, ( [1953]  S.
C.  R. 677).  <a href="/doc/1920625/" id="a_48">Section 22</a> does not enlarge the definition  of
sales; it only restricts the power of the State to tax.	 The
explanation  to<a href="/doc/1920625/" id="a_49"> s. 22</a>, like the explanation to <a href="/doc/730559/" id="a_50">Art.  236(1</a>),
is  merely  for the purpose of defining what is	 an  outside

merely	to  bring the State laws into conformity  with	<a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_52">Art.

tation	Order  under  <a href="/doc/251565/" id="a_54">Art. 372(2</a>), cannot  be  construed  as
permitting the imposition of tax on Explanation sales  which

Company case ( [1955] 2 S. C. R. 603 at 667).  What did	 not
exist could not be validated.

legislatures.  <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_60">Article 286(2)</a> does not give Parliament power
to  validate or ratify laws of the State legislatures.	 The

But even this decision helps the petitioners in so far as it
lays  down  that where tax had neither	been  collected	 nor
levied the <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_65">Validation Act</a> did not confer power to assess  or
levy.  The whole

<a href="/doc/1920625/" id="a_76">Section	 22</a>  does  not authorise the imposition	 of  tax  on
Explanation sales.  It could not have been the intention  of
the  President to allow the State to add a new	category  of
sales - the Explanation Sales -to be taxed.  The language of
<a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_77">Art.  286(2)</a>  indicates	 that the lifting of the  ban  is  a
condition  precedent to legislation by the  States  imposing
tax  on inter-State sales.  Alternatively, the power to	 tax
inter-State sales is with Parliament under Entry 97 of	List
I of Schedule VII of the Constitution.	<a href="/doc/1920625/" id="a_78">Section 22</a> was wiped

power in the States to enact laws imposing tax on interstate

</p><p id="p_21">VENKATARAMA AIYAR J.-The petitioners are dealers carrying on

yarn,  and  they have filed the present	 applications  under
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_120">Art.  32</a>  of  the Constitution for the issue of	 a  writ  of
prohibition or other appropriate writ restraining the  State
of  Andhra  from  taking proceedings  for  imposing  tax  on
certain	 sales effected by them in favour of  merchants	 who
are  residing  or carrying on business in what	is  now	 the
State of Andhra Pradesh, on the ground, inter alia, that the
said sales were made in the course of inter-State trade, and
that  no  tax  could  be levied on them	 by  reason  of	 the
prohibition contained in <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_121">Art. 286(2)</a> of the Constitution.
The course of dealings between the parties resulting
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">       1433</span>
in  the above sales has been set out in para. 5 in  Petition
No.  220 of 1955.  It is therein stated that the dealers  in
Andhra would place orders for the purchase of yarn with	 the
petitioners in Madras, that the contracts would be concluded
at  Madras, that the goods would be delivered  ex-godown  at
Madras and would thereafter be despatched to the  purchasers
either	by lorries or by rail as might be directed by  them,
that when the goods were sent by rail, the railway  receipts
would  be  taken either in the name of the  consignees,	 and
sent  to  them by post or in the name of the  consignor	 and
endorsed  to the purchasers and delivered to them in  Madras
or sent to them by post endorsed in favour of a bank and the
purchasers  would  take	 delivery of  those  receipts  after
payment to the bank.  It is said that in all cases price  of
the goods was paid in Madras.
</p><p id="p_22">On  the	 above allegations, it is manifest  that  the  sales
mentioned therein are not all of the same kind, and in point
of law, the incidents attaching to them might be  different.
A  consideration  of  the validity of  the  imposition	with
reference  to the several classes of sales  mentioned  above
would  he wholly airy and pointless without a  determination
of the facts relating to them, which, however, have not been
investigated.	 Counsel  for  the   petitioners,   however,
concedes that the, dispute in these proceedings is  confined
to  the proposed imposition of tax, in so far as it  relates
to  sales of the character mentioned in the  Explanation  to
<a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_122">Art. 286(1)(a</a>), that is to say, sales in which the  property
in the goods sold passed outside the State of Andhra but the
goods themselves were actually delivered as a result of	 the
sale  for consumption within that State.  These	 sales	have
been referred to in the arguments before us as	"Explanation
sales ", and it will be convenient to adopt that  expression
in referring to them in this judgment.
</p><p id="p_23">It will be seen that the above sales would all of them	have
been intrastate, so long as the Andhra State formed part  of
the  composite	State  of  Madras,  and	 questions  of	 the
character now agitated before us could not then have arisen.
On September 14, 1953,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">1434</span>
Parliament  enacted  the  Andhra State	Act  (30  of  1953),
whereby	 a  separate State called the State  of	 Andhra	 was
constituted  incorporating  therein  territories  which	 had
previously  thereto formed part of the State of Madras,	 and
this Act came into force on October 1, 1953.  Under s. 53 of
the  Andhra State Act, the laws in force in the	 territories
in  the	 Andhra	 State	prior to  its  constitution  are  to
continue  to be in force even thereafter, and one  of  those
laws is the Madras General Sales Tax Act (Madras 9 of 1939),
hereinafter  referred to as the Madras Act.  Section  54  of
the Andhra State Act conferred on the Government a power  to
adapt  laws for the purpose of facilitating the	 application
of  any	 law previously made, and in exercise of  the  power
conferred by this section, an Adaptation Order was passed on
November  12,  1953,  whereby  the  word  "  Andhra  "	 was
substituted  for  the word "Madras" in the Madras  Act.	  We
shall  hereafter  refer to the Madras Act as  continued	 and
applied in the State of Andhra as the Andhra (Madras)
Act.
</p><p id="p_24">It will be convenient at this stage to refer to the relevant
provisions of this Act.	 The preamble to the Act states that
"  it is expedient to provide for the levy of a general	 tax
on  the	 sale of goods in the State of Madras".	  "Sale"  is
defined	 in <a href="/doc/87571198/" id="a_123"> s.	 2(h)</a>, omitting what  is  not  material,  as
meaning	 "  every transfer of the property in goods  by	 one
person	to  another in the course of trade or  business	 for
cash   or   for	  deferred   payment   or   other   valuable
consideration."	 <a href="/doc/87571198/" id="a_124">Section 2(i)</a> defines " turnover " as "	 the
aggregate  amount  for which goods are either bought  by  or
sold  by a dealer, whether for cash or for deferred  payment
or other valuable consideration ". <a href="/doc/18809355/" id="a_125">Section 3</a> is the charging
section	 and provides that every dealer shall pay  for	each
year tax on his total turnover for such year.  By the Madras
General	 Sales	Tax (Amendment) Act No. 25 of  1947,  a	 new
Explanation was added to the definition of " sale ", and  it
is as follows:
</p><p id="p_25">Explanation 2: " Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_126">Indian Sale of (Goods Act</a>, 1930, the sale or purchase of
any goods shall be deemed, for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">1435</span>
the  purposes  of  this Act, to have  taken  place  in	this
Province,  wherever the contract of sale or  purchase  might
have been made-
</p><p id="p_26">(a)  if the goods were actually in this Province at the time
when the contract of sale or purchase in respect thereof was
made, or
</p><p id="p_27">(b)  in	 case the contract was for the sale or	purchase  of
future goods by description, then, if the goods are actually
produced in this Province at any time after the contract  of
sale or purchase in respect thereof was made."
This  amendment	 came  into force on  January  1,  1948.
<a href="/doc/1266379/" id="a_127">In   Poppatlal Shah v. The State of Madras</a> (1),	 this  Court
had  to consider the scope of the definition of " sale "  in
s.  2(h) and of Explanation 2, and it was therein held	that
though	the power to tax a sale was really a power to tax  a
transaction  of	 sale and a law imposing such tax  would  be
competent if any of the ingredients of sale had taken  place
within the State, the Madras Act had, by its definition of "
sale  " in<a href="/doc/87571198/" id="a_128"> s. 2(h)</a> prior to the enactment of Explanation  2,
imposed	 a  tax only when the property in the  goods  passed
within	the  State, and that in respect of sales  which	 had
taken  place  prior  to	 the amendment,	 the  tax  would  be
unauthorised if the property in the goods passed outside the
State  of  Madras.   It was also  observed  that  after	 the
amendment came into force, a tax on a sale which came within
Explanation 2 would be valid.  That was the position in	 law
under  the  Madras  Act	 prior	to  the	 enactment  of	 the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_28">It is now necessary to refer to the changes effected in	 the
law by the Constitution.  <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_129">Article 286</a>, which is relevant for
the present purpose, is as follows:
</p><p id="p_29">286(1).	 " No law of a State shall impose, or authorise	 the

enacts that,

the  President made Adaptation Orders with reference to	 the

Act,  he  issued  on July 2,  1952,  the  Fourth,  Amendment
inserting  a  new section,<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_131"> s. 22</a> in that Act.	It  runs  as
follows:

</p><p id="p_42">It will be noticed that the Explanation to <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_132">Art. 286 (1)	 (a)</a>
is reproduced verbatim in s. 22 of the Madras Act.  The true
meaning	  and  scope  of  this	Explanation  came   up	 for
consideration  before this Court in <a href="/doc/424874/" id="a_133">The State of Bombay	 and
another	 v.  The United Motors India Ltd., and	others</a>	(1).
Therein,  it  was held by a majority that though  the  sales
falling	 within	 the Explanation would, in fact, be  in	 the
course	of interState trade, they became, by reason  of	 the
fiction	 introduced therein, invested with the character  of
intra-State  sales, and would be liable to be taxed  by	 the
State within which the goods were delivered for consumption.
Acting	on this judgment, the Board of	Revenue	 (Commercial
Taxes) Andhra State, issued a
(1)  [1953] S.C.R. 1069.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">1438</span>
<p id="p_43">notification  on  July	13, 1954, calling  upon	 dealers  to
submit	returns	 of their turnover of sales in	which  goods
were  delivered in the Andhra State for consumption,  and  a
copy  thereof  was  sent  to  the  Madras  Yarn	  Merchants'
Association,  of  which the petitioners	 are  members.	 The
Association disputed the liability of the Madras dealers  to
pay  any tax in respect of the sales to the Andhra  dealers,
and  after  some correspondence, the  Andhra  State  finally
issued on June 30, 1955, notices to the petitioners to	send
their returns of turnover by July 15, 1955, failing which it
was  stated  that  assessments would be	 made  on  the	best
judgment  basis,  and that, further, the  dealers  would  be
liable to the penalties prescribed by the law (Vide Annexure
H  to the petition).  Thereupon, the petitionera have  filed
the present petitions challenging the validity of the demand
made by the Andhra State on the ground, inter alia, that the
sales proposed to be taxed were inter-State sales, and	that
they  were  immune from taxation under <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_134">Art.  286(2).</a>   These

consideration  before  this  Court in  <a href="/doc/608874/" id="a_136">The  Bengal  Immunity
Company	 Limited v. The State of Bihar and others</a>  (1).	  By
its judgment dated September 6, 1955, this Court held, again

of  <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_137">Art. 286(2</a>), unless Parliament lifted the ban, that	 the

but  without costs.  Before final orders were passed on	 the
petitions,  however, the Sales Tax Validation Ordinance	 No.
III  of 1956, was promulgated on January 30, 1956, and	that

<a href="/doc/87571198/" id="a_141">Section 2</a> of this Act runs as follows:
</p><p id="p_47">" Notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any court
no  law of a State imposing, or authorising  the  imposition

April,	1951, and the 6th day of September, 1955,  shall  be
deemed to be invalid or ever to have been invalid merely  by
reason of the fact that such sale or purchase took place  in
the  course  of interstate trade or commerce; and  all	such
taxes levied or collected or purporting to have been  levied
or  collected  during the aforesaid period shall  be  deemed
always	 to  have  been	 validly  levied  or  collected	  in

</p><p id="p_48">On February 19, 1957, the Andhra State which had become	 the
State  of  Andhra  Pradesh  under<a href="/doc/18809355/" id="a_142"> s. 3</a>	(1)  of	 the  <a href="/doc/1211891/" id="a_143">States
Reorganisation Act</a> (37 of 1956) filed a fresh statement that
by  reason of the <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_144">Validation Act</a> the State was	entitled  to
impose a tax on the Explanation sales, which had taken place
during	the period between the 1st day of April,  1951,	 and
the  6th day of September, 1955 (which will  hereinafter  be
referred to as the specified period), and that the petitions
should therefore be dismissed.
</p><p id="p_49">The petitioners challenge the correctness of this  position.
They contend that the Andhra (Madras) Act does not, in fact,
impose	a  tax	oh  the	 Explanation  sales,  and  that,  in
consequence,  the <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_145">Validation Act</a> can have no effect  on	 it;
that the <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_146">Validation Act</a> is itself unconstitutional and void;
that  the Act even if valid, does not validate s. 22 of	 the
Andhra	(Madras)  Act;	that it validates  only	 levies	 and
collections of tax already made, and does not authorise	 the
initiation
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">1440</span>
of  fresh proceedings for assessment of tax or for  realisa-
tion  of  the same; that even if the  Act  authorised  fresh
imposition of taxes, that could not be done without  further
legislation  pursuant  thereto	by the State,  and  that  no
action	could be taken on the basis of s. 22 of	 the  Andhra
(Madras)  Act, as, being unconstitutional when	enacted,  it
was for all purposes non est ; that tax on the sale of	yarn
could under the Act be levied only at a single point and the
State  of Madras having imposed a tax on the sale  of  goods
now proposed to be taxed, the Andhra State could not  impose
a  tax	once again on the sale of the self-same	 goods,	 and
that,  further, the tax on yarn would, so far as the  Andhra
State  is  concerned, be bad as being hit by  the  <a href="/doc/774360/" id="a_147">Essential
Commodities Act</a> (52 of 1952), read with <a href="/doc/1112282/" id="a_148">Art. 286 (3).</a>
It  must be mentioned that similar to the  Adaptation  Order
which enacted<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_149"> s. 22</a> in the Madras Act, there were Adaptation
Orders by the President with reference to the Sales Tax Laws
in  all	 the States, and provisions similar to	s.  22	were
enacted	 therein.   As	any decision by this  Court  on	 the
questions  raised  in the petitions  must  conclude  similar
questions  under  the  laws of other  States,  those  States
applied	 for and obtained permission to intervene  in  these
proceedings,  and  we have heard  the  Advocates-General  of
Madras,	 Uttar Pradesh and Bihar on the questions.   As	 the
main  point for determination is the vires of the <a href="/doc/1920625/" id="a_150">Sales	 Tax
Laws  Validation Act</a> (which will hereinafter be referred  to
as the impugned Act), the Union of India has intervened, and
the  learned  Solicitor-General	 has  addressed	 us  on	 the
questions  relating  to the validity of that  Act.   Certain
assessees  who are interested in the decision of  the  above
questions  also	 applied  for  and  obtained  permission  to
intervene,   and   they	  are  the   Mysore   Spinning	 and
Manufacturing  Co., the Minerva Mills, Ltd., the  Tata	Iron
and  Steel  Co.	 Ltd., and the Madura Mills  Co.  Ltd.,	 and
counsel	 appearing for them have, in general, supported	 the
petitioners.
</p><p id="p_50">Counsel	 for  the Madura Mills Co. Ltd.,  raised  a  further
contention different from and inconsistent with
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">1441</span>
the  position  taken  by the petitioners  and  other  inter.
veners,	 and  that is that under Entry 42 in List I  of	 the
Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, inter-State trade	 and
commerce  is the exclusive domain of the Union	Legislature,
that tax on inter-State sales is comprised therein, that the
States have accordingly no power to tax such sales, and that
Parliament is not competent to authorise them to impose such
a  tax,	 and that, accordingly, the impugned Act  is  wholly
misconceived and inoperative.
</p><p id="p_51">On  these  contentions,	 the questions that  arise  for	 our
determination are:
</p><p id="p_52">(I)  Whether the Andhra (Madras) Act, in fact, imposes a tax
on the class of sales falling within the Explanation to <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_151">Art.
286 (1) (a);</a>
</p><p id="p_53">(II)Whether the impugned Act is ultra vires the ground	that
it is not authorised by the terms of <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_152">Art. 286(2);
(III) (a)</a> Whether s. 22 of the Andhra (Madras) Act is within
the protection of the impugned Act, and
(III)(b) Whether the impugned Act validates only levies	 and
collections made during the specified period, or whether  it
authorises  the imposition and collection of taxes  on	such
sales in future;
</p><p id="p_54">(IV)Whether s. 22 of the Madras Act was null and void on the
ground	that  it was in contravention of <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_153">Art. 286  (2</a>),	 and
whether the proceedings sought to be taken thereunder on the
strength of the impugned Act are incompetent;
(V)  Whether   tax  on	inter-State  sales  is	within	 the
exclusive competence of Parliament, and whether the impugned
Act  is,  in consequence, bad as authorising the  States  to
levy tax ;
</p><p id="p_55">(VI)Whether the proposed imposition of tax is illegal on the
ground	that successive sales of yarn are subject under	 the
law  to	 be  taxed at only one point, and as  the  State  of
Madras	has  already taxed the present sales, the  State  of
Andhra cannot again levy a tax on them ; and
(VII)Whether  the proposed imposition of tax on yarn by	 the
Andhra	State is hit by the <a href="/doc/774360/" id="a_154">Essential Commodities Act</a>,	read
with <a href="/doc/1112282/" id="a_155">Art. 286(3</a>), and is illegal?
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">1442</span>
<p id="p_56">(1):The	 first	question  that falls  to  be  determined  is
whether	 the Andhra (Madras) Act, in fact, imposes a tax  on
the  Explanation  sales.  Only if it does  that,  would	 the
further	 questions as to the vires and the operation of	 the
impugned  Act  arise  for consideration.   We  have  already
referred to the relevant provisions of the Madras Act and to
the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1266379/" id="a_156">Poppatlal Shah v. The State of
Madras</a> (1), wherein it was held that under the definition of
"  sale	 "  in	s.  2(h) of that  Act  and  apart  from	 the
Explanations  to it which are not material for	the  present
discussion,  power had been taken by the Province of  Madras
to  tax	 only sales in which property in  the  goods  passed
inside	the State.  It must, therefore, be taken that  under
the Act, as it stood prior to the Constitution, the State of
Madras	had  no power to impose a tax on sales of  the	kind
mentioned  in the Explanation to <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_157">Art. 286 (1)(a).</a>  Now,	 the
question  is whether the Adaptation Order of  the  President
(Fourth Amendment) dated July 2, 1952, has, by the insertion
of <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_158"> s.	22</a>  in the Madras Act, altered	the  position.	 The
contention of the respondent is that it has, because it	 has
bodily	incorporated the Explanation to <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_159">Art. 286 (1) (a)</a>  in
the section itself, and as under that Explanation, all sales
falling within its ambit would be sales inside the State  of
Madras,	 they became taxable as sales within the  definition
in<a href="/doc/87571198/" id="a_160"> s.	  2</a>  (h)  of the Madras Act;  and  that	 accordingly
under s.  22  of  the Andhra (Madras)  Act  the	 Explanation
sales become taxable by the Andra State as sales within that
State.
</p><p id="p_57">The petitioners dispute this position, and contend that that
is not the true effect of the Explanation, and that properly
construed, it does not authorise the  in position of any tax
which  was  not leviable under the provisions  of  the	Act,
prior  to  its enactment.  It is argued that the  object  of
<a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_161">Art.   286</a>  of	the  Constitution  was	merely	 to   impose
restrictions  on the power which the States had under  Entry
54 in List 11 to enact laws imposing tax on sales, and that,
in  that context, the true scope of the Explanation to	<a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_162">Art.
286 (1) (a)</a> was that it merely took away from the State	 its
power to
(1)  [1953] S.C.R. 677.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">1443</span>
<p id="p_58">tax  a	sale in which the property passed inside it  if	 the
goods were actually delivered under the sale for consumption
in  another State and not to confer on the delivery State  a
power to tax such a sale, and that the Explanation in<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_163"> s.  22</a>
which  is, word for word, a reproduction of the	 Explanation
to  <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_164">Art.  286 (1) (a)</a> must be construed as having  the	same
import.	 Reliance is placed in support of this contention on
the  following	observations  of this Court  in	 The  Bengal
Immunity Company case(1) at p. 640:
</p><p id="p_59">"  In clause (1) (a) the Constitution makers have  placed  a
ban on the taxing power of the States with respect to  sales
or  purchases  which take place outside the State.   If	 the
matter	had  been  left	 there	the  ban  would	 have	been
imperfect, for the argument would have still remained as  to
where  a  particular -,ale or purchase took place.   Does  a
sale or purchase take place at the place where the  contract
of  sale is made, or where the property in the goods  passes
or  where  the	goods are delivered ?  These  questions	 are
answered  by the Explanation.  That Explanation is 'for	 the
purposes  of  sub-clause  (a)', i.e.,  for  the	 purpose  of
explaining  which  sale	 or purchase is to  be	regarded  as
having taken place outside a State.  By saying that a Parti-
cular  sale  or	 purchase  is to be  deemed  to	 take  in  a
particular  State the Explanation only indicates  that	such
sale  or purchase has taken place outside all other  States.
The  Explanation is neither an Exception nor a	Proviso	 but
only  explains what is an outside sale referred to  in	sub-
clause	(a).   This  it does by creating  a  fiction.	That
fiction is only for the purposes of subclause (a) and cannot
be  extended to any other purpose.  It should be limited  to
its  avowed purpose.  To say that this	Explanation  confers
legislative  power on what for the sake of brevity has	been
called	the  delivery State is to use it  for  a  collateral
purpose	 which is not permissible. .Further, it	 is  utterly
illogical  and untenable to say that <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_165">article 286</a>  which	 was
introduced in the Constitution to place restrictions on	 the
legislative  powers  of the States, by a side  wind,  as  it
were,

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">183</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">1444</span>
<p id="p_60">gave enlarged legislative powers to the State of delivery by
an  explanation sandwiched between two	restrictions.	This
construction  runs  counter  to the  entire  scheme  of	 the
article and the explanation and one may see no justification
for  imputing  such  indirect and oblique  purpose  to	this
article."
</p><p id="p_61">Now,  the  contention  of  the	petitioners  is	 that  these
observations  are  decisive  of	 the  present	controversy,
because	 the  same provision expressed	in  ipsissima  verba
cannot	have  one  meaning in <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_166">Art. 286(1) (a)</a>  and  quite  a
different  one	in  s.	22 of the Madras  Act;	and  on	 the
construction  put by this Court on the Explanation  to	<a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_167">Art.
286(1) (a</a>), the Explanation to<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_168"> s. 22</a> of the, Andhra (Madras)
Act  must  be interpreted as prohibiting States	 other	than
Andhra from taxing sales under which goods are delivered for
consumption  outside  those  States,  even  though  property
passed	inside	them  and not as authorising  the  State  of
Andhra to tax sales in which goods are delivered therein for
consumption  ,	even  though property in  the  goods  passed
outside	 that State.  It is argued that this  conclusion  is
reinforced  by	the opening words of<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_169"> s. 22</a>,  viz.,  "Nothing
contained in this Act shall be deemed to impose or authorise
the  imposition	 of  a tax on the sale or  purchase  of	 any
goods".	  The  effect of this, it is said, is  to  impose  a
restriction   on  the  power  which  the  State	  previously
possessed,  of taxing sales coming within the definition  in
s. 2 (h) and not to enlarge it.	 The decision in  <a href="/doc/320997/" id="a_170">Government
of Andhra v. Nooney Govindarajulu</a> (1) is cited in support of
these contentions.
</p><p id="p_62">The  error  in this argument lies in this that	it  focusses
attention exclusively on the terms in which the Explanations
are  couched in <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_171">Art. 286(1) (a)</a> and in<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_172"> s. 22</a> and  completely
overlooks  the	fundamental difference in  the	context	 and
setting	 of these two enactments.  The scope and purpose  of
<a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_173">Art. 286</a> have been considered at length in the decisions  of
this  Court  in The United Motors case (2) as  also  in	 The
Bengal	Immunity Company case (3), and it is  sufficient  to
briefly recapitulate them.  Under Entry 48 in List 11 of the
(1) (1957) 8 Sales Tax Cases 297.  (2) [1953] S.C.R, 1069.
(3) [1955] 2 S.C.R. 603.

<p id="p_63">Seventh	 Schedule to the Government of India Act, 1935,	 the
Provincial Legislature had the exclusive competence to enact
a  law imposing a tax on the sale of goods, and under<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_174"> s.  99</a>
(1), such a law could be made " for the Province or for	 any
part thereof ". <a href="/doc/129830/" id="a_175">In Wallace Brothers &amp; Co. Ltd. v. Income-tax
Commissioner</a>  (1), the question arose as to the validity  of
certain	 provisions  of	 the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_176">Indian  Income-tax	 Act</a>,  which
sought	to tax non-resident foreigners in respect  of  their
foreign	 income.  The Indian Legislature had under Entry  54
in List I of the Government of India Act power to enact laws
imposing  tax on income other than agricultural income,	 and
under <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_177"> s.  99(1)</a> the law could be made " for  the  whole  of
:British India or for any part thereof ". It was held by the
Privy Council that the requirements of<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_178"> s. 99</a> were  satisfied
if  there was sufficient territorial connection between	 the
State  imposing the tax and the person who was sought to  be
taxed, and the receipt of income by the assessees in British
India  furnished  sufficient nexus to give validity  to	 the
legislation  imposing tax on their foreign income.  If	this
doctrine  of  nexus is applicable to laws  imposing  tax  on
sales-and it was applied by this Court to those laws in	 the
United	Motors case (2) at p. 1079 and in  Poppatlal  Shah's
case  (3) at pp. 682-683-then it would be competent  to	 the
State to enact a law imposing a tax on sales not merely when
the  property in the goods passed within the State but	even
when it (lid not, if there was sufficient connection between
the State and the transaction of sale, such as the  presence
of  the goods in the State at the date of the agreement,  as
was  held  recently by this Court in <a href="/doc/1629177/" id="a_179">Tata Iron &amp;  Steel	 Co.
Ltd.  v. State of Bihar</a> (4).  In fact, acting on  the  nexus
theory the Legislatures of the States enacted Sales Tax Laws
adopting  one or more of the nexi as the basis of  taxation.
This  resulted	in multiple taxation, as  a  consequence  of
which  the free flow of commerce between the  States  became
obstructed and the larger economic interests of the  country
suffered.    It	 was  to  repair  this	mischief  that	 the

<p id="p_67">retaining  the power in the States to tax sales under  Entry
54 in List II sought to impose certain restrictions on	that
power  in <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_180">Art. 286.</a>  One of those restrictions is  contained
in  <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_181">Art.  286(1)(a)</a>  which prohibits  a	 State	from  taxing
outside	 sales.	 The Explanation now under consideration  is
attached to this provision, and it is in this context, viz.,
in  its	 setting in an Article, the object of which  was  to
impose fetters on the legislative powers of the States, that
this Court observed that though positive in form, it was  in
substance  negative in character, and that its true  purpose
was  not to confer any fresh power of taxation on the  State
but  to	 restrict the power which it  previously  had  under
Entry 54.
</p><p id="p_68">These	considerations	will  clearly  be  in  apposite	  in
construing a taxing statute like the Madras Act, the  object
of  which is primarily to confer power on the State to	levy
and collect tax.  When we find in such a statute a provision
containing a prohibition followed by an Explanation which is
positive in its terms, the true interpretation to be put  on
it  is	that while the prohibition is  intended	 to  prevent
taxation  of  outside  sales  on  the  basis  of  the  nexus
doctrine, the Explanation is intended to authorise  taxation
of  sales falling within its purview, subject of  course  to
the  other provisions of the Constitution, such as <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_182">Art.	 286
(2).</a>  It should be remembered that unlike the  Constitution,
the   law  of  a  State	 can  speak  only  within  its	 own
territories.   It  cannot operate either to  invest  another
State  with a power which it does not possess, or divest  it
of  a  power which it does possess under  the  Constitution.
Its  mandates  can run only within its	own  borders.	That
being the position, what purpose would the Explanation serve
in  s.	22 of the Madras Act, if it merely meant  that	when
goods are delivered under a contract of sale for consumption
in the State of Madras, the outside State in which  property
in  the goods passes has no power to tax the sale ? That  is
not  the  concern of the State of Madras,  and	indeed,	 the
Legislature  of Madras would be incompetent to enact such  a
law.  In its context and setting, therefore, the Explanation
to<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_183"> s. 22</a> must mean that it
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">1447</span>
authorises  the	 State of Madras to impose a  tax  on  sales
falling	 within its purview.  Thus, while in the context  of
<a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_184">Art. 286 (1) (a)</a> the Explanation thereto could be  construed
as purely negative in character though positive in form,  it
cannot be so construed in its setting in s. 22 of the Madras
Act, where it must have a positive content.
Nor  is	 there much force in the contention  that  the	non-
obstante clause in<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_185"> s. 22</a> has only the effect of substracting
something  from the power to tax conferred on the  State  by
the  charging section,<a href="/doc/18809355/" id="a_186"> s. 3</a>, read with<a href="/doc/87571198/" id="a_187"> s. 2</a> (h) and  not  of
adding to it.  <a href="/doc/350457/" id="a_188">In Aswini Kumar Ghosh and another v. Arabinda
Bose  and another</a> (1), It was observed by this Court that  "
the  enacting part of a statute must, where it is clear,  be
taken  to control the non-obstante clause where both  cannot
be read harmoniously ". Now, as the Explanation lays down in
clear and unambiguous terms that the sales of the  character
mentioned  therein  are	 to be deemed to  have	taken  place
inside	 the  State  in	 which	goods  are   delivered	 for
consumption,  full  effect  must be given  to  it,  and	 its
operation  cannot  be  cut down by  reference  to  the	non-
obstante clause.  It cannot be put against this construction
that  it  renders the non-obstante  clause  ineffective	 and
useless.  According to the definition in<a href="/doc/87571198/" id="a_189"> s. 2</a> (h), a sale in
which  property	 passes inside the State of Madras  will  be
liable to be taxed, even though the goods are delivered	 for
consumption  outside that State, but under  the	 Explanation
such  a sale will be deemed to have taken place in the	out-
side State in which goods are delivered for consumption, and
therefore the State of Madras will have nO power to tax	 it:
The  purpose  which  the non-obstante clause  serves  is  to
render	the Explanation effective against the definition  in
s. 2 (h) and not to render it ineffective in its own sphere,
as determined on its
terms.
</p><p id="p_69">But  it is contended that in order to reach this  result  it
was necessary that the Explanation to<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_190"> s. 22</a> should have been

because under<a href="/doc/18809355/" id="a_192"> s. 3</a>, which is the charging
(1)  [1953] S.C.R. 1, 24.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">1448</span>
<p id="p_70">section, it is the turnover of sales that is subject to tax,
that  sale for the purpose of that section is only  what  is
defined as " sale " under<a href="/doc/87571198/" id="a_193"> s. 2</a> (h), and that the Explanation
sales  not  having been brought within that  definition,  no
charge could be imposed thereon.  The Explanation in<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_194"> s.	 22</a>,
it  is argued, cannot override<a href="/doc/87571198/" id="a_195"> s. 2</a> (h), and if	 its  object
was  to	 confer on the State a power to	 tax  sales  falling
within its ambit, that has not, in fact, been achieved.	  It
is pointed out by way of contrast that in the Sales Tax Laws
of  some other States, such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh,	 the
Explanation has been added to the definition of sale.	Now,
a  contention  that what the Legislature intended  to  bring
about	it  has	 failed	 to  do	 by  reason   of   defective
draftsmanship is one which can only be accepted in the	last
resort,	 when there is no avenue left for escape  from	that
conclusion.   But  that clearly is not	the  position  here.
<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_196">Section 22</a> opens with the words " Nothing contained in	this
Act  ",	 and that means that that section is to be  read  as
controlling, inter alia, the definition of sale in<a href="/doc/87571198/" id="a_197"> s. 2</a> (h).
Otherwise,  sales  in which property passes  in	 Madras	 but
delivery  is outside that State would be taxable under<a href="/doc/87571198/" id="a_198"> s.  2</a>
</p><p id="p_71">(h)  and  under	<a href="/doc/18809355/" id="a_199"> s.  3</a>, even  though  they  are	 within	 the
prohibition  enacted in<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_200"> s. 22</a>.	If the provisions of <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_201"> s.  22</a>
are  effective for the purpose of limiting the operation  of
s.  2  (h), we do not see any difficulty in  construing	 the
Explanation therein as equally effective for the purpose  of
enlarging  it.	 Again, it is a rule of	 construction  well-
establisbed  that  the several sections forming	 part  of  a
statute should be read, unless there are compelling  reasons
contra,	 as  constituting a single scheme and  construed  in
such  manner as would give effect to all of them.   On	this
principle, <a href="/doc/87571198/" id="a_202"> s.	2</a>  (h) and<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_203"> s. 22</a> must be  read	together  as
defining what are sales, which are taxable under the Act and
what are not, and so read, the Explanation really means that
in sales in which goods are delivered for consumption in the
State  of  Madras, the property therein shall be  deemed  to
have passed inside that State, notwithstanding that it	has,
under the <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_204">Sale of Goods Act</a>, passed outside that State.	  On
this construction, those
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">1449</span>
sales  will fall within the definition in<a href="/doc/87571198/" id="a_205"> s. 2</a> (h) and	will
be  taxable.   The  contention	of  the	 petitioners  highly
technical and based oil the non-insertion of the Explanation
in<a href="/doc/87571198/" id="a_206"> s. 2</a> (h) must, in our opinion, be rejected
as unsound.
</p><p id="p_72">It  is next contended that the power of the President  under
Art,. 372 (2) is merely to bring the provisions of the State
laws  into conformity with <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_207">Art. 286</a>, and that having  regard
to  the	 interpretation put on that Article  in	 The  Bengal
Immunity Company case (1), the Explanation in<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_208"> s. 22</a> would be
valid  in  so far as it prohibits the State of	Madras	from
imposing a tax on sales in which goods are delivered outside
Madras,	 though property therein passed inside	that  State,
but  that  in  so far as it makes  taxable  sales  in  which
property  passes outside the State of Madras but  the  goods
themselves  are delivered for consumption in Madras,  it  is
much more than bringing the. ,State law into conformity with
<a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_209">Art. 286</a>, and is, in consequence, unauthorised and bad.	  It
is  argued  that such a provision could be  enacted  by	 the
Legislature  of Madras, as was in fact, done by	 the  legis-
latures	 of many of the States, but the President could	 not
do it in exercise of the special and limited power conferred
on  him	 by  <a href="/doc/251565/" id="a_210">Art.  372(2).</a>  That  power	 is  merely,  it  is
contended, to take the definition of " sale " in s. 2(h)  of
the  Madras Act, strike out therefrom whatever is  repugnant
to <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_211">Art. 286</a>, such as sales in which goods are delivered	 for
consumption  outside Madras, and leave it there and  not  to
add to it.
</p><p id="p_73">We are not satisfied that that is a correct view to take  of
the powers of the President under <a href="/doc/251565/" id="a_212">Art. 372(2).</a>	It is to  be
observed  that	<a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_213">Art. 286(1)(a)</a> and the	Explanation  thereto
form,  in their setting in a taxing statute, integral  parts
of and different facets of the same concept.  Sales in which
property passes outside the State of Madras but delivery for
consumption  is inside Madras are at once inside  sales	 for
Madras	and outside sales for the other States.	 Now, if  in
exercise  of  the  power  to adapt,  the  enactment  of	 the
Explanation  is	 requisite to give effect to one  aspect  of
that
(1)  [1955] 2 S.C.R. 603.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">1450</span>
<p id="p_74">concept,  that is, for prohibiting the State of Madras	from
taxing	sales when goods are delivered outside, we  fail  to
see  why it should not operate to give effect to  the  other
aspect of the concept which is so integrally connected	with
it,  viz., taxing of sales in which goods are delivered	 for
consumption  in	 the  State of Madras, if  its	language  is
comprehensive  and  wide enough to include such	 sales.	  We
find it difficult to hold that the self-same Explanation  is
intra  vires  the powers of the President in so	 far  as  it
prohibits  the State from taxing gales, in which  goods	 are
delivered Outside the State but is ultra vires in so far  as
it  authorises	that State to tax sales in which  goods	 are
delivered inside it.
</p><p id="p_75">It  should be remembered in this connection that  the  power
which  the President has under <a href="/doc/251565/" id="a_214">Art. 372(2)</a> to adapt  is	 the
legislative  power  of the State whose law is  adapted,	 and
that  includes the power to repeal and amend any  provision.
Provided  that the law as adapted is within the	 legislative
competence of the State and its enactment is in the  process
of bringing the State law into conformity with <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_215">Art. 286</a>,  it
seems  to us that it is within the ambit of the	 power	con-
ferred	by  <a href="/doc/251565/" id="a_216">Art.  372(2).</a>   The	 question,  however,  is  of
academic  interest, because of the concluding words of	<a href="/doc/251565/" id="a_217">Art.
372(2</a>), which enact that no adaptation order made under that
provision  shall  be  liable  to  be  questioned.   It	 was
suggested  for the -petitioners that these words would	have
no  application	 when the adaptation order went	 beyond	 the
terms  of  <a href="/doc/251565/" id="a_218">Art.	 372(2</a>), and that it was  open	to  them  to
challenge  its	validity on the ground that it	amounted  to
more  than  bringing the existing law into  conformity	with
<a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_219">Art. 286.</a>  We are unable to agree.  If the adaptation  order
is within the scope of <a href="/doc/251565/" id="a_220">Art. 372(2</a>), then it is valid of	 its
own force, and does not require the aid of a clause such  as
is contained in the concluding portions thereof.  It is only
when  the adaptation amounts to something more	than  merely
bringing   the	 State	 law  into   conformity	  with	 the
Constitutional	provisions that there can arise a  need	 for
such a clause.	In our opinion, the effect of the concluding
words of <a href="/doc/251565/" id="a_221">Art. 372(2)</a> is to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">1451</span>
render	the question of the validity of the adaptation	non-
justiciable.	The  Adaptation	 Order	in  question   must,
accordingly, be held to be not open to attack on the  ground
that it goes beyond the limits contemplated by <a href="/doc/251565/" id="a_222">Art. 372(2).</a>
It  is then argued that even though the Adaptation Order  of
the  President might not be open to question even if it	 had
imposed for the first time a tax on sales which had not been
previously  imposed  by the Act,  nevertheless	in  deciding
whether	 it  does, in fact, impose such a tax, it  would  be
relevant to take into account that the object of <a href="/doc/251565/" id="a_223">Art. 372(2)</a>
was  only to bring the State laws into conformity  with	 the
Constitution,  and that, in consequence, the Explanation  in
s.  22 must be construed as having the same meaning  as	 the
Explanation  in <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_224">Art. 286(1)(a).</a>	 This would, no doubt, be  a
legitimate consideration in interpreting the language of the
Explanation,  but  then, it must be remembered that  at	 the
time   when  the  Adaptation  Order  was  made,	  the	true
interpretation of the Explanation to <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_225">Art. 286(1)(a)</a> had	 not
been the subjectmatter of any decision, and it is  therefore
difficult to impute to the framers of<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_226"> s. 22</a> the construction
put  by this Court on the Explanation to <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_227">Art.  286(1)(a)</a>  in
The  Bengal Immunity Company case (1) any more than the	 one
put  on it in The United Motors case (2).  We are  therefore
thrown	back  on the language of the Explanation  itself  to
discover  its true scope.  If, in enacting the	Explanation,
the  Adaptation Order merely intended to prohibit the  State
of  Madras from imposing tax on sales under which goods	 are
delivered  for	consumption outside that State	even  though
property therein passed inside that State, it would  clearly
have  expressed	 that intention in words  to  the  following
effect:	 " For the purposes of clause (a)(i), a	 sale  under
which goods are delivered for consumption outside the  State
of  Madras shall be deemed to have taken place outside	that
State,	notwithstanding that property in those goods  passed
inside that State ". But the language of the Explanation  is
general, and fixes the situs of sales of
(1) [1955] 2 S.C.R. 603.
</p><p id="p_76">(2) [1953] S.C.R. 1069.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">184</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">1452</span>
<p id="p_77">an  inter-State	 character in the State in which  goods	 are
actually delivered for consumption.  Under this Explanation,
a sale under which goods are delivered outside the State  of
Madras	will be an outside sale for that State	even  though
property  in  the  goods  passed  inside  that	State,	 and
likewise, a sale under which goods are delivered inside	 the
State of Madras will be an inside sale for that State,	even
though property in the goods passed outside that State.	  As
the language of the Explanation is general and of sufficient
amplitude  not	merely to restrict but also to	add  to	 the
power  of  the State to tax Explanation sales,	and  as	 the
reasons	 for  construing it as purely  restrictive  in	<a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_228">Art.
286(1)(a)</a>  are,	 as already stated, without force  in  their
application to a taxing statute, we must give full effect to
the  words of the enactment, and bold that they	 operate  to
confer on the State a power to tax Explanation sales.
There is one other contention relating to this aspect of the
matter,	 which	remains to be considered, and that  is	that
even  if the Explanation could be construed  as	 authorising
the  imposition of a tax on the sales mentioned	 therein,  a
reading	 of the section as a whole makes it clear  that,  in
fact,  no such tax was imposed, as it expressly enacts	that
"Nothing  contained in this Act shall be deemed to impose  a
tax  on	 inter-State  sales  ". The  argument  is  that	 the
Explanation  sales being inter-State sales and	the  section
having	exempted  them	from taxation, they go	out  of	 the
statute book altogether, and do not exist for the purpose of
the  impugned  Act.   We  are  unable  to  agree  with	this
contention.   <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_229">Article  286(2)</a>  consists of  two	 parts,	 one
imposing a restriction on the power possessed by the  States
to  tax sales under Entry 54 in so far as such sales are  in
the  course of inter-State trade and commerce  and  another,
vesting	 in Parliament a power to enact a law removing	that
restriction.   If<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_230"> s. 22</a> had merely enacted that	 portion  of
<a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_231">Art.   286(2)</a>  which  prohibited  imposition  of  taxes	  on
interstate  sales, that might have furnished some  plausible
ground for the contention now urged by the  petitioners.:but
it enacts both the parts of <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_232">Art. 286(2</a>),
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">1453</span>
the  restriction imposed therein and also the  condition  on
which  that  restriction  is  to  cease,  viz.,	  Parliament
providing  otherwise by law.  Taken along with the  admitted
power  of the States to impose tax on sales under Entry	 54,
the true scope of<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_233"> s. 22</a> is that it does impose	  a  tax  on
the Explanation sales, but the imposition    is	  to	take
effect only when Parliament lifts the ban.   In other words,
it  is a piece of legislation imposing tax in praesenti	 but
with  a condition annexed that it is to come into  force  in
futuro	as  and	 when Parliament so  provides.	 It  is	 not
contended  that there is in the Constitution any  inhibition
against conditional legislation.  In The Queen v. Burah (1),
it  was held by the Privy Council that a legislature  acting
within	the  ambit  of	authority conferred  on	 it  by	 the
Constitution has the power to enact a law either  absolutely
or  conditionally,  and that position  has  been  repeatedly
affirmed in this Court.	 Vide In  The Delhi Laws Act,  1912,
etc.  (2) and <a href="/doc/1519712/" id="a_234">Sardar Inder Singh v. State  of  Rajasthan</a>(3).
It  would  clearly be within the competence  of	 the  Madras
Legislature  to	 enact	a  law	imposing  a  tax  on   sales
conditional  on the ban enacted in <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_235">Art. 286(2)</a> being  lifted
by  Parliamentary legislation, and that, in our opinion,  is
all that has been done in<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_236"> s. 22</a>.  The Madras Act defines the
event  on which the tax becomes payable and the person	from
whom and the rate at which it has to be levied, and forms  a
complete  code on the topic under consideration.   It  could
have no immediate operation by reason of the bar imposed  by
<a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_237">Art.  286(2</a>),  but  when once that is removed by  a  law  of
Parliament,  there is no impediment to its  being  enforced.
That  satisfies	 all  the  requirements	 of  a	 conditional
legislation.  But it was argued that s. 22 of the Madras Act
could  not be so construed, because it was not open  to	 the
President  acting in exercise of the power conferred on	 him
under <a href="/doc/251565/" id="a_238">Art. 372 (2)</a> to impose a conditional levy ; nor  would
it be competent to the Legislature of Madras to make a	levy
conditional  or otherwise, unless Parliament had  authorised
it.  We see no force in this argument.	As
(1) (1878) L.R. 5 I.A. 178.	   (2) [1951] S.C.R. 747.
(3)  [1957] S.C.R. 605.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">1454</span>
<p id="p_78"><a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_239">Art. 286(2)</a> is itself in two parts, one a restriction on the
power of the State and the other, a condition on which	such
restriction  will  cease  to  operate,	an  adaptation	made
pursuant thereto must also be similar in its contents.	 Nor
is there in <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_240">Art. 286 (2)</a> any prohibition of any	 legislation
by tile State Legislature against enacting laws imposing tax
on  interstate	sales.	It merely enacts that such  law	 can
have no effect.	 The words "No law of a State shall impose "
mean  only that no such law shall be effective to  impose  a
tax.
</p><p id="p_79">It is also contended that under the <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_241">Sales Tax Act</a>s, the levy
of  tax	 is annual and the rules contemplate  submission  of
quarterly returns and payment of taxes every quarter on	 the
admitted turnover, and that a conditional legislation  under
which payment of tax will become enforceable in futuro would
be  inconsistent with the scheme of the Act and	 the  rules.
But this argument, when examined, comes to no more than this
that  the existing rules do not provide a machinery for	 the
levy and the collection of taxes which might become  payable
in  future,  when Parliament lifts the ban.   Assuming	that
that  is the true position, that does not affect the  factum
of the imposition, which is the only point with which we are
now concerned.	That the States will have to frame rules for
realizing the tax which becomes now payable is not a  ground
for  holding that there is, in fact, no imposition  of	tax.
It  should  also be mentioned in this  connection  that	 the
Madras Act makes a clear distinction between sales which are
outside the operation of the Act, and sales which are within
its  operation	but  are exempt from  taxation.	  <a href="/doc/19949416/" id="a_242">Section  4</a>
provides  that the provisions of the Act shall not apply  to
the  sale of electrical energy, motor  spirit,	manufactured
tobacco and certain other articles.  In contrast to this  is
the  language of<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_243"> s. 22</a>, which expressly enacts that the	 Act
shall  not be deemed to impose a tax on	 inter-State  sales,
except in so far as Parliament may by law otherwise provide.
We are of opinion that, on the true construction of<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_244"> s. 22</a> of
the Act, there is an imposition of tax on Explanation  sales
but  that  it  could be enforced  only	when  Parliament  so
provides.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">1455</span>
<p id="p_80">We  have so far considered the question on principle and  on
the  language  of the statute.	We may now.,. refer  to	 the
decisions of the High Courts, wherein this question has been
considered.   <a href="/doc/1773770/" id="a_245">In Mettur Industries Ltd. v. State  of  Madras</a>
(1), the point directly arose for decision as to whether  s.
22  of	the  Madras  Act did. in fact, levy  a	tax  on	 the
Explanation sales so as to fall within the protection of the
<a href="/doc/1920625/" id="a_246">Sales  Tax  Laws  Validation  Act</a>.  It	was  held  that	 the
Explanation  to<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_247"> s. 22</a> had' the effect of rendering the	sale
one inside the State so as to fall within the definition  of
that  word  in<a href="/doc/87571198/" id="a_248"> s. 2</a> (h), and that it was taxable.   Next  in
point  of time is the decision of the Bombay High  Court  in
Dial Das v. P. S. Talwalkar (2) in which the question  arose
with  reference to s. 46 of the Bombay Sales Tax  Act  (Bom.
III of 1953), corresponding to s. 22 of the Madras Act.	  It
was held that it did impose a tax, though it was to  operate
only  if  Parliament  so  provided.  Then,  there  are	 two
decisions  of  the Travancore-Cochin High Court,  <a href="/doc/1566447/" id="a_249">Mathew  v.
Travancore-Cochin  Board of Revenue</a>(3) and <a href="/doc/239161/" id="a_250">Cochin Coal	Co.,
Ltd. v. State Of Travancore-Cochin</a>(4), in which it was	held
that  s. 26 of the Travancore-Cochin General Sales  Tax	 Act
corresponding to s. 22 of the Madras Act, had not the effect
of  imposing,  of its own force, a tax	on  the	 Explanation
sales, and the decision in <a href="/doc/1773770/" id="a_251">Mettur Industries Ltd. v.  Madras
State</a> (supra) was not followed.	 <a href="/doc/284932/" id="a_252">In The -Mysore Spinning and

does not call for any detailed consideration.  Suffice it to
say  that it cannot be maintained if the true scope of	<a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_266">Art.
286</a> is to define and limit the powers of State	Legislatures
with reference to imposition of sales tax and not to  itself
impose it.
</p><p id="p_86">(11) That brings us on to the next question which is whether
the  impugned Act, <a href="/doc/1920625/" id="a_267">Sales Tax Laws Validation Act</a>,  is  ultra
vires  on the ground that it is not authorised by the  terms
of  <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_268">Art.  286  (2).</a>   Now,  it	is  a  well-known  rule	  of
interpretation	that in order to understand the true  nature
and  scope of an Act it is necessary to ascertain  what	 the
evils  were which were intended to be redressed by it.	 The
starting  point of the trouble which ultimately led  to	 the
enactment  of  the impugned Act is the Explanation  to	<a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_269">Art.
286(1)(a</a>),  which came into force on January 26, 1950.	 The
terms in which it is worded undoubtedly suggest that sales

<p id="p_91">of  the description mentioned therein are to be	 treated  as
sales  inside the delivery State for purposes  of  taxation.
That  is  how it would seem to have been understood  in	 the
Adaptation  Order  under  which<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_270"> s. 22</a> was  inserted  in	 the
Madras	Sales Tax Act and in the Adaptation Orders  relating
to  the	 Sales	Tax Laws of other States;  for,	 as  already
stated, in a taxing statute the language of the	 Explanation
can  only mean that a sale failing within its purview is  an
inside	sale  enabling the State to tax it.  In	 The  United
Motors	case (1), the construction put by this Court on	 the
Explanation  was that though but for it the sales  mentioned
therein	 would	be  in the course of  interState  trade	 and
commerce,  its	effect was to convert them  into  intrastate
sales,	so as to bring them within the taxing power  of	 the
delivery  State.   It was only later that  this	 Court	held
finally	 in  The Bengal Immunity Company case (2)  that	 the
Explanation  sales were not divested of their  character  as
inter-State sales as the Explanation to <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_271">Art. 286 (1) (a)</a> did
not  govern  <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_272">Art.  286	(2</a>), and  that	in  the	 absence  of
Parliamentary  legislation as contemplated by <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_273">Art. 286	(2</a>),
taxation  of  sales  falling within  its  purview  would  be
unconstitutional.  This judgment was delivered on  September
6, 1955.
</p><p id="p_92">But  acting  on	 the  apparent	tenor  and  import  of	 the
Explanation  and the construction put upon it in The  United
Motors case (1), the States in India had been levying  taxes
oil  the sales falling within its purview.  The position  on
September  6,  1955,  was that the States  had	imposed	 and
collected large amounts by way of tax on Explanation  sales;
that there were proceedings pending for assessment of tax on
such sales; and that apart from this, the States would	have
been  entitled to take, but for the decision in	 The  Bengal
Immunity Company case (2), proceedings for the assessment of
tax  in	 respect  of those sales.  Now, the  result  of	 the
decision  in The Bengal Immunity Company case (2)  was	that
the  levy  of  the  tax	 on  the  Explanation  sales  became
unauthorised and the States were faced with large claims for
restitution of the

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">1458</span>
<p id="p_94">amounts	  realised,  involving	threat	to  their   economic
stability.   It should also be mentioned that quite a  large
number of dealers had, acting under provisions of the  <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_274">Sales
Tax Act</a>s which empowered them to pass the tax on,  collected
it  from their purchasers for the purpose of payment to	 the
State,	and  as after the decision in  The  Bengal  Immunity
Company case (1) they could no longer be called upon to	 pay
it, they stood to make an unjust gain of it.
</p><p id="p_95">These were the evils which called for redress, and it was to
remedy them that Parliament enacted the Sales Tax Validation
Ordinance No. III of 1956, and eventually replaced it by the
impugned Act.  <a href="/doc/87571198/" id="a_275">Section 2</a> of the Act provides that no law  of
a  State  imposing a tax on sales which took  place  in	 the
course	of  interState trade or commerce  between  April  1,
1951,  and September 6, 1955, shall be deemed to be  invalid
or  ever to have been invalid merely by reason of  the	fact
that  such  sales were in the course of	 inter-State  trade.
The  section  further  provides that  all  taxes  levied  or
collected under such a law during the specified period shall
be  deemed  to have been validly levied	 or  collected.	 The
policy	behind	the Act is obviously to declare the  law  as
interpreted  in	 The  United  Motors case  (2)	as  the	 law
governing  sales  filling within the Explanation up  to	 the
date of the judgment in The Bengal Immunity Company  case(1)
and to give effect to the law as laid down in that  decision
for the sales effected subsequent thereto.
The  question  is whether this Act  is	unconstitutional  as
being  ultra vires the powers of Parliament tinder Art'	 286
(2).   The petitioners maintain that it is, and put  forward
several grounds in support of that position.  It is  firstly
contended by them that under Entry 54 in List II, the  power
to  make  laws	in  respect  of	 tax  on  sales	 is   vested
exclusively in the States, that the power which is conferred
on  Parliament	under  <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_276">Art. 286(2)</a> is only to  enact  a	 law
directing or permitting the States to impose a tax on inter-
States	sales and not to itself enact a law  with  reference
thereto that the impugned Act being one to validate Sales

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">1459</span>
<p id="p_97">Tax  Laws is substantive in character and is not  authorised
by  the	 terms	of  <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_277">Art. 286 (2)</a>  and  is,  in	consequence,
unconstitutional.   It	is  argued that to  validate  is  to
confirm	 or ratify, and that can be only in respect of	acts
which  one  could  have	 himself  performed,  and  that	  if
Parliament  cannot  enact a law relating to  sales  tax,  it
cannot	validate such a law either, and that such a  law  is
accordingly unauthorised and void.  The only basis for	this
contention in the Act is its description in the Short  Title
as  the " <a href="/doc/1920625/" id="a_278">Sales Tax Laws Validation Act</a> " and  the  marginal
note to<a href="/doc/87571198/" id="a_279"> s.     2</a>,  which is similarly worded.  But the	true
nature of a law has to be determined not on the label  given
to   it	 in the statute but on its substance.  <a href="/doc/87571198/" id="a_280">Section 2</a>  of
the  impugned  Act which is the only  substantive  enactment
therein	 makes	no  mention  of	 any  validation.   It	only
provides that no law of a State imposing tax on sales  shall
be deemed to be invalid merely because such sales are in the
course of inter-State trade or commerce.  The effect of this
provision  is  merely to liberate the State  laws  from	 the
fetter	placed	on them by <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_281">Art. 286 (2)</a> and to	enable	such
laws  to operate on their own terms.  The true scope of	 the
impugned Act is, to adopt the language of this Court in	 the
decisions  in  The  United Motors case (1)  and	 The  Bengal
Immunity Company case (2), that it lifts the ban imposed  on
the States against taxing inter-State sales and not that  it
validates  or  ratifies	 any  such  law.   Considering	 the
legislation  on its substance, we have .no doubt that it  is
within the scope of the authority conferred on Parliament by
<a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_282">Art. 286 (2)</a> and is not
ultra vires.
</p><p id="p_98">It  is	next  contended	 that the  impugned  Act  is  wholly
retrospective  in  character in that it	 operates  on  sales
which took place during the specified period, and that	such
a  legislation is, having regard to the intendment  of	<a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_283">Art.
286 (2</a>), outside its terms.  It is argued that this Article,
to  start  with, enacts a restriction on the  power  of	 the
State to impose taxes on inter-State sales and then vests in
Parliament a power

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">185</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">1460</span>
<p id="p_100">to  remove  that restriction, and that in  logical  sequence
therefore, there should first be a legislation by Parliament
authorising  the States to impose a tax on interState  sales
and  then a law of the State made in  accordance  therewith,
and  that  that order having been reversed  in	the  present
case, the impugned Act is unconstitutional.  We do not agree
with this contention.  <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_284">Article 286 (2)</a> merely provides	that
no  law of a State shall impose tax on inter-State  sales  "
except in so far as Parliament may by law otherwise  provide
". It places no restrictions on the nature of the law to  be
passed by Parliament.  On the other hand, the words " in  so
far  as " clearly leave it to Parliament to decide  oil	 the
form  and  nature of the law to be enacted by it.   What  is
material   to  observe	is  that  the  power  conferred	  on
Parliament  under <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_285">Art. 286 (2)</a> is a legislative	 power,	 and
such  a power conferred on a Sovereign	Legislature  carries
with  it  authority to enact a law either  prospectively  or
retrospectively,   unless   there  can	be  found   in	 the
Constitution itself a limitation on that power.	 Now,  there
is nothing express in <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_286">Art. 286 (2)</a> imposing a restriction on
the  power of Parliament to enact a law	 with  retrospective
operation.  But it is argued for the petitioners that such a
restriction is to be implied from the scheme of it, which is
that  there  is a prohibition on the power of the  State  to
enact  a  law  imposing tax  on	 inter-State  sales,  unless
Parliament lifts the ban, and it is said that a	 prohibition
operates  only in futuro and therefore a law  removing	that
prohibition  must also operate in futuro.  The	decision  of
the  Privy Council in Punjab Province v. . Daulat Singh	 (1)
is  relied  on in support of this proposition.	 There,	 the
question arose with reference to the validity of a  mortgage
of  agricultural  lands in the Punjab executed in  the	year
1933.	Section	 13-A of the Punjab Alienation of  Land	 Act
which  came  into force in 1939 enacted that transfer  of  a
land  by  a  member of an agricultural tribe  in  favour  of
another member of the tribe was void if the transferee was a
benamidar  for a person who was not a member of that  tribe,
whether such transfer was
(1)  (1946) L.R. 73 I.A. 59.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">1461</span>
<p id="p_101">made  before or after the Act.	The mortgagee  instituted  a
suit,  challenging the vires of this section on	 the  ground
that  it  contravened s. 298(1) of the Government  of  India
Act,  1935,  which provided that no subject of	His  Majesty
domiciled  in  India  shall be	prohibited  from  acquiring,
holding	 or  disposing	of  property  on  grounds  only	  of
religion, place of birth or descent.  The mortgagor in reply
relied	on <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_287"> s. 298</a> (2) which enacted that  nothing  in	that
section	 shall	affect	the  operation	of  any	 law   which
prohibits the sale or mortgage of agricultural land  situate
in  any particular area and owned by a person  belonging  to
the agriculturist class.  In rejecting this contention,	 the
Privy Council observed that what was saved by<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_288"> s. 298</a> (2) was
a law prohibiting certain kinds of transfers, that the	word
" prohibition " could properly apply only to acts to be done
in  futuro,  and that the impugned provision,<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_289"> s.  13-A</a>,	 was
intra  vires  the Constitutional provision in so far  as  it
prohibited transfers after the date of its enactment, but to
the  extent that it avoided transfers which had taken  place
prior  to  that	 date, it was ultra  vires.   This  decision
proceeded solely on the connotation of the word "  prohibits
"  in<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_290"> s. 298</a> (2) of the Government of India Act, and can  be
of  no	assistance  in the construction	 of  <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_291">Art.  286	(2</a>),
wherein that word does not occur.  And even on the substance
of  it,	 we see no real analogy between the case  in  <a href="/doc/208970/" id="a_292">Punjab
Province  v. Daulat Singh</a> (1) and the present.	 There,	 the
law  which was authorised by<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_293"> s. 298</a> (2) was one	 prohibiting
certain	  transfers;  here  the	 law  which  Parliament	  is
authorised  to make is one not prohibiting the	States	from
imposing tax on inter-State sales, but permitting them to do
so.  While a law prohibiting transfers must be	prospective,
a law authorising imposition of tax need not be.  It can  be
both prospective and retrospective.
</p><p id="p_102">A  decision more directly in point is the one in The  United
Provinces  v. Atiqa Begum(2).  There, the question arose  on
the  construction of s. 292 of the Government of India	Act,
1935, which enacted that,
" Notwithstanding the repeal by this Act of the
(1) (1946) I. R. 73 I. A. 59.
</p><p id="p_103">(2) [1940] F. C. R.   110.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">1462</span>
<p id="p_104">Government of India Act, but subject to the other provisions
of  this  Act,	all  the  law  in  force  in  British  India
immediately before the commencement of Part III of this	 Act
shall  continue in force in British India until	 altered  or
repealed  or  amended by a competent  Legislature  or  other
competent authority."
</p><p id="p_105">The  Legislature of the United Provinces had enacted  a	 law
modifying  the pre-existing law relating to the	 payment  of
rents  by tenants to landlords and giving  it  retrospective
operation.   The  question  was whether	 the  enactment	 was
repugnant to<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_294"> s. 292</a> which had provided that the	 preexisting
law  was to continue in force until it was altered.  It	 was
held that the power of a legislature to pass a law  included
a power to pass it retrospectively, and that the words of<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_295"> s.
292</a> did not operate to impose any restriction on that power,
and  that the legislation was intra vires. In  our  opinion,
the principle of this decision is applicable to the  present
case,  and the impugned Act cannot be held to be bad on	 the
ground that it is retrospective in operation.
It  is next contended that the impugned Act is ultra  vires,
inasmuch  as it is much more than a mere retrospective	law,
and that it is really a piece of ex post facto	legislation,
which  is  not authorised by <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_296">Art. 286(2).</a>  The	argument  in
support	 of  this contention may thus be stated :  A'  State
legislature is competent under Entry 54 in List II to  enact
a  law taxing sale of goods, and when such a law is made  to
operate	 retrospectively it may not be open to challenge  on
constitutional grounds, though its propriety may be open  to
question on grounds of policy.	Parliament has no competence
to  enact  laws in respect of tax on  sales  filling  within
Entry  54 in List 11, but <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_297">Art. 286(2)</a> confers on it a  power
to  authorise  the  States to impose a	tax  on	 inter-State
sales.	The impugned Act does not do that, but validates  ex
post   facto   laws   of  States   imposing   such   a	 tax
retrospectively	 for the specified period.  Such  a  general
law may be intra vires the States but not Parliament, nor is
it one which can be justified by the power granted to it  to
"  provide otherwise." It is therefore unconstitutional	 and
void, In
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">1463</span>
our  opinion,  this argument is only an amalgam of  the	 two
contentions already dealt with, and does not require further
detailed  consideration.  The impugned Act, though it is  in
name  a validating Act, is in essence a law lifting the	 ban
under <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_298">Art. 286 (2</a>), and if no limitation on the character of
that law could be spelt out of the language of that Article,
then it must be upheld as within the authority conferred  by
it.
</p><p id="p_106">It  is	also  argued that even if the power to	make  a	 law
conferred  on  Parliament under <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_299">Art. 286 (2)</a>  comprehends  a
power  to  enact a law with  retrospective  operation,	that
power cannot extend to authorising what is unconstitutional,
and  that as<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_300"> s. 22</a> of the, Madras Act and the  corresponding
provisions   in	  the	statutes  of   other   States	were
unconstitutional  and illegal when made as contravening	 the
prohibition  enacted in <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_301">Art. 286 (2</a>), the impugned Act	must
be held to be unauthorised and bad in that it seeks to	give
effect	to  those provisions.  But this is to beg  the	very
question which we have to decide.  If it is competent to the
legislatures of the States to enact a law imposing a tax  on
inter-State   sales  to	 take  effect  when  Parliament	  so
provides,  there  is  nothing  unconstitutional	 or  illegal
either	in s. 22 of the Madras Act or in  the  corresponding
provisions  in	the Acts of other  States.   If	 conditional
legislation  is valid, as we have held it is, then<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_302"> s. 22</a>  is
clearly	 intra	vires,	and the	 foundation  on	 which	this
contention of the petitioners rests, disappears and it	must
fall  to the ground.  In the result, we are of opinion	that
the  impugned  Act  is	intra vires,  and  is  not  open  to
challenge  on  any  of	the  grounds  put  forward  by	 the
petitioners.
</p><p id="p_107">(111)	  (a).	We have now to consider the contention	that
even  if  the  impugned Act is valid, that  would  not	give
efficacy  to  s. 22 of the Madras Act or  the  corresponding
provisions  in	the laws of other States which	came  in  by
adaptation under <a href="/doc/251565/" id="a_303">Art. 372 (2).</a>	The ground urged in  support
of this contention is that the expression " law of a State "
in  <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_304">Art.  286 (2)</a> has a technical import, and  means  a	 law
which is enacted by the legislature of a State in the manner
prescribed  by	the Constitution and open  to  challenge  in
courts if
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">1464</span>
it is unconstitutional, that that expression occurring	,-in
s. 2 of the impugned Act must bear the same meaning which it
has  in	 <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_305">Art.  286 (2)</a> as it was enacted,  pursuant  to	 the
authority  contained therein, and that s. 22 of	 the  Madras
Act is not a law of that description, as it was made by	 the
President in exercise, of the special power conferred on him
by  <a href="/doc/251565/" id="a_306">Art. 372 (2</a>), and is, as provided therein, not  open  to
attack in a court of law.
</p><p id="p_108">We do not see why we should restrict the connotation of	 the
words " law of a State " in the manner contended above.	 The
law  of	 a  State signifies, in	 its  ordinary	acceptation,
whatever   is	an  expression	of   the   legislative,	  as
distinguished  from  the executive or judicial	power  of  a
State.	 Its normal mode under the Constitution is no  doubt
that  it  is  enacted  by  the	legislature  of	 the   State
constituted  in	 accordance with  the  procedure  prescribed
therein.   But	that  is  not the only	mode  in  which	 the
legislative  power of the State could be  exercised.   Under
<a href="/doc/860592/" id="a_307">Art.  213</a>,  the	 Governor  is  authorised,  subject  to	 the
conditions laid down therein, to issue Ordinances which have
the  force of law, and these Ordinances are clearly laws  of
the State and not the less so by reason of their not  having
been passed by the State legislature.  Under <a href="/doc/667558/" id="a_308">Art. 252</a>, it is
open to Parliament acting on resolutions of the legislatures
of  two or more States, to enact laws on subjects which	 are
within	the  exclusive competence of the  States,  a  recent
instance  of  such  legislation being Act 42  of  1955,	 the
validity of which was the subject of consideration in <a href="/doc/725224/" id="a_309">R.  M.
D.  Charnarbaugwalla  v.  Union of  India</a>(1).	Can  it,  be
contended  that these are not laws of the States  for  which
they  were  enacted,  because they were not  passed  by	 the
legislatures of those States ? We entertain no doubt that by
the expression " law of a State " in <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_310">Art. 286 (2)</a> and<a href="/doc/87571198/" id="a_311"> s.   2</a>
of the impugned Act is meant whatever operates as law in the
state, and that s. 22 of the Madras Act is   a	law   within
those  enactments.  Nor does it affect this conclusion	that
that law may not be open to challenge in a court of law.   A
right to challenge a

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">1465</span>
<p id="p_109">law  must  depend  on the  provisions  of  the	Constitution
governing the matter, and if those provisions enact that  it
is  not	 open to question in a court of law or' that  it  is
liable	to be questioned only on certain specified  grounds,
that  will not have the effect of depriving a  statute	duly
enacted of its character as law.  We are also not  satisfied
that  a	 law as adapted under <a href="/doc/251565/" id="a_312">Art. 372 (2)</a> is  not  open  to
attack on the ground that it contravenes some constitutional
provision.   We	 are disposed to think that  the  concluding
words  of <a href="/doc/251565/" id="a_313">Art. 372 (2)</a> preclude an attack on the  Adaptation
Order  only  on	 the ground that it does  more	than  merely
bringing the State law into conformity with the Constitution
and is, in consequence, ultra vires the powers conferred  by
that article.  In the result, we must hold that s. 22 of the
Madras Act is within the protection afforded by<a href="/doc/87571198/" id="a_314"> s. 2</a> of	 the
impugned Act.
</p><p id="p_110">(111)  (b)  : The next contention of  the  petitioners	that
falls  to be considered is whether even on the footing	that
the  impugned  Act is intra vires the powers  of  Parliament
under <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_315">Art. 286 (2</a>), the proceedings which are proposed to be
taken by the State of Andhra against them for assessment  of
tax  are incompetent, because the Act validates only  levies
or collections made during the specified period but does not
authorise  the initiation of fresh proceedings for  levy  or
collection of tax.  It is contended that though<a href="/doc/87571198/" id="a_316"> s. 2</a> of	 the
impugned  Act consists of two clauses, one giving effect  to
laws  of States imposing tax on inter-State sales in so	 far
as they took place during the specified period and the other
validating  levy  or  collection of  tax  made	during	that
period,	 the first clause has no independent operation,	 the
only purpose which it serves being to lead up to the  second
which  is the only effective clause in the section.   It  is
argued	that  if the intention of the  legislature  was	 not
merely	to validate the levies or collections  already	made
but  also to maintain the laws in force so as to enable	 the
States to take fresh proceedings for assessment and levy  of
tax,  then  there  was no need	whatsoever  for	 the  second
clause,	 as  effectuation  of the  Act	would  automatically
validate the levies and collections made thereunder.  It  is
said
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">1466</span>
that the object of the legislation was only to see that	 the
States had not to refund amounts collected by them, and that
for  achieving	that object it was necessary  only  to	give
effect to the second clause.  The decision in <a href="/doc/947197/" id="a_317">Dialdas v.  P.
S. Talwalkar</a> (1) already cited, was relied on as  supporting
the petitioners on this point.
</p><p id="p_111">In our judgment, the language of the enactment is too  clear
and unambiguous to admit of this contention.  If the purpose
of  the enactment is what the petitioners contend it to	 be,
then nothing would have been easier for the legislature than
to have so framed the section as to confine its operation to
levies or collections already made, without giving effect to
the  law itself.  On the contention of the petitioners,	 the
first clause has to be discarded as wholly inoperative,	 and
we  should  be 10th to adopt a construction which  leads  to
that result.  It is true that on the contention of the State
that  the first clause has independent operation the  second
clause would be unnecessary, as even without it, the  result
sought to be achieved by it must follow on the first  clause
itself.	  But  it is to be noted that the first	 clause	 has
reference  to  the exercise of legislative power  while	 the
second	is concerned with administrative action, and  it  is
possible  that the second clause might have been enacted  by
way  of abundant caution.  It is nothing strange or  unusual
for  a	legislature  to	 insert	 a  provision  ex  abundanti
cautela,  so as to disarm possible objection; but it is	 in-
conceivable that it should enact a provision which is wholly
inoperative.  Of two alternative constructions of which	 one
leads  to  the	former and the	other  involves	 the  latter
result,	 there cannot be any question that it is the  former
that is to be preferred.  Nor is it permissible to cut	down
the plain meaning of the terms of the statute on  considera-
tions of policy behind the legislation.	 But even from	that
point  of view, there was the fact that there  were  dealers
who had collected taxes from their purchasers for payment to
the State, but were relieved of
(1)  A.I.R. 1957 Bom. 71.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">1467</span>
<p id="p_112">that  obligation  by  the judgment in  The  Bengal  Immunity
Company case (1) and that, further, to validate only  levies
and  collections made would give an advantage to  those	 who
evaded	the law as then understood, over those	who  loyally
obeyed it.  It follows that we are unable to agree with	 the
decision in <a href="/doc/947197/" id="a_318">Dialdas v. P. S. Talwalkar</a> (2), in so far as  it
held  that it was not competent to the State to start  fresh
proceedings  for  assessment of tax on the strength  of	 the
impugned Act.  In our opinion, the true construction of<a href="/doc/87571198/" id="a_319"> s. 2</a>
is  that  the two clauses therein are, as indicated  by	 the
conjunction, distinct and independent in their opera.  tion,
and that the laws of the States are kept in force in respect
of sales which had taken place during the specified  period,
and  that proceedings in respect thereof for assessment	 are
within the protection of the Act.
</p><p id="p_113">It  was	 next argued that the impugned Act  is	a  temporary
statute,  as  its operation is limited to sales	 which	took
place  during the specified period, and that  period  having
expired,  no proceedings could now be taken on the  strength
of  the provisions of that Act, and reliance was  placed  on
the observations of this Court in <a href="/doc/656658/" id="a_320">Keshavan Madhava Menon  v.
The  State of Bombay</a> (3), in support of this position.	 But
the  impugned Act is in no sense a temporary Act.  Its	life
is  not limited to any specified period.  It is a  permanent
statute	 operating on all sales which took place during	 the
specified  period.   The fallacy in this contention  of	 the
petitioners  lies in mixing up the period, the sales  during
which are brought within the operation of the Act, with	 the
period	of the operation of the Act itself.  The former	 may
be said to be temporary, but the latter clearly is not.
(IV) It	 is  next contended that even if  the  impugned	 Act
authorised  starting of fresh proceedings for assessment  of
tax  on the Explanation sales which had taken  place  during
the  specified	period, no action in that  behalf  could  be
taken under<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_321"> s. 22</a> of the

<p id="p_114">Andhra	(Madras) Act, because it was, when it  was  enacted,
repugnant  to  <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_322">Art.  286(2)</a> of	the  Constitution,  and	 was
therefore  void.   It  is argued that  a  statute  which  is
unconstitutional is a nullity and must be treated as non est
and that the impugned Act could not infuse life into it.  It
may be open, it is said, to the Legislature of the State  of
Andhra	to  enact a fresh law giving it	 even  retrospective
operation  as  provided	 in the impugned  Act,	but  in	 the
absence of such a legislation, the provisions of the Act  as
they  stood  prior  to the impugned  Act  are  incapable  of
enforcement.	It  would  be  sufficient  answer  to	this
contention  that s. 22 of the Madras Act is only a piece  of
conditional  legislation, imposing tax on  interState  sales
when  Parliament should enact a law lifting the ban, and  if
such legislation is competent as we have held it is, then no
question  of unconstitutionality of the section when it	 was
enacted	 could arise.  But it would be more satisfactory  to
decide	the point on its own merits, as the question  raised
has been, of late, the subject of considerable discussion in
this Court.
</p><p id="p_115">Now,  in  considering  the  question as	 to  the  effect  of
unconstitutionality  of	 a statute, it is necessary  to	 re-
member	that unconstitutionality might arise either  because
the law is in respect of a matter not within the  competence
of  the	 legislature,  or because the  matter  itself  being
within	 its   competence,  its	  provisions   offend	some
constitutional	restrictions.	In  a  Federal	Constitution
where  legislative powers are distributed between  different
bodies,	 the  competence  of  the  legislature	to  enact  a
particular  law must depend upon whether the topic  of	that
legislation  has  been assigned by the <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_323">Constitution  Act</a>  to
that  legislature.  Thus, a law of the State on an Entry  in
List  1,  Sch.	 VII of the  Constitution  would  be  wholly
incompetent and void.  But the law may be on a topic  within
its competence, as for example, an Entry in List II, but  it
might  infringe restrictions imposed by the Constitution  on
the  character	of  the law to be passed,  as  for  example,
limitations  enacted in Part III of the Constitution.	Here
also, the law to the extent of the repugnancy will be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">1469</span>
void.	Thus,  a  legislation  on a  topic  not	 within	 the
competence  of the legislature and a legislation within	 its
competence but violative of constitutional limitations	have
both the same reckoning in a court of law; they are both  of
them unenforceable.  But does it follow from this that	both
the laws are of the same quality and character, and stand on
the  same footing for all purposes ? This question has	been
the  subject of consideration in numerous decisions  in	 the
American  Courts, and the preponderance of authority  is  in
favour	of the view that while a law on a matter not  within
the  competence of the legislature is a nullity, a law on  a
topic	within	 its  competence  but	repugnant   to	 the
constitutional	prohibitions  is only  unenforceable.	This
distinction   has   a  material	 bearing  on   the   present
discussion.  If a law is on a field not within the domain of
the  legislature,  it  is absolutely null and  void,  and  a
subsequent cession of that field to the legislature will not
have the effect of breathing life into what was a still-born
piece of legislation and a fresh legislation on the  subject
would  be  requisite.	But if the law is in  respect  of  a
matter	assigned  to  the  legislature	but  its  provisions
disregard constitutional prohibitions, though the law  would
be  unen.  forceable by reason of those	 prohibitions,	when
once they are removed, the law will become effective without
re-enactment.
</p><p id="p_116">Willoughby on the Constitution of the United States, Vol. 1,
at p. 11 says :
</p><p id="p_117">"  The	validity  of  a	 statute is  to	 be  tested  by	 the
constitutional	power  of a legislature at the time  of	 its
enactment  by  that legislature, and, if thus tested  it  is
beyond	the  legislative power, it is  not  rendered  valid,
without re-enactment, if later, by constitutional amendment,
the necessary legislative power is granted.
However,  it has been held that where an act is	 within	 the
general	 legislative  power  of the enacting  body,  but  is
rendered  unconstitutional  by reason of  some	adventitious
circumstance,  as for example, when a State  legislature  is
prevented  from	 regulating a matter by reason of  the	fact
that the Federal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">1470</span>
Congress  has  already legislated upon that  matter,  or  by
reason of its silence is to be construed as indicating	that
there should be no regulation, tile act does not need to  be
re-enacted  in	order to be enforced, if this cause  of	 its
unconstitutionality is removed."
</p><p id="p_118">In Cooley on Constitutional Law at p. 201, it is stated that
"  a  finding of unconstitutionality does  not	destroy	 the
statute	 but merely involves a refusal to enforce  it".	  In
Wilkerson  v. Rahrer (1), the State of Kansas had enacted  a
law  in	 1889 forbidding the sale  of  intoxicating  liquor.
This was bad in so far as it related to sales in the  course
of  interstate	trade,	as it was in  contravention  of	 the
Commerce  Clause.   But in 1890, the Congress passed  a	 law
conferring  authority  on the States  to  enact	 prohibition
laws.  The question was whether a prosecution under the	 law
of 1889 in respect of a breach of that law subsequent to the
Congress  legislation in 1890 was  maintainable.   Repelling
the  contention that the statute of 1889 was a nullity	when
it was passed and could not be enforced without reenactment,
the Court observed:
</p><p id="p_119">" This is not the case of a law enacted in the	unauthorized
exercise of a power exclusively confided to Congress, but of
a  law	which it was competent for the State  to  pass,	 but
which  could not operate upon articles occupying  a  certain
situation  until the passage of the Act of  Congress.	<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_324">That
Act</a>  in	 terms	removed the obstacle,  and  we	perceive  no
adequate  ground  for adjudging that a re-enactment  of	 the
state law was required before it could have the effect	upon
imported which it had always had upon domestic property."
It should be noted that in this case the law of 1889 applied
to  intrastate	sales also, and it was admittedly  valid  to
that   extent.	 The  impugned	legislation  was   therefore
unconstitutional only in part.	Rottschafer after  referring
to  the	 conflict of authorities on 'this  question  in	 the
States, refers to the decision in Wilkerson v. Rahrer (1) as
embodying  the	better view.  Vide  American  Constitutional
Law, 1939 Edn. p. 39.

be void ", Lord MacDermott
L.   C. J. observed:
</p><p id="p_122">" I am not aware of any authority for the view that language
such  as  this	necessarily means  that	 contravention	must
produce an actual gap in the statute book in the sense	that
the measure concerned, or some specific part thereof, simply
drops out of the authorized text.  As well as this  vertical
severability, if I may so describe it, I see no reason	why,
if  the	 circumstances warrant such a course, the  terms  of
<a href="/doc/164037896/" id="a_325">section	 5(1)</a> should not be sufficiently met by what  I	 may
call  a	 horizontal severance, a severance  that  is  which,
without	 excising  any of the text, removes from  its  ambit

Coming to the authorities of this Court where this  question
has  been  considered: <a href="/doc/1683423/" id="a_326">In Behram Khurshed  Pesikaka  v.	 The
State of Bombay</a> (2) the question arose with reference to the
Bombay	Prohibition  Act of 1949 which, subject	 to  certain

liquor.	 <a href="/doc/334293/" id="a_327">In The State of Bombay and another v. F. N. Balsara</a>

medicinal  and toilet preparations containing alcohol.	 The
appellant  was	prosecuted  for	 the  offence  of  consuming
liquor,	 and  his  defence was that he	had  taken  medicine
containing  alcohol.  The point in dispute was	whether	 the

not.  This

<p id="p_125">Court  held  that the onus was on the prosecution,  and	 the

the petitioners:
</p><p id="p_126">"  The constitutional invalidity of a part of section  13(b)
of  the Bombay Prohibition Act having been declared by	this
Court,	that  part of the section ceased to have  any  legal
effect in judging cases of citizens arid had to be  regarded
as null and void in determining whether a citizen was guilty
of an offence."
</p><p id="p_127">It  must  be  observed that the question  of  the  constitu-
tionality  of  the  Act did not arise  directly	 for  deter-
mination  and was incidentally discussed as bearing  on	 the
incidence   of	 burden	 of  proof.   And   further,   these
observations  have  reference to the enforceability  of	 the
provisions  of	the Bombay Prohibition Act,  while  the	 bar
under  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_329">Art. 19</a> continued to operate.  There was no  question
of the lifting of ban imposed by <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_330">Art. 19</a>, 'and the  question
as  to	the  effect of lifting of a ban did  not  arise	 for
decision.   In the context in which they occur, the words  "
null  and  void " cannot be construed as implying  that	 the
impugned  law  must  be	 regarded as non est  so  as  to  be
incapable  of taking effect, when the bar is removed.	They
mean  nothing  more than that the Act  is  unenforceable  by
reason of the bar.
</p><p id="p_128"><a href="/doc/1350547/" id="a_331">In A. V. Fernandez v. State of Kerala</a> (1) the question arose
with  reference to the Travancore-Cochin General  Sales	 Tax
Act   and   the	 Rules	made  thereunder.   Prior   to	 the
Constitution,  the assessees were liable to pay tax  on	 the
total turnover of sales including those inside the State and
those  outside the State.  Where the sales were of  cocoanut
oil,  there was a provision for deduction of the price	paid
for  the purchase of copra from the total  turnover.   After
the coming into force of the Constitution, a new section,<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_332"> s.

incorporating  therein	the  provisions	 of  <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_333">Art.  286</a>,	 and
consequent  thereon, the sales which took place outside	 the
State were excluded from the turnover.	On this,
(1)  [1957] S. C. R. 837.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">1473</span>
<p id="p_129">a question arose as to the quantum of deduction to which the
assessee  was entitled in respect of his purchase of  copra.
He claimed that he was entitled to deduct the price paid for
copra  not only in respect of oil which was sold inside	 the
State but also oil sold outside the State.  This  contention
was rejected by the High Court, which limited the  deduction
to  purchase  of  copra relating to the	 sales	inside'	 the
State, and in affirming that decision, this Court observed :
"  In our opinion, <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_334">section 26</a> of the Act, in  cases  falling
within	the  categories specified under <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_335">Article 286</a>  of	 the
Constitution  has  the effect of setting at  nought  and  of
obliterating  in regard thereto the provisions contained  in
the  Act  relating to the imposition of tax on the  sale  or
purchase  of  such goods and in	 particular  the  provisions
contained  in  the  charging  section  and  the	  provisions
contained  in  rule  20(2) and other  provisions  which	 are
incidental  to the process of levying such tax.	 So  far  as
sales falling within the categories specified in <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_336">Article 286</a>
of the Constitution and the corresponding <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_337">section 26</a> of	 the
Act  are concerned, they are, as it were, taken out  of	 the
purview	 of  the Act and no effect is to be given  to  those
provisions  which  would otherwise have been  applicable  if
<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_338">section 26</a> had not been added to the Act.  "
</p><p id="p_130">On  the strength of the above observations, the	 petitioners
contend	 that the provisions relating to  inter-State  sales
must  be  treated as non-existent, and	that,  therefore,  a
fresh  enactment of the statute would be necessary to  bring
them into operation.  Here again, the point for decision was
only  as  to  the effect of the ban under <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_339">Art.	286</a>  on	 the
transactions  which came within its purview.  That  ban	 had
not then been lifted and the effect of the lifting of such a
ban  on the existing law did not fall to be considered.	  We
are  unable  to	 read  the observations	 relied	 on  by	 the
petitioners as implying that s. 22 of the Madras Act must be
taken to have been blotted out of the statute book.
A  case	 directly in point is <a href="/doc/762155/" id="a_340">Bhikaji  Narayan	Dhakras	 and
others	v.  The	 State of Madhya Pradesh  and  another</a>	(1).
There, the question arose with reference
(1)  [1955] 2 S. C. R. 589.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">1474</span>
<p id="p_131">to  the C. P. &amp; <a href="/doc/1470394/" id="a_341">Berar Motor Vehicles (Amendment)  Act</a>,	1947
(Act  3 of 1948).  <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_342">That Act</a> had amended<a href="/doc/292729/" id="a_343"> s. 43</a> of  the  Motor
Vehicles   Act,	 1939,	by  introducing	  provisions   which
authorised the Provincial Government " to take up the entire
motor  transport  business  in the Province and	 run  it  in
competition  with  and	even  to  the  exclusion  of   motor
transport operators ". These provisions, though valid at the
time when they were enacted, became void on the coming	into
force  of  the	Constitution as	 infringing  the  rights  of
citizens  to carry on business, protected by <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_344">Art.  19(1)(g).</a>
The Constitution, however, was amended on June 18,1951,	 and
<a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_345">Art. 19(6)</a> was amended so as to authorise the State to carry
on  business  " to the exclusion, complete  or	partial,  of
citizens  or otherwise ". Subsequent to this amendment,	 the
Government  issued  a  notification  under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_346"> s.	43</a>  of	 the
Amendment  Act	of  1948, and it was the  validity  of	that
notification that was in issue.	 The contention was that  as
s. 43 of the Act of 1948 had become void at the date of	 the
Constitution, a notification issued by the Government  under
that section after the date of the amendment of the  Consti-
tution was not valid, as it must be taken to have become non
est.   It  was held by this Court that<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_347"> s. 43</a> of the  Act  of
1948  could  not  be held to have been effaced	out  of	 the
statute	  book,	  because  it  continued   to	operate	  on
transactions   prior  to  the  coming  into  force  of	 the
Constitution, and that even after the Constitution, it would
be  operative as against non-citizens, that the	 consequence
of<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_348"> s. 43</a> being repugnant to <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_349">Art. 19(1)(g)</a> was that it  could
not be enforced so long as the prohibition contained therein
was  in force, but that when once that prohibition had	been
removed as it was by the First Amendment, the provisions  of
that  Act which had been dormant all the time became  active
and enforceable.
</p><p id="p_132">The result of the authorities may thus be summed up:   Where
an enactment is unconstitutional in part but valid as to the
rest, assuming of course that the two	portions	 are
severable,  it cannot be held to have been wiped out of	 the
statute	 book  as it admittedly must remain  there  for	 the
purpose of enforcement of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">1475</span>
the  valid portion thereof, and being on the  statute  book,
even that portion which is unenforceable on the ground	that
it is unconstitutional will operate proprio vigore when	 the
Constitutional	bar is removed, and there is no need  for  a
fresh legislation to give effect thereto.  On this view, the
contention   of	 the  petitioners  with	 reference  to	 the
Explanation  in	 s. 22 of the Madras Act  must	fail.	That
Explanation  operates, as already stated, on two classes  of
transactions.	It  renders taxation of sales in  which	 the
property  in the goods passes in Madras but  delivery  takes
place  outside	Madras illegal on the ground that  they	 are
outside	 sales	falling	 within <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_350">Art. 286(1)  (a).</a>   It	also
authorises  the imposition of tax on the sales in which	 the
property  in the goods passes outside Madras but  goods	 are
delivered for consumption within Madras.  It is valid in  so
far as it prohibits tax on outside sales, but invalid in  so
far  as sales in which goods are delivered inside the  State
are  concerned, because such sales are bit by  <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_351">Art.  286(2).</a>
The fact that it is invalid as to a part has not the  effect
of  obliterating it out of the statute book, because  it  is
valid as to a part and has to remain in the statute book for
being enforced as to that part.	 The result of the enactment
of  the impugned Act is to lift the ban under  <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_352">Art.  286(2</a>),
and  the  consequence  of it is that  that  portion  of	 the
Explanation  which relates to sales in which  property	paws
outside Madras but the goods are delivered inside Madras and
which	was   unenforceable   before,	became	 valid	 and
enforceable.   In this view, we do not feel called  upon  to
express	 any  opinion  as  to  whether	it  would  make	 any
difference  in	the  result if the  impugned  provision	 was
unconstitutional in its entirety.

repugnant  to the provisions of Part III.  We are  concerned
in  these  petitions  not with infringement of	any  of	 the
provisions of Part III but of <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_356">Art. 286(2</a>), and the point for
our decision is as to the effect of the infringement of that
provision.   <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_357">Art. 286(2)</a> does not provide that a  law  which
contravenes  it	 is  void, and when regard  is	had  to	 the
context	 of  that  provision, it is difficult  to  draw	 the
inference  that that is the consequence of contravention  of
that provision.	 <a href="/doc/162232/" id="a_358">Art. 372(1)</a> provides for the continuance in
force of all laws existing at the date of the  Constitution.
The proviso to <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_359">Art. 286(2)</a> enacts that the President may  by
an order continue the operation of the Sales Tax Laws up  to
March 31, 1951, and <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_360">Art. 286(2)</a> itself enacts that no law of
a  State shall impose a tax.  In the context in	 which	they
occur,	the true meaning to be given to these words  is,  as
already observed, that no law of a State shall be  effective
to impose a tax; that is to say, the law cannot be  enforced
in so far as it imposes such a tax.  Whether we consider the
question  on  broad  principles	 as to	the  effect  of	 un-
constitutionality  of a statute or on the language  of	<a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_361">Art.
286(2</a>),	 the  conclusion is inescapable that s.	 22  of	 the
Madras	Act  and the corresponding provisions in  the  other
statutes  cannot be held to be null and void and non est  by
reason of their being, repugnant to <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_362">Art. 286(2)</a> and the	 bar
under  that  Article having been now removed,  there  is  no
legal impediment to effect being given to them.
(V)  We	 shall now deal with the contention of	the  learned
counsel	 for  the Madura Mills Ltd., who struck a  new	path
cutting	 across the lines on which the petitioners  and	 the
other interveners proceeded.  He contended that the decisive
factor in the determination of the question was Entry 42  in
List  I	 of  the Seventh Schedule,  "Inter-State  trade	 and
commerce",  that  under	 that  Entry,  Parliament  had	 the
exclusive  power  to enact laws in  respect  of	 inter-State
trade  and commerce and that included power to impose a	 tax
on  inter-State	 sales,	 that the States  had  therefore  no
competence  under the Constitution to enact a  law  imposing
tax on such sales, that the laws passed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">1477</span>
by  the	 States after the Constitution imposing such  a	 tax
were ultra vires and void, that the impugned Act  purporting
to  give  effect to such laws was likewise ultra  vires	 and
inoperative,  and  that,  in  consequence,  the	 proceedings
sought	to  be taken under s. 22 of the Madras Act  and	 the
corresponding provisions in the sister Acts of other  States
were  unauthorised and illegal.	 The argument in support  of
this contention was as follows: Entry 42 in List I is  based
on the Commerce Clause of the American Constitution, <a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_363">Art. 1</a>,
s.  8  that  " The Congress shall  have	 power	to  regulate
commerce  among	 the  several States ", and  that  has	been
interpreted  by	 the Supreme Court of the United  States  as
meaning	 that  the  States  have no power  to  enact  a	 law
imposing a tax on the carrying on of inter-State trade (Vide
Robins v. Taxing District of Shelby County (1), or  imposing
tax on inter-State sales (Vide McLeod v. Dilworth Co.  (2)).
The  contents  of  Entry 42 are the same  as  those  of	 the
Commerce  Clause, and it must therefore be construed  as  of
the  same  effect.  It is also a  well-established  rule  of
construction that the Entries in the Legislative Lists	must
be  interpreted	 liberally and in a wide  sense.   The	true
interpretation	therefore  to be put upon Entry 42  is	that
Parliament  has, and therefore, in view of the	non-obstante
clause in <a href="/doc/671198/" id="a_364">Art. 246(1)</a> and of the words "subject to" in	<a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_365">Art.
246(3</a>),	 the  States have not, the power to  impose  tax  on
inter-State  sales.  <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_366">Article 301</a> which provides	 that  trade
and commerce in the territory of India shall be free is also
intended to achieve the same result.  It reproduces s. 92 of
the  Commonwealth  of Australia Constitution  Act,  and	 the
authorities  on that section have held that imposition of  a
tax  on	 inter-State  trade  would  be	obnoxious  to	that
provision.   That the freedom in <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_367">Art. 301</a>  includes  freedom
from  taxation is also implicit in <a href="/doc/1773635/" id="a_368">Art. 304 (a)</a> in which  an
exception  to <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_369">Art. 301</a> is made in respect of the  imposition
of tax on goods imported from other States.  The result	 is,
it is argued, that after the Constitution no law of a  State
can impose a tax on
(1)  (1887) 120 U.S. 489; 30 L. Ed. 694.
</p><p id="p_134">(2)  (1044) 322 U.S. 327 ; 88 L. Ed. 1304.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">1478</span>
<p id="p_135">inter-State  sales, and in consequence, s. 22 of the  Madras
Act, which came into force after the Constitution, would, if
it is construed as imposing a tax, be bad, and the  impugned
Act  which  proceeds on the view that the  States  have	 the
power to enact laws imposing a tax on inter-State sales	 and
seeks to give effect to them would also be  unconstitutional
and void.
</p><p id="p_136">This  contention  suffers,  in	our  opinion,  from  serious
infirmities.   It  overlooks that our Constitution  was	 not
written	 on a tabula rasa, that a Federal  Constitution	 had
been  established under the Government of India	 Act,  1935,
and though that has undergone considerable change by way  of
repeal,	 modification  and addition, it	 still	remains	 the
framework  on which the present Constitution is	 built,	 and
that the provisions of the Constitution must accordingly  be
read  in  the light of the provisions of the  Government  of
India  Act.  It fails to give due weight to the	 setting  of
the   relevant	provisions  of	the  Constitution  and	 the
interpretation	which  is  to  be put  upon  them  in  their
context.  In the Government of India Act, 1935, there was no
Entry  corresponding to Entry 42 in List I of the  Constitu-
tion.  But there was in List II, Entry 48 which	 corresponds
to Entry 54 in the Constitution.  It is not in dispute	that
under Entry 48 the States had power to pass a law imposing a
tax on inter-State sales, because the terms of the Entry are
wide  and  would include inter-State as well  as  intrastate
sales.	 It was on this view that the Provinces had  enacted
laws imposing tax on inter-State sales.	 Then the  Constitu-
tion  came into force, and it included for the first time  a
new Entry 42 in List 1. It also reproduced Entry 48 in Entry
54  in	List  II in terms,  for	 our  -purposes,  identical.
Having	regard	to  the connotation of	that  Entry  in	 the
Government of India Act, 1935, one would have expected	that
if  it	was  intended by the  Constitution-makers  that	 the
States	should	be deprived of the power to  tax  interstate
sales  which  they had under Entry 48 in the  Government  of
India  Act,  that would have been made clear  in  the  Entry
itself.	  It is material to note that while Entry 48 in	 the
Government
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">1479</span>
of  <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_370">India  Act</a>	was  "Taxes on the  sale  of  goods  and  on
advertisement ", Entry 54 in List II of the Constitution  as
originally  enacted was " Taxes on the' sale or purchase  of
goods  other than newspapers".	Thus, the  Constitution	 did
limit the scope of Entry 48 by excluding from it newspapers,
and  if	 it was its intention to exclude  inter-State  sales
from its purview, nothing would have been easier for it than
to  have  said	so, instead of leaving	that  result  to  be
inferred  on  a construction of Entry 42 in List  I  in	 the
light  of the American authorities on the  Commerce  Clause.
This Is strong indication that Entry 42 is not to be read as
including  tax	on inter-State sales.	This  conclusion  is
further	 strengthened, when regard is had to the  scheme  of
the  Lists  in	the  Seventh  Schedule	and  the   principle
underlying the enumeration of heads of legislation therein.
In List 1, Entries I to 81 mention the several matters	over
which Parliament has authority to legislate.  Entries 82  to
92  enumerate the taxes which could be imposed by a  law  of
Parliament.   An examination of these two groups of  Entries
shows that while the main subject of legislation figures  in
the  first  group, a tax in relation thereto  is  separately
mentioned  in  the second.  Thus, Entry 22 in List  I  is  "
Railways  ",  and Entry 89 is " Terminal taxes on  goods  or
passengers, carried by railway, sea or air; taxes on railway
fares  and  freights ". If Entry 22 is to  be  construed  as
involving  taxes  to  be imposed, then	Entry  89  would  be
superfluous.   Entry  41 mentions "Trade and  commerce	with
foreign	  countries;  import  and  export   across   customs
frontiers  ". If these expressions are to be interpreted  as
including  duties to be levied in respect of that trade	 and
commerce,  then	 Entry	83  which is  "	 Duties	 of  customs
including  export  duties  "  would  be	 wholly	  redundant.
Entries	 43 and 44 relate to incorporation,  regulation	 and
winding	 up of corporations.  Entry 85	provides  separately
for  Corporation tax.  Turning to List II, Entries I  to  44
form  one group mentioning the subjects on which the  States
could legislate.  Entries 45 to 63 in that List form another
group, and they deal with
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">1480</span>
taxes.	Entry 18, for example, is " Land " and Entry 45 is "
Land  revenue  ". Entry 23 is " Regulation of  mines  "	 and
Entry 50 is " Taxes on mineral rights ". The above analysis-
and  it is not exhaustive of the Entries in the	 Lists-leads
to  the	 inference  that  taxation is  not  intended  to  be
comprised  in  the  main subject in which  it  might  on  an
extended  construction	be  regarded  as  included,  but  is
treated	 as  a distinct matter for purposes  of	 legislative
competence.   And this distinction is also manifest  in	 the
language  of <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_371">Art. 248</a>, Cls. (1) and (2), and of Entry 97  in
List  I	 of the Constitution.  Construing Entry	 42  in	 the
light  of  the above scheme, it is difficult to	 resist	 the
conclusion  that  the power of Parliament  to  legislate  on
inter-State  trade  and	 commerce under Entry  42  does	 not
include	 a power to impose a tax on sales in the  course  of
such trade and commerce.
</p><p id="p_137"><a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_372">Article	 286</a>  has a direct bearing on the  point  now  under
discussion.  It imposes various restrictions on the power of
the State to enact laws imposing taxes on sale of goods	 and
one  of those restrictions has reference to taxes on  inter-
State  sales,  vide  <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_373">Art. 286(2).</a>  It is  implicit  in	this
provision  that it is the States that have got the power  to
impose a tax on such sales, as there can be no question of a
restriction on what does not exist.  That is how <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_374">Art. 286(2)</a>
has  been construed by this Court both in The United  Motors
case  (1) and in The Bengal Immunity Company case  (2).	  It
was observed therein that under Entry 54, as under Entry  48
of  the	 Government  of India Act, the power  to  tax  sales
rested	with  the States, and that <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_375">Art. 286(2)</a>	was  enacted
with the object of avoiding multiple taxation of inter-State
sales  in  exercise of the power conferred  by	that  Entry.
This  again strongly supports the conclusion that  Entry  54
must  be  interpreted as including the power to	 tax  inter-
State sales and Entry 42 as excluding it.
</p><p id="p_138">In  order  to  get over this  hurdle,  learned	counsel	 put
forward	 the contention that <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_376">Art. 286(2)</a> had reference	only
to  laws  which	 were  in existence at	the  time  when	 the
Constitution came into force, and that the
(1) [1953] S.C.R. 1069.
</p><p id="p_139">(2) [1955] 2 S.C.R. 603.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">1481</span>
<p id="p_140">power  given to Parliament was one to continue	those  laws.
Reference  was	made  to the proviso to	 <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_377">Art.  286(2)</a>  which
authorised the President to direct that the taxes which were
being  levied  by the State before the commencement  of	 the
Constitution might be continued to be levied until March 31,
1951,  and it was said that the power conferred	 under	<a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_378">Art.
286(2)</a> was of the same character, and that it merely enabled
Parliament to continue pre-Constitution laws.
Now, it cannot be disputed that the language of <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_379">Art.  286(2)</a>
would,	in terms, comprehend future  legislation.   Language
similar to the one used in <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_380">Art. 286 (2)</a> is also to be  found
in <a href="/doc/1921704/" id="a_381">Art. 287</a>, and there, it clearly has reference to laws  to
be enacted after the Constitution.  Indeed, it was  conceded
that on the wording of <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_382">Art. 286(2)</a> both existing and  future
legislation  would be included.	 But it was  contended	that
its operation should be limited to existing laws, because as
Entry  42 in List I includes tax on inter-State	 sales,	 any
law  of	 the State subsequent to the  Constitution  imposing
such a tax would be incompetent.  This, however, is  petitio
principii.  The point for decision is whether tax on  inter-
State  sales is included within Entry 42.  The inference  to
be  drawn from the plain language of <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_383">Art. 286(2)</a> is that  it
is  not.   It  is no answer to this to	say  that  Entry  42
includes it, and that, therefore, the meaning of <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_384">Art. 286(2)</a>
should be cut down.  We cannot accede to such a contention.
To  sum	 up: (1) Entry 54 is successor to Entry	 48  in	 the
Government  of	India  Act, and it would  be  legitimate  to
construe  it  as including tax on interState  sales,  unless
there  is anything repugnant to it in the Constitution,	 and
there  is none such. (2) Under the scheme of the Entries  in
the Lists, taxation is regarded as a distinct matter and  is
separately set out. (3) <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_385">Article 286(2)</a> proceeds on the basis
that  it  is the States that have the power  to	 enact	laws
imposing tax on inter-State Sales. it is a fair inference to
draw  from these considerations that under Entry 54 in	List
11  the States are competent to enact laws imposing  tax  on
inter-State sales.
</p><p id="p_141">We must now consider the arguments that have
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">1482</span>
been put forward as supporting the opposite conclusion.	  It
is  firstly  contended that the Entries in  the	 Legislative
Lists  must  be construed broadly and not narrowly or  in  a
pedantic   manner,  and	 that,	in  accordance	 with	this
principle,  Entry  42 should be construed,  there  being  no
limitation  contained therein, as inclusive of the power  to
tax  sales in inter-State trade and commerce.  The  rule  of
construction relied on is no doubt well-established; but the
question  is  as  to the application of	 that  rule  in	 the
present case.  The question here is not simpliciter  whether
a  particular piece of legislation falls within an Entry  or
not.  The point in dispute before us is whether between	 two
Entries	  assigned   to	 two  different	  Legislatures	 the
particular subject of legislation falls within the ambit  of
the  one  or  the other.  If Entry 42 in List  I  is  to  be
construed liberally, so must Entry 54 in List II be, and the
point is not settled by reference to <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_386">Art. 246</a>, Cls. (1)	 and
(3) and to the principle laid down in Union Colliery Company
of  British  Columbia v. Bryden (1) that where	there  is  a
conflict of jurisdiction between a Central and a  Provincial
Legislature, it is the law of the Centre that must  prevail.
<a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_387">Art. 246</a>, Cls. (1) and (3) have to be invoked only if  there
is  a  conflict as to the scope of two Entries	in  the	 two
Lists  and  not otherwise.  What has therefore first  to  be
decided is whether there is any conflict between Entry 42 in
List  I	 and  Entry 54 in List 11.  If	there  is  not,	 the
application of the non-obstante clause in <a href="/doc/671198/" id="a_388">Art. 246(1)</a> or  of
the words " subject to " in <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_389">Art. 246(3)</a> does not arise.
There is another rule of construction also wellsettled	that
the  Entries in two Legislative Lists must be  construed  if
possible  so as to avoid a conflict.  <a href="/doc/882976/" id="a_390">In Province of  Madras
v.  Boddu  Paidanna  and Sons</a> (2) the  question	 was  as  to
whether	 the  first sales by a manufacturer  of	 goods	were
liable	to be taxed by the Province under Entry 48  in	List
II,  or	 whether  it was really a tax on  excise  which	 was
within the exclusive competence of the Centre under Entry 45
in List 1. It was held by the Federal Court that the
(1) [1899] A. C. 580.
</p><p id="p_142">(2) [1942] F.C.R. 90.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">1483</span>
<p id="p_143">correct	 approach to the question was to see whether it	 was
possible to effect a reconciliation between the two  Entries
so  as	to avoid a conflict and overlapping,' and  that,  in
that  view,  though excise duty might in  a  extended  sense
cover the first sales by the manufacturer, in the context of
entry 48 in List II it should be held not to include it, and
that  therefore the Province had the right to tax the  first
sales.	 This  view  was approved by the  Privy	 Council  in
GovernorGeneral in Council v. Province of Madras (1).  If it
is possible therefore to construe Entry 42 as not  including
tax on interstate sales, then on the principle enunciated in
<a href="/doc/882976/" id="a_391">Province  of  Madras  v. Boddu Paidanna</a>	 and  Sons  (2)	 and
Governor-General  in  Council v. Province of Madras  (1)  we
should so construe it, as that will avoid a conflict between
the two Entries.
</p><p id="p_144">It  was also argued in support of the contention that  Entry
42 in List I must be held to include the power to tax,	that
that was the interpretation put by the American	 authorities
on  the Commerce Clause, and that there was no reason why  a
different construction ,should be put on Entry 42 in list  I
of  our	 Constitution.	It is true  that  our  Constitution-
makers	 bad  before  them  the	 Commerce  Clause  and	 the
authorities  thereon,  but it is a mistake to  suppose	that
they intended to bodily transplant that clause in Entry	 42.
We  had in the Government of India Act, 1935, a	 fullfledged
Federal Constitution in force in this Country, and what	 the
Constitution-makers  did  was  to draw	from  other  Federal
Constitutions of the world, adapt and modify the  provisions
so   as	 to  sent  our	conditions  and	 fit  them  in	 our
Constitution.  In this new context, those provisions do	 not
necessarily mean what they meant in their old setting.	 The
threads	 were no doubt taken from other	 Constitutions,	 but
when  they were woven into the fabric of  our  Constitution,
their	reach  and  their  complexion	underwent   changes.
Therefore, valuable as the American decisions are as showing
how the question is dealt with in a sister
(1)  (1945) L.R. 72 I.A. 91.
</p><p id="p_145">(2)  [1942] F.C.R. 90.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">188</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">1484</span>
<p id="p_146">Federal Constitution, great care should be taken in applying
them  in the interpretation of our Constitution.  We  should
not  forget  that  it is our Constitution  that	 we  are  to
interpret,  and	 that  interpretation  must  depend  on	 the
context and setting of the particular provision which has to
be interpreted.	 Applying these principles and having regard
to the features already set out, we must hold that Entry  42
in  List I is not to be interpreted as	including  taxation.
The  same remarks apply to the argument based upon s. 92  of
the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act and <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_392">Art.	 301</a>
of 'our Constitution.  We should also add that <a href="/doc/1773635/" id="a_393">Art. 304	 (a)</a>
of  the Constitution cannot be interpreted as  throwing	 any
light  on.  the	 scope of <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_394">Art. 301</a>  with  reference  to	 the
question of taxation, as it merely reproduces<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_395"> s. 297</a> (1) (b)
of  the	 Government  of --<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_396">India Act</a>, and  as  there  was  no
provision  therein corresponding to <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_397">Art. 301</a>,<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_398"> s. 297</a>  (1)(b)
could  not  have implied what is now sought to	be  inferred
from <a href="/doc/1773635/" id="a_399">Art. 304 (a).</a>
</p><p id="p_147">In the result, we are of opinion that if the States had	 the
power  under Entry 54 to impose a tax on inter- State  sales
subject	 only  to the restriction enacted in <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_400">Art.  286	(2</a>),
then  by  virtue of the impugned Act such  law	is  rendered
operative  and proceedings taken thereunder are	 valid.	  We
have  reached  this  conclusion on  a  construction  of	 the
statutory   provisions	bearing	 on  the  question   without
reference to the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution  which,
proceeding on the view that the States had the power to	 tax
interState  sales under Entry 54, has amended the  Constitu-
tion, and has vested the power to tax interstate sales
in the Centre.
</p><p id="p_148">(VI) Another contention urged by the petitioners is that the
levy  of tax proposed to be made by the Andhra State on	 the
sale  of yarn by them to dealers in the State of  Andhra  is
illegal,  because  under the Madras Act and the	 Rules	made
thereunder, where there are successive sales of yarn the tax
can  be imposed at only one point, and as the Government  of
Madras	had  already imposed a tax on the sale	within	that
State, a second levy on the self-same goods by the State  of
Andhra is unauthorised. and that therefore
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">1485</span>
the  threatened proceedings for assessment are	incompetent.
This  contention is clearly untenable.	When the Madras	 Act
provides  for a single levy on successive sales of yarn,  it
can  have only application to sales in the State of  Madras,
as  it would be incompetent to the Legislature of Madras  to
enact  a law to operate in another State.  But it is  argued
that  s.  53  of the Andhra State Act,	1953,  on  its	true
interpretation	enacts	that though for	 political  purposes
Andhra	is  to	be regarded as a  separate  State,  for	 the
enforcement of laws as they stood on that date it should  be
deemed to be a part of the State of Madras.  We do not agree
with  this  interpretation.  In our opinion, <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_401"> s.  53</a>  merely
provides that the laws in existence in the territories which
were  constituted into the State of Andhra  should  continue
to,  operate  as before.  In fact, by  an  Adaptation  Order
issued	on  November 12, 1953, even the name of	 Andhra	 was
substituted for Madrts in the Madras General Sales Tax	Act.
There is no substance in this contention.
</p><p id="p_149">(VII)	  Lastly,   it	 is  argued   that   the   <a href="/doc/774360/" id="a_402">Essential
Commodities  Act</a>  enacted by Parliament in exercise  of	 the
power conferred by <a href="/doc/1112282/" id="a_403">Art. 286 (3)</a> has declared that yarn is an
essential  commodity,  and that if the Madras Act is  to  be
construed  as  a  fresh enactment for the  Andhra  State  by
reason	of  ss. 53 and 54 of the Andhra State  Act  and	 the
Adaptation  Order dated November 12, 1953, then it would  be
bad  inasmuch as the procedure prescribed in that  provision
had not been followed.	The basis of this contention is that
the  Madras Act as applied to the Andhra State is a now	 Act
for purposes of <a href="/doc/1112282/" id="a_404">Art. 286 (3</a>), but that is not so. The Madras
Act  was in force in the territories which now form part  of
the Andhra State until October 1, 1953, and thereafter	that
Act  continues to be in operation by force of s. 53  of	 the
Andhra State Act.  Moreover, the Madras Act become operative
in  the new State of Andhra not under any law passed by	 the
Legislature of the State of Andhra but under<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_405"> s. 53</a> of a	 law
enacted	 by  Parliament and therefore <a href="/doc/1112282/" id="a_406">Art. 286	(3)</a>  has  no
application.   We should add that the <a href="/doc/774360/" id="a_407">Essential	 Commodities
Act</a> (LII of 1952) has itself
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_68">1486</span>
been   repealed	 and  is  no  longer  in  operation.	This
contention of the petitioners also should be rejected.
The  petitioners sought to raise certain  other	 contentions
such as that they are not "dealers" in the Andhra State, and
that  the  Explanation to<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_408"> s. 22</a> had no	application  to	 the
sales sought to be taxed, as the goods were delivered not in
the State of Andhra but in Madras.  But these are  questions
which  ought  properly	to be raised  before  the  assessing
authorities, and cannot be gone into in these proceedings.
In  the	 result, the petitions fail and are  rejected.	 The
petitions  have	 had  a	 chequered  career,  their  fortures
fluctuating  with changes in the interpretation of  the	 law
and in the law itself.	In the circumstances, we direct	 the
parties to bear their own costs.
</p><p id="p_150">SARKAR	J.-The	petitioners who are dealers in	cotton	yarn
carrying on business in the city of Madras had sold goods to
various	 persons  in the State of Andhra.  This	 State,	 the
respondent in these petitions, demanded taxes on these sales
under  the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_409">Sales Tax Act</a> applying  to	 its
territories.   The  petitioners challenged  the	 respondents
right to tax the, sales, and filed these petitions for writs
of  prohibition	 or  other suitable  writs  restraining	 the
respondent  from  levying and collecting the tax.   <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_410">The	 Act</a>
mentioned various kinds of sales which could be taxed  under
it. The procedures followed by the petitioners in  effecting
the  sales were diverse and have not yet  been	ascertained,
and it is not possible without such ascertainment to  decide
whether they are or are not taxable under the provisions  of
the  Act  read	with other relevant  laws.   To	 avoid	this
difficulty  it has been agreed between the parties that	 the
only  question	that will be decided on these  petitions  is
whether	 the respondent can tax a sale under which the	pro-
perty  in the goods sold passed outside the State of  Andhra
but  the goods were delivered in that State for	 consumption
there.	 Before	 proceeding to discuss this question  it  is
necessary to refer to certain antecedent
events.

though	 the  property	in  the	 goods	passed	beyond	 its

Andhra	is a new State which came into existence on  October
1,  1953.   It was created by the Andhra  State	 Act,  1953,
largely out of territories previously belonging to the State
of  Madras.  Later, the new State came to be  designated  as
the  State of Andhra Pradesh but I will refer to it  as	 the
State of Andhra or simply Andhra.  Section 53 of the  Andhra
State Act provided that the laws in force prior to the	Con-
stitution of the State of Andhra in the territories included
in  it,	 were thereafter to continue in	 force	there.	 The
Madras General Sales Tax Act therefor(, became applicable to
the State of Andhra and it became go applicable with the new
s. 22 previously added to it.  Subsequently, the Madras	 Act
as  applying in the State of Andhra was, to suit the  latter
State, adapted by substituting for the name Madras the	name
Andhra	wherever it occurred in that Act.  I will  hereafter
call this <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_418">Act the Sales Tax Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_158">Sometime  in  the  year 1954 the respondent,  the  State  of
Andhra,	 issued notices to the petitioners  demanding  taxes
under  its  <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_419">Sales  Tax Act</a>.  As I have	earlier	 stated	 the
petitioners  challenged the right of the respondent to	levy
the  tax  and  certain	correspondence	followed.   As	 the

instituted  the	 present proceeding,-, in July	and  August,
1955.

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_71">1489</span>
<p id="p_160">by  this  Court in the case of the <a href="/doc/608874/" id="a_421">Bengal  Immunity  Company
Ltd.  v. The State of Bihar</a>(1).	 This Court by its  judgment
pronounced, again by a majority, on September 6, 1955,	held
that until Parliament by law made in the exercise of  powers
vested in it under <a href="/doc/471187/" id="a_422">Art. 286(2)</a> otherwise provided, no  State
could  impose  any tax on a sale or purchase of	 goods	when
such  sale  or purchase took place in the course  of  inter-
State  trade  or commerce and the majority decision  in	 the
<a href="/doc/424874/" id="a_423">State of Bombay v. The United Motors (India) Ltd</a>. (2) in  so
far  as	 it decided to the contrary could  not	be  accepted
andfurther  that  the explanation in <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_424">Art.  286(1)(a)</a>did	 not
confer	any  right  on the State in  which  the	 goods	were
delivered  under a sale, to tax it notwithstanding that	 the
property in the goods passed in another State.
In view of this decision the respondent was advised that  it
could  not oppose the petitions and on October 21, 1955,  it
actually  filed statements in these  proceedings  submitting
that  the  petitions might be allowed.	Before	however	 the
petitions  could  be  heard and disposed  of,  an  Ordinance
called	the Sales Tax Laws Validation Ordinance,  1956,	 was
promulgated  by	 the President on January  30,	1956.	This
Ordinance  was	later, on March 21, 1956,  replaced  by	 the
<a href="/doc/1920625/" id="a_425">Sales Tax Laws Validation Act</a>, 1956.  Both these  enactments
were  in  identical terms.  The operative provision  of	 the
<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_426">Validation Act</a> is set out below.
</p><p id="p_161">2.   " Notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of	 any
court  no  law	of  a State  imposing,	or  authorising	 the
imposition  of, a tax on the sale or purchase of  any  goods
where  such  sale or purchase took place in  the  course  of
inter-State trade or commerce during the period between	 the
1st day of April, 1951, and the 6th day of September,  1955,
shall  be deemed to be invalid or ever to have been  invalid
merely by reason of the fact that such sale or purchase took
place  in the course of interstate trade or commerce  ;	 and
all  such  taxes levied or collected or purporting  to	have
been levied or collected during the

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_72">1490</span>
<p id="p_163">aforesaid period shall be deemed always to have been validly
levied or collected in accordance with law.  "
The  respondent	 was  advised that the	<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_427">Validation  Act</a>	 had
changed the situation and in view of it the petitions  could
no  longer succeed.  Thereupon, the respondent	on  February
19,  1957,  filed  fresh  statements  submitting  that	 the
petitions should be dismissed.	The petitions have now	come
up for hearing in these circumstances.
</p><p id="p_164">The   validity	of  the	 <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_428">Validation  Act</a>  itself  has	been
challenged.  But I do not think it necessary to decide	that
question.   I will assume that that Act is perfectly  valid.
It  does not however itself levy any tax.  Its only  effect,
so far as these cases are concerned, is to permit the  <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_429">Sales
Tax  Act</a>  to operate to tax sales which took  place  in	 the
course	of trade between Andhra and any other State  between
certain dates.I will not refer to these dates hereafter for
what Ihave to  say   applies to sales between them only.
As has been    agreed  between the parties, as mentioned  at
the commencement of this judgment, the only question that we
have to decide is whether a sale under which the goods	were
delivered in Andhra for consumption there though property in
them passed in Madras, can be taxed by the respondent.	Such
a  sale	 would	no doubt be a sale in the  course  of  trade
between	 Andhra	 and Madras.  It is said that  such  a	sale
cannot	be  taxed  by  the  respondent	notwithstanding	 the
<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_430">Validation Act</a>, because the <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_431">Sales Tax Act</a> does not-  purport
to tax	it.
</p><p id="p_165"><a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_432">Does  the  Sales Tax Act</a> then contain any  provision  taxing
such  a sale ? <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_433">Now the Act</a> authorises the levy of a  tax  on
sales as defined in it.	 A sale is defined in<a href="/doc/87571198/" id="a_434"> s. 2(h)</a> of the
Act.   It is not disputed however that that definition	does
not include a sale under which goods are delivered in Andhra
for consumption there but property in them passes in  Madras
and  no	 further  reference to	that  section  is  therefore
necessary.   It	 is  however said that	the  effect  of	 the
Explanation in<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_435"> s.   22</a> is to make such a sale, a sale within
the meaning of the  Act	 and therefore liable  to  be  taxed
under it. So   I  proceed to examine that section.   <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_436">Section
22</a> as it  stood at the relevant time reads thus:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_73">1491</span>
<p id="p_166">S.22.  "Nothing contained in this Act shall be deemed  to
impose, or authorise the imposition of, a tax on the sale or
purchase  of any goods, where such' sale or  purchase  takes
place
</p><p id="p_167">(a)  (i) outside the State of Andhra, or
</p><p id="p_168">(ii) in	 the  course  of the import of the  goods  into	 the
territory of India or of the export of the goods out of such
territory, or
</p><p id="p_169">(b)  except  in	 so far as Parliament may by  law  otherwise
provide,  after the 31st day of March 1951 in the course  of
inter-State  trade or commerce, and the provisions  of	this
Act shall be read and construed accordingly.
Explanation.-For  the purposes of clause (a)(i), a  sale  or
purchase shall be deemed to have taken place in the State in
which  the  goods have actually been delivered as  a  direct
result	of  such  sale	or  purchase  for  the	purpose	  of
consumption  in	 that State, notwithstanding the  fact	that
under  the  general  law  relating to  sale  of	 goods,	 the
property in the goods has by reason of such sale or purchase
passed in another State.  "
</p><p id="p_170">Does  the  Explanation in this section then  say  that	when
under  a sale goods are delivered in Andhra, the sale  shall
be  deemed to have taken place there though the property  in
the  goods  may have passed in another State,  for  example,
Madras ? It no doubt says, without specifying any particular
State,	that a sale shall be deemed to have taken  place  in
the State in which the goods were delivered under it  though
the  property in them has passed in another State.   But  it
seems to me impossible from the language used to say that it
contemplated  a	 case in which the goods were  delivered  in
Andhra though property in them passed in another State.	 For
the sake of clarity I have left out in what I have just said
the  term as to consumption in the State in which the  goods
were delivered and no question as to such consumption is  in
dispute in these cases.
</p><p id="p_171">The  Explanation opens with the words " For the purposes  of
clause (a) (i) ". What then is that clause ?
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_74">189</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">1492</span>
<p id="p_172">It  only contains the words "outside the State of  -Andhra".
It  completes  the sentence part of which has  preceded	 it.
The complete sentence says,
Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to impose, or  authorise
the  imposition	 of, a tax on the sale or  purchase  of	 any
good,,;, where such sale or purchase takes place
</p><p id="p_173">(a) (i) outside the State of Andhra.
</p><p id="p_174">It then savs that no tax shall be levied under the Act on  a
sale  which  takes place outside Andhra.  It is	 after	this
that  the Explanation comes and starts with the words "	 for
the purposes of clause (a) (i)".  These words must therefore
mean,  for  the purpose of explaining which sale  is  to  be
regarded   as  having  taken  place  outside  Andhra.	 The
Explanation  then is for this purpose.	I will now  turn  to
the   remaining	  and  the  substantive	  portion   of	 the
Explanation.   That  must  explain  when a  sale  is  to  be
regarded   as  having  taken  place  outside  Andhra.	 The
substantive  portion of the Explanation however	 mentions  a
sale  which  is to be deemed to have taken  place  inside  a
State.	 Keeping  its purpose in mind, it must be  taken  by
saying	that a certain sale is to be deemed inside a  State,
to  say that it is outside the State of Andhra.	 It  follows
that  the  Explanation does not contemplate that  the  State
inside which a sale is to be deemed to have taken place, can
be  the State of Andhra.  That State cannot be the State  of
Andhra, for then the Explanation would not show when a	sale
is  to	be  deemed  to be outside Andhra  and  that  by	 its
language  is  the  only purpose for  which  it	is  enacted.
Therefore the Explanation can only be read as  contemplating
a  State other than Andhra as the State inside which a	sale
shall be deemed to have taken place.  This is the inevitable
result	produced  by the opening words	of  the	 Explanation
understood  according  to  their  plain	 meaning.   So	 the
Explanation,  omitting	portions  of  it  for  the  sake  of
clarity, can only be read in the manner shown below:
For  the purposes of clause (a)(i) a sale or purchase  shall
be  deemed  to have taken place in the State being  a  State
other than Andhra, in which the goods have
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">1493</span>
been actually delivered notwithstanding that the property in
the goods has passed in the State of Andhra.
I  therefore find it impossible to say that the	 Explanation
states	that  a	 sale shall be deemed to  have	taken  place
inside	Andhra	if under it the goods  have  been  delivered
there  though the property in them passed in another  State.
The  Explanation does not hence, in my view,  authorise	 the
taxation of a sale under which goods are delivered in Andhra
though property in them passed in Madras.
</p><p id="p_175">The view that I have taken of the purpose of the Explanation
in<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_437"> s. 22</a> was taken of the purpose of the Explanation in <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_438">Art.
286(1)(a)</a>  in the Bengal Immunity Company case (1).  It	 was
said  at p. 646 of the report, " Here the avowed purpose  of
the Explanation is to explain what an outside sale  referred
to in sub-clause (a) is ". The language of the	Explanations
and  the  setting of each in its  respective  provision	 are
identical.   That  language  must therefore  have  the	same
meaning.   It is said that the consideration that  prevailed
with  the Court in the Bengal Immunity Company case  (1)  in
dealing with <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_439">Art. 286</a> cannot apply in dealing with<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_440"> s. 22</a> for
the  latter  is a provision in a taxing	 statute  which	 the
former is not.	But I do not see that this comment, even  if
justified,  would lead to a different meaning being  put  on
words  used  when they occur in a taxing statute  from	that
when they occur in a statute which does not purport to	levy
a  tax.	 As a matter of language only, words must  have	 the
same meaning.  The words "for the purpose of clause  (a)(i)"
must therefore have tile same meaning in the Explanation  in
<a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_441">Art.  286(1)(a)</a> as in the Explanation in<a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_442"> s. 22</a>. 1 am  unable
to  distinguish	 the present case from the  Bengal  Immunity
Company case (1) for the purpose of determining the meaning
of the words used.
</p><p id="p_176">It  is	then  said that the Explanation in  i.	22  has	 two
facets; that when it talks of a sale inside one State, it at
the same time necessarily talks of a sale outside all  other
States.	 Therefore it is said that when under a
(1)  [1955] 2 S.C.R. 603.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">1494</span>
<p id="p_177">sale  goods  are delivered in Andhra but property  in  .them
passes	outside	 Andhra, the Explanation at  the  same	time
makes  such  a	sale inside Andhra  and	 outside  all  other
States.	  I do not follow this.	 Why should the	 Explanation
in  this  <a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_443">Andhra Act</a> be concerned with saying  when  a	sale
shall be deemed to have taken place outside all other States
?  Andhra  cannot of course legislate for any  other  State.
Nor  is there anything in this Act which makes it  necessary
for the purposes of it to say when a sale shall be deemed to
be  outside all other States.  It follows therefore  that  a
construction  cannot  be put on the language  used  in	tile
Explanation  which produces the result of showing a sale  to
be inside Andhra and so outside all other States.   Further,
as I have earlier pointed out, the words " For the  purposes
of  clause (a)(i)" with which the Explanation  starts,	show
conclusively that it is necessarily confined to a sale under
which  goods are delivered in a State other than Andhra	 and
the  property  in  the goods passes in	Andhra.	  It  is  no
objection to this reading of the Explanation to say that the
<a href="/doc/264421/" id="a_444">Andhra Act</a> would then be saying when a sale is to be  deemed
to have taken place inside another State and it has no power
to  do	so as it can legislate only for itself	and  for  no
other  State.  Such an objection would be pointless  because
Andhra	by saying that a sale shall be deemed to have  taken
place  inside another State is only legislating	 for  itself
and  only  saying that such a sale is therefore	 an  outside
sale  so far as it is concerned and cannot be taxed in	view
of <a href="/doc/187873126/" id="a_445"> s. 22(a)</a> of its Act.  It may be that it is	possible  in
construing the Explanation in <a href="/doc/560327/" id="a_446">Art. 286(1)(a)</a> to conceive  of
two  facets  because that dealt with all States or  any	 two
States	at  a time and for all these  the  Constitution	 was
fully  competent to lay down the law.  That however  is	 not
possible   when	  construing  a	 law  passed  by   a   State
legislature.   Such  law cannot regulate the laws  of  other
States.	  And  in  this	 case  the  conception	is   further
impossible  because the language shows that the	 Explanation
is for explaining when a sale is to be deemed to have  taken
place outside the State of Andhra.  It is not meant to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_78">1495</span>
explain	 when it is deemed to have taken place	outside	 any
State  whatsoever that State may be.  I am therefore  unable
to see that the Explanation has any facet showing what would
be a sale inside Andhra.
</p><p id="p_178">The  conclusion that I reach is that the <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_447">Sales Tax Act</a>	with
which  these  cases are concerned does	not  authorise	'.he
taxing	of a sale under which goods are delivered in  Andhra
but the property in them passes in Madras.  In this view  of
the  matter  I	do not think it	 necessary  to	discuss	 the
various other grounds on which the respondent's right to tax
these sales was also challenged.
</p><p id="p_179">In the result I would allow these petitions.
BY  COURT:  In	view of the opinion  of	 the  majority,	 the
petitions  an dismissed.  The parties are to bear their	 own
costs.
