<p id="p_1">                      THE COURT        :      Neither the appellant nor the
           respondent is present nor represented.
</p><p id="p_2">                      In all probability, the main appeal seems to
           have    been     disposed    of.    The   application   has   become
           infructuous and the same is accordingly dismissed.

           Ledger as also in the database.
