HEADNOTE:
	    The	 first appellant is a manufacturer and	supplier
of
	metallic  yarn	under the name and  style  "Raplon  Mettal
ic
	Yarn" having its registered office at Udyognagar,  Mohamad
a-
	bad,  Gujarat within the jurisdiction of the civil court
at
	Kaira.	The  second appellant is the sister concern  of	 t
he
	first appellant.
	    The	 Respondent is a registered partnership	 firm  doi
ng
	business  in  metallic	yarn and other	allied	products
at
	Salem.	The first appellant entered into an  agreement	wi
th
	the Respondent on 2.10.74 whereunder the appellants were
to
	supply 5000 bobbins of Ruplon Metallic Yarn to the  Respon
d-
	ent  at	 the rate of Rs.35 per bobbin as stipulated  in	 t
he
	terms  of the agreement. Under clause (11) of the  agreeme
nt
	it  was provided that any dispute arising out of  this	sa
le
	shall  be  subject  to Kaira  jurisdiction.  Dispute  havi
ng
	arisen	out  of this contract, the Respondent filed  a	su
it
	against the appellants in the court of Subordinate Judge
at
	Salem  for the recovery of Rs.1,63,240 being the balance
of
	the  advance in the hands of the appellants and also  for
 a
	sum  of	 Rs.2,40,000 towards damages. The  appellants  int
er
	alia  took preliminary objection that the Subordinate  Jud
ge
	at  Salem had no jurisdiction to entertain the Suit  as	 t
he
	parties	 by express contract had agreed to confer  exclusi
ve
	jurisdiction  in regard to ali disputes arising out  of	 t
he
	contract on the civil court at Kaira. The trial court uphe
ld
	the prelimi-
	2
	nary objection and found that it had, in view of clause (1
1)
	of the contract, no jurisdiction to entertain the' suit.
It
	accordingly returned the plaint for presentation before	 t
he
	proper court.
	    The	 Respondent appealed to the High Court	against	 t
he
	order of the .Subordinate Judge. The High Court allowed	 t
he
	appeal,	 set aside the Judgment of the trial court,  with
 a
	direction to take the plaint on file and dispose of the su
it
	on merits and on other issues.
	    Hence  this	 appeal by the	appellants.  Dismissing	 t
he
	appeal, this Court,
	    HELD: That an agreement to oust absolutely the jurisdi
c-
	tion  of the court will be unlawful and void  being  again
st
	the public policy, Ex-dolo malo non oritur actio. [6G]
	    The	 jurisdiction of the court in the matter of  a	co
n-
	tract  will  depend on the situs of the	 contract,  and	 t
he
	cause of action arising through connecting factors. [7B-C]
	    So	long  as the parties to a contract do not  oust	 t
he
	jurisdiction  of all the courts which would  otherwise	ha
ve
	jurisdiction to decide the cause of action under the law,
it
	cannot	be  said  that the parties have	 by  their  contra
ct
	ousted the jurisdiction ofthe court. [8G]
	    Where  the	parties to a contract agreed to	 submit	 t
he
	disputes arising from it to a particular jurisdiction  whi
ch
	would otherwise also be a proper jurisdiction under the la
w,
	their  agreement to the extent they agreed not to submit
to
	other  jurisdictions  cannot be said to be void	 as  again
st
	public	policy. If on the other hand the  jurisdiction	th
ey
	agree to submit to would not otherwise be proper,  jurisdi
c-
	tion to decide disputes arising out of the contract it	mu
st
	be declared void being against public policy. [8H; 9A-B]
	    Where  there may be two or more competent  courts  whi
ch
	can entertain a suit consequent upon a part of the cause
of
	action	having	arisen there-within if the  parties  to	 t
he
	contract  agreed to vest jurisdiction on one such  court
to
	try the dispute which might arise as between themselves	 t
he
	agreement  would  be  valid. If such a	contract  is  clea
r,
	unambiguous  and  explicit and not vague, it is not  hit
by
	<a href="/doc/1625889/" id="a_4">sections 23</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/1224074/" id="a_5">28</a> of the Contract Act. This cannot be  unde
r-
	stood as parties contracting against the Statute. Mercanti
le
	Law and Practice permit such agreements. [11B-C]
	3
	    Where  such an ouster clause occurs, it is pertinent
to
	see whether there is ouster of jurisdiction of other court
s.
	When the clause is clear, unambiguous and specific  accept
ed
	notions	 of contract would bind the parties and	 unless	 t
he
	absence	 of  ad idem can be shown the  other  courts  shou
ld
	avoid  exercising jurisdiction. As regards  construction
of
	the  ouster clause, when words like 'alone', 'only'  'excl
u-
	sive',	and the like have been used, there may be no  diff
i-
	culty.	Even  without such words in  appropriate  cases	 t
he
	maxim "expressio unius est exclusio alterius'-expression
of
	one  is the exclusion of another may be applied. What is
an
	appropriate  case shall depend on the facts of the case.
In
	such  a	 case mention of one thing may	imply  exclusion
of
	another.  Where	 certain jurisdiction is  specified  in	 t
he
	contract, an intention to exclude all others from its oper
a-
	tion  may in such cases be inferred. It has therefore to
be
	properly construed. [12E-G]

<p id="p_19">	    Mr.	 Pinaki	 Misra, the learned counsel for	 the  appe
l-
</p><p id="p_20">	lants,	submits that Clause 11 of the agreement having	pr
o-
</p><p id="p_21">	vided  that  any dispute arising out of this sale  shall
be
	subject	 to Kaira jurisdiction, the parties are bound by
it
	and  the  suit could therefore have been filed	only  with
in
	Kaira  jurisdiction and not at Salem, and as such, the	Hi
gh
	Court  committed  error of law in setting  aside  the  Tri
al
	Court judgment and in directing the Court as Salem to ente
r-
</p><p id="p_22">	tain the suit. Mr. S.S. Javali, the learned counsel for	 t
he
	respondent,  submits that what is being called Clause 11
of
	the  agreement was only one of the general terms and  cond
i-
</p><p id="p_23">	tions  of  the sale and not a clause in the  agreement,	 a
nd
	that  even if it was construed as a clause in the  agreeme
nt
	itself it was not exclusive so as to take away all jurisdi
c-
</p><p id="p_24">	tions except that of Kaira.
	    The first question to be decided, therefore, is  wheth
er
	Clause	11  as aforesaid formed part of.the  agreement.	 M
r.
</p><p id="p_25">	Javali submits that Ext. B-1 is an order of confirmation N
o.
</p><p id="p_26">	68/59 dated 2.10.1974 from the Sales Executive for the fir
st
	appellant  to  the respondent acknowledging the	 receipt
of
	their  order and registering the same subject to  the  ter
ms
	and conditions 'overleaf'. The general terms and  conditio
ns
	printed	 overleaf included the aforesaid Clause 11.  We	 a
re
	unable to agree. Admittedly the parties have transacted	 t
he
	business on inter alia basis of Clause 11. There is,  ther
e-
</p><p id="p_27">	fore,  no escape from the conclusion that Clause  11  form
ed
	part  of the agreement and the parties would be bound by
it
	so long as they would be bound by the contract itself. It
is
	not  open to the respondent to deny existence of Clause	 1
</p><p id="p_28">1.
	The submission of Mr. Javali has, therefore, to be rejecte
d.
</p><p id="p_29">	    The next question is whether Clause 11 is valid, and
if
	so,  What would be its effect? As Clause 11 formed  part
of
	the  agreement it would be valid only if the  parties  cou
ld
	have  validly agreed to it. It is common knowledge that	 t
he
	law of contract only prescribes certain limiting  principl
es
	within	which parties are free to make their own  contract
s.
</p><p id="p_30">	An agreement enforceable at law is a contract. An  agreeme
nt
	which  purports to oust the jurisdiction of the Court  abs
o-
</p><p id="p_31">	lutely is contrary to public policy and hence void. Each
of
	the citizens has the right to have his legal position dete
r-
</p><p id="p_32">	mined  by  the	ordinary Tribunal except, of  course,  in
 a
	contract  (a) when there is an arbitration clause  which
is
	valid  and binding under the law, and (b) when parties to
 a
	contract  agree as to the jurisdiction to which disputes
in
	respect	 of the contract shah be subject. "It has long	be
en
	established",  say  Cheshire and Fifoot,  "that	 a  contra
ct
	which  purports to destroy the right of one or both  of	 t
he
	parties to submit questions of law to the courts is contra
ry
	to  public policy and is void pro tanto". However,  arbitr
a-
</p><p id="p_33">	tion is a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">	6</span>
	statutory mode of settlement; and as a matter of  commerci
al
	law  and practice parties to a contract may agree as to	 t
he
	jurisdiction to which all or any disputes on or arising	 o
ut
	of the contract shall be subject.
	    <a href="/doc/1224074/" id="a_9">Section  28</a>	 of the Indian Contract Act,  1872  provid
es
	that every agreement by which any party thereto is restric

</p><p id="p_34">	ed absolutely from enforcing his fights under or in  respe
ct
	of  any	 contract,  by the usual legal	proceedings  in	 t
he
	ordinary tribunal, or which limits the time within which
he
	may thus enforce his fights, is void to that extent. This
is
	subject	 to  exceptions, namely, (1) contract  to  refer
to
	arbitration  and to abide by its award, (2) as a  matter
of
	commercial  law	 and practice to submit disputes  on  or
in
	respect	 of the contract to agreed  proper jurisdiction	 a
nd
	not  other jurisdictions though proper. The .  principle
of
	Private	 International Law that the parties should be  bou
nd
	by the jurisdiction clause to which they have agreed  unle
ss
	there is some reason to contrary is being applied to munic
i-
</p><p id="p_35">	pal contracts. In Lee v. Showmen's Guild, [1952] 1 All	E.
R.
</p><p id="p_36">	1175 at 1181 Lord Denning said:
	"Parties  cannot by contract oust the ordinary	courts	fr
om
	their  jurisdiction.  They can, of course,  agree  to  lea
ve
	questions  of  law,  as well as questions of  fact,  to	 t
he
	decision  of the domestic tribunal. They can,  indeed,	ma
ke
	the  tribunal  the final arbiter on questions of  fact,	 b
ut
	they  cannot make it the final arbiter on questions of	la
w.
</p><p id="p_37">	They  cannot  prevent its decisions being  examined  by	 t
he
	courts.	 If parties should seek, by agreement, to  take	 t
he
	law out of the hands of the courts and put it into the han
ds
	of  a private tribunal, without any recourse at all  to	 t
he
	courts	in cases of error of law, then the agreement  is
to
	that extent contrary to public policy and void."
</p><p id="p_38">	     Under <a href="/doc/1625889/" id="a_10">section 23</a> of the Indian Contract Act the consi
d-
</p><p id="p_39">	eration	 or object of an agreement is lawful, unless  it
is
	opposed	 to  public  policy. Every agreement  of  which	 t
he
	object or consideration is unlawful is void. Hence there c
an
	be no doubt that an agreement to oust absolutely the  juri
s-
</p><p id="p_40">	diction of the Court will be unlawful and void being again
st
	the public policy. Ex dolo malo non oritur actio. If  ther
e-
</p><p id="p_41">	fore it is found in this case that Clause 11 has  absolute
ly
	ousted	the  jurisdiction of the Court it would	 be  again
st
	public	policy. However, such will be the result only if
it
	can be shown that the jurisdiction to which the parties ha
ve
	agreed to submit had nothing to do with the contract. If
on
	the  other  hand it is found that  the	jurisdiction  agre
ed
	would also be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">	7</span>
	a proper jurisdiction in the matter of the contract it cou
ld
	not  be said that it ousted the jurisdiction of	 the  Cour
t.
</p><p id="p_42">	This  leads to the question in the facts of this case as
to
	whether Kaira would be proper jurisdiction in the matter
of
	this contract. It would also be relevant to examine if	so
me
	other  courts than that of Kaira would also have had  juri
s-
</p><p id="p_43">	diction	 in the absence of Clause 11 and whether that  wou
ld
	amount	to ouster of jurisdiction of those courts and  wou
ld
	thereby affect the validity of the clause.
	    The	 jurisdiction of the Court in matter of	 a  contra
ct
	will  depend on the situs of the contract and the  cause
of
	action arising through connecting factors.
	    A cause of action means every fact, which, if traverse
d,
	it would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove in order
to
	support	 his  right  to a judgment of the  Court.  In  oth
er
	words,	it  is a bundle of facts which taken  with  the	 l
aw
	applicable  to	them gives the plaintiff a fight  to  reli
ef
	against the defendant. It must include some act done by	 t
he
	defendant  since in the absence of such an act no  cause
of
	action can possibly accrue. It is not limited to the  actu
al
	infringement  of  the  fight sued on but  includes  all	 t
he
	material facts on which it is founded. It does not  compri
se
	evidence  necessary  to	 prove such facts,  but	 every	fa
ct
	necessary for the plaintiff to prove to enable him to obta
in
	a  decree.  Everything which if not proved  would  give	 t
he
	defendant a fight to immediate judgment must be part of	 t
he
	cause  of  action. But it has no relation  whatever  to	 t
he
	defence	 which	may be set up by the defendant nor  does
it
	depend	upon the character of the relief prayed for  by	 t
he
	plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_44">	    Under  section  20(c)  of the Code	of  Civil  Procedu
re
	subject	 to  the limitation stated therebefore,	 every	su
it
	shall  be instituted in a court within the local  limits
of
	whose  jurisdiction the cause of action, wholly or  in	pa
rt
	arises. It may be remembered that earlier <a href="/doc/74115/" id="a_11">section 7</a> of Act
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> 7</span>
	of 1888 added Explanation III as under:
	"Explanation III--In suits arising out of contract the cau
se
	of  action arises within the meaning of this section at	 a
ny
	of the following places, namely:
	(1) the place where the contract was made;
		(2) the place where the contract was to be perform
ed
	or performance thereof completed;
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">	8</span>
<p id="p_45">	      (3) the place where in performance of the contract a
ny
	money  to which the suit relates was expressly or  implied
ly
	payable."
</p><p id="p_46">	    The	 above	Explanation  III has not  been	omitted	 b
ut
	nevertheless it may serve a guide. There must be a  connec
t-
</p><p id="p_47">	ing factor.
</p><p id="p_48">	    In	the matter of a contract there may arise  causes
of
	action of various kinds. In a suit for damages for breach
of
	contract  the cause of action consists of the making of	 t
he
	contract,  and of its breach, so that the suit may be  fil
ed
	either	at the place where the contract was made or  at	 t
he
	place  where  it should have been performed and	 the  brea
ch
	occurred. The making of the contract is part of the cause
of
	action. A suit on a contract, therefore, can be filed at t
he
	place  where  it was made. The determination  of  the  pla
ce
	where the contract was made is part of the Law of  Contrac
t.
</p><p id="p_49">	But  making of an offer on a particular place does not	fo
rm
	cause  of  action in a suit for damages for breach  of	co
n-
</p><p id="p_50">	tract. Ordinarily, acceptance of an offer and its intimati
on
	result	in  a contract and hence a suit can be	filed  in
 a
	court within whose jurisdiction the acceptance was  commun
i-
</p><p id="p_51">	cated.	The  performance of a contract is part of  cause
of
	action	and  a suit in respect of the breach can  always
be
	filed at the place where the contract should have  perform
ed
	or  its	 performance  completed. If the contract  is  to
be
	performed  at  the place where it is made, the suit  on	 t
he
	contract is to be filed there and nowhere else. In suits f
or
	agency actions the cause of action arises at the place whe
re
	the  contract of agency was made or the place where  actio
ns
	are  to be rendered and payment is to be made by the  agen
t.
</p><p id="p_52">	Part  of cause of action arises where money is expressly
or
	impliedly payable under a contract. In cases of	 repudiati
on
	of  a contract, the place where repudiation is	received
is
	the place where the suit would lie. If a contract is plead
ed
	as  part of the cause of action giving jurisdiction  to	 t
he
	Court where the suit is filed and that contract is found
to
	be invalid, such part of cause of the action disappears	 T
he
	above are some of the connecting factors.
	    So	long  as the parties to a contract do not  oust	 t
he
	jurisdiction  of all the Courts which would  otherwise	ha
ve
	jurisdiction to decide the cause of action under the law
it
	cannot	be  said  that the parties have	 by  their  contra
ct
	ousted	the  jurisdiction of the Courts. If  under  the	 l
aw
	several Courts would have jurisdiction and the parties	ha
ve
	agreed	to submit to one of these jurisdictions and  not
to
	other  or  others of them it cannot be said  that  there
is
	total  ouster  of jurisdiction. In other  words,  where	 t
he
	parties to a contract agreed to submit the disputes
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">	9</span>
	arising	 from  it to a particular jurisdiction	which  wou
ld
	otherwise also be a proper jurisdiction under the law  the
ir
	agreement  to the extent they agreed not to submit to  oth
er
	jurisdictions  cannot be said to be void as  against  publ
ic
	policy. If on the other hand the jurisdiction they agreed
to
	submit	to  would not otherwise be  proper  jurisdiction
to
	decide	disputes  arising  out of the contract	it  must
be
	declared void being against public policy. Would this be t

	vest  the exclusive jurisdiction only in the Courts at	Lu
c-
</p><p id="p_80">	know.  A note of caution was sounded by M.P. Thakkar, J.
as
	he then was, in Snehal Kumar Sarabhai v. E.T. Orgn.,  A.I.
R.
</p><p id="p_81">	1975 Guj. 72 observing that the ouster clause could  opera
te
	as  estoppel  against the parties to the  contract,  but
it
	could  not tie the hands of the Court and denude it  of	 t
he
	powers	to  do	justice. Ordinarily, it	 was  observed:	 t
he
	Courts would respect the agreement between the parties whi
ch
	was borne out of the meeting of their minds out of conside
r-
</p><p id="p_82">	ation of convenience, but the Courts were not obliged to
do
	so  in every case; and that a new approach to  the  questi
on
	deserved to be made where the ouster clause was	 "calculat
ed
	to  operate  as an engine of oppression and as	a  means
to
	defeat the ends of justice." In such a case the free conse
nt
	may be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">	12</span>
	wanting and injustice may be avoided.
	    When  the Court has to decide the question of  jurisdi
c-
</p><p id="p_83">	tion  pursuant to an ouster clause it is necessary  to	co
n-
</p><p id="p_84">	strue  the ousting expression or clause properly. Often	 t

	stipulation  is	 that the contract shall be deemed  to	ha

	been  made  at a particular place. This	 would	provide	 t
he
	connecting  factor  for jurisdiction to the Courts  of	th
at
	place in the matter of any dispute on or arising out of th
at
	contract. It would not, however, ipso facto take away juri
s-
</p><p id="p_85">	diction of other Courts. Thus, in Salem Chemical  Industri
es
	v.  Bird  &amp; Co., A.I.R. 1979 Madras 16 where the  terms	 a
nd
	conditions  attached to the quotation contained an  arbitr
a-

	quotation shall be deemed to be a contract made in  Calcut
ta
	and  any  dispute arising therefrom shall be settled  by
an
	Arbitrator to be jointly appointed by us", it was held	th
at
	it merely fixed the situs of the contract at Calcutta and
it
	did  not  mean to confer an exclusive  jurisdiction  on	 t
he
	Court  at Calcutta, and when a part of the cause  of  acti
on
	had  arisen at Salem, the Court there had also	jurisdicti
on
	to  entertain  the suit under section 20(c) of the  Code
of
	Civil Procedure.
</p><p id="p_87">	    From  the foregoing decisions it can be  reasonably	 d
e-
</p><p id="p_88">	duced that where such an ouster clause occurs, it is  pert
i-
</p><p id="p_89">	nent to see whether there is ouster of jurisdiction of oth
er
	Courts.	 When the clause is clear, unambiguous and  specif
ic
	accepted  notions  of contract would bind  the	parties	 a
nd
	unless the absence of ad idem can be shown, the other Cour
ts
	should	avoid exercising jurisdiction. As regards  constru
c-
</p><p id="p_90">	tion  of the ouster clause when words like 'alone',  'only
',
	'exclusive'  and  the like have been used there	 may  be
no
	difficulty.  Even without such words in	 appropriate  cass
es
	the  maxim 'expressio unius est exclusio  alterius'--expre
s-
</p><p id="p_91">	sion of one is the exclusion of another may be applied. Wh
at
	is  an	appropriate case shall depend on the  facts  of	 t
he
	case.  In such a case mention of one thing may imply  excl
u-
</p><p id="p_92">	sion of another. When certain jurisdiction is specified in
 a
	contract an intention to exclude all others from its  oper
a-
</p><p id="p_93">	tion  may in such cases be inferred. It has therefore to
be
	properly construed.
</p><p id="p_94">	    Coming  to clause 11 we already found that	this  clau
se
	was included in the general terms and conditions of sale a
nd
	the order or confirmation No. 68/59 dated 2.10.1974 with t
he
	general	 terms	and  conditions was  sent  from	 Udyognaga

	Mohmadabad, Gujarat to the respondent's address at 12  Sur
a-
</p><p id="p_95">	mangalam  Road Salem, Tamilnadu. The statement made  in	 t
he
	Special Leave Petition that Udyognagar, Mohamadabad, Gujar
at
	is within the jurisdiction of the Civil Court of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">	13</span>
	Kaira  has not been controverted. We have already seen	th
at
	making of the contract was a part of the cause of action a
nd
	a  suit on a contract therefore could be filed at the  pla
ce
	where  it  was made. Thus Kaira court would  even  otherwi
se
	have  had  jurisdiction. The bobbins of metallic  yarn	we
re
	delivered  at the address of the respondent at Salem  whic
h,
	therefore, would provide the connecting factor for Court
at
	Salem to have jurisdiction. If out of the two  jurisdictio
ns
	one  was excluded by Clause 11 it would not absolutely	ou
st
	the  jurisdiction of the Court and, therefore, would not
be
	void against public policy and would not violate <a href="/doc/1625889/" id="a_25">sections
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">23</span></a>
	and <a href="/doc/1224074/" id="a_26">28</a> of the Contract Act. The question then is whether
it
	can  be construed to have excluded the jurisdiction  of	 t
he
	Court  at Salem. In the clause 'any dispute arising  out
of
	this  sale shall be subject to Kaira jurisdiction' ex  fac
ie
	we  do not find exclusive words like  'exclusive',  'alone
',
	'only'	and  the like. Can the maxim  'expressio  unius	 e
st
	exclusio  alterius' be applied under the facts	and  circu
m-
</p><p id="p_96">	stances	 of  the case? The order of confirmation  is  of
no
	assistance. The other general terms and conditions are	al
so
	not  indicative of exclusion of other  jurisdictions.  Und
er
	the  facts and circumstances of the case we hold that  whi
le
	connecting  factor  with Kaira jurisdiction was	 ensured
by
	fixing the situs of the contract within Kaira, other  juri
s-
</p><p id="p_97">	dictions  having connecting factors were not clearly,  una
m-
</p><p id="p_98">	biguously  and explicitly excluded. That being the  positi

	it  could not be said that the jurisdiction of the Court
at
	Salem  which  Court  otherwise had  jurisdiction  under	 l
aw
	through connecting factor of delivery of goods there at	 w
as
	expressly excluded. We accordingly find no error or infirm
i-
</p><p id="p_99">	ty in the impugned judgment of the High Court.
	    In	the result, this appeal fails and is dismissed.	 W
