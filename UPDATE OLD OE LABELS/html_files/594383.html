HEADNOTE:
A  Swiss  company,  Ciba Ltd.  'of  Basic,  carried  on	 the
business  of  selling  its  products  in  India,  through  a
subsidiary called Ciba (India) Ltd.  After the incorporation
of  the	 assessee the activities of the Swiss Co.  in  India
were bifurcated : the pharmaceutical section was taken	over
by  the assessee Ciba of India Ltd. and the other  lines  of
business  were continued by Ciba (India) Ltd.  An  agreement
was entered into between the Swiss Co. and the assessee	 for
providing  the latter with technical assistance for  running
the business.  The Swiss Co., which was continually carrying
on research had agreed to make the, results available to the
assesse,  and  the assessee was	 expressly  prohibited	from
divulging confidential information to third parties  without
the  consent of the Swiss Co. A licence was granted  to	 the
assessee  to use the Swiss Co's patents and trade  marks  in
India.	The licence was to be for a period of 5 years liable
to  be terminated in certain eventualities even	 before	 the
expiry	of that period.	 It was subject to  rights  actually
granted	 or  which  may be granted after  the  date  of	 the
'agreement  to	others.	 In consideration of  the  right  to
receive	 scientific  and technical assistance  the  assessee
stipulated to make certain recurrent contributions dependent
upon  the  sales and only for the period of  the  agreement.
'Pursuant to this agreement, the 'assessee paid diverse sums
of  money  to the Swiss Co. and claimed them  as  admissible
deductions  either under s. 10(2) (xii) or s. 10(2) (xv)  of
the   <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_1">Indian  Income-tax  Act</a>,	1922,  in  proceedings	 for
assessment to tax.
The  Swiss Co. had also entered into an agreement  with	 May
and  Baker  Ltd.  of  England, who  were  also	carrying  on
business as pharmaceutical manufacturers in India.  By	that
agreement the two companies mutually agreed to grant to	 one
another	 a  non-exclusive  licence  in	respect	 of  certain
products  in different countries including India.  By cl.  5
of  the	 agreement  the two companies  agreed  to  take	 all
necessary steps to defend patents granted to or applied	 for
in  respect  of	 those products	 against  infringement,	 and
agreed	to  share  equally all costs incurred.	 In  a	suit
instituted  by	May and Baker against M/s.  Boots  Drug	 Co.
alleging that the latter has infringed the Indian patents of
the  plaintiffs.  May and Baker had co incur  certain  costs
and the Swiss Co. paid its share to May and Baker as per the
terms  of  cl. 5 of the agreement.  The	 assesse  reimbursed
that amount to the Swiss Co. and claimed it as a permissible
deduction under<a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_2"> s. 10(2)</a> (xv) in proceedings for  assessment
to tax
The High Court, on reference, held in favour of the assesses
that  the first claim was an admissible deduction  under <a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_3"> s.
10(2)</a>  (xv) but not under s: 10(2) (xii), and held that	 the
second claim was not a permissible deduction.
In  appeals,  by  the Commissioner  of	Income-tax  and	 the
assessee,
HELD  : (1) Expenditure (not being in the nature of  capital
expenditure)  laid  out or expended on	scientific  research
relating to the business
69 7
of a person is an admissible allowance under<a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_4"> s. 10(2)</a>  (xii)
if the expenditure was laid out or expended by the assessee.
In the present case, the amounts paid to the Swiss Co.	were
not  laid  out	or expended by the  assesses  on  scientific
research relating to the business of the assessee.   Payment
made  to  recoup  another  for	expenditure  for  scientific
research  incurred  by	that other person, even	 if  it	 may
ultimately benefit the assessee is, unless it is carried  on
for or on behalf of the assessee, not expenditure, laid	 out
or  expended  in relation to the business of  the  assessee.
Therefore, the expenditure was not allowable under<a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_5"> s.  10(2)</a>
(xii). [701 G-H; 702 A-B]
But,  it was an admissible allowance under<a href="/doc/1954990/" id="a_6"> s. 10</a>  (2)  (xv),
because, the expenditure incurred by the assessee was not an
allowance of the nature described in cls. (i) to (xiv) of<a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_7"> s.
10(2)</a>, it was laid out or expended wholly or exclusively for
the purpose of the business of the assessee, and it was	 not
of  a capital nature.  The assessee did not become  entitled
exclusively  even  for the period of the, agreement  to	 the
patents and trade marks of the Swiss Co.; it acquired merely
the  right  to	draw. for the purpose  of  carrying  on	 its
business upon the technical knowledge of the Swiss Co. for a
limited period; by making that technical knowledge available
the  Swiss Co. did not part with any asset of  its  business
nor  did the assessee acquire and asset or advantage  of  an
enduring  nature for the benefit of its business. [702	B-C,
H; 703 E-F]
Evans v Medical Supplies Ltd. v. Moriarty (H.  M.  Inspector
of  Taxes), 37 T.C. 540; Jeffrey v. Rolls Royce Co. Ltd.  40
T.  C. 443 and Musker v. English Electric Co., Ltd. 41	T.C.
556, referred to.
(2)  From  the terms of the agreement between the Swiss	 Co.
and  the  assessee,  the assessee was  entitled	 to  certain
Indian patents, but they did not include the Indian  patents
of  May	 and  Baker obtained by he Swiss Co.  from  May	 and
Baker.	 It could not therefore be assumed that the,  rights
to  patents  standing  in the name of  May  and	 Baker	were
available to the assessee under its agreement with the Swiss
Co.  The  rights  to the patents and  trade  marks  did	 not
devolve	  upon	 the  assessee	when  it   took	  over	 the
pharmaceutical	business  from Ciba (India)  Ltd.,  nor	 was
there any proof that the obligation of the Swiss Co. to	 pay
a share of the costs of the suit, incurred by May and  Baker
was taken over and transmitted by Ciba (India) Ltd., to	 the
assessee.   Therefore, the High Court was right	 in  holding
against	 the assessee regarding the second claim. [707	E-G,

question  was answered in the negative.	 Against the  answer
recorded  on the first question the Commissioner of  Income-
tax has appealed, and against the answer recorded on   the
second question the assessee has appealed.
The assessee which  was	 originally floated in the  name  of
Ciba,  Pharma Ltd., and is now called Ciba of India Ltd.  is
an  Indian  subsidiary	of  Ciba  Ltd.,	 Basle	(hereinafter
referred to as 'the Swiss Company') which is engaged in	 the
development,   manufacture   and   sale	  of   medical	 and
pharmaceutical	preparations.  The Swiss Company  originally
carried on business in India of selling its products through
a   subsidiary	 called	 Ciba  (India)	 Ltd.	 After	 the
incorporation  of  the assessee on December' 13, 1  947	 the
activities  of the Swiss Company in India were bifurcated  :
the  pharmaceutical section was taken over by  the  assessee
from  January  1,  1948, and the  other	 lines	of  business
relating  to  dyes  and	 chemicals  were  continued  by	 its
subsidiary  Ciba (India) Ltd., the name whereof,  was  later
changed to Ciba Dyes Ltd,
By  a deed dated December 17, 1947 the Swiss Company  agreed
with  the assessee in consideration of payment of  a  "tech-
nical  and research contribution for the use of	 its  Indian
patents	 and/or Trade Marks", to communicate the results  of
its  research work, insofar as they relate to  the  products

any  event under<a href="/doc/1954990/" id="a_21"> s. 10</a> (2) (xv).  The High  Court  disagreed

admissibility of an allowance under cl. (xii) of<a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_27"> s. 10(2)</a> is
that  the  expenditure	must  be laid  out  or	expended  on

marks  of the Swiss Company (Article IV, cis.  1 and 2)	 and
had further agreed (c) upon the termination of the agreement
for  any cause to cease to use the patents and	trade  marks
and   to  return  to  the  Swiss  Company  all	 copies	  of
information,  scientific data or material sent to it and  to
refrain from communicating any such information,  scientific
data  or material received by it to any person : (Article  V
cl. 3).
</p><p id="p_17">The  assessee did not, under the agreement, become  entitled
exclusively  even  for the period of the agreement,  to	 the
patents and trade marks of the Swiss Company : it had-merely
access	to  the technical knowledge and	 experience  in	 the
pharmaceutical field which the Swiss Company commanded.	 The
assessee was on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">703</span>
that  account  a mere licensee for a limited period  of	 the
technical  knowledge of the Swiss Company with the right  to
use  the  patents  and trade marks  of	that  Company.	 The
assessee contends that tile contribution for being permitted
to  have access to this technical knowledge for the  purpose
of  running the business during the period of the  agreement
falls  within  the terms of<a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_34"> s. 10(2)(xv)</a> of  the  Income-tax
Act, 1922.  That clause, insofar as it is material, provides
:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_19">	      "Such profits or gains shall be computed after
	      making the following allowances, namely
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_20">	      (xv)  any	 expenditure not being an  allowance
	      of the nature described in any of the  clauses
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_21">	      (i)  to (xiv) inclusive, and not being in	 the
	      nature  of  capital  expenditure	or  personal
	      expenses of the assessee laid out or  expended
	      wholly and exclusively for the purpose of such
	      business, profession or vocation."
</blockquote><p id="p_18">The expenditure incurred by the assessee is not an allowance
the  nature  described	in cls. (i)  to	 (xiv).	  Again	 the
expenditure  is laid out or expended wholly and	 exclusively
for  the purpose of the business of the	 assessee.   Counsel
for the Revenue however contends that the expenditure is  of
capital	 nature	 and on that account not  admissible  as  an
allowance in the computation of the taxable income.
The  assessee acquired under the agreement merely the  right
to  draw, for the purpose of carrying on its business  as  a
manufacturer and dealer of pharmaceutical products, upon the
technical  knowledge  of  the Swiss Company  for  a  limited
period	: by making that technical knowledge  available	 the
Swiss  Company did not part with any asset of  its  business
nor  did the assessee acquire any asset or advantage  of  an
enduring nature for the benefit of its business.
Counsel for the Commissioner strongly pressed for acceptance
of what he called the principle of the speeches of  Viscount
Simonds	 and  Lord  Tucker  and	 Denning  in  Evans  Medical
Supplies  Ltd.	v. Moriarty (H.M. Inspector of	Taxes)	(1).
Counsel said that it was ruled in that case by the  majority
of the House that money received 'by a tax-payer for  making
available to another person a right to technical  'know-how'
is  liable to be treated as a capital receipt.	It  must  in
the  first  instance be noted that the House  of  Lords	 was
dealing with the true character of a receipt by a  tax-payer
who  had made technical 'know-how' available to	 another  in
consideration of a certain payment.  The nature of a receipt
as capital or
(1)  37 T.C. 54).
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">704</span>
<p id="p_19">revenue	 is  not always determinative of the nature  of	 the
outgoing in the hands of the person who pays it.  Again	 the
view  expressed	 by the majority of the House does  not	 lay
down  any principle which may be of value in  deciding	this
case.  In Evans Medical .Supplies Ltd.'s case(1) the Burmese
Government  granted  a	contract 'to  the  taxpayer  company
engaged in the, manufacture of pharmaceutical products	with
a  world-wide  trading	Organisation  and  which  till	then
carried	 on business in Burma through an agency to set up  a
pharmaceutical industry in Burma.  The Company undertook  to
disclose  secret processes to the Burmese Government and  to
provide other information in consideration of the payment of
a  "capital  sum of pound 1,00,000".  The assessee  had	 not
entered	 into  any other similar agreement  with  any  other
foreign Government or any other party.	The Court of  Appeal
held that the amount of pound 1,00,000 arose to the  assesse
as a receipt of its trade. but a part of that sum which	 was
attributable  to  the disclosure of secret processes  was  a
capital receipt, and on that view remanded ,the case 'to the
Commissioners  to determine the part so	 attributable.	 The
speeches  of  the Law Lords in dealing with the	 appeals  of
'the Crown and the Company disclose a remarkable  divergence
,of opinions.  Viscount Simonds and Lord Tucker held that by
the  ,transaction  the assessee had parted  with  a  capital
asset for a price, and that the Crown could not be permitted
to  make out a new ,case that a part of the amount  received
by  the	 assessee  was capital and the	rest  income.	Lord
Morton	of Henryton agreed with the Court of  Appeal.	Lord
Keith  of Avonholm held that the amount in its enitrely	 was
received  'by  the  assessee in the course  of	its  trading
activity  and  Lord  Denning  said  that  he  could  see  no
,distinction   between	 the  money  paid   for	  disclosing
information  of	 secret processes and money paid  for  other
information, and that it was a single payment for "know-how"
in  the	 course	 of the assessee's trade and  was  on,	that
account	 income	 and  not capital, but since  there  was  no
finding	 that it was received in the course of the  existing
trade which was being taxed, it was not liable to be brought
to  tax.  The view of the majority of the House	 reached  on
different and somewhat contradictor' premises is of   little
assistance  in	deciding  this case.   In  two	later  cases
decided	 by  the  House of Lords : Jeffrey  v.	Rolls  Royce
Ltd.(1); and Musker v. English Electric Co. Ltd.(3), it	 was
observed that in Evans Medical Supplies Ltd.'s case(1) there
was  a	total  loss of the business of the  company  by	 the
communication of secret processes to the Burmese  Government
and on that account the company parted with an asset against
receipt	 of a capital sum.  In the case of Rolls Royce	Ltd.

as  to	improvements and modifications	in  manufacture	 and
design, instructing the licensee's personnel in their  works
and  for releasing members of their own staff to  assist  in
the manufacture -of engines by -the licensee was held to  be
received  on  revenue account of the taxpayer's	 trade.	  In
English	 Electric Company's case(1) the taxpayer  contracted
with  the Admiralty to design and develop a, turbine and  to
license its manufacture by a limited number of companies  in
the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada and also contracted
with  the Government of Australia and an  American  aircraft
manufacturing  corporation to license the manufacture  of  a
bomber	which the taxpayer had designed and  developed,	 and
received  fixed	 lumpsum  payments as  a  consideration	 for
imparting " manufacturing technique" to the licensee'.	 The
receipts were held to be income.
</p><p id="p_24">In the case in hand it cannot be said that the Swiss Company
had wholly parted with its Indian business.  There was	also
no, attempt to part with the technical knowledge  absolutely
in favour of the assessee.
</p><p id="p_25">The following facts which emerge from the agreement  clearly
show  that the secret processes were not sold by  the  Swiss
Company	 to the assessee : (a) the licence was for a  period
of   five  years,  liable  to  be  terminated	in   certain
eventualities  even before the expiry of the period; b)	 the
object	of  the agreement was to obtain the benefit  of	 the
technical  assistance  for running- the	 business;  (c)	 the
licence	 was granted to the assessee subject, to rights	 ac-
tually granted or which may be granted after the date of the
agreement  to other persons; (d) the assessee was  expressly
prohibited' from divulging confidential information to third
parties without the con-sent of the Swiss Company, (e) there
was no transfer of the fruits of research once for all : the
Swiss  Company which was continuously carrying	on  research
and had agreed to make it available to the assessee; and (f)
the  stipulated	 payment was recurrent	dependent  upon	 the
sales, and only for the period of the. agreement.  We  agree
with  the  High Court that the first  question	was  rightly
answered in favour of the assessee.
</p><p id="p_26">The second question relates to the admissibility of a  share
in, the costs incurred in a Civil Suit in the High Court  of
Calcutta  as an allowable expenditure under<a href="/doc/1541982/" id="a_35"> s. 10(2)(xv)</a>  of
the  Income-tax	 Act.	The relevant facts are	these  :  In
accordance  with the terms of the agreement dated  June	 18,
1948, the assessee took, over the pharmaceutical section  of
Ciba   (India)	Ltd.   The   pharmaceutical   stock-in-trade
together  with	all the pending contracts  and	orders	were
transferred to the assessee by Ciba (India) Ltd' which	then
had changed its name to Ciba Dyes Ltd.	Under an
(1)  4 T.C. 556.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">706</span>
<p id="p_27">agreement  between the Swiss Company with Messrs.   May	 and
Baker  Ltd., England-hereinafter called 'May and  Baker'-who
were   also   carrying	 on   business	 as   pharmaceutical
manufacturers  in  India,  the	two  contracting   companies
mutually  agreed  to grant to one  another  a  non-exclusive
licence in respect of "sulphathiazol products" in  different
countries  including India.  May and Baker had prior to	 the
date of the agreement obtained patents in India bearing Nos.
26513 and 36850, and the Swiss Company obtained the  benefit
of  'those  patents under the agreement.  By cl.  5  of	 the
agreement  the	two companies agreed to take  all  necessary
steps  to defend patents -ranted to or applied for by it  in
respect	 of "sulphathiazol products"  against  infringement,
and  agreed  to	 share equally all costs  incurred  and	 all
damages	 or other sums received in respect  thereof.   Under
cl.  8	of the agreement each party had to  take  all  steps
within	its power to secure the observance of the  terms  of
the  agreement	by its subsidiary or  associated  companies'
licensees and agents.  'Sulphathiazole' was sold in India by
the  .Swiss  Company and by May and Baker  under  the  trade
names of "Cibasol" and "Thiazamide" respectively.  In a suit
instituted  by	'May and Baker in the  Calcutta	 High  Court
against	 Messrs.  Boots .Drug Co. alleging that	 the  latter
had  infringed the Indian patents of the plaintiff,  it	 was
found  necessary during the progress of the suit  'to  amend
the  specifications  of	 the patents.  The  High  Court	 ,of
Calcutta made it a condition in granting the application for
amendment that May and Baker shall not institute any  action
for  ,any act of infringement of the patent committed  prior
to  the	 date of the amendment, and that they shall  pay  to
Boots  Pure  Drug  Co.	costs  of  and	incidental  to	 the
application  for amendment of the specifications.   May	 and
Baker  complied with the order of payment of costs  and	 the
Swiss  Company	_paid its share of costs to  May  and  Baker
under  the  terms of cl. 5 of the agreement.   The  assessee
reimbursed  that amount to the Swiss Company and claimed  it
as a permissible deduction in proceedings for assessment  to
tax.   The  Income-tax	Officer disallowed  the	 claim.	  In
appeal, the Appellate Tribunal held that in the payment made
by  'the  assessee  there was no  capital  element  and	 the
assessee  incurred  the	 expenditure in the  course  of	 its
business  and for the purpose of ensuring that	the  patents
with  which it was connected were not infringed.   The	High
Court held that the assessee company was not responsible for
the  payment because the liability of the Swiss Company	 had
not at any time devolved upon Ciba (India) Ltd. prior to the
transfer  of the business in the pharmaceutical	 section  to
the  assessee,	and ,since the assessee had  undertaken	 the
liability  to  satisfy,	 discharge and	pay  all  debts	 and
liabilities  of Ciba (India) Ltd. and of no  ,other  person,
the  assessee was not entitled to claim the amount  paid  to
the Swiss Company as an allowable deduction.  The High Court
also observed that since the agreement between Ciba  (India)
'Ltd.  and the assessee contained no clause for sharing	 any
expen-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">707</span>
<p id="p_28">diture between the assessee and the Swiss Company as was  to
be  found in the agreement dated November 15,  1944  between
May and Baker and the Swiss Company, the amount paid by	 the
assessee was not a permissible allowance, and even  assuming
that the agreement to assist implied a stipulation to  share
the  cost, the agreement was only prospective, and  did	 not
attract liability in respect of any infringement before	 the
date of the agreement.
</p><p id="p_29">Counsel	 for  the assessee contended in the  first  instance
that  under  the terms of the agreement	 between  the  Swiss
Company and May and Baker each Company became a licensee for
the patents of the other, and under the agreement with	Ciba
(India) Ltd. the assessee was entitled to the rights to	 the
patents	 of  May  and Baker and on that	 account  the  costs
incurred for defending the rights of the Swiss Company as  a
licensee  from May and Baker ensured for the benefit of	 the
assessee and the assessee in paying the amount 'to the Swiss
Company was acting for protecting its trading interest.	  In
the  alternative, it was contended that the  obligations  of
the  Swiss  Company  arising  in  respect  of  the  patents,
relating  to sulphathiazole were debts which.  Ciba  (India)
Ltd.  was  liable to discharge, and from Ciba  (India)	Ltd.
under  the terms of the agreement dated June 18, 1948,	that
liability devolved upon the assessee.
</p><p id="p_30">In  our view, the contentions cannot be accepted.  From	 the
terms  of  the agreement between the Swiss Company  and	 the
assessee  it  is  clear that the assessee  was	entitled  to
certain Indian patents 'but that did not include any  patent
either	in respect of "sulphathiazole" or  "thiazamide"	 ob-
tained	'by the Swiss Company from May and Baker.   The	 two
patents Nos. 27,825 and 29,117 obtained by the Swiss Company
and  the Indian Trade Mark No. 1621 in respect of  "Cibazol"
are  specifically  referred  to in  the,  Schedules  to	 the
agreement dated December 1, 1949.  The right to the  patents
of  May and Baker for the manufacture  of  "sulphalthiazole"
and the trade mark in respect of thiazamide did not  however
devolve	 upon the assessee.  It cannot therefore be  assumed
that  the rights to the patents standing in the name of	 May
and Baker were available to the assessee Jr  under	 its
agreement   with  the  Swiss  Company.	 No   argument	 was
apparently advanced either before the Tribunal or before the
departmental  authorities that the assessee was entitled  to
these patent rights, and no investigation was permissible on
that question in the High Court.
</p><p id="p_31">Suit  No.  890	of 1946 was filed before  the  assessee	 was
registered.   By  paying to the Swiss Company the  share  of
costs  in  that Suit No. 890 of 1946, the assessee  was	 not
seeking to protect its trading interest.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">708</span>
<p id="p_32">We also agree with the High Court that it is not proved that
the  obligation of the Swiss Company to pay a share  of	 the
costs ill Suit No. 890 of 1946 incurred by May and Baker was
transmitted from Ciba (India) Ltd. to the assessee.  We	 are
unable	to  agree  with the contention of  counsel  for	 the
assessee  that the Tribunal had found that liability of	 the
Swiss Company in regard to the payment of share of costs  of
May and Baker devolved upon the assessee.  The Tribunal	 has
riot expressly so found and there is no evidence in  support
of  that  view.	  In our view the High Court  was  right  in
answering the second question against the assessee.
Both the sets of appeals fail and are dismissed with  costs.
One hearing fee in each set.
