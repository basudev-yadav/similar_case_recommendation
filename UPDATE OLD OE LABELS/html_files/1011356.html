<p id="p_1">Shivaraj V. Patil,J.
</p>

<p id="p_2">	The only point urged by the learned counsel for the appellants
before us is that there was a transfer of right to use the machinery by
the respondent in favour of the contractors by collecting hire charges
looking to the clauses contained in the agreement.  As such it was
liable to pay sales tax under Section 5-E of The Andhra Pradesh
General Sales Tax Act, 1957 (for short 'the Act').  On behalf of the
respondent, the learned senior counsel made submissions
supporting the impugned order pointing out to the various clauses
contained in the agreement.
</p>
<p id="p_3">	Section 5-E reads: -
</p>
<p id="p_4">"5-E.  Tax on the amount realized in respect of
any right to use goods

Every dealer who transfers the right to use any
goods for any purpose whatsoever, whether or
not for a specified period, to any lessee or
licencee for cash, deferred payment or other
valuable consideration, in the course of his
business shall, on the total amount realized or
realisable by him by way of payment in cash or
otherwise on such transfer or transfers of the right
to use such goods from the lessee or licencee,
pay a tax at the rate of five paise in every rupee
of the aggregate of such amount realized or
realisable by him during the year;
</p>
<p id="p_5">Provided that no such tax shall be levied if the
total turnover of the dealer including such
aggregate is less than Rs.1,00,000/-."
</p>
<p id="p_6">(emphasis supplied)

	The respondent is owning Visakhapatnam Steel project.  For
the purpose of steel project, it allotted different works to contractors.
The respondent undertook to supply sophisticated machinery to the
contractors for the purpose of being used in execution of the
contracted works and received charges for the same.  The appellant
made provisional assessment levying tax on hire charges under
Section 5-E of the Act.	 The respondent filed writ petition seeking
declaration that the tax levied, exercising power under Section 5-E
of the Act on the hire charges collected during the period 1988-89,
was illegal and unconstitutional.  The appellant filed a counter
affidavit in the writ petition contending that the respondent was
lending highly sophisticated and valuable imported machinery to the
contractors engaged in the execution of the project work on
specified hire charges; the machinery was given in the possession of
the contractor and he was responsible for any loss or damage to it
and in view of the terms and conditions contained in the agreement,
there was transfer of property in goods for use and on the amounts
collected by the respondent as charges for lending machinery
attracted tax liability under Section 5-E of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_7">	The High Court after scrutiny and close examination of the
clauses contained in the agreement and looking to the agreement as
a whole, in order to determine the nature of the transaction,
concluded that the transactions between the respondent and
contractors did not involve transfer of right to use the machinery in
favour of the contractors and in the absence of satisfying the
essential requirement of Section 5-E of the Act, i.e., transfer of right
to use machinery, the hire charges collected by the respondent from
the contractors were not exigible to sales tax.	 On a careful reading
and analysis of the various clauses contained in the agreement and,
in particular, looking to clauses 1, 5, 7, 13 and 14, it becomes clear
that the transaction did not involve transfer of right to use the
machinery in favour of contractors.  The High Court was right in
arriving at such a conclusion.	In the impugned order, it is stated,
and rightly so in our opinion, that the effective control of the
machinery even while the machinery was in use of the contractor
was that of the respondent company; the contractor was not free to
make use of the machinery for the works other than the project work
of the respondent or move it out during the period the machinery
was in his use; the condition that the contractor would be
responsible for the custody of the machinery while it was on the site
did not militate against respondent's possession and control of the
machinery.  It may also be noticed that even the Appellate Deputy
Commissioner, Kakinada in the order dated 15.11.1999 in regard to
assessment years 1986-87 and 1987-88 held that under the terms
and conditions of the agreement, there was no transfer of right to
use the machinery in favour of the contractor.	Although it cannot be
said that the appellant was estopped from contending otherwise in
regard to assessment year 1988-89, it is an additional factor and
circumstance, which supports the stand of the respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_8">	In our view, no fault can be found with the order under
challenge.  In the light of what is stated above this appeal has no
merit.	Consequently it is dismissed directing the parties to bear their
respective costs.
