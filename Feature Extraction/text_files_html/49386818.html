       HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE S.P. GARG

PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.           We shall be referring to the parties as „Radico‟ and
„Carlsberg‟. We highlight that Radico Khaitan Ltd. hereinafter
referred to as „Radico‟ was the plaintiff and Carlsberg India
Pvt. Ltd. hereinafter referred to as „Carlsberg‟ was the
defendant.      In the suit filed by Radico against Carlsberg,
permanent injunction restraining Carlsberg from using the
numeral „8‟ as a part of its trademark was prayed for.
Damages      were      also   claimed.   The   action   is       one   for
infringement and in the alternative for passing off.
</p><p id="p_2">2.           Radico‟s case is that it is the registered proprietor
of various trademarks, having obtained registration in India
and „8 PM‟ is an essential, distinguishing and identifying
feature of the various trademarks, registration whereof has
been obtained by Radico. The registered trademarks are „8 PM
BERMUDA XXX RUM‟, „8 PM ROYALE‟, „8 PM EXCELLENCE
BRANDY‟ and „8 PM BERMUDA WHITE ORIGINAL‟.                         Apart
therefrom, Radico claims to be the registered proprietor of the
mark „8 PM‟ pertaining to whisky under Class-32 of the T.M.Act
1999. It is the case of Radico that between the years 2006 -
2007 till 2010 - 2011 its sales have ranged from minimum of
`2136.4 million to `2565.9 million.
</p><p id="p_3">3.           In a nutshell, Radico pleads a proprietary interest in
the mark „8 PM‟. It claims that the numeral „8‟ is an essential,




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">FAO(OS)-549&amp;567/2011                              Page 2 of 22</span>
 distinguishing and identifying feature of its mark in relation to
the font size and the colour with which the numeral „8‟ is
printed.
</p><p id="p_4">4.           Grievance in the plaint is to Carlsberg selling beer
by launching the product in February 2011 under the
trademark „PALONE 8‟ with the numeral „8‟ being used in the
same font and colour as is used by Radico. Further grievance
is that Radico‟s slogan „AATH KE THAATH‟ pertaining to the
whisky sold by it under the trademark „8 PM‟ has been piggy
ridden on by Carlsberg by using the slogan „8 KA DUM‟. The
grievance is to the stealing of the idea „AATH KE THAATH‟ i.e.
„the luxury of eight‟ by Carlsberg using the slogan „8 KA DUM‟
i.e. „the potency of eight‟, to the concept which emerges in the
mind of the buyer who, with the imperfect recollection of a
normal person remembering that Radico‟s product has a
feature of „the luxury of eight‟, with reference to Radico‟s
trademark „8 PM‟ would think, and associate, Carlsberg beer
when he sees the beer bottle with the label prominently
displaying the numeral „8‟ in the same font, size and colour
and styling as that of Radico and the slogan „8 KA DUM‟ and
think that he is seeing a product having same source as that of
the whisky i.e. being misled that the beer is a product of
Radico.
</p><p id="p_5">5.           Defence   of   Carlsberg   is   that    it   has      sought
registration of the trademark „PALONE 8‟ for beer in Class-33,
and that beer and whisky are different products and the
consumer of alcohol is an informed consumer and would not
be misled, as claimed by Radico, not only for the reason the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">FAO(OS)-549&amp;567/2011                                Page 3 of 22</span>
 two products are different but even for the reason the price
difference of the two products is substantial, in that, the
whisky sold by Radico is priced at `300/- per bottle and the
beer sold by Carlsberg is priced at `65/- per bottle. Secondly
that the numeral „8‟ is publici juris and common to the trade in
alcohol, inasmuch as it is used to denote the quality or the
character of an alcoholic drink; and being common to the
trade, Radico cannot appropriate the numeral „8‟ to its
exclusive use.         Thirdly that the cardinal numbers by their
inherent feature of being a cardinal number are bound to lack
distinctiveness in character. Fourthly, the trademark „8 PM‟ is
per se non-descriptive and registration being granted under
Part-B of the erstwhile Trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_1">Merchandise Marks Act</a> 1958
was proof of the weakness, due to non-descriptiveness, of the
mark. Lastly, Radico does not have any separate registration
for the numeral „8‟ as its trademark and thus cannot claim any
exclusive right over the numeral „8‟.       On said account, it is
justified in using the numeral „8‟ as a part of its trademark
„PALONE 8‟, in          respect whereof its application         seeking
registration was pending. It is pleaded by Carlsberg that since
the beer being marketed by it was a „Strong Beer‟ i.e. high in
alcohol content, it was entitled to use the numeral „8‟ to inform
the consumer, by way of description of its product, i.e. that the
beer had a strong alcoholic content. The slogan „8 KA DUM‟
was justified by pleading that it was conveying the „dum‟ i.e.
the potency of its product.
</p><p id="p_6">6.           An    analysis    of   the   impugned   order       dated
September 16, 2011, which we find is a fairly lengthy order,




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">FAO(OS)-549&amp;567/2011                             Page 4 of 22</span>
 needs to be penned by us, so that we are able to focus on the
issue which needs to be discussed keeping in view the rival
contentions.
</p><p id="p_7">7.           After noting the pleadings of the parties in the
plaint and the written statement and submissions urged by
learned counsel spanning the first 22 pages of the impugned
order,   the    discussion   commences   in   page    No.23    from
paragraph 20 onwards.        With reference to Section 29 of the
T.M.Act 1999 and with emphasis upon clause (c) of sub-section
4 of Section 29 and the rights conferred upon the registered
proprietor of a trademark as enumerated in Section 28 of the
T.M.Act 1999 and with reference to the exception carved out in
Section 30 of the T.M.Act 1999, the learned Single Judge has
concluded that a registered proprietor of a trademark cannot
prevent others from using a mark or a part of the mark if user
thereof is an honest practice in industrial or commercial
matters; and after noting the case law as to what would be the
objective standards of determining honest practice, the
learned Single Judge has opined in paragraph 27 that the same
has to be evaluated from two standpoints.         First, from the
standpoint of a reasonable person in the trade; and second
from the perspective of the practices prevalent in the industry
i.e. to see what others are doing in the same industry. The
learned Single Judge has concluded the general evaluation of
the law, as he understood and sought to apply, while deciding
the issue of interim relief prayed for in paragraph 32 of the
impugned decision as under:-
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">FAO(OS)-549&amp;567/2011                            Page 5 of 22</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">          "32.    The propositions which are emerging
         from the above-mentioned discussions are as
         under:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">         (a)     That <a href="/doc/24182/" id="a_2">Section 30</a> acts as an exception to

         trademark by anyone other than the registered
         proprietor if the use of the said trademark is in
         accordance with the honest practices in the
         industrial or commercial matters and is not such
         as to take unfair advantage of or be detrimental
         to the distinctive character or repute of the
         trademark.

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">         (c)      Honest         practices      in     the

                    industry."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">8.           The       second   distinct   conceptual       limb       of   the
impugned order commences with a discussion in paragraph 33
onwards, wherein the learned Single Judge commences the
journey by referring to the definition of the expression „mark‟
in Section 2(1)(m) of the T.M.Act 1999 and has highlighted that
it encompasses even a numeral being a mark, but has
immediately noted treatise and case law on the subject that
numerals notoriously lack inherent distinctiveness on account
of common and natural practice of they being indicative of
quality or characteristic of a product. Further discussion has



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">FAO(OS)-549&amp;567/2011                                    Page 6 of 22</span>
 led the learned Single Judge to take note of various alcoholic
drinks in the market having reference to the numeral „8‟; for
example, whisky sold under the trademark „SIGNATURE‟ with
the numeral „8‟ being displayed prominently on the label;
</blockquote><p id="p_8">„BACARDI 8 RUM‟ etc.      Therefrom, the learned Single Judge
has, with reference to common practice in the trade of alcohol,
brought out that the numeral „8‟ is common to the trade and
hence the non-distinctive character of the numeral „8‟ in the
trade of alcoholic drinks.      The learned Single Judge has
concluded the second conceptual part of the impugned order
by opining in para 40 as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">      "40. I find substance in contention of the learned
      counsel for the defendant that the numeral mark 8 is
      prima facie of non distinctive character. This is due
      to following reasons:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">           That the aforementioned analysis done by the
      defendants itself shows that major players or
      competitor like Bacardi, Signature and others etc.
      nationally and internationally use the numeral 8 on
      their label. Thus, it does not remain the case of
      mere formal entries on the register but also is
      backed by the substantive user of the other parties
      which negatives the claims of exclusivity.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">          There are authorities on the subject stating that
      there are some numerals like 8.5 or at least 8 which
      are requirement of the trade which denotes the
      strength. The said aspect further clarifies that there
      is some nexus of the numeral 8 in respect of alcohol
      drinks.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">           The plaintiffs are not registered for 8 per se and
      rather the registration is of 8PM in Part B of the
      register. The mark on part B was considered to be
      weak trade mark and rather prima facie descriptive
      one.    The exclusivity in the said mark can be



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">FAO(OS)-549&amp;567/2011                            Page 7 of 22</span>
       defeated by showing the evidence of non
      distinctiveness. In the present case, the same thing
      has been shown.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">           Overall by reading <a href="/doc/24182/" id="a_5">Section 30</a> of the Act and
      testing the numeral 8 on the principle of the same
      (which I have already dealt with above on honest
      practices of trade), the use of the numeral in these
      circumstances by a tradesman when there are such
      overwhelming user by other parties as stated above
      coupled with the nexus of numeral in the trade, it
      can be safely said that use of the numeral 8 by any
      other person including defendant in respect of
      alcohol or beers cannot be said to be dishonest and
      would be protected by <a href="/doc/24182/" id="a_6">section 30</a> of the Act."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_9">9.           With respect to an action for passing off and an
action for infringement of non-identical, but alleged to be
deceptively similar marks, the learned Single Judge has
proceeded to note case law on the point that the test in such
cases of deception is identical. The learned Single Judge has
then proceeded to note that though sold through the same
trade channel, beer and whisky were distinct products and has
highlighted that the consumer knows the difference.
</p><p id="p_10">10.          From paragraph 46 onwards, the decision appears
to be relating back to the earlier part of the discussion and the
conclusion arrived at in para 40 on the subject of the numeral
„8‟ being non-distinctive in character.     The learned Single
Judge has once again highlighted the three clauses of sub-
section 4 of Section 29 of the T.M.Act and the fact that Radico
had obtained registration of the trademark „8 PM‟ under Part-B
of the Trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_7">Merchandise Marks Act</a> 1958 and has
thereafter noted, in paragraph 49, <a href="/doc/1587254/" id="a_8">Section 17</a> of the Trade and
<a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_9">Merchandise Marks Act</a> 1958, to conclude that such marks are



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">FAO(OS)-549&amp;567/2011                           Page 8 of 22</span>
 prima facie non-distinctive and are descriptive.     The learned
Single Judge has once again held, what was previously held,
probably by way of re-emphasis in paragraph 53, that prima
facie infringement would be doubtful.
</p><p id="p_11">11.          The learned Single Judge has thereafter referred to
and distinguished a few judgments pertaining to a numeral
being an essential feature of a registered trademark.         The
discussion is to be found in paragraphs 54 and 55 of the
decision.
</p><p id="p_12">12.          In paragraph 56 onwards, the learned Single Judge
has discussed the issue in the context of passing off and by
applying the test of identity of composition, identity of
consumers, price ranges, consuming public, the goods being of
different composition i.e. beer versus wine and the price
differentiation, and with reference to the decision of the
Supreme Court reported as 2008 (10) SCC 723 <a href="/doc/507033/" id="a_10">Khoday
Distilleries Ltd. vs. Scotch Whisky Association &amp; Ors</a>. , has
opined that notwithstanding commonality in the trade channel,
it could not be prima facie established that there was
likelihood of deception and goods of Carlsberg being passed
off as goods of Radico.
</p><p id="p_13">13.          Discussing the issue of Radico‟s slogan „AATH KE
THAATH‟ and Carlsberg‟s slogan „8 KA DUM‟, the learned
Single Judge has opined that the said issue would be relevant
in the context of similarity in packaging and finding none, has
negated the plea of Radico.     Though not stated in so many
words, aforesaid can be gathered by an intelligent reading of
the second sub-para of para 72 of the impugned decision.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">FAO(OS)-549&amp;567/2011                           Page 9 of 22</span>
<p id="p_14"> 14.          However, with reference to the styling, the colour
used to print the trademark „8 PM‟ by Radico and the
prominence to the numeral „8‟ while depicting the trademark
„PALONE 8‟ by Carlsberg, the learned Single Judge terminates
the discussion by granting partial injunction in the following
words:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">      "76. However, I find some substance in the
      submission of the plaintiff about its grievance that
      the defendant is using the mark-8 in similar writing
      style and also in the golden colour which may be
      avoided. Thus, in order to avoid any confusion, I
      direct the defendant to use the mark PALONE and
      numeral-8 together in the same line. The numeral-8
      is allowed to be used by the defendant in different
      writing style in different colour other than in golden
      colour. This, I am directing this (sic) even (sic) to
      avoid any bleak chances of misrepresentation. The
      mark „PALONE 8‟ would be used by the defendant in
      the same size of lettering and fonts. The defendant
      is, however, granted time up to 31.12.2011 to make
      such changes and amendment in the packaging and
      advertisement material as well as in slogan "8 KA
      DUM" if used by the defendant at present. The
      defendant shall also maintain true statement of
      account for the aforementioned products and file the
      same in this case every quarterly with an advance
      copy to the plaintiff. The defendant is allowed to use
      the same as the manner mentioned above."

<p id="p_15">15.          We reproduce herein below the label put on the
bottle of whisky sold by Radico as also the label printed on the
cardboard box in which the whisky bottle is kept.             It is as
under:-
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">FAO(OS)-549&amp;567/2011                          Page 10 of 22</span>

</p>



<p id="p_17">17.          Now, injunctions are not to be granted in an action
for infringement of a registered trademark or an action for
passing off, to „avoid any bleak chances of misrepresentation‟.
The reason for the limited injunction granted by the learned




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">FAO(OS)-549&amp;567/2011                           Page 11 of 22</span>
 Single Judge is thus not sound. In fact, as was rightly argued
by Sh.Sandeep Sethi, learned senior counsel for Carlsberg,
para 76 of the impugned decision runs contrary to the
reasoning of the decision up to paragraph 75 thereof.
</p><p id="p_18">18.          We have to concur with said argument and our
reason is that an analysis of the judgment up to paragraph 75
would show that the learned Single Judge has negated each
and every contention of Radico and on the principles i.e. to
avoid any bleak chances of misrepresentation, the learned
Single Judge has granted limited injunction.
</p><p id="p_19">19.          But we hasten to add that we are not to be
understood as if we have returned a verdict against Radico, for
the reason we are yet to give our opinion on the subject. Till
this stage of our opinion, we have simply noted the rival
arguments and the reflection thereon by the learned Single
Judge.
</p><p id="p_20">20.          It needs hardly any emphasis, that a „trademark‟ is
a word, name, symbol, device or any combination thereof used
by a manufacturer or retailer of a product, in connection with
that product, to help consumers identify the product and
distinguish the same from the products of competitors.         A
trademark indicates to consumers that a particular product
comes from a distinct source, even if the name of that source
is unknown to the consumer.      A trademark also functions to
indicate quality and reputation, thus creating goodwill in the
proprietor of the trademark.
</p><p id="p_21">21.          The use of a trademark benefits the manufacturer
or the merchant of a product as well as the consuming public.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">FAO(OS)-549&amp;567/2011                           Page 12 of 22</span>
<p id="p_22"> For the manufacturer or merchant, a trademark serves as an
advertising tool, facilitating repeat sales and the successful
marketing of new products.        Individual consumers rely on
trademarks to distinguish among competing products and to
represent a certain level of quality they have come to expect
when purchasing products with which a particular mark is
used.
</p><p id="p_23">22.          A word, letter, numeral or a symbol, used in
combination may create a trademark which is distinctive from
existing marks used and unrelated to the goods to which it is
applied.     It may alternatively result in the creation of a
trademark which is descriptive.
</p><p id="p_24">23.          It is settled law, and has been correctly noted and
applied by the learned Single Judge, that a holder of a
protectable descriptive mark has no legal claim to an exclusive
right in the primary, descriptive meaning of the term;
consequently, everyone is free to use the term in its primary,
descriptive sense; but with a caveat. The caveat is that: „so
long as such use does not lead to consumer confusion as to
the source of the goods‟.     And in an action for infringement,
the „fair use‟ defence „is available only to situations where the
alleged infringer employs a trademark in its descriptive sense,
as opposed to: as a trademark.‟
</p><p id="p_25">24.          Thus, on the facts pleaded before the learned
Single Judge, the first question which required to be posed and
prima facie opined upon has to be: Whether Radico, the holder
of a protectable descriptive mark (8 PM), having no legal claim
to an exclusive right in the primary, descriptive meaning of the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">FAO(OS)-549&amp;567/2011                           Page 13 of 22</span>
 numeral „8‟, could seek to injunct Carlsberg to use the numeral
„8‟ in a manner where the numeral was not being used by
Carlsberg as a part of its trademark „PALONE 8‟, i.e. as a
descriptive numeral; but as a trademark.              Or, to put it
differently, the same question could have been framed:
Whether Carlsberg was entitled to use the numeral „8‟ by
employing the same, allegedly as descriptive of its product,
but actually was using the numeral as a trademark.                     The
second question which would arise would be: Whether
Carlsberg was imitating the style and the colour adopted by
Radico as a slavish imitation to predate upon the reputation of
Radico which would subsume within, the question: Whether
Radico at all had any protectable interest in the style and
colour with/in which it depicted „8 PM‟.
</p><p id="p_26">25.          Whether a single numeral is capable of being a
trademark?
</p><p id="p_27">26.          Trademark jurisprudence in India has fought shy of
according trademark status to single numerals or letters. While
a combination of letters and numbers has often been found
worthy of trademark protection, there is ample material to
suggest    that    the   consistent   stand   taken   both        by   the
Trademark Registry and the Courts is to frown upon attempts
to secure trademark protection for single digits, single colours
and single letters in India.
</p><p id="p_28">27.          In the instant case, it is not in dispute that the
registration obtained by Radico is for the word mark „8 PM‟,
although the usage by Radico, in variance to the registration,




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">FAO(OS)-549&amp;567/2011                              Page 14 of 22</span>
 is one that accords primacy to the numeral „8‟ and relegates
„PM‟ to almost 1/8th the relative space on the label.
</p><p id="p_29">28.          Section 17 of the T.M.Act 1999 makes it ample clear
that a registered proprietor of a composite mark cannot seek
exclusivity with respect to individual components of the
trademark. Therefore, by logical extension, it is not open to
Radico, which is the registered proprietor of the composite
mark „8 PM‟, to seek protection for infringement of its
trademark by a third party who merely uses the numeral „8‟,
since no exclusivity can be claimed in a single numeral.
</p><p id="p_30">29.          Therefore, in the present case, an action for
trademark infringement in respect of the composite word mark
„8 PM‟ against Carlsberg, which uses the mark „PALONE 8‟,
where the only commonality between the two is the numeral
„8‟, must prima facie undoubtedly fail.
</p><p id="p_31">30.          If Radico‟s mark had been a label mark, then the
issue of the size and manner of representation of the numeral
would have had some bearing, but since the registration is for
the word mark simpliciter, no case for trademark infringement
prima facie appears to be made out against Carlsberg.
</p><p id="p_32">31.          That brings us to the issue of passing off which is a
far more nuanced issue in the light of the various defences
that have been set up before this Court.
</p><p id="p_33">32.          At the outset, it may be kept in mind that while
undoubtedly a single numeral does not belong to anybody‟s
exclusive domain, but at the same time an unfettered right to
use the numeral in a particular mode and manner is not an
automatic right that flows to all third parties. It is open to a




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">FAO(OS)-549&amp;567/2011                            Page 15 of 22</span>
 plaintiff to demonstrate through overwhelming evidence that a
particular manner of representation of the said numeral or a
limited use of the numeral in relation to a particular class of
goods has acquired some degree of distinctiveness in relation
to the plaintiff and that a similar non-descriptive use of the
numeral by a third party may therefore become actionable
under the law of passing off.
</p><p id="p_34">33.          Is Carlsberg‟s use descriptive in the instant case?
</p><p id="p_35">34.          The answer must begin by posing the question:
Whether the use of the numeral „8‟ by Carlsberg is in the
nature of a descriptive, and hence non-trademark use, or a
trademark use. The two are antithetical to each other and one
plea, if successful, must necessarily destroy the other. This
principle was enunciated by a Single Judge of this Court, in the
decision reported as 57 (1995) DLT 49 <a href="/doc/1221147/" id="a_11">Automatic Electric vs.
R.K.Dhawan</a> in the following words:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">        "The fact that the defendant itself has sought to
        claim trade proprietary right and monopoly in
        "DIMMER DOT", it does not lie in their mouth to say
        that the word "DIMMER" is a generic expression.
        User of the word "DIMMER" by others cannot be a
        defense available to the defendant, if it could be
        shown that the same is being used in violation of
        the statutory right of the plaintiff."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_36">35.          In the instant case, too, the plea of Carlsberg
unfortunately, suffers from the same fallacy. While on the one
hand Carlsberg has applied for registration of the mark
„PALONE 8‟ and thereby claim exclusivity over the numerical,
albeit as a component of a composite mark, its argument that




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">FAO(OS)-549&amp;567/2011                             Page 16 of 22</span>
 „8‟ is a descriptive numerical in the alcohol industry, may
hinder its own ability to claim trademark rights over it.
</p><p id="p_37">36.          Thus, the use and manner of writing „PALONE 8‟ by
Carlsberg, on its impugned label must be tested for an alleged
descriptive use of the numeral „8‟.
</p><p id="p_38">37.          There are three tests which can be evolved to
ascertain whether the use of the numeral „8‟ by Carlsberg is
meant to be a descriptive use or is in the nature of a
trademark use:
</p><p id="p_39">(i)          Does      the   numeral   8   indicate   any        quality,
functionality, property, content etc. of the product itself?
The third party instances relied upon by Carlsberg appear to
be using „8‟ in a descriptive manner to denote, for instance, an
„8‟ year vintage or an „8‟ % blend.
</p><p id="p_40">             It is, of course, conceivable that there will be
instances where the use of a numeral in a trademark will be
purely descriptive in nature, even if the trademark itself does
not consist of a numeral simpliciter and is accompanied by
signs, colours or other devices. In evaluating such marks, the
test to be applied would be one of: Whether the relevant class
of persons, without further thought, perceive the numeral to
be descriptive of the characteristics of the goods in question?
</p><p id="p_41">             This test was enumerated by the European Court of
First Instance in rejecting a trademark for the numerals „100‟
and „300‟ in respect of printed matter, manipulative puzzles
and organisation of competitions by a Polish company. See C-
51/10 P Agencja Wydawnicza Technopol sp. z o.o. v. OHIM (10
March 2010).

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">FAO(OS)-549&amp;567/2011                             Page 17 of 22</span>
<p id="p_42">              In the present case, by its own admission, Carlsberg
is not selling a product to which either the „year vintage‟ or
„alcohol-by-volume‟ descriptors apply. Being beer, it does not
involve a question of a vintage and the percentage of alcohol
content is admittedly 7.5% and not the exact number of „8‟.
</p><p id="p_43">             So the choice of „8‟ is more arbitrary            than
descriptive, as it does not indicate any quality or property of
the product.
</p><p id="p_44">(ii)         Does the numeral „8‟ appear „in a manner of
speaking‟ on the label or has been given undue prominence so
as to appear as a trademark?
</p><p id="p_45">             It is apparent that Carlsberg, much like Radico (qua
the use of „PM‟), has written the word „Palone‟ in a significantly
smaller font compared to the numeral „8‟, which is several
times larger. It is clearly not written with an intention to be a
mere descriptor but is intended to be the most prominent
component of the label. Such a use cannot be termed as a
descriptive use and is clearly in the nature of trademark use.
</p><p id="p_46">(iii)        Does the product, aside from the numeral „8‟, carry
any other mark which is intended to be the „brand name‟ or
„trademark‟ by which consumers are to ask for the product?
</p><p id="p_47">             The final, and perhaps most important test of
descriptiveness is: Whether the product has any other name
which could perhaps be called the „trademark‟ under which the
product is being sold, in order to distinguish it from the
descriptive mark/numerical in issue here? The result of such a
test is also negative in so much as the product though called
„PALONE 8‟ by Carlsberg, but given that the numeral „8‟ is the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">FAO(OS)-549&amp;567/2011                           Page 18 of 22</span>
 single most prominent feature of the label, the product for all
practical purposes is being sold under the mark „8‟ and
consumers are likely to identify and ask for the product as „8‟
and not „PALONE 8‟ i.e. the consumer is most likely to tell the
bartender or the salesman at a liquor vend: „Give me beer 8‟
and not „Give me beer Palone 8‟.
</p><p id="p_48">38.          Thus, one can fairly conclude that the use by
Carlsberg of the numeral „8‟ is not an instance of a descriptive
use and must be understood as an instance of a trademark
use.
</p><p id="p_49">39.          The next part of the analysis must therefore be:
Whether the trademark use of the numeral „8‟ by Carlsberg is
actionable or not?
</p><p id="p_50">40.          The test applied in similar cases concerning a
particular colour scheme or word marks is settled to be one of
the „essential features‟ of the composite mark. In the decision
reported as (2000) 5 SCC 573 <a href="/doc/1132403/" id="a_12">SM Dyechem vs. Cadbury</a>, in
para 39, the Supreme Court explained the „essential features‟
inquiry in the following words:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">        "In the present case, three tests have to be applied.
        The first one is this: Is there any special aspect of
        the common feature which has been copied? The
        second test will be with reference to the mode in
        which the parts are put together differently? That is
        to say whether the dissimilarity of the part or parts
        is enough to mark the whole thing dissimilar (Kerly
        para 17.17 referred to above). The third test is
        whether when there are common elements, should
        one not pay more regard to the parts which are not
        common, while at the same time not disregarding
        the common parts?"
</blockquote>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">FAO(OS)-549&amp;567/2011                           Page 19 of 22</span>
<p id="p_51"> 41.          For similar reasons, this Court, in the decision
reported as 2005 (31) PTC 583 (<a href="/doc/664493/" id="a_13">Del) Colgate Palmolive vs.
Patel</a> in para 19, held that the „red-and-white‟ colour scheme
of the „COLGATE‟ brand without the addition of the mark
„COLGATE‟ could not be said to be a feature so essential to the
trademark so as to entitle Radico therein to urge passing off
by the mere adoption of the „red-and-white‟ colour scheme by
someone else.
</p><p id="p_52">42.          The following prima facie conclusions emerge from
the above analysis in the instant case:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">      A.     Radico has a registration for „8 PM‟ as a composite
      mark. Thus, it cannot claim exclusivity over the single
      numeral      „8‟   to   restrain   Carlsberg     for    trademark
      infringement.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_17">      B.     Carlsberg cannot rely on descriptive use as a
      defence to pre-empt Radico‟s claim.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_18">      C.     For passing off, the last two prongs of the classical
      Jif Lemon trinity have to be applied to test if there is any
      consumer confusion (or likelihood thereof) and any
      resultant damage caused to Radico by the impugned use
      of the numeral „8‟ by Carlsberg. On the evidence before
      this Court, the answer prima facie comes up negative in
      respect of both.
</blockquote><p id="p_53">43.          Actually, the final question which boils down to is a
simple trade dress analysis of the overall „look and feel‟ of the
label - which really is an analysis independent of the contents
of the label. The concept of a „trade dress‟ is inherently built
into the Indian statute in the language of <a href="/doc/595959/" id="a_14">Section 2(zb)</a> which




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">FAO(OS)-549&amp;567/2011                                 Page 20 of 22</span>
 defines a trademark in inclusive terms with elements such as
the       „shape   of   goods‟,      their    „packaging‟    and       „colour
combination‟ being included as a trademark, provided the
following two elements are satisfied, viz.:
</p><p id="p_54">   (i)        a „capacity for graphical representation‟, and
</p><p id="p_55">   (ii)       an „ability to distinguish the goods or services of
            one person from those of others‟.
</p><p id="p_56">44.           On applying the above tests it is possible to
conclude that Radico‟s label is capable of trade dress
protection.
</p><p id="p_57">45.           However, the unique elements of Radico‟s label
have not been copied by Carlsberg. On comparing the two
labels, one cannot prima facie form an impression that
actionable similarity emerges. The mere manner of writing the
numeral „8‟ or the size of it cannot be a sufficient ground for
Radico to obtain an injunction.              Mere use of black and gold
colour combination, which is fairly common to labels of
alcoholic products, cannot be unique to Radico. The styling of
the numeral „8‟ is normally two small „o‟; one on top of the
other, or the numeral „3‟ mirroring itself. Prima facie we see
no uniqueness to entitle Radico to an interim injunction. Both
parties have adopted the latter.
