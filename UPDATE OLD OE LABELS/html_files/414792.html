ACT:
Fundamental Right-Res judicata-Dismissal of writ Petition by
High  Court-If	and when bar to petition in  Supreme  Court-
Constitution of India, Arts. 32, 226.



HEADNOTE:
Where  the High Court dismisses a writ petition	 under	<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Art.
226</a>  of	 the Constitution after hearing the  matter  on	 the
merits on the ground that no fundamental right was proved or
contravened  or that its contravention was  constitutionally
justified, a subsequent petition to the Supreme Court  under
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_2">Art.  32</a> of the Constitution on the same facts and  for	 the
same reliefs filed by the same party would be barred by	 the
general principle of res judicata.
There  is no substance in the plea that the judgment of	 the
High  Court  cannot be treated as res  judicata	 because  it
cannot
575
under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_3">Art.  226</a> entertain a petition under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_4">Art. 32</a>  of	 the
Constitution.
Citizens  have	ordinarily the right to invoke <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_5">Art.  32</a>	 for
appropriate relief if their fundamental rights are illegally
on  unconstitutionally violated and it is incorrect  to	 say
that  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_6">Art. 32</a> merely gives this Court a discretionary  power
as <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_7">Art. 226</a> does to the High Court.

The  right  given to the citizens to move this	Court  under
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_10">Art.  32</a>  is  itself  a	 fundamental  right  and  cannot  be
circumscribed  or  curtailed  except  as  provided  by	 the
Constitution.	The expression "appropriate proceedings"  in
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_11">Art. 32</a><a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_12">,(1</a>), properly construed, must mean such	 proceedings
as may be appropriate to the nature of the order,  direction

appropriate to the nature of the case.

Even  so  the general principle of res judicata,  which	 has
it.; foundation on considerations of public policy,  namely,
(1)   that   binding  decisions	 of  courts   of   competent
jurisdiction  should be final and (2) that no person  should
be  made to face the same kind of litigation twice over,  is
not  a	mere  technical	 rule  that  cannot  be	 applied  to

The  binding character of judgments of courts  of  competent
jurisdiction  is  in essence a part of the rule	 of  law  on
which  the administration of justice, so much emphasised  by
the  Constitution,  is founded and a judgment  of  the	High
Court  under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_15">Art. 226</a> passed after a hearing on  merits  as
aforesaid must bind the parties till set aside in appeal  as
provided by the Constitution and cannot be circumvented by a

Consequently,  (1)  where  the petition under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_25">Art.  226</a>  is
considered on the merits as a contested matter and dismissed
by   the High Court, the decision pronounced is	 binding  on

appropriate  proceedings under the Constitution;
(2)  Where the petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_26">Art. 226</a> is dismissed I not on
the  merits but because of laches of the party applying	 for
the  writ or because an alternative remedy is  available  to
him, such dismissal is no bar to a subsequent petition under
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_27">Art.  32</a> except in cases where the facts found by  the	High
Court may themselves be relevant even under <a href="/doc/618177/" id="a_28">Art. 32;
(3)</a>  Where  the writ petition is dismissed in limine and  an
order is pronounced, whether or not such dismissal is a	 bar
must depend on the nature of the order;
(4)  if	 the  petition	is dismissed  in  limine  without  a
speaking order, or as withdrawn, there can be no bar of	 res
judicata.

</p><p id="p_12">1961.  March 27.  The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
GAJENDRAGADKAR,	 J.-These  six writ  petitions	filed  Gaje,
under  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_30">Art. 32</a> of the Constitution have been  placed  before
the Court for final disposal in a group because though	they
arise between separate parties and are unconnected with each
other  a common question of law arises in all of them.	 The
opponents  in all these petitions have raised a	 preliminary
objection against the maintainability of the writ  petitions
on  the ground that in each case the petitioners  had  moved
the  High  Court for a similar writ under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_31">Art. 226</a>  and	 the
High Court has rejected the said petitions.  The argument is
that  the dismissal of a writ petition filed by a party	 for
obtaining an appropriate writ creates a bar of res  judicata
against a similar petition filed in this Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_32">Art. 32</a>
on  the	 same or similar facts and praying for the  same  or
similar writ.  The question as to whether such a bar of	 res
judicata  can  be pleaded against a petition filed  in	this
Court  under  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_33">Art. 32</a> has been adverted to in  some  of	 the
reported decisions of this Court but it has not so far	been
fully  considered  or  finally	decided;  and  that  is	 the
preliminary question for the decision of which the six	writ
petitions have been placed together for disposal in a group.
In  dealing with this group we will set out the facts  which
give  rise  to Writ Petition No. 66 of 1956 and	 decide	 the
general point raised for our decision.	Our decision in this
writ petition will govern the other writ petitions as well.
Petition  No.  66 of 1956 alleges that for  the	 last  fifty
years  the  petitioners and their ancestors  have  been	 the
tenants of the land described in Annexure A attached to	 the
petition and that respondents 3 to 5 are the proprietors  of
the said land.	Owing to communal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">73</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">578</span>
disturbances  in  the Western District of Uttar	 Pradesh  in
1947,  the petitioners had to leave their village  in  July,
1947; later in November, 1947, they returned  but they found
that  during their temporary absence respondents 3 to 5	 had
entered in unlawful possession of the said land.  Since	 the
said respondents refused   to deliver possession of the land
to  the	 petitioners the petitioners had to file  suits	 for
ejectment  under  s.  180 of the U. P.	Tenancy	 Act,  1939.
These  suits were filed in June, 1948.	In the	trial  court
the  petitioners succeeded and a decree was passed in  their
favour.	 The said decree. was confirmed in appeal which	 was
taken  by respondents 3 to 5 before the	 learned  Additional
Commissioner.	In  pursuance of the  appellate	 decree	 the
petitioners obtained possession of the land through Court.
Respondents 3 to 5 then preferred a second appeal before the
Board  of  Revenue under s. 267 of the U.  P.  Tenancy	Act,
1939.	On  March  29, 1954, the Board	allowed	 the  appeal
preferred   by	respondents  3	to  5  and   dismissed	 the
petitioner's  suit  with respect to the	 land  described  in
Annexure A, whereas the said respondents' appeal with regard
to  other lands were dismissed.	 The decision of  the  Board
was  based  on	the  ground that by  virtue  of	 the  U.  P.
Zamindary Abolition and Land Reforms (Amendment) Act XVI  of
1953  respondents  3  to  5  had  become  entitled  to	 the
possession of the land.
</p><p id="p_13">Aggrieved  by this decision the petitioners moved  the	High
Court  at Allahabad under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_34">Art. 226</a> of the  Constitution	 for
the  issue  of	a  writ of  certiorari	to  quash  the	said
judgment.   Before the said petition was filed a Full  Bench
of the Allahabad High Court had already interpreted s. 20 of
the  U. P. Land Reforms Act as amended by Act XVI  of  1953.
The  effect  of the said decision was  plainly	against	 the
petitioners'  contentions, and so the learned  advocate	 who
appeared  for the petitioners had no alternative but not  to
press  the petition before the High Court.   In	 consequence
the  said  petition  was dismissed on March  29,  1955.	  It
appears that s. 20 has again been amended by s. 4 of Act  XX
of 1954.  It is under these
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">579</span>
circumstances  that the petitioners have filed	the  present
petition under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_35">Art. 32</a> on March 14, 1956.  It is plain	that
at  the	 time when the present petition has been  filed	 the
period	of limitation prescribed for an	  appeal  under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_36">Art.
136</a>  against  the  dismissal of	 the  petitioners'  petition
before the- Allahabad High Court had already expired.  It is
also  clear that the grounds of attack against the  decision
of  the Board which the petitioners seek to raise  by  their
present	 petition are exactly the same as the grounds  which
they had raised before the Allahabad High Court; and so	 it
is  urged  by the respondents that the present	petition  is
barred by res judicata.
</p><p id="p_14">Mr. Agarwala who addressed the principal arguments on behalf
of   the  petitioners  in  this	 group	contends  that	 the
'principle of res judicata which is no more than a technical rule  similar
  to the rule of estoppel  cannot  be  pleaded
against	 a petition which seeks to enforce  the	 fundamental
rights	guaranteed by the Constitution.	 He argues that	 the
right  to move the Supreme Court for the enforcement of	 the
fundamental  rights  which is guaranteed by  <a href="/doc/846967/" id="a_37">Art.  32(1)</a>  is
itself	a  fundamental	right and  it  would  be  singularly
inappropriate to whittle down the said fundamental right  by
putting	 it in the straight jacket of the technical rule  of
res judicata.  On the other hand it is urged by the  learned
Advocate-General  of Punjab, who led the  respondents,	that
<a href="/doc/846967/" id="a_38">Art. 32(1)</a> does not guarantee to every citizen the right  to
make  a petition under the said article but it merely  gives
him   the   right  to  move  this  Court   by appropriate
proceedings,   and   he	 contends   that   the	 appropriate
proceedings  in cases like the present would be	 proceedings
by way of an application for special leave under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_39">Art. 136</a> or
by  way of appeal under the appropriate article of the	Con-
stitution.   It	 is also suggested that the  right  to	move
which  is guaranteed by <a href="/doc/846967/" id="a_40">Art. 32(1)</a> does not impose  on	this
Court  an obligation to grant the relief, because as in	 the
case of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_41">Art. 226</a> so in the case of <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_42">Art. 32</a> also the granting
of leave is discretionary.
</p><p id="p_15">In  support of the argument that it is in the discretion  of
this Court to grant an appropriate relief or refuse to do so
reliance has been placed on the observations
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">580</span>
made in two reported decisions of this Court.  <a href="/doc/108021/" id="a_43">In Laxmanappa
Hanumantappa Jamkhandi v. The Union of India &amp; Another</a>	(1),
this Court held that as	    there is a special	provision in
<a href="/doc/1405898/" id="a_44">Art. 265</a> of the Constitution that no tax shall be levied  or
collected except by authority of law, cl.  1 of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_45">Art. 31</a> must
be  regarded  as   concerned with  deprivation	of  property
otherwise than by imposition or collection of tax and as the
right conferred by <a href="/doc/1405898/" id="a_46">Art. 265</a> is not a fundamental right	con-
ferred	by  Part  III  of the  Constitution,  it  cannot  be
enforced  under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_47">Art. 32.</a>  In other words, the  decision	 was
that the petition filed before this Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_48">Art. 32</a>	 was
not  maintainable;  but Mahajan, C.J.., Who  spoke  for	 the
Court,	proceeded to observer that "even otherwise  in	'the
peculiar circumstances that have arisen it would not be just
and proper to direct the issue of any of the writs the issue
of  which  is discretionary with this Court".	The  learned
Chief Justice has also added that when this position was put
to  Mr. Sen he fairly and rightly conceded that it  was	 not
possible  for  him to combat this position.   'To  the	same
effect	are the observations made by the same learned  Chief
Justice	 in <a href="/doc/763703/" id="a_49">Dewan Bahadur Seth Gopal Das Mohta v. The  Union
of  India &amp; Another</a> (2).  It will, however, be noticed	that
the  observations  made in both the cases are  obiter,	and,
with  respect,	it  would be difficult to treat	 them  as  a
decision  on the question that the issue of  an	 appropriate
writ tinder <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_50">Art. 32</a> is a matter of discretion, and that even
if  the petitioner proves his fundamental rights  and  their
unconstitutional  infringement this Court  nevertheless	 can
refused. to issue an appropriate writ in his favour Besides,
the  subsequent decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/761967/" id="a_51">Basheshar Nath  v.
The  Commissioner  of Income-tax, Delhi and,  Rajasthan</a>	 (3)
tender	to  show that if a petitioner makes out	 a  case  of
illegal	 contravention of his fundamental rights he  may  be
entitled to claim an appropriate relief and a plea of waiver
cannot	be  raised against his claim.  It is true  that	 the
question  of res judicata did not fall to be  considered  in
that case but the tenor of all the judgments, which no doubt
disclose a
(1) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 760, 772, 773-  (2) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 773,
</p><p id="p_16">776.
(3) [1959] SUPP. 1 S.C.R. 528
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">581</span>
difference  in	approach,  seems  to  emphasise	 the   basic
importance  of	the fundamental rights	guaranteed  by,	 the
Constitution  and the effect of the decision appears  to  be
that  the  citizens are ordinarily entitled  to	 appropriate
relief under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_52">Art. 32</a> once it is shown that their fundamental
rights	have been illegally or unconstitutionally  violated.
Therefore,  we	are not impressed by the  argument  that  we
should	deal with the question of the applicability  of	 the
rule  of  res judicata to a petition under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_53">Art.	 32</a>  on	 the
basis  that  like  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_54">Art. 226</a> <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_55">Art. 32</a> itself  gives  merely  a
discretionary  power  to the Court to grant  an	 appropriate
relief.
</p><p id="p_17">The argument that <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_56">Art. 32</a> does not confer upon a citizen the
right to move this Court by an original petition but  merely
gives  him  the right to move this Court by  an	 appropriate
proceeding  according to the nature of the case seems to  us
to  be	unsound.   It is urged that in	a case	where  the
petitioner has moved the High Court by a writ petition under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_57">Art.  226</a> all that he is entitled to do under <a href="/doc/846967/" id="a_58">Art. 32(1)</a>  is
to move this Court by an application for special leave under
<a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_59">Art.  136;</a>  that,  it is contended, is	the  effect  of	 the
expression "appropriate proceedings" used in <a href="/doc/846967/" id="a_60">Art. 32(1).</a>  In
our  opinion,  on  a fair construction	of  <a href="/doc/846967/" id="a_61">Art.  32(1)</a>	 the
expression  "appropriate  proceedings"	has  reference,	  to
proceedings  which may be appropriate having regard  to	 the
nature of the order, direction or writ which the  petitioner
seeks to obtain from this Court.  The appropriateness of the
proceedings  would depend upon the particular writ or  order
which  he claims and it is in that sense that the right	 has
been  conferred	 on  the  citizen  to  move  this  Court  by
appropriate  proceedings.   That is why we must	 proceed  to
deal  with the question of res judicata on the basis that  a
fundamental right has been guaranteed to the citizen to move
this Court by an original petition wherever his grievance is
that his fundamental rights have been illegally contravened.
There can be no doubt that the fundamental right  guaranteed
by  <a href="/doc/846967/" id="a_62">Art.  32(1)</a>	 is  a	very  important	 safeguard  for	 the
protection of the fundamental rights of the citizen, and  as
a result of the said guarantee this
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">582</span>
Court  has been entrusted with the solemn task of  upholding
the fundamental rights of the citizens of this country.	 The
fundamental   rights  are  intended  not  only	to   protect
individual's  rights  but  they are  based  on	high  public
policy.	 Liberty of the individual and the protection of his
fundamental  rights are the very essence of the	 democratic
way  of	 life  adopted by the Constitution, and	 it  is	 the
privilege and the duty of this Court to uphold those rights.
This Court would naturally refuse to circumscribe them or to
curtail them except as provided by the Constitution  itself.
It  is because of this aspect of the matter that  in  <a href="/doc/456839/" id="a_63">Romesh
Thappar	 v. The State of Madras</a> (1), in the very first	year
after the Constitution came into force, this Court  rejected
a  preliminary objection raised against the competence of  a
petition filed under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_64">Art. 32</a> on the ground that as a  matter
of  orderly  procedure	the  petitioner	 should	 first	have
resorted to the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_65">Art. 226</a>, and observed that
"this Court in thus constituted the protector and  guarantor
of the fundamental rights, and it cannot, consistently	with
the  responsibility  so laid upon it,  refuse  to  entertain
applications  seeking  protection against  infringements  of
Ruch  rights".	Thus the right given to the citizen to	move
this  Court  by	 a  petition under  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_66">Art.  32</a>  and  claim  an
appropriate  writ against the unconstitutional	infringement
of his fundamental rights itself is a matter of	 fundamental
right,	and  in	 dealing with the  objection  based  on	 the
application  of the rule of res judicata this aspect of	 the
matter had no doubt to be borne in mind.
</p><p id="p_18">But, is the rule of res judicata merely a technical rule  or
is  it	based  on high public policy?  If the  rule  of	 res
judicata itself embodies a principle of public policy  which
in  turn  is an essential part of the rule of law  then	 the
objection that the rule cannot be invoked where	 fundamental
rights are in question may lose much of its validity.	Now,
the  rule of res judicata as indicated in s. 11 of the	Code
of Civil Procedure has no doubt, some technical aspects, for
instance  the rule of constructive res judicata may be	said
to be technical; but the basis on which the said rule  rests
is

<p id="p_19">founded	 on considerations of public policy.  It is  in	 the
interest  of  the  public at large that	 a  finality  should
attach	to  the binding decisions pronounced by	 Courts'  of
competent  jurisdiction,  and  it  is  also  in	 the  public
interest  that	individuals should not be vexed	 twice	over
with  the same kind of litigation.  If these two  principles
form the foundation of the general rule of res judicata they
cannot	be  treated as irrelevant or  inadmissible  even  in
dealing	 with  fundamental rights in petitions	filed  under
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_67">Art. 32.</a>
</p><p id="p_20">In  considering the essential elements of res  judicata	 one
inevitably  harks  back to the judgment of  Sir	 William  de
Grey, (afterwards Lord Walsingham) in the leading Duchess of
King8ton's case (1).  Said Sir William de Grey,	 (afterwards
Lord  Walsingham)  "from the variety of	 cases	relative  to
judgments being given in evidence in civil suits, these	 two
deductions seem to follow as generally true: First, that the
judgment  of  a court of concurrent  jurisdiction,  directly
upon  the  point,  is  as a plea, a  bar,  or  as  evidence,
conclusive  between the same parties, upon the same  matter,
directly  in question in another court; Secondly,  that	 the
judgment of a court of exclusive jurisdiction, directly upon
the  point,  is	 in like manner	 conclusive  upon  the	same
matter,	 between  the same parties, coming  incidentally  in
question in another court for a different purpose".  As	 has
been observed by Halsbury, "the doctrine of res judicata  is
not a technical doctrine applicable only to records; it is a
fundamental doctrine of all courts that there must be an end
of  litigation" (2 ). Halsbury also adds that  the  doctrine
applies equally in all courts, and it is immaterial in	what
court the former proceeding was taken, provided only that it
was  a	court of competent jurisdiction, or  what  form	 the
proceeding took, provided it was really for the same  cause"
(p. 187, paragraph 362).  "Res judicata", it is observed  in
Corpus	Juris, "is a rule of universal law  pervading  every
well regulated system of jurisprudence, and is put upon	 two
grounds	 embodied in various maxims of the common  law;	 the
one,

<p id="p_21">public policy and necessity, which makes it to the, interest
of  the State that there should be an end to s litigation
interest  republican  ut sit finis litium;  the	 other,	 the
hardship on the individual that he should be vexed twice for
the  same cause-nemo debet bis vexari pro eadem causa"	(1).
In  this  sense	 the recognised basis of  the  rule  of	 res
judicata  is  different	 from that  of	technical  estoppel.
"Estoppel  rests on equity able principles and res  judicata
rests  on  maxims which are taken from the Roman  Law"	(2).
Therefore,  the	 argument that res judicata is	a  technical
rule  and  as such is irrelevant in dealing  with  petitions
under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_68">Art. 32</a> cannot be accepted.
</p><p id="p_22">The  same question can be considered from another  point  of
view.	If  a  judgment has been pronounced by	a  court  of
competent  jurisdiction	 it is binding between	the  parties
unless	it  is reversed or modified by appeal,	revision  or
other procedure prescribed by law.  Therefore, if a judgment
has  been  pronounced by the High Court in a  writ  petition
filed  by a party rejecting his prayer for the issue  of  an
appropriate  writ  on  the  ground either  that	 he  had  no
fundamental  right  as pleaded by him or there has  been  no
contravention of the right proved or that the  contravention
is  justified  by the Constitution itself,  it	must  remain
binding	 between  the  parties	unless	it  is	attacked  by
adopting  the  procedure  prescribed  by  the	Constitution
itself.	  The binding character of judgments  pronounced  by
courts of competent jurisdiction is itself an essential part
of  the	 rule of law, and the rule of law obviously  is	 the
basis  of  the	administration	of  justice  on	 which	 the
Constitution lays so much emphasis.  As Halsbury has observ-
ed  "subject to appeal and to being amended or set  aside  a
judgment  is  conclusive as between the	 parties  and  their
privies, and is conclusive evidence against all the world of
its existence, date and legal consequences"(3).	 Similar  is
the  statement of the law in Corpus Juris: "the doctrine  of
estoppel by judgment does not rest on any superior authority
of  the court rendering the judgment, and a judgment of	 one
court is a bar to an

<p id="p_23">action	between the same parties for the same cause  in	 the
same  court  or	 in another court, whether  the	 latter	 has
concurrent  or other jurisdiction.  This rule is subject  to
the  Limitation that the judgment in the former action	must
have  been  rendered  by a court or  tribunal  of  competent
jurisdiction"  (1).  "It is, however' essential	 that  there
should	have  been  a judicial determination  of  rights  in
controversy  with a final decision thereon" In other  words,
an  original petition for a writ under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_69">Art. 32</a>	cannot	take
the place of an appeal against the order passed by the	High
Court in the petition filed before it under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_70">Art. 226.</a>  There
can  be little doubt that the jurisdiction of this Court  to
entertain  applications	 under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_71">Art. 32</a>	which  are  original
cannot	be  confused or mistaken or used for  the  appellate
jurisdiction  of this Court which alone can be	invoked	 for
correcting errors in the decisions of High Courts pronounced
in  writ  petitions  under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_72">Art.  226.</a>	 Thus,	on   general
considerations of public policy there seems to be no  reason
why   the  rule	 of  res  judicata  should  be	treated	  as
inadmissible  or irrelevant in dealing with petitions  filed
under  Art,.  32 of the Constitution.  It is true  that	 the
general	 rule can be invoked only in cases where  a  dispute
between	 the  parties  has  been  referred  to	a  court  of
competent jurisdiction, there has been a contest between the
parties before the court, a fair opportunity has been  given
to  both  of them to prove their case, and at  the  end	 the
court  has  pronounced	its judgment or	 decision.   Such  a
decision pronounced by a court of competent jurisdiction  is
binding	 between  the  parties	unless	it  is	modified  or
reversed   by  adopting	 a  procedure  prescribed   by	 the
Constitution.  In our opinion, therefore, the plea that	 the
general	 rule  of res judicata should not be allowed  to  be
invoked cannot be sustained.
</p><p id="p_24">This  Court had occasion to consider the application of	 the

<p id="p_26">Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_75">Art. 32</a> and claimed an appropriate writ  against
the Chairman and the Members of the Committee of  Privileges
of  the State Legislative Assembly.  The said  petition	 was
dismissed.    Subsequently   he	  filed	  another   petition
substantially  for the same relief and substantially on	 the
same  allegations.  One of the points which then  arose	 for
the decision of this Court was- whether the second  petition
was  competent, and this Court held that it was not  because
of  the rule of res judicata.  It is true that	the  earlier
decision on which res judicata was pleaded was a decision of
this  Court  in a petition filed under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_76">Art. 32</a> and  in	that
sense the background of the dispute, was different,  because
the  judgment on which the plea was based was a judgment  of
this  Court  and  not  of any High  Court.   Even  so,	this
decision affords assistance in determining the point  before
us.   In  upholding  the plea of  res  judicata	 this  Court
observed  that	the  question  determined  by  the  previous
decision  of  this Court cannot be reopened in	the  present
case  and  must	 govern the rights and	obligations  of	 the
parties	 which	are substantially the same.  In	 support  of
this  decision	Sinha,	C.  J., who  spoke  for	 the  Court,
referred  to  the  earlier decision of	this  Court  in	 <a href="/doc/1481962/" id="a_77">Raj
Lakshmi	 Dasi  v.  Banamali Sen</a> (1) and	 observed  that	 the
principle  underlying res judicata is applicable in  respect
of a question which hag been raised and decided after full
contest,  even though the first Tribunal which	decided	 the
matter	may have no jurisdiction to try the subsequent	suit
and  even though the subject-matter of the dispute  was	 not
exactly	 the  same  in	the two	 proceedings.	We  may	 add
incidentally   that  the  Court	 which	tried  the   earlier
proceedings in the case of Raj Lakshmi Dasi (1) was a  Court
of  exclusive jurisdiction.  Thus this decision	 establishes
the  principle that the rule of res judicata can be  invoked
even against a petition filed under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_78">Art. 32.</a>
We may at this stage refer to some of the earlier  decisions
of  this Court where the presedt problem was posed  but	 not
finally	 or definitely answered.  <a href="/doc/732516/" id="a_79">In Janardan Reddy  v.	 The

<p id="p_27">appeared  that	against	 the decision of the  High  Court  a
petition for specialleave had been filed but the,  same
had been, rejectedand this was followed by petitions under
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_80">Art. 32.</a>These petitions were in fact entertained though on
the  merits  they  were dismissed, and in doing	 so  it	 was
observed by Fazl Ali, J., who delivered the judgment of	 the
Court, that "it may, however, be observed that in this	case
we  have  not considered it necessary to decide	 whether  an
application  under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_81">Art. 32</a> is maintainable after  a  similar
application  under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_82">Art. 226</a> is dismissed by the High  Court,
and  we reserve our opinion on that question".	To the	same
effect	are  the observations made by Mukherjea, J.,  as  he
then was, in <a href="/doc/1063853/" id="a_83">Syed Qasim Razvi v. The State of Hyderabad</a> (1).
On the other hand, in <a href="/doc/658608/" id="a_84">Bhagubhai Dullabhabhai Bhandari v. The
District  Magistrate,  Thana</a> (2) the decision  of  the	High
Court was treated as binding between the parties when it was
observed by reference to the said proceedings that "but that
is  a  closed chapter so far as the  Courts  including	this
Court  also  are  concerned  inasmuch  as  the	petitioner's
conviction  stands confirmed as a result of the	 refusal  of
this  Court  to grant him special leave to appeal  from	 the
judgment  of the Bombay High Court".  In other words,  these
observations seem to suggest that the majority view was that
if  an order of conviction and sentence passed by  the	High
Court would be binding on the convicted person and cannot be
assailed  subsequently	by him in a proceeding	taken  under
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_85">Art. 32</a> when it appeared that this Court had refused special
leave  to  the said convicted person to appeal	against	 the
said order of conviction.
</p><p id="p_28">The  next  question  to consider is  whether  it  makes	 any
difference to the application of this rule that the decision
on  which the plea of res judicata is raised is	 a  decision
not  of	 this  Court  but of a	High  Court  exercising	 its
jurisdiction  under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_86">Art. 226.</a>  The argument is that  one  of
the  essential requirements of<a href="/doc/711331/" id="a_87"> s. 11</a> of the Code  of  Civil,
Procedure  is that the Court which tries the first  suit  or
proceeding should be competent
(1) [1953] S.C.R. 589-
</p><p id="p_29">(2) [1956] S.C.R. 533.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">588</span>
<p id="p_30">to  try the second suit or proceeding, and since  the	High
Court  cannot,	entertain an application under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_88">Art.  32</a>	 its
decision  cannot be treated as res judicata for the  purpose
of  such  a  petition.	 It is	doubtful  if  the  technical
requirement prescribed by<a href="/doc/711331/" id="a_89"> s. 11</a> as to the Competence of	 the
first Court to try the subsequent suit is an essential	part
of  the general rule of res judicata; but assuming  that  it
is, in substance even the said test is satisfied because the
jurisdiction  of  the  High Court in  dealing  with  a	writ
petition filed under Art,. 226 is substantially the same  as
the   jurisdiction   of	 this  Court  in   entertaining	  an
application tinder <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_90">Art. 32.</a>  The scope of the writs,  orders
or directions which the High Court can issue in	 appropriate
cases under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_91">Art. 226</a> is concurrent with the scope of similar
writs,	orders	or directions which may be  issued  by	this
Court  under  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_92">Art.  32.</a>	 The cause of  action  for  the	 two
applications would be the same.	 It is the assertion of	 the
existence   of	 a  fundamental	 right	 and   its   illegal
contravention  in both cases and the relief claimed in	both
the  cases  is	also of the  same  character.	<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_93">Article	 226</a>
confers	 jurisdiction  oil  the High Court  to	entertain  a
suitable writ petition, whereas <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_94">Art. 32</a> provides for  moving
this Court for a similar writ petition for the same purpose.
Therefore, the argument that a petition under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_95">Art. 32</a> cannot
be entertained by a High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_96">Art. 226</a> is without any
substance;  and	 so the plea that the judgment of  the	High
Court  cannot be treated as res judicata on the ground	that
it  cannot  entertain  a  petition under  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_97">Art.	32</a>  must  be
rejected.
</p><p id="p_31">It  is,	 however, necessary to add that	 in  exercising	 its
jurisdiction  under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_98">Art. 226</a> the High Court  may  sometimes
refuse	to issue an appropriate writ or order on the  ground
that the party applying for the writ is guilty of laches and
in  that  sense	 the issue of a high  prerogative  writ	 may
reasonably  be	treated as a matter of discretion.   On	 the
other  hand,  the right granted to a citizen  to  move	this
Court  by  appropriate proceedings under  <a href="/doc/846967/" id="a_99">Art.	32(1)</a>  being
itself a fundamental right this Court ordinarily may have to
issue an appropriate writ or order provided it is shown that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">589</span>
the  petitioner	 has  a fundamental  right  which  has	been
illegally  or  unconstitutionally contravened.	 It  is	 not
unlikely  that	if a petition is filed even  under  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_100">Art.  32</a>
after a long lapse of time, considerations ma arise  whether
rights in favour of third parties which may, have arisen  in
the meanwhile could be allowed to be' affected, and in	such
a  case the effect of laches on the, part of the  petitioner
or  of	his  acquirence	 may have  to  be  considered;	but,
ordinarily if a petitioner makes out a case for the issue of
an appropriate writ or' order he, would. be entitled to have
such a writ or, order under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_101">Art. 32</a> and that may be said  to
constitute a difference in the right conferred on a  citizen
to  move the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_102">Art. 226</a> as distinct from	 the
right conferred on him to move this Court.  This  difference
must inevitably mean that if -the High, Court has refused to
exercise  its discretion on the ground of laches or  on	 the
ground that the party has an efficacious alternative  remedy
available  to  him then of course the decision of  the	High
Court  cannot generally be pleaded in support of the bar  of
res judicata. if, however, the matter has been considered on
the merits and the High Court has dismissed the petition for
a writ on the ground that no fundamental right is proved  or
its  breach  is	 either not established or is  shown  to  be
constitutionally  justified there is no reason why the	said
decision  should  not  be  treated  as	a  bar	against	 the
competence of a subsequent petition filed by the same  party
on the same facts and for the same reliefs under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_103">Art. 32.</a>
In this connection reliance has been placed on the fact that
in  England habeas corpus petitions can be filed  one  after
the other and the dismissal of one habeas corpus petition is
never held to preclude the making of a subsequent  petition,
for  the same reason.  In our opinion, there is	 no  analogy
between the petition for habeas corpus: and petitions  filed
either	under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_104">Art. 226</a> or under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_105">Art.  32.</a>   For  historical
reasons the writ for habeas corpus is treated as standing in
</p><p id="p_32">-a  category  by itself; but, even with regard to  a  habeas
corpus	petition  it has now been- held in  England  in	 Re,
Hastings (No. 2) (1) that "an applicant for a writ
(1)  (1958) 3 All E.R. Q.B.D. 625.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">590</span>
<p id="p_33">of  habeas  corpus in a criminal matter who  has  once	been
heard by a Divisional Court of the Queen's Bench Division is
not entitled to be heard a second time by another Divisional
Court in the same Division, since a decision of a Divisional
Court  of  the Queen's Bench Division is equivalent  to	 the
decision  of  all the judges of the Division,  just  as	 the
decision of one of the old common law courts sitting in bank
was the equivalent of the decision of all the judges of that
Court."	 Lord Parker, C. J., who delivered the	judgment  of
the  Court, has elaborately examined the historical  genesis
of the writ, several dicta pronounced by different judges in
dealing	 with successive writ petitions, and  has  concluded
that  "the  authorities	 cannot	 be  said  to  support	 the
principle that except in vacation an applicant could go from
judge to judge as opposed to going from court to court"	 (p.
</p><p id="p_34">633), so that even in regard to a habeas corpus petition  it
is now settled in England that an applicant cannot move	 one
Divisional  Court of the Queen's Bench Division	 after	ano-
ther.  The-said decision has been subsequently applied in Re
Hastings  (No.	3) (1) to a writ petition filed	 for  habeas
corpus in a, Divisional Court of tile Chancery Division.  In
England,  technically  an  order passed on  a  petition	 for
habeas corpus is not regarded as a judgment and that  places
the  petitions for habeas corpus in a class  by	 themselves.
Therefore  we  do  not think that  the	English	 analogy  of
several	  habeas   corpus  applications	  can	assist	 the
petitioners in the present case when they seek to resist the
application  of res judicata to petitions filed	 under	Art.
</p><p id="p_35">32.   Before we part with the topic we would, however,	like
to add that we propose to express no opinion on the question
as to whether repeated applications for habeas corpus  would
be competent under our Constitution.  That is a matter	with
which we are not concerned in the present proceedings.
There  is  one	more  argument Which  still  remains  to  be
considered.  It is urged that the remedies available to	 the
petitioners  to move the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_106">Art. 226</a> and	this
Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_107">Art. 32</a> are

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">591</span>
<p id="p_36">alternate remedies and so the adoption of one remedy  cannot
bar  the  adoption  of the other.  These  remedies  are	 not
exclusive  but are cumulative and so no bar of res  judicata
can  be pleaded when a party who has filed a petition  under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_108">Art.  226</a>  seeks to invoke the jurisdiction  of	 this  Court
under  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_109">Art. 32.</a>	 In support of this contention reliance	 has
been  placed on the decision of the Calcutta High  Court  in
<a href="/doc/399219/" id="a_110">Mussammat Gulab Koer v. Badshah Bahadur</a> (1).  In that case a
party  who  had unsuccessfully sought for the  review  of  a
consent	 order on the ground of fraud brought a suit  for  a
similar relief and was met by a plea of res judicata.	This
plea  was rejected by the Court on the ground that  the	 two
remedies  though co-existing were not inconsistent  so	that
when a party aggrieved has had recourse first to one  remedy
it cannot be precluded from subsequently taking recourse  to
the  other.  In fact the judgment shows that the Court	took
the  view  that	 an  application  for  review  was  in	 the
circumstances  ail  inappropriate remedy and that  the	only
remedy	available  to  the party was that  of  a  suit.	  In
dealing with the question of res judicata the Court examined
the special features and conditions attaching to the  appli-
cation	for  review,  the  provisions  with  regard  to	 the
finality of the orders passed in such review proceedings and
the  limited nature of the right to appeal provided  against
such  orders.	In the result the Court held  that  the	 two
remedies   cannot  be  regarded	 as  parallel  and   equally
efficacious and so no question of election of remedies arose
in  those cases.  We do not think that this decision can  be
read  as laying down a general proposition of law that	even
in regard to alternate remedies if a party takes recourse to
one  remedy  and a contest arising therefrom is tried  by  a
court  of  competent  jurisdiction and all  points  of	con-
troversy are settled the intervention of the decision of the
court  would make no difference at all.	 In such a case	 the
point to consider always would be what is the nature of	 the
decision pronounced by a Court of competent jurisdiction and
what  is its effect.  Thus considered there can be no  doubt
that if a writ petition filed by a party has been  dismissed
on the merits

passed	 by  his  taking  recourse  to	<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_111">Art.  32</a>    of	 the
Constitution.	Therefore,  we are not	satisfied  that	 the
ground of alternative remedies is well founded.
 We,  must  now	 proceed  to state  our	 conclusion  on	 the
preliminary  objection raised by the respondents.   We	hold
that  if a writ petition filed by a party under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_112">Art. 226</a>  is
considered  on	the  merits as &amp;-contested  matter,  and  is
dismissed  the	decision thus pronounced would	continue  to
bind the parties unless it is otherwise modified or reversed
by appeal or other appropriate proceedings permissible under
the Constitution.  It would not be open to a party to ignore
the  said judgment and move this Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_113">Art. 32</a>  by  an
original  petition made on the same facts and for  obtaining
the same or similar orders or writs.  If the petition  filed
in  the	 High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_114">Art. 226</a> is dismissed not  on	 the
merits	but because of the laches of the party applying	 for
the  writ  or  because	it is held that	 the  party  had  an
alternative  remedy available to it, then the  dismissal  of
the writ petition would not constitute a bar to a subsequent
petition  under	 <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_115">Art. 32</a> except in cases where	and  if	 the
facts  thus  found  by	the High  Court	 may  themselves  be
relevant  even	under  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_116">Art.  32.</a>   If  a  writ	petition  is
dismissed  in  limine  and an order is	pronounced  in	that
behalf, whether or not the dismissal would constitute a	 bar
would depend upon the nature of the order.  If the order  is
on the merits it would be a bar; if the order shows that the
dismissal was for the reason that the petitioner was  guilty
of laches or that he had an alternative remedy it would	 not
be  a bar, except in cases which we have already  indicated.
If  the	 petition is dismissed in limine without  passing  a
speaking  order	 then such dismissal cannot  be	 treated  as
creating  a  bar of res judicata.  It is  true	that,  prima
facie,	dismissal in limine even without passing a  speaking
order  in  that behalf may strongly suggest that  the  Court
took the view that there was no substance in the petition at
all; but in the absence of a speaking order it would not  be
easy to decide
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">593</span>
what factors weighed in the mind of the Court and that makes
it  difficult  and  unsafe  to	hold  that  such  a  summary
dismissal is a dismissal on merits and as such constitutes a
bar  of	 res judicata against a similar The  petition  filed
under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_117">Art. 32.</a>	If the petition is dismissed as withdrawn it
cannot be a bar to a subsequent Gaj petition under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_118">Art.	 32</a>,
because	 in  such a case there has been no decision  on	 the
merits	by  the Court.	We wish to make it  clear  that	 the
conclusions  thus  reached by us are confined  only  to	 the
point of res jadirata which has been argued as a preliminary
issue  in these writ petitions and no other.  It is  in	 the
light  of this decision that we will now proceed to  examine
the position in the six petitions before us.
In  Petition  No. 66 of 1956 we have already seen  that	 the
petition filed in the High Court was on the same allegations
and  was for the same relief The petitioners had  moved	 the
High  Court  to	 obtain a writ of certiorari  to  quash	 the
decision  of  the Revenue Board against them, and  when	 the
matter	was  argued  before the High Court in  view  of	 the
previous  decisions of the High Court their learned  counsel
did  not press the petition.  In other words, the points  of
law  raised  by the petition were dismissed on	the  merits.
That  being so, it is a clear case where the  writ  petition
has  been dismissed on the merits, and so the  dismissal  of
the  writ petition creates a bar against the  competence  of
the  present  petition	under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_119">Art. 32.</a>	 The  position	with
regard to the companion petition, No. 67 of 1956, is exactly
the  same.  In the result these two petitions fail  and	 are
dismissed; there would be no order as to costs.
In Writ Petition No. 8 of 1960 the position is substantially
different.   The previous petition for a writ filed  by	 the
petitioner (No. 68 of 1952) in the Allahabad High Court	 was
withdrawn  by  his  learned  counsel  and  the	High   Court
therefore  dismissed  the  said petition  with	the  express
observation  that the merits had not been considered by	 the
High Court in dismissing it and so no order is to costs	 was
passed.	 This order the writ petition withdrawn which was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">75</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">594</span>
passed	on  February 3, 1955, cannot therefore	support	 the
plea  of  res  judicata against the  present  petition.	  It
appears that a co-lessee of the petitioner had also  filed a
similar	 Writ  Petition,  No. 299 of  1958.   On  this	writ
petition  the High Court no doubt made certain	observations
and findings but in the end it came to	the conclusion	that
a  writ petition was not the proper proceeding for  deciding
such old disputes about title and so it left the  petitioner
to  obtain a declaration about title from a competent  civil
or revenue court in a regular suit.  Thus it would be  clear
that the dismissal of this writ petition (on 17-3-1958) also
cannot	constitute  a  bar against  the	 competence  of	 the
present	 writ  petition.  The preliminary  objection  raised
against	 this writ petition is therefore rejected and it  is
ordered	 that  this writ petition be set  down	for  hearing
before a Constitution Bench.
</p><p id="p_38">In  Petition  No. 77 of 1957 the petitioner  has  stated  in
paragraph  11  of his petition that he had  moved  the	High
Court  of Punjab by a writ petition under Arts. 226 and	 227
but  the same was dismissed in limine on July 14, 1957.	  It
is not clear from this statement whether any speaking  order
was  passed  on the petition or not.  It  appears  that	 the
petitioner  further filed an application for review  of	 the
said  order under O. 47, r. 1 read with<a href="/doc/206650/" id="a_120"> s. 151</a> of  the	Code
but  the  said application was also heard and  dismissed  in
limine	on  March 1, 1957.  It is also not clear  whether  a
speaking order was passed on this application or not.	That
is why, on the material as it stands it is not possible	 for
us  to	deal with the merits of the  preliminary  objection.
We' would accordingly direct that the petitioner should file
the two orders of dismissal passed by the Punjab High Court.
After the said orders are filed this petition may be  placed
for  hearing before the Constitution Bench and the  question
of  res	 judicata  may be, considered in the  light  of	 our
decision in the present group.
</p><p id="p_39">In  Petition No. 15 of 1957 initially we had a bare  recital
that the writ petition made by the petitioner in the  Punjab
High  Court had been dismissed.	 Subsequently, however,	 the
said order itself has been
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">595</span>
produced  and it appears that it gives no reasons  for	dis-
missal.	  Accordingly we must hold that the said order	does
not  create a bar of res judicata and so the  petition	will
have to be set down for hearing on the merits.
In  Writ Petition No. 5 of 1958 the position is clear.	 The
petitioner   had  moved	 the  Bombay  High  Court   for	  an
appropriate  writ challenging the order of the Collector  in
respect of the land in question.  The contentions raised  by
the  petitioner were examined in the light of the  rejoinder
made  by  the Collector and substantially  the	petitioner's
case  was rejected.  It was held by the High Court that	 the
power  conferred on the State Government by<a href="/doc/763353/" id="a_121"> s. 5(3)</a>  of	 the
impugned  Act,	the  Bombay  Service  Inam  (Useful  to	 the
Community)  Abolition Act, 1953, was not arbitrary  nor	 was
its  exercise  in  this	 particular  case  unreasonable,  or
arbitrary.  The	 High Court also held that the land  of	 the
petitioner  attracted  the relevant provisions of  the	said
impugned statute.  Mr. Ayyangar 'for the petitioner realised
the  difficulties in his way, and so he attempted  to  argue
that the contentions which he wanted to raise in his present
petition are put in a different form, and in support of this
argument  he  has invited am attention to grounds 8  and  10
framed	by  him	 in paragraph X of  the	 petition.   We	 are
satisfied  that a change in the form of attack	against	 the
impugned statute would make no difference  to the true legal
position  that the writ petition in the High Court  and	 the
present writ petition are directed against the same  statute
and the grounds raised by the petitioner in that behalf	 are
substantially the same.	 Therefore the decision of the	High
Court  pronounced  by it on the merits of  the	petitioner's
writ  petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_122">Art. 226</a> is a bar to the making of	 the
present	 petition, under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_123">Art. 32.</a>  In the result  this	writ
petition fails and is dismissed.  There would be no order as
to costs.
