HEADNOTE:
     For a  candidate to  be  deemed  to  be  set  up  by  a
political party	 under paragraph  13 of the Election Symbols
(Reservation and Allotment) Order 1968, it is essential that
a notice  in writing  to that  effect  signed  by  the	duly
authorised office-bearer of the political party is delivered
to the	returning officer of the constituency not later than
3 p.m.	on the	last day  of withdrawal of candidatures. The
allotment of  any symbol  to a	candidate by  the  returning
officer is final under sub-r. (5) of r. 10 of the Conduct of
Elections Rules,  1961 except  where it is inconsistent with
any directions	issued by  the Election	 Commission in	that
behalf.
     The appellant,  the respondent  and one  Jagmohan Singh
contested the  election to  the Punjab	Legislative Assembly
from the  same constituency  and the respondent was declared
elected.  The  appellant  challenged  the  election  of	 the
respondent under<a href="/doc/57723398/" id="a_7"> s. 100(1)(d)(iv)</a> read with<a href="/doc/25889893/" id="a_8"> s. 123(7)</a> of the
Representation of  the People  Act, 1951. Paragraphs 4 to 18
of the petition related to change of symbols allotted to the
candidates. It	was averred  therein that  the last  day for
withdrawal of  nomination papers  was May  5, 1980;  that  a
notice in  writing signed by the authorised office-bearer of
the Indian National Congress (I) to the effect that Jagmohan
Singh was contesting as the candidate of that party
703
had been  delivered to	the Returning  Officer on  that day;
that the  Returning    Officer had on May 8, 1980, intimated
by a  letter  that  on	receipt	 of  instructions  from	 the
Election Commission  a	change	had  been  effected  in	 the
symbols allotted  to the  candidates according	to which the
symbol 'hand'  reserved for the Indian National Congress (I)
had been  allotted to  the  respondent;	 that  in  terms  of
paragraph 13  of the  Symbols Order  Jagmohan Singh ought to
have been  deemed to  be the  candidate set up by the Indian
National Congress  (I); that  the Election Commission had no
power to  direct re-allotment of the symbol once allotted to
a candidate  under sub-r.  (4) of  r. 10  and therefore	 the
action of  the Returning  Officer in recalling the allotment
of the	symbol 'hand'  to Jagmohan Singh was in violation of
the Act	 and  the  rules  made	thereunder.  The  respondent
contested these	 averments  in	his  written  statement	 and
referred  to   the  circumstances   in	which  the  Election
Commission had issued the instructions relating to change of
symbols.
     The respondent  raised a preliminary objection that the
averments in  paragraphs 4  to 18  of the  petition did	 not
disclose any  cause of	action and the High Court, accepting
the objection, ordered deletion of those paragraphs from the
petition. The  High Court  held that it was incumbent on the
appellant  to  find  out  the  circumstances  in  which	 the
Election Commission  had passed the order relating to change
of symbols  and	 that  in  the	absence	 of  those  material
circumstances non-compliance  with r.  10(5) or Paragraph 13
of the	Symbols Order  could not  be spelled  out. The	High
Court further  held that  the Symbols Order was not an order
made under  the Act  and therefore <a href="/doc/57723398/" id="a_9"> s. 100(1)(d)(iv)</a> was not
attracted.
     In	 appeal,   counsel  for	  appellant  contended	that
paragraphs 4  to  18  of  the  petition	 contained  all	 the
material facts	necessary to show that the change of symbols
was in	breach of  r. 10(5)  and paragraph 13 of the Symbols
Order and the High Court was not justified in ordering their
deletion.
     Counsel for  respondent contended	that paragraphs 4 to
18 of  the petition  did not disclose any cause of action as
there was  non-disclosure of facts necessary to show how the
order of  the Election Commission was illegal, that the High
Court was  justified in	 striking out those paragraphs under
O. Vl,	r. 16 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 as it had
no power  to direct  further and better particulars under O.
Vl, r.	5. Laying  emphasis on	the words  "under  the	Act"
occurring in <a href="/doc/57723398/" id="a_10"> s. 100(1)(d)(iv)</a> he contended that the Symbols
Order was not an Order made under the Act.
     Allowing the appeal,
^
     HELD:  Cl.	  (a)  of   sub-s.(1)  of  <a href="/doc/123749551/" id="a_11"> s.	83</a>   of	 the
Representation of  the People  Act,  1951  enjoins  that  an
election petition  shall contain  a concise statement of the
material facts on which the election petitioner relies. This
clause is  based on  the provisions of O. VI, r. 2(1) of the
Code of	 Civil Procedure,  1908 from  which it is clear that
the statement  of material  facts ought	 not to	 contain the
evidence by  which they are proved. Cl. (b) of sub-s. (1) of
s. 83 states that an
704
election petitioner  must set  forth full particulars of any
corrupt practice  on which he challenges the election of the
returned candidate.  This clause  is based  on O VI, r. 4 of
the Code  and the High Court has ample power while trying an
election petition  to direct  further and better particulars
as to  the nature  of the  claim or defence under O.VI, r.5.
The word 'material' in cl. (a) means facts necessary for the
purpose of  formulating a  complete cause  of action; and if
any one material fact is omitted, the statement or plaint is
bad; it	 is  liable  to	 be  struck  out.  The	function  of
'particulars' in  cl. (b)  is quite  different; the  use  of
particulars is intended to meet a further and quite separate
requirement of	pleading imposed  in fairness and justice to
the returned  candidate. The function of 'particulars' is to
fill in	 the picture  of the  election-petitioner's cause of
action with  information sufficiently  detailed to  put	 the
returned candidate  on his  guard as  to the  case he has to
meet and  to enable him to prepare for trial in a case where
his election  is challenged  on the  ground of	any  corrupt
practice. Under	 O.VI, r.5. 'particulars' will be ordered of
the 'material  facts' on which the party pleading relies for
his claim  or defence. If a party's pleading is defective he
can also  seek leave  to alter	and amend  his own defective
pleading  under	  O.VI,	 r.17.	There  is  no  express	rule
providing for  the consequence of a party failing to deliver
'particulars'  required	 by  order  of	the  Court  but	 the
decisions are to the effect that either by the order calling
for particulars or by a later order the court can direct the
claim or  defence to  be struck out under O.VI, r.16. [724B;
723 H; 724 C-F; 726 C-E; 724 G-H; 725 A]
     In the  instant case  the question	 whether  the  order
passed by the High Court could be justified under O.VI, r.16
would depend  upon whether  or not the election petition was
in conformity  with the	 requirements of s.83. A preliminary
objection that	the election  petition does  not  contain  a
concise statement  of material facts on which the petitioner
relies is  but a  plea in  the nature  of  demurrer  and  in
deciding the  question the  court had  to  assume  for	this
purpose that  the averments  contained in  the petition were
true. Although	the High  Court observed  that a question of
this nature  had to  be decided	 on a  consideration of	 the
averments in  the election  petition alone, it later on made
certain observations which tend to show that the allegations
in the written statement of the respondent were very much in
its mind.  It is  no part  of the  statement of an election-
petitioner to  anticipate the  defence and  to state what he
would have  to say  in answer  to it. The High Court cast on
the appellant  the burden of disclosing facts not within his
knowledge. This approach was unwarranted. The High Court was
not justified in directing that the averments in paragraphs,
4 to  18 of the petition be deleted on the ground that there
was non-disclosure of material facts sufficient to give rise
to a cause of action under<a href="/doc/57723398/" id="a_12"> s. 100(1)(d)(iv)</a>. It is not clear
from the order whether the High Court proceeded to act under
O.VII, r.  1 1	(a) or under O.VII, r. 16. It could not have
acted under  O. VII, r. 1 1 (a) as, under that rule, when it
is found that the plaint discloses no cause of action, it is
obligatory to  reject the  plaint as  a whole  and  not	 any
particular portion  thereof. The  High Court's	Order cannot
also be	 sustained under  O.VI, r.16  because there  was  no
finding that the averments in paragraphs 4 to 18 were either
unnecessary, frivolous	or vexatious,  or were	such as	 may
tend to	 prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the
election, or  were such	 as to	constitute an  abuse of	 the
process of the court. [723C; 721H; 722 A-B; 724 B; 721C; 719

603, referred to.
     (b) The  contention that the High Court had no power to
direct further and better particulars under O.VI, r.5 cannot
be accepted.  Sub-s. (1) of s.87 enacts that the trial of an
election  petition  shall  be,	as  nearly  as	may  be,  in
accordance with	 the procedure	applicable under the Code of
Civil Procedure,  1908 to the trial of suits, subject to the
provisions of  the Act	and of	any rules  made	 thereunder.
There are  no express  provisions in the Act or in the rules
made thereunder	 to deal  with	a  situation  like  the	 one
presented in  the instant  case. The  provisions of the Code
accordingly must  apply in  such a  case as provided by sub-
s.(1) of  s 87.	 That being so, the provisions of O.VI which
are integral  part of  the Code come into play except to the
extent modified by sub-s. (5) of<a href="/doc/149856068/" id="a_14"> s. 86</a>. [727 A-B; 726 <a href="/doc/363539/" id="a_15">E-G]

     2. The  High Court	 was in	 error in  holding that	 the
Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968 was
not an	order made  under the  <a href="/doc/320017/" id="a_17">Representation of  the People
Act</a>, 1951.  <a href="/doc/320017/" id="a_18">The Act</a>  is a  law made by Parliament under <a href="/doc/31824/" id="a_19">Art.
327</a> of	the Constitution to provide for conduct of elections
and the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961 are rules framed by
the Central Government under<a href="/doc/179381577/" id="a_20"> s. 169</a> in consultation with the
Election Commission  for  regulating  the  mode	 of  holding
elections.  Rule  5  requires  the  Election  Commission  to
specify the symbols that may be chosen by candidates and the
restrictions to	 which their choice shall be subjected. Rule
10  provides   for  allotment	of  symbols   to  contesting
candidates by  the returning  officer subject to any general
or special  directions issued in that behalf by the Election
Commission. By	virtue of  <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_21">Art. 324</a>  of the Constitution the
authority to  conduct all  elections to Parliament and State
Legislatures is	 vested	 in  the  Election  Commission.	 The
Symbols Order  has been issued by the Election Commission in
exercise of its powers under <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_22">Art. 324</a> read with<a href="/doc/121084/" id="a_23"> s. 5</a> and <a href="/doc/1213036/" id="a_24">10</a>.
The primary  object of	the Symbol  Order is  to provide for
specification, reservation,  choice and allotment of symbols
at elections  in parliamentary	and assembly constituencies.
It is  a matter	 of common  knowledge that  elections in our
country are  fought on	the basis  of symbols.	It must	 but
logically follow  as a	necessary corollary that the Symbols
Order is  an order  made under the Act. Any other view would
be destructive	of the	very fabric of our system of holding
parliamentary and  assembly constituency  elections  in	 the
country on the basis of adult suffrage. [718 B; 712 G; 713

     The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
     SEN, J. This appeal by special leave is from a judgment
and order  of the Punjab &amp; Haryana High Court dated February
2, 1981	 by which it has directed the deletion of paragraphs
4 to  18 of  the election  petition filed  by the  appellant
under<a href="/doc/124681654/" id="a_26"> s.  81</a> read  with<a href="/doc/21523700/" id="a_27"> s.  100</a> of the Representation of the
People Act,  1951 ('Act'  for short) calling in question the
election of  the respondent  Nachhattar Singh  Gill  to	 the
State Legislative  Assembly of Punjab from the Moga Assembly
Constituency No.  99  on  the  ground  that  there  is	non-
disclosure of  material facts  on which	 he alleges that the
change of  allotment of	 symbols by  the Returning  Officer,
Moga amounted  to non-compliance  with the provisions of the
Constitution, or  of the  Act, or  any rules  or orders made
thereunder so that the result of the election, insofar as it
concerns the  respondent i.e.  the  returned  candidate,  is
materially affected.
</p><p id="p_5">     At the  last general elections to the State Legislative
Assembly of  Punjab from  Moga Assembly	 Constituency No. 99
the appellant contested as a candidate of the Lok Dal Party.
The last  date	for  withdrawal	 of  nomination	 papers	 was
notified as  May 5,  1980. It  appears that on that day Shri
Darbara Singh,	President of the Punjab Pradesh Congress (I)
Committee, intimated  the Returning  Officer  that  Jagmohan
Singh had  been nominated  as the  official candidate of the
Indian National	 Congress (I) to contest the election. There
is also	 on record  a letter  dated May 5, 1980 addressed by
Shri Darbara  Singh, President,	 Punjab Pradesh Congress (I)
Committee, to the respondent stating that Jagmohan Singh had
been finally  selected as  the	official  candidate  of	 the
Indian National	 Congress  (I)	from  the  99-Moga  Assembly
Constituency in	 his place,  and he  was advised to withdraw
his nomination paper.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">707</span>
<p id="p_6">     It	 appears  that	the  Indian  National  Congress	 (I)
changed its  official candidate	 and  finally  selected	 the
respondent  Nachhattar	 Singh	Gill   to  be  the  official
candidate of  its party.  On  May  7,  1980,  the  Returning
Officer, Moga  Vidhan Sabha  Assembly Constituency  wrote  a
letter to  Jagmohan Singh  stating that he had been directed
by the	Secretary, Election Commission of India, by means of
a police radio message that the respondent was to be treated
as the finally selected candidate, and that party's reserved
symbol 'hand'  be allotted  to him.  On	 May  8,  1980,	 the
Returning Officer,  Moga Vidhan Sabha Assembly Constituency,
addressed a  letter to	all  the  candidates  regarding	 the
change in the allotment of election symbols to the effect:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	  "According to	 the  instructions  from  the  Chief
     Election Commissioner of India, certain change has been
     effected in  the election	symbols of the candidates of
     the  election   to	 the  99-Moga  Legislative  Assembly
     Constituency which is as under:</blockquote><pre id="pre_2">
     S.No.   Name of the Candidate	     Symbol Allotted
     1.	     Shri Nachhattar Singh		  'HAND'
     2.	     Shri Jagmohan Singh	      "BOW &amp; ARROW"
</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     Accordingly,  the	 necessary  change  of	symbols	 was
effected in  Form 7A, the list of contesting candidates. The
respondent fought the election on the reserved symbol of the
Indian National	 Congress  (I)	'hand'	and  secured  22,460
votes. As  against this,  the appellant, who was a candidate
of the	Lok  Dal  party,  secured  16,686  votes  while	 the
aforesaid Jagmohan Singh as an Independent candidate got 242
votes.	The   appellant	 was   therefore  defeated   by	 the
respondent by  a margin	 of 5,774 votes. The appellant filed
an  election   petition	 challenging  the  election  of	 the
respondent under<a href="/doc/21523700/" id="a_28"> s. 100</a> (1) (d) (iv) read with<a href="/doc/70252546/" id="a_29"> s. 123</a> (7) of
the Act.  The averments in paragraphs 4 to 18 related to the
change of  symbols allotted  to the  respondent viz.  'hand'
instead of 'bow &amp; arrow' allotted to Jagmohan Singh.</blockquote>
<p id="p_7">     Upon these	 facts, it  is averred	in paragraph 12 that
Jagmohan Singh	alone be  deemed to be set up as a candidate
by the	Indian National	 Congress (I)  within the meaning of
paragraph  13	of  the	  Election  Symbols  (Reservation  &amp;
Allotment) Order,  1968 and not the respondent, and that the
candidates could withdraw their
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">708</span>
nomination papers  under<a href="/doc/59976370/" id="a_30"> s.  37</a> (1)  before 3 p.m. on May 5,
1980 which was notified by the Election Commission to be the
last date for withdrawal of candidatures under<a href="/doc/1320832/" id="a_31"> s. 30</a> (c) and
thereafter the	Returning Officer  was enjoined	 under<a href="/doc/152734757/" id="a_32"> s. 38</a>
(1) to	publish in  the prescribed  Form 7A  the  names	 and
addresses of  the contesting  candidates together  with	 the
symbols allotted  to them.  It is  then averred in paragraph
14:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	  "On a	 perusal of  para 18 of the Symbols Order it
     is clear  that the	 Election Commission has no power to
     issue instructions	 and  directions  to  the  Returning
     Officer of	 an Assembly  Constituency to  re-allot	 the
     symbol once  allotted to  a contesting  candidate under
     sub-rule (4)  of rule  10 of  the Conduct	of Elections
     Rules and	to allot  the symbol reserved for a National
     Party who has allotted the symbol to a candidate deemed
     to be  set up  by that political party under para 13 of
     the  Symbols  Order  to  any  other  person  after	 the
     publication of the list of the contesting candidates in
     Form 7A."</blockquote>
<p id="p_8">     In paragraph  15 after  stating that Jagmohan Singh had
delivered to  the Returning  Officer a	notice in writing as
provided for under paragraph 13 (b) from Shri Darbara Singh,
President, Punjab  Pradesh Congress  (I) Committee,  who was
duly authorized by the Indian National Congress (I) to issue
such authorization  as envisaged under paragraph 13 (c), the
appellant avers	 that the action of the Returning Officer in
recalling on  May 8, 1980 the allotment of the symbol 'hand'
to Jagmohan  Singh on  May 5, 1980 and allotting the same to
the respondent,	 was in	 violation of  the provisions of the
Act and	 the rules  made thereunder,  and the  result of the
election, insofar as it concerns the returned candidate i.e.
the respondent,	 has been  materially affected	inasmuch  as
because of  the change of symbol Jagmohan Singh got only 242
votes while  the respondent could not have secured more than
the same  number if  he had  contested on  the symbol 'bow &amp;
arrow' earlier	allotted to  him. If  the respondent had not
been allotted  the reserved  symbol  'hand'  of	 the  Indian
National Congress  (I), he  could not have won the election.
In paragraphs  16, 17  and 18,	the appellant  set out	some
facts showing  how the result of the election, insofar as it
concerns the respondent, has been materially affected by the
change of allotment of symbols.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">709</span>
<p id="p_9">     The respondent  filed a written statement controverting
the allegation	that there  was a  breach of paragraph 13 of
the Symbols Order by the change of allotment of symbols made
by the Returning Officer in accordance with the instructions
issued by  the Election	 Commission. It	 was pleaded,  inter
alia, that  the respondent  had made  a declaration  in	 the
nomination paper  filed by  him on May 2, 1980 to the effect
that he	 had been  selected as	a candidate  of	 the  Indian
National Congress  (I); and  that he  had  on  May  5,	1980
furnished a  notice to	the  Returning	Officer	 signed	 and
issued by  Shri Darbara	 Singh,	 President,  Punjab  Pradesh
Congress (I)  Committee, in pursuance of paragraph 13 (b) of
the Symbols  Order. It was alleged that after the respondent
had been  adopted as  a candidate  by  the  Indian  National
Congress (I),  Jagmohan Singh  made an	effort to  get	that
party's ticket	for the seat and produced a letter from Shri
Darbara Singh dated May 5, 1980 before the Returning Officer
showing that  he was  the official  candidate of  the Indian
National Congress  (I). When  the respondent  learnt of this
move on	 the part of Jagmohan Singh, he met the President of
the Indian National Congress (I) at New Delhi on the morning
of May	5, 1980	 and apprised  her of  the situation and was
informed that  he had  been finally  selected as  the  party
candidate and there was no question of a change.
</p><p id="p_10">     It is  further averred that a communication was sent by
Shri Buta  Singh on  May  5,  1980  to	the  Chief  Election
Officer, Punjab,  Chandigarh and  the Returning Officer, 99-
Moga Assembly  Constituency, in	 supersession of all earlier
communications with  regard to	the  Assembly  Constituency,
stating that  the respondent  was the  official candidate of
the Indian National Congress (I) and that the party's symbol
'hand' be  allotted to him. A letter to this effect was also
delivered by  Smt. G.  Brar, Member  of	 Parliament  to	 the
Election  Commission   on  the	 morning  of  May  5,  1980.
Thereafter,  Shri   Ganesan,  Secretary	  to  the   Election
Commission, got	 in touch  with the Chief Electoral Officer,
Chandigarh and	informed him  that the	respondent  was	 the
official candidate  of the  Indian  National  Congress	(I).
There was  a mention  of this talk in the telex message sent
by the	Secretary to  the Returning Officer, Moga, with copy
to the Chief Electoral Officer, Punjab on May 5, 1980.
</p><p id="p_11">     A preliminary  objection was  raised on  behalf of	 the
respondent that	 the averments in paragraphs 4 to 18 as well
as paragraphs 19A
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">710</span>
and 20, with which we are not concerned, do not disclose any
cause of  action and therefore they are liable to be deleted
under Order  VII, r.  11 (a) of the Code of Civil Procedure.
The High Court accordingly framed a preliminary issue to the
effect :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">	  "Whether paragraphs  4 to 18, 19 (a) and 20 of the
     election  petition	 have  to  be  deleted	because	 the
     averments made  therein do	 not make  out any  case for
     setting aside  the election  under<a href="/doc/21523700/" id="a_33"> s.  100</a> (1) (d) (iv)
     and<a href="/doc/70252546/" id="a_34"> s.  123</a> (7)  of the  <a href="/doc/320017/" id="a_35">Representation of	 the  People
     Act</a>."</blockquote>
<p id="p_12">     By the  judgment under appeal, the High Court sustained
the preliminary objection and directed that the averments in
paragraphs 4 to 18 be struck out from the election petition.
In dealing  with the  question, the High Court observed that
the preliminary issue had to be decided upon a consideration
of the pleas in the election petition and nothing averred in
the written statement could be taken into account.
</p><p id="p_13">     On a  consideration of the averments in paragraphs 4 to
18  the	  High	Court	felt  that   the  use  of  the	word
"instructions" in  Annexure P-I, the letter addressed by the
Returning Officer, Moga Assembly Constituency on May 8, 1980
to all	the candidates	intimating about  the change  in the
allotment of  election symbol to the respondent, cannot lead
to an  inference of their being issued under paragraph 18 of
the Symbols Order. It then observes :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">	  "The petitioner  has not  at all  disclosed in the
     election petition	as to  what was exactly the order of
     the Election  Commission  behind  the  instructions  in
     Annexure P-I, and how it was in contravention of any of
     the provisions  of the  Act, or  rule,  or	 order	made
     thereunder."</blockquote>
<p id="p_14">     It was  urged on  behalf of  the respondent that before
filing	the  election  petition	 it  was  incumbent  on	 the
appellant to  find out the entire circumstances in which the
Election Commission  passed the	 order as  to the  change of
symbols	 and   consequently  issued   instructions  to	 the
Returning Officer  in that  behalf. The	 High Court accepted
the contention and observed that "in the absence of material
circumstances, non-compliance  with the	 provisions of r. 10
(5) of	the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961, or of paragraph
13 of  the Election Symbols (Reservation &amp; Allotment) Order,
1968 could  not be spelled out," Further, the High Court was
of the view that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">711</span>
the  Symbols   Order  having   been  made  by  the  Election
Commission in  exercise of  the powers under <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_36">Art. 324</a> of the
Constitution read  with Rs.  5 and  10	of  the	 Conduct  of
Elections Rules, it cannot be said to be an order made under
the Act	 and therefore the provisions of<a href="/doc/21523700/" id="a_37"> s. 100</a> (1) (d) (iv)
of the	Act were  not attracted. Accordingly, the High Court
directed that paragraphs 4 to 18 of the election petition be
deleted.
</p><p id="p_15">     It is  argued by learned counsel for the appellant that
under sub-s.  (1) of <a href="/doc/123749551/" id="a_38"> s. 83</a> of the Act, an election petition
must contain  a concise	 statement of  the material facts on
which the  election petitioner	relies; the  words "material
facts" mean  the facts	necessary to  formulate	 a  complete
cause of  action. It  is urged	that all  the material facts
have been  stated in  the election  petition  to  show	that
change of  allotment of symbols by the Returning Officer, in
compliance with	 the directions	 of the Election Commission,
was in	breach of  r. 10 (5) and paragraph 13 of the Symbols
Order which  gave rise to a cause of action under<a href="/doc/21523700/" id="a_39"> s. 100</a> (1)
</p><p id="p_16">(d) (iv)  of the  Act. According to the learned counsel, the
appellant had  disclosed all  the facts within his knowledge
and it was no part of his duty to anticipate the defence and
plead facts  in relation  thereto. It  is further urged that
the High Court was in error in holding that the breach of r.
10 (5),	 paragraphs 13	and 18 of the Symbols Order does not
constitute  non-compliance   with  any	 provisions  of	 the
Constitution, or  the Act,  or	any  rules  or	orders	made
thereunder.
</p><p id="p_17">     In reply,	learned counsel for the respondent submitted
that the  Symbols Order	 was not an order made under the Act
and therefore  the change  of allotment	 of  symbols  was  a
matter which fell outside the purview of<a href="/doc/21523700/" id="a_40"> s. 100</a> (1) (d) (iv)
of the	Act, It was urged that there  was no breach of r. 10
(5) of	the Conduct  of Elections  Rules or of paragraphs 13
and 18	of the	Symbols Order inasmuch as the respondent was
the official  candidate set  up by  Indian National Congress
(I) and	 he had	 in the nomination paper filed by him before
the Returning  Officer on  May 3, 1980 made a declaration to
the effect and had also indicated his choice of that party's
reserved symbol	 'hand'. Our  attention was drawn to certain
averments in  the written  statement which tend to show that
the respondent	was, in fact, the candidate sponsored by the
Indian	National   Congress  (I).  Learned  counsel  made  a
grievance that	the appellant  had  deliberately  suppressed
this fact  in paragraph 7 of the election petition. Further,
he urged  that it was incumbent on the appellant to find out
the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">712</span>
circumstances in  which the  Election Commission  issued the
necessary instructions	as to  the change  of symbols  under
paragraph 18 of the Symbols order. It was contended that the
High  Court   was  therefore   justified  in   striking	 out
paragraphs 4  to 18  of the  election petition on the ground
that they  do not  disclose any	 cause of action. Further it
was contended  that the	  High	Court had  no power to order
further and  better particulars	 under Order VI, r. 5 of the
Code of	 Civil Procedure.  In  support	of  the	 contention,
reliance was  placed on	 <a href="/doc/363539/" id="a_41">Hari Vishnu  Kamath v. The Election
Tribunal, Jabalpur &amp; Anr</a>. (1)
     In this  appeal, two questions arise. First of these is
whether any  breach of	paragraph 13  or 18  of the  Symbols
Order amounts  to non-compliance  with the provisions of the
Constitution, or  the Act, or any rules or orders made under
the Act	 and therefore the change of allotment of symbols by
the Returning  Officer in  compliance with the directions of
the Election  Commission was  a matter which fell within the
purview of <a href="/doc/21523700/" id="a_42"> s. 100</a>  (1) (d)  (iv) of  the Act. The second is
whether it  was incumbent on the appellant before filing the
election petition  to find  out the  circumstances in which,
and the	 reasons for  which, the  Election Commission issued
necessary instructions	under paragraph	 18 of	the  Symbols
Order; and  if so,  whether failure  to disclose  such facts
amounts	 to   non-disclosure  of   material  facts  i.e.  an
incomplete cause  of action under<a href="/doc/21523700/" id="a_43"> s. 100</a> (1) (d) (iv) of the
Act and therefore the averments in paragraphs 4 to 18 of the
election petition  were liable	to be struck out under Order
VI, r. 16 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.
</p><p id="p_18">     As to  the	 first	question,  there  can  be  no  doubt
whatever that  the Symbols  Order is an order made under the
Act.   Under	<a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_44">Art.   324</a>    of   the	 Constitution,	 the
superintendence, direction and control of the preparation of
the electoral  rolls for,  and the conduct of, all elections
to Parliament  and the	Legislature of	every State  and  of
elections to  the offices  of President	 and  Vice-President
held  under   the  Constitution,   vests  in   the  Election
Commission. <a href="/doc/320017/" id="a_45">The	 Act</a> is	 a law made by Parliament under <a href="/doc/31824/" id="a_46">Art.

thereof provides  that in  particular, and without prejudice
to the	generality of  the foregoing power, the rules framed

all or any of the matters enumerated therein. In exercise of
the powers  under<a href="/doc/179381577/" id="a_48"> s.  169</a> of the Act, the Central Government
made the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961 for the purpose of
regulating the	mode of	 holding elections  to the Houses of
Parliament  or	 to  the   House  or  either  House  of	 the
Legislature of	every  State.  Rule  5	of  the	 Conduct  of
Elections Rules	 requires the Election Commission to specify
the  symbols   that  may   be  chosen	by   candidates	  in
parliamentary and assembly elections and the restrictions to
which that choice shall be subject, and it provides:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">	  "5. Symbols  for elections  in  parliamentary	 and

candidates by  the Returning  Officer subject to any general

<p id="p_21">     The Election  Symbols (Reservation	 &amp; Allotment) Order,
1968 was  issued by  the Election  Commission in exercise of
its powers  under <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_49">Art. 324</a> of the Constitution read with rs.
5 and  10 of  the Conduct  of Elections	 Rules, 1961 and all
other powers enabling in that behalf. The primary object and
purpose of  the Symbols	 Order, as  the long  title and	 the
preamble show, is to provide for specification, reservation,
choice	and   allotment	  of   symbols	 at   elections	  in
parliamentary	and   assembly	 constituencies,   for	 the
recognition of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">715</span>
political  parties  in	relation  thereto  and	for  matters
connected there- with. The purpose and object of the Symbols
Order as  well as  the source of power under which the Order
was issued is brought out in the preamble which reads:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">	  "Whereas  the	  superintendence,   direction	 and
     control of	 all elections	to  Parliament	and  to	 the
     Legislature  of   every  State   are  vested   by	 the
     Constitutution of	India in  the Election Commission of
     India.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">	  And, whereas	it is  necessary  and  expedient  to
     provide in	 the interests	of purity of election to the
     House of  the People  and the  Legislative Assembly  of
     every State and in the interests of the conduct of such
     elections in  a fair  and	efficient  manner,  for	 the
     specification, reservation,  choice  and  allotment  of
     symbols for  the recognition  of political	 parties  in
     relation thereto and for matters connected therewith.
	  Now,	therefore,   in	 exercise   of	the   powers
     conferred by  <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_50">article 324</a> of the Constitution read with
     rule 5  and rule  10 of the Conduct of Elections Rules,
     1961, and	all other powers enabling it in this behalf,
     the Election  Commission  of  India  hereby  makes	 the
     following Order."</blockquote>
<p id="p_22">     It would be apparent from the provisions of the Conduct
of  Elections	Rules,	1961   and  the	  Election   Symbols
(Reservation &amp;	Allotment) Order,  1968 that  when elections
are  imminent,	 allotment  of	symbols	 to  candidates	 for
elections in  parliamentary and	 assembly constituencies  is
but an important stage of such elections. The provisions for
registration of	 political parties  and their recognition as
National or State parties by the Commission are only for the
purpose	 of  allotment,	 reservation  and  specification  of
symbols at  elections. The  expression, "political party" is
defined in  paragraph 2	 (h) to mean "an association or body
of individuals	of India registered with the Commission as a
political party	 under paragraph  3 and includes a political
party deemed  to be registered with the Commission under the
proviso to  sub-para (2)  of that  paragraph."	Paragraph  3
provides   for	 registration	with   the   Commission	  of
associations and  bodies of individuals as political parties
for the	 purposes of  the Order and paragraph 4 provides for
allotment  of	symbols.  Paragraph   5	  deals	  with	 the
classification of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">716</span>
symbols. According to this paragraph, a 'reserved symbol' is
a symbol reserved for a political party for exclusive use of
that party. A symbol other than the reserved symbol has been
described by  the said	paragraph to  be  a  'free  symbol'.
Paragraph 6  provides for  the classification  of  political
parties. The parties are either recognized political parties
or unrecognized	 political parties  and	 it  lays  down	 the
conditions necessary  for a political party to be treated as
a recognized  political	 party.	 If  a	political  party  is
treated as  a recognized  political party  in four  or	more
States in  accordance with  paragraph 6,  it shall  have the
status of  a National  party throughout	 the whole of India.
If, on	the contrary,  a political  party is  treated  as  a
recognized political  party in	less than  four	 States,  it
shall enjoy  the status	 of a  State party  in the  State or
States in  which it is a recognized political party. We need
not dilate  upon this  aspect because  it is  not in dispute
that the  Indian National  Congress (I) and Lok Dal are both
National  parties.  Paragraph  8  regulates  the  manner  of
allotment of  symbols, and  sub-para (I)  and (3)  which are
relevant for our purposes read:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">	  "8. Choice  of symbols  by candidates	 of National
     and State Parties and allotment thereof:
     (1)   A candidate	set up	by a  National party  at any
	  election in any constituency in India shall choose
	  and shall  be allotted,  the symbol  reserved	 for
	  that party and no other symbol.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">     (2)       xx	 xx	   xx
     (3)   A reserved  symbol shall  not be  chosen  by,  or
	  allotted to,	any candidate  in  any	constituency
	  other than  a candidate set up by a National party
	  for whom  such  symbol  has  been  reserved  or  a
	  candidate set	 up by	a State	 party for whom such
	  symbol has  been reserved in the State in which it
	  is a State party even if no candidate has been set
	  up  by  such	National  or  State  party  in	that
	  constituency."
</blockquote><p id="p_23">Paragraphs 9  to 12  deal with	certain restrictions  on the
allotment of  symbols, concessions  to certain candidates as
well as	 choice of symbols for some categories of candidates
with which  we are  not concerned. Paragraph 13 specifies as
to when a candidate shall be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">717</span>
deemed to  be set up as a candidate by a political party and
reads as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">	  "13  When a candidate shall be deemed to be set up
     by a  political party-For	the purpose  of this Order a
     candidate shall  be deemed	 to be set up by a political
     party if, and only if,
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">     (a)  the candidate	 has  made  a  declaration  to	this
	  effect in his nomination   paper;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_17">     (b)  a notice  in writing to that effect has, not later
	  than 3  P.M. on  the last  day  of  withdrawal  of
	  candidatures,	 been  delivered  to  the  returning
	  officer of the constituency; and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_18">     (c)  the said  notice is  signed by  the president, the
	  secretary or	any other office-bearer of the party
	  and the president, secretary or such other office-
	  bearer is  authorised by  the party  to send	such
	  notice and  the name and specimen signature of the
	  president, the  secretary or	such  other  office-
	  bearer  are	communicated  in   advance  to	 the
	  returning officer  of the  constituency and to the
	  Chief Electoral Officer of the State."
</blockquote><p id="p_24">Paragraph 18 which is important for our purposes is in these
terms:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_19">	  "18. Power of Commission to issue instructions and
     directions-The Commission	may issue  instructions	 and
     directions:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_20">     (a)  for the  clarification of any of the provisions of
	  this Order;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_21">     (b)  for the  removal of any difficulty which may arise
	  in relation  to the  implementation  of  any	such
	  provisions; and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_22">     (c)  in relation  to any  matter with  respect  to	 the
	  reservation	and   allotment	  of   symbols	 and
	  recognition of  political parties,  for which this
	  order makes no
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">718</span>
	  provision or	makes  insufficient  provision,	 and
	  provision is	in the	opinion	 of  the  Commission
	  necessary for	 the smooth  and orderly  conduct of
	  elections."</blockquote>
<p id="p_25">     In our judgment, the High Court was clearly in error in
holding that  the Symbols  Order was not an order made under
the Act	 and therefore the change of allotment of symbols by
the Returning  Officer in  compliance  with  the  directions
issued by  the Election Commission, even if it was in breach
of paragraph  13 thereof,  did not  amount to non-compliance
with the  provisions of the Constitution, or the Act, or any
rules or  orders made under the Act and therefore the matter
fell outside the ambit of<a href="/doc/21523700/" id="a_51"> s. 100</a> (1) (d) (iv) of the Act. It
is however  urged by learned counsel for the respondent that
the Symbols  Order was	not an	order made  under  the	Act.
Emphasis is  laid on  the words "under the Act" occurring in
s. 100	(1) (d) (iv) of the Act. We are afraid, the argument
is too	tenuous to be accepted. The Symbols Order was issued
by  the	  Election  Commission	 under	<a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_52">Art.   324</a>  of	 the
Constitution  in   exercise  of	  its  undoubted  powers  of
superintendence, direction and control of the conduct of all
elections to  Parliament and  Legislature of every State. It
is also	 relatable to  rules 5	and 10	of  the	 Conduct  of
Elections Rules framed by the Central Government in exercise
of their  powers under	s. 169	of the	Act. Rule  4 of	 the
Conduct of  Elections Rules  provides that  every nomination
paper presented	 under<a href="/doc/35641423/" id="a_53"> s. 33</a> of the Act shall be in Forms 2A
to 2E,	as may	be appropriate.	 The Forms 2A and 2B require
the candidate  to choose symbol. Under r. 5 (1) the Election
Commission by  notification may specify the symbols that may
be chosen  by candidates  at elections	to parliamentary and
assembly constituencies.  Under	 r.  10	 (4)  the  Returning
Officer shall  consider the  choice of	symbols expressed by
contesting candidates and "subject to any general or special
direction issued by the Election Commission" allot different
symbols to different candidates. The allotment of symbols by
the Returning  Officer is  final under	sub-r. (5)  of r. 10
except where  it is  inconsistent with any directions issued
by the	Election Commission in that behalf in which case the
Election Commission  may revise the allotment in such manner
as it thinks fit.
</p><p id="p_26">     <a href="/doc/876928/" id="a_54">In Sadiq  Ali &amp;  Anr. v. Election Commission of India &amp;
Ors</a>.(1) Khanna, J. speaking for the court, after setting out
the scheme of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">719</span>
the Symbols  Order, explained  the reasons  which led to the
introduction of symbols, in these words:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_23">	  "It is  well known  that overwhelming	 majority of
     the electorate  are illiterate. It was realised that in
     view of  the handicap  of illiteracy,  it might  not be
     possible for  the illiterate voters to cast their votes
     in favour of the candidate of their choice unless there
     was some  pictorial representation	 on the ballot paper
     itself whereby such voters might identify	  the
     candidate of  their choice.  Symbols  were	 accordingly
     brought into use. Symbols or emblems are not a peculiar
     feature of	 election law  of India.  In some countries,
     details in	 the form  of letters of alphabet or numbers
     are added	against the  name of each candidate while in
     others, resort  is made  to  symbols  or  emblems.	 The
     object is	to ensure that the process of election is as
     genuine and fair as possible and that no elector should
     suffer from  any handicap in casting his vote in favour
     of a candidate of his choice."</blockquote>
<p id="p_27">     The Symbols  Order made  by the  Election Commission in
exercise of its power under Art 324 of the Constitution read
with rs.  5 and 10 of the Conduct of Elections Rules and all
other powers  enabling it  in that behalf, are in the nature
of general  directions issued  by the Election Commission to
regulate the  mode of allotment of symbols to the contesting
candidates.  It	  is  a	 matter	 of  common  knowledge	that
elections in our country are fought on the basis of symbols.
It must	 but logically	follow as a necessary corollary that
the Symbols  Order is an order made under the Act. Any other
view would  be destructive  of the very fabric of our system
of holding parliamentary and assembly constituency elections
in the country on the basis of adult suffrage.
</p><p id="p_28">     As to  the second	question,  there  can  be  no  doubt
whatever that  the High Court was not justified in directing
that the  averments in	paragraphs 4  to 18  of the election
petition be  deleted on	 the  ground  that  there  was	non-
disclosure of  material facts  sufficient to  give rise to a
cause of action under<a href="/doc/21523700/" id="a_55"> s. 100</a> (1) (d) (iv) of the Act.
</p><p id="p_29">     The order	passed	by  the	 High  Court  directing	 the
striking out  of paragraphs 4 to 18 of the election petition
can hardly be supported. It is not clear from the order that
the High Court
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">720</span>
proceeded to  act under	 Order VII, r. II (a) or under Order
VI, r.	16 of  the Code in passing the order that it did. It
is rightly conceded that the High Court could not have acted
under Order  VII, r.  II (a)  of the  Code. Where the plaint
discloses no cause of action it is obligatory upon the Court
to reject  the plaint  as a whole under Order VII, r. II (a)
of the	Code, but the rule does not justify the rejection of
any particular	portion of a plaint: Mulla's Civil Procedure
Code, 13th  Edn., Vol.	1, p. 755. It is therefore necessary
to consider whether the order passed by the High Court could
be justified  under order VI, r. 16 of the Code, which reads
as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_24">	  "16.Striking out  pleadings-The Court	 may at	 any
     stage of  the proceedings	order to  be struck  out  or
     amended any matter in any pleading-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_25">	  (a)  which   may   be	  unnecessary,	 scandalous,
	       frivolous or vexatious, or
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_26">	  (b)  which may  tend to  prejudice,  embarrass  or
	       delay the fair trial of the suit, or
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_27">	  (c)  which is otherwise an abuse of the process of
	       the Court."</blockquote>
<p id="p_30">     The order	passed by  the	High  Court  directing	that
paragraphs 4  to 18  of the  election petition be struck out
cannot be  sustained on	 the terms of Order VI, r. 16 of the
Code. There is no finding reached by the High Court that the
averments in paragraphs 4 to 18 of the election petition are
either unnecessary, frivolous or vexatious, or that they are
such as	 may tend  to prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair
trial of  the election,	 nor is	 there any  finding that the
averments therein  are such as to constitute an abuse of the
process of  the court.	That being so, the High Court had no
power to  direct the  striking out  of paragraphs 4 to 18 of
the election petition.
</p><p id="p_31">     It is  submitted by  learned counsel for the respondent
that there  is non-disclosure  of the necessary facts by the
appellant in  paragraphs 4 to 18 of the election petition to
show as	 to how	 the order  of the  Election Commission	 was
illegal, or  as to  how there  was non-compliance  with	 the
provisions of  the Constitution, or the Act, or any rules or
orders made  under the	Act within the meaning of<a href="/doc/21523700/" id="a_56"> s. 100</a> (1)
</p><p id="p_32">(d) (iv)  of the  Act. He urges that it was incumbent on the
appellant to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">721</span>
find out  the circumstances in which the Election Commission
issued the  necessary  instructions  as	 to  the  change  of
symbols under  paragraph 18  of the  Symbols  Order.  It  is
contended that	the High  Court was  therefore justified  in
striking out  paragraphs 4 to 18 of the election petition on
the ground  that they  do not  disclose any  cause of action
inasmuch as  the averments  therein do not constitute a plea
of non-compliance  with the  provisions of the Constitution,
or the	Act, or any rules or orders made under the Act so as
to  attract  <a href="/doc/21523700/" id="a_57"> s.  100</a>	(1)  (d)  (iv)	of  the	 Act.  These
contentions, in our opinion, cannot be given effect to.
</p><p id="p_33">     The approach  of the  High Court  in dealing  with	 the
preliminary issue  appears  to	be  wholly  unwarranted.  In
dealing with  the question whether or not paragraphs 4 to 18
of the	election petition  disclose any cause of action, the
High  Court   has  cast	 on  the  appellant  the  burden  of
disclosing facts  not within his knowledge. It speaks of his
duty to produce evidence prima facie to show that the change
of allotment  of symbols  by the  Returning Officer  to	 the
respondent was	in contravention of r. 10 (5) of the Conduct
of Elections  Rules read  with paragraph  13 of	 the Symbols
Order. It  then	 observes  that	 the  onus  was	 on  him  to
establish  as  to  how	and  under  what  circumstances	 the
Election Commission  issued the instructions in question. It
accepts	 the  contention  of  the  respondent  that  it	 was
incumbent on the appellant to set himself on an inquiry into
these circumstances. According to the High Court, failure to
disclose the circumstances which led the Election Commission
to issue directions or instructions to the Returning Officer
to effect  a change  in the allotment of symbols, amounts to
non-disclosure	of  material  facts  which  must  entail  in
deletion of the averments in paragraphs 4 to 18 by which the
appellant seeks relief under<a href="/doc/21523700/" id="a_58"> s. 100</a> (1) (d) (iv) of the Act.
We are	afraid, the  High Court has viewed the matter from a
wrong perspective.
</p><p id="p_34">     We	 find  it  difficult  to  comprehend  the  reasoning
adopted by  the High  Court that there was non-disclosure of
material facts.	 True it  is that  it begins the judgment by
observing that	a question of this nature, as it must be so,
has to be decided on a consideration of the averments in the
election petition  alone, and the allegations in the written
statement  cannot  be  taken  into  account.  A	 preliminary
objection that	the election  petition is  not in conformity
with<a href="/doc/123749551/" id="a_59"> s.	 83</a> (1)	 (a) of the Act i.e. it does not contain the
concise	 statement  of	the  material  facts  on  which	 the
petitioner relies is but a plea in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">722</span>
nature of  demurrer and	 in deciding  the question the Court
has to	assume for this purpose that the averments contained
in the	election petition  are	true.  Unfortunately,  while
deciding the  preliminary issue	 the  High  Court  has	made
certain observations which tend to show that the allegations
in the written statement were very much present in its mind.
In repelling  the  contention  of  the	appellant  that	 the
instructions issued  by	 the  Election	Commission  for	 re-
allotment of  symbols were  referable to paragraph 18 of the
Symbols Order, the High Court observes:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_28">	  "Upon the  use of  word "instructions" in Annexure
     P-1, it  was sough	 to be	inferred that  the  issuance
     thereof could  only be  within the	 ambit of para 18 of
     the Symbols  Order, since	the change  of	Symbols	 was
     outside the  ambit of para 18 therefore the said change
     was  illegal.   The  argument  has	 not  impressed	 me,
     inasmuch as in the normal course of things the Election
     Commission,   having    passed   an    order,    issues
     instructions, for	its compliance.	 As such, the use of
     the "instructions"	 in any communication cannot lead to
     an inference  of their being issued under the said para
     18 of the Symbols Order."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_29">     It then goes on to observe:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_30">	  "The petitioner  has not  at all  disclosed in the
     election petition	as to  what was exactly the order of
     the Election  Commission  behind  the  instructions  in
     Annexure P-1  and how  it was  in contravention  of the
     provisions of  the aforesaid  Act or the rules or order
     made thereunder."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_31">     It proceeds to say:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_32">	  "Thus, the argument of the learned counsel for the
     returned candidate	 proceeded that	 before	 filing	 the
     election petition	it was incumbent upon the petitioner
     to find  out the  entire  circumstances  in  which	 the
     Election Commission  passed the  order as to the change
     of symbols	 and consequently  issued instructions	vide
     Annexure P-1 to the Returning Officer."
     In	 coming	 to  the  conclusion  that  there  was	non-
</blockquote><p id="p_35">disclosure of material facts, the High Court observes:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_33">	  "In  the   complete  absence	 of   the   material
     circumstances,  non-compliance   with   the   aforesaid
     provisions could not be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">723</span>
     spelt out	and hence  in the  election petition none of
     the said  provisions has been specifically sought.... .
     I direct that paras 4 to 18 of the election petition be
     deleted."
</blockquote><p id="p_36">These observations  made by  the High  Court  proceed  on  a
misconception of law.
</p><p id="p_37">     It is therefore necessary to consider whether the order
passed by  the High Court could be justified under Order VI,
r. 16  of the  Code. That would depend on whether or not the
election petition  is in conformity with the requirements of
s. 83 of the Act, which reads as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_34">	  "83.	Contents   of	Petition-(1)   An   election
	       petition-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_35">     (a)  shall contain	 a concise statement of the material
	  facts on which the petitioner relies.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_36">     (b)  shall set  forth full	 particulars of	 any corrupt
	  practice that the petitioner alleges, including as
	  full a  statement as	possible of the names of the
	  parties alleged  to have  committed  such  corrupt
	  practice and	the date and place of the commission
	  of each such practice; and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_37">     (c)  shall be  signed by the petitioner and verified in
	  the  manner	laid  down  in	the  Code  of  Civil
	  Procedure, 1908 for the verification of pleadings:
	  Provided that	 where the  petitioner	alleges	 any
	  corrupt  practice,  the  petition  shall  also  be
	  accompanied by an affidavit in the prescribed from
	  in support  of  the  allegation  of  such  corrupt
	  practice and the particulars thereof.
     (2)  Any schedule	of annexure  to the  petition  shall
	  also be  signed by  the petitioner and verified in
	  the same manner as the petition."
</blockquote><p id="p_38">Cl. (a)	 of<a href="/doc/123749551/" id="a_60"> s.	83</a> is  based on	 the provisions of Order VI,
r.2(1) of  the Code which states the basic or cardinal rules
of pleadings and is in the following terms:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">724</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_38">     "2. Pleading  to state material facts and not evidence-
     Every pleading  shall  contain,  and  contain  only,  a
     statement in  a concise  form of  the material facts on
     which the	party  pleading	 relies	 for  his  claim  in
     defence, as  the case  may be,  but not the evidence by
     which they are to be proved."
</blockquote><p id="p_39">Cl. (a)	 of sub-s.  (1) of <a href="/doc/123749551/" id="a_61"> s. 83</a> of the Act enjoins that an
election petition  shall contain  a concise statement of the
material facts	on which  the election petitioner relies. It
is no  part  of	 the  statement	 of  claim  of	an  election
petitioner to  anticipate the  defence and  to state what he
would have  to say  in answer to it. Cl. (b) of sub-s.(1) of
s. 83  interdicts that an election petitioner must set forth
full  particulars  of  any  corrupt  practice  on  which  he
challenges the	election of  the returned candidate under<a href="/doc/25889893/" id="a_62"> s.
123(7)</a> including  as full statement as possible of the names
of the	parties	 alleged  to  have  committed  such  corrupt
practice and  the date	and place  of the commission of each
such practice.	It is more or less based on Order VI, r.4 of
the Code which reads:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_39">     "4. In  all cases in which the party pleading relies on
     any misrepresentation,  fraud, breach  of trust, wilful
     default, or  undue influence, and in all other cases in
     which particulars	may be	necessary beyond such as are
     exemplified in  the forms	aforesaid, particulars (with
     dates and	items if  necessary) shall  be stated in the
     pleading."
</blockquote><p id="p_40">The High  Court has  ample power  while trying	an  election
petition to  direct further and better particulars as to the
nature of  the claim  or defence under Order VI, r. 5 of the
Code which reads:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_40">     "5. A further and better statement of the nature of the
     claim or  defence, or further and better particulars of
     any matter	 stated in  an pleading	 may in all cases be
     ordered, upon such terms, as to costs and otherwise, as
     may be just."
</blockquote><p id="p_41">Under Order  VI, r.5,  particulars will	 be ordered  of	 the
material facts	on which  the party  pleading relies for his
claim or  defence. If a party's pleading is defective he can
also seek  leave  to  alter  and  amend	 his  own  defective
pleading under	Order VI,  r.17. There	is no  express	rule
providing for  the consequence of a party failing to deliver
particulars required  by order	of Court.  but the decisions
are
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">725</span>
to  the	  effect  that	either	by  the	 order	calling	 for
particulars or	by a  later order  the Court  can direct the
claim or  defence to  be struck out under Order VI, r. 16 of
the Code.
</p><p id="p_42">     There  is	distinction  between  "material	 facts"	 and
"particulars" The  word "material facts" show that the facts
necessary to  formulate a  complete cause  of action must be
stated. Omission  of a	single material	 fact  leads  to  an
incomplete cause  of action  and  the  statement  or  plaint
becomes bad.  The distinction  which has  been made  between
"material facts" and "particulars" was brought out by Scott,
L.J. in	 Bruce v.  Odhams Press	 Ltd. (1)  in the  following
passage:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_41">	  "The cardinal	 provision  in	r.  4  is  that	 the
     statement of  claim must  state the material facts. The
     word "material"  means necessary  for  the	 purpose  of
     formulating a  complete cause of action; and if any one
     "material" fact  is omitted,  the statement of claim is
     bad: it  is "demurrable" in the old phraseology, and in
     the new  is liable	 to be "struck out" under O. xxv, r.
     4; See Philips v. Philips (2): or "a further and better
     statement" of claim may be ordered under O.XIX r. 7.
	  The function	of "particulars" under r. 6 is quite
     different. They  are not  to be  used in  order to fill
     material gaps  in a  demurrable statement of claim-gaps
     which  ought   to	have   been  filled  by	 appropriate
     statements of the various material facts which together
     constitute the  plaintiff's cause of action. The use of
     particulars is  intended to  meet a  further and  quite
     separate requirement  of pleading,	 imposed in fairness
     and justice to the defendant. Their function is to fill
     in the  picture of the plaintiff's cause of action with
     information sufficiently  detailed to put the defendant
     on his  guard as  to the  case he	has to	meet and  to
     enable him to prepare for trial."
</blockquote><p id="p_43">The dictum  of Scott,  L.J. in Bruce's case, supra, has been
quoted with  approval by this Court in <a href="/doc/1504198/" id="a_63">Samant N. Balakrishan
v. George  Fernandez &amp;	Ors</a>.(3) and while observing that the
requirements of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">726</span>
s. 83  are mandatory, the distinction between material facts
and particulars was brought out in the following terms:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_42">	  "The	word   "material"  shows   that	 the   facts
     necessary to  formulate a complete cause of action must
     be stated.	 Omission of a single material fact leads to
     an incomplete  cause of  action and  the  statement  of
     claim becomes  bad. The  function of  particulars is to
     present as	 full a	 picture of the cause of action with
     such further  information in  detail  as  to  make	 the
     opposite party  understand the  case he  will  have  to
     meet."
</blockquote><p id="p_44">Thus, the  word "material"  in material facts under<a href="/doc/123749551/" id="a_64"> s. 83</a> of
the Act means facts necessary for the purpose of formulating
a complete  cause of  action; and if any one "material" fact
is omitted,  the statement or plaint is bad; it is liable to
be struck  out.	 The  function	of  "particulars"  is  quite
different, the	use of	particulars is	intended to  meet  a
further and  quite separate  requirement of pleading imposed
in fairness  and justice  to the  returned candidate.  Their
function  is   to  fill	 in  the  picture  of  the  election
petitioner's cause  of action  with information sufficiently
detailed to  put the  returned candidate  on his guard as to
the case  he has  to meet  and to  enable him to prepare for
trial in  a case  where his  election is  challenged on	 the
ground of any corrupt practice.
</p><p id="p_45">     Sub-s. (1) of<a href="/doc/21742521/" id="a_65"> s. 87</a> of the Act enacts that the trial of
an election  petition shall  be, as  nearly as	may  be,  in
accordance with	 the procedure	applicable under the Code of
Civil Procedure,  1908 to the trial of suits, subject to the
provisions of  the Act	and of	any rules  made	 thereunder.
There are  no express  provisions in the Act or in the rules
made thereunder as contemplated under sub-s. (1) of<a href="/doc/21742521/" id="a_66"> s. 87</a> of
the Act	 to deal  with the  situation like  the present. The
provisions of the Code accordingly must apply in such a case
as provided  by sub-s.	(1) of	s. 87 of the Act. That being
so, the	 provisions of	Order VI  which are integral part of
the Code  come into  play except  to the  extent modified by
sub-s. (5) of<a href="/doc/149856068/" id="a_67"> s. 86</a> of the Act.
</p><p id="p_46">     Learned counsel  for the  respondent  however  contends
that the  High Court  had no  power to	direct	further	 and
better particulars  under Order	 VI, r.	 5 of  the Code.  In
support	 of  the  contention,  reliance	 is  placed  on	 the
decision of the Madhya Pradesh High
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">727</span>
Court in  <a href="/doc/363539/" id="a_68">Hari Vishnu Kamath v. The Election Tribunal &amp; Anr</a>.
(1) It	is urged  that the particulars given in the petition
were insufficient  to  formulate  a  cause  of	action	and,
therefore the  High Court  had the  power to  strike out the
pleadings under	 Order VI, r. 16 of the Code. The contention
cannot, in our opinion, be accepted. <a href="/doc/10498/" id="a_69">In Bhikaji Keshao Joshi
&amp; Anr.	v. Brijlal  Nandlal  Joshi  &amp;  Ors</a>,  (2)  the  Court
recognized a  power in the Tribunal to direct particulars of
a corrupt practice and to strike out the pleadings in a case
where there  was a  default in	compliance with	 a  previous
order directing	 particulars. Thereafter, there was a change
brought about  in law by Act 27 of 1956. Sub-s. (5) of<a href="/doc/58321134/" id="a_70"> s. 90</a>
introduced by  that Act	 recast the  old sub-s. (3) of<a href="/doc/123749551/" id="a_71"> s. 83</a>
and took  away the  power of  the Election Tribunal to order
further and  better particulars	 of corrupt  practice  while
retaining the  power to	 allow	amendment  or  amplification
though the language used was slightly different.
</p><p id="p_47">     The decision  of the  Madhya Pradesh High Court in Hari
Vishnu Kamath's case, (supra) on which reliance is placed is
inapplicable. A question arose whether the Election Tribunal
was justified  in directing furnishing of better particulars
of certain  corrupt practices.	There, the  High  Court	 was
dealing with  the Act as it stood after its amendment by Act
27 of  1956. In view of the change in law brought about, the
High Court  held that the rule as laid down by this Court in
Bhikaji	 Keshao	  Joshi's  case,   (supra)  was	  no  longer
applicable. After  the repeal  of sub-s. (3) of<a href="/doc/123749551/" id="a_72"> s. 83</a> of the
Act by	Act 27 of 1956, which introduced in its place sub-s.
(5) of	s. 90,	conferring power  on the  Tribunal to  allow
amendment or  amplification of	particulars, the  High Court
held that the word "allowed" meant allowed on an application
and therefore  there was  no power  left with  the  Tribunal
under sub-s. (5) of<a href="/doc/58321134/" id="a_73"> s. 90</a> to direct the furnishing of better
particulars and	 that there  would equally  be no  power  to
strike	out   the  pleadings   for  default   of  furnishing
particulars, if	 directed. It  was however, held that it was
open to the Tribunal to find that the particulars given in a
petition were insufficient for trial. It is evident that the
decision of  the High Court turned on the provisions of sub-
s. (5)	of<a href="/doc/58321134/" id="a_74"> s.  90</a>, which is identical to sub-s. (5) of<a href="/doc/149856068/" id="a_75"> s. 86</a>
of the	Act, but both these provisions relate to allowing an
amendment of  the election petition subject to such terms as
to costs or otherwise with a view to furnish the particulars
of any corrupt practice. The decision of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">728</span>
Madhya Pradesh	High Court  in Hari  Vishnu  Kamath's  case,
(supra) is therefore distinguishable.
</p><p id="p_48">     It must accordingly be held that the High Court was not
justified in striking out paragraphs 4 to 18 of the election
petition acting presumably under Order VI, r. 16 of the Code
of Civil Procedure, 1908 on the ground that the facts stated
therein were not sufficient to formulate a complete cause of
action under <a href="/doc/152271000/" id="a_76"> s. 100(1)</a> (d)(iv) of the <a href="/doc/320017/" id="a_77">Representation of the

facts.
</p><p id="p_49">     In the  result, the appeal succeeds and is allowed with
costs. The  judgment of	 the High  Court  striking  out	 the
averments in  paragraphs 4 to 18 of the election petition is
set aside  and it  is directed	to proceed  with  the  trial
according to law.
