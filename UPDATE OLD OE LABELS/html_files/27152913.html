<p id="p_2">2.          The plaintiff has filed the suit for permanent injunction

restraining infringement of trade mark, passing off, dilution and

tarnishment of trade mark, unfair competition, rendition of accountts,

damages and delivery up against the defendants, namely, Ms Kamini

Jain, Mr Ashwani Jain and Kamini Creations (Exports).

</p><p id="p_3">3.          The suit as well as the interim application were listed before

the Court on 15.03.2011 and after hearing the learned counsel for the

plaintiff, the summons were issued to the defendants in the suit and ad-

interim injunction was passed against the defendants thereby restraining

the defendants from manufacturing, fabricating, selling, distributing,

storing men clothing by the brand name ZEGNA though with different

spellings JENYA and MENYA. The Local Commissioner was appointed

to make the inventory of the impugned goods.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.          As per the facts mentioned in the plaint, it is contended that

the plaintiff is a company having its principal place of business in Italy.

The plaintiff together with Lanificio Ermenegildo ZEGNA and Figli,

Ermenegildo Zegna Corporation and all other remaining affiliated

companies is a part of the Ermenegildo Zegna Group and are

manufacturing luxury clothing for men. It is stated that on account of the

business activity, the plaintiff along with the other ZEGNA Group of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CS(OS) No.629/2011                                            Page No.2 of 19</span>
 companies obtained registration in the trade name ZEGNA in 150

countries all over the world. The details of the registration by the plaintiff

group are given in para 11 of the plaint.
</p>
<p id="p_5">5.            The trade mark ZEGNA is derived from the name of

Ermenegildo Zegna, the founder of the said Group Company. It is

pronounced as ZEN-YAH in Italian language throughout the world

including India.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.            The details of the Sales Turnover under the plaintiff‟s trade

mark ZEGNA are as follows:
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">     YEAR          WORLDWIDE SALES                  SALES IN INDIA
                           (in Euros)                    (in Euros)
     2005      571 million                         0.5 million
     2006      642 million                         0.2 million
     2007      703 million                         0.9 million
     2008      724 million                         2 million
     2009      690 million                         3 million


</pre><p id="p_7">7.            It is alleged that the aforesaid figures of turnover/sales have

shown ascendency of 690 million Euros and the sales 3 million Euros in

the year 2009, which clearly shows that its overall turnover has been

increasing.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.            It is averred that over a period of time, the plaintiff has

acquired certain reputation of manufacturing, selling and exporting the

branded readymade garments under the trade name ZEGNA which is also




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CS(OS) No.629/2011                                               Page No.3 of 19</span>
 registered in India. The learned counsel has drawn the attention of the

Court to the certificates of registration granted by Indian authorities.

</p><p id="p_9">9.          The case of the plaintiff pleaded against the defendants is that

some time in September, 2010, the plaintiff came to know that the

defendant No. 3 is manufacturing, selling, exporting readymade garments

such as shirts and trousers under the brand name JENYA and MENYA

which is the proprietorship concern of defendant No.2 and the defendant

No.1 is stated to be running the business in question on behalf of the

defendant No.3. The main thrust of the plaintiff‟s arguments against the

defendants is that they are selling men clothing like shirt, kurta etc. under

the deceptively similar trade mark of the plaintiff and are giving an

impression to the public at large that these are the goods manufactured by

the plaintiff which in fact is untrue. The said act of the defendants

amounts to infringement of the plaintiff‟s statutory rights and the

defendants are violating the same with impunity and are causing harm to

the goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff without any justification.

</p><p id="p_10">10.         The defendants‟ defence is that there is no visual, phonetic

and structural similarity whatsoever.       Two names, i.e., ZEGNA and

JENYA are completely different. There cannot be any confusion and

deception per se in view thereof.       It is contended that if a customer

already knows that ZEGNA is not pronounced as „ZEGNA‟ but as

„ZEN-YAH‟ in the fancy Italian pronunciation, then that customer would

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CS(OS) No.629/2011                                               Page No.4 of 19</span>
 never be confused or even be likely to confuse it with Jenya.              It is

submitted that the essence of purchase of high-end branded goods is their

label and look and in this case the emphasis is on the mark ZEGNA, with

the special emphasis on the first letter „Z‟. Thus, the customers who buy

ZEGNA would never purchase in reality any label which starts with the

letter J and confuse it with ZEGNA.
</p>
<p id="p_11">            It is stated that the customers who purchase the high-end

Italian brand ZEGNA are the "elite upper strata and educated" class who

would clearly see the obvious difference in the two marks. If there is

such a clear difference in the customers, there can be no confusion.

</p><p id="p_12">11.         Mr Darpan Wadhwa, learned counsel appearing on behalf of

the defendants, has argued that there are various decisions which have

clearly laid down the test and deal with the issue of lack of phonetic and

visual similarity and wherein it is held that the first syllable of a word

mark is generally the most important, especially in cases of short marks

and there is a general tendency to slur the termination of words. As in

the present case, the first syllable is different in look and sound, there is

no question of slurring the termination of words.

</p><p id="p_13">12.         From the pleading and documents adduced by the plaintiff, it

is the admitted position that the plaintiff is the registered proprietor of the

mark ZEGNA in classes 24 and 25 under registration Nos. 277992 and

643530.       The plaintiff has also obtained the registrations for

</pre><p id="p_14">13.         Mr Pravin Anand, the learned counsel for the plaintiff,

submits that the plaintiff has produced the evidence on record to show

that the plaintiff‟s well known trade mark ZEGNA is pronounced as

ZEN-YAH throughout the world, including in India. Therefore, the use

of the trade mark JENYA by the defendants would create confusion and

deception and the case of infringement of the trade mark is made out by

the plaintiff. In addition to the mark       जेनिया      in Hindi which is


deceptively similar with the mark JENYA used by the defendants, two

competing marks "ZEGNA" and "JENYA‟ are even otherwise, visually

and phonetically identical as it is quite common for the letter Z to be

pronounced as J and vice-versa. Further, he says that as far as mark

MENYA is concerned, the plaintiff has no objection if the defendants are

permitted to use the same in a different style.
</p>
<p id="p_15">14.         In view of the facts mentioned above, the question before this

court is whether the mark JENYA used by defendants in relation to the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">CS(OS) No.629/2011                                             Page No.7 of 19</span>
 same goods amounts to infringement of plaintiffs‟ registered trade marks

and/or any case of passing off is made out by the plaintiff. The two sets

of the marks used and claimed by the parties have to be compared in

view of     the pleadings   and documents are placed on record.          The

following points are to be considered:
</p>
<pre id="pre_4">       a)     whether the two marks ZEGNA                and JENYA are
              deceptively similar;

       b)     whether the mark ZEGNA is pronounced as ZEN-YAH in
</pre><p id="p_16">              the trade as claimed by the plaintiff and if the answer is
              positive then is it similar with the defendants‟ mark
              JENYA; and lastly
</p><p id="p_17">       c)     whether the plaintiff‟s mark जेनिया registered in Hindi is
              protectable in the absence of user of the mark in India.

</p><p id="p_18">15.         The concept of aural confusion is statutorily embodied in

Section 29 (9) of the Trademarks Act, 1999 in so far as it states that

"Where the distinctive elements of a registered trademark consist of or

include words, the trade mark may be infringed by spoken use of the

words as well as their visual representation and the reference in this

section to the use of the mark shall be construed accordingly." In view of

the fact that the Legislature has included the spoken use of the words as

an infringing activity, it is clearly evident that the pronunciation of the

trade mark is clearly a determining criteria in ascertaining infringement.

</p><p id="p_19">16.         Section 29(2) of the Trademarks Act, 1999 recognizes the

concept of likelihood of association, wherein the consumer is likely to


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">CS(OS) No.629/2011                                              Page No.8 of 19</span>
 believe that the Defendants‟ mark has an association/affiliation/

connection with the Plaintiff or that the Defendants have the approval of

the plaintiff to use the said trade mark.
</p>
<p id="p_20">17.         The plaintiff has produced certain documents which includes

internet downloads in order to show that the plaintiff‟s trade mark is

pronounced as ZEN-YAH.
</p>
<p id="p_21">            A CD containing sound clips downloaded from the internet is

also filed and placed in court which is prima facie evidencing that the

plaintiff‟s trade mark is pronounced as ZEN-YAH. The affidavit of the

investigator who visited the plaintiff‟s store at DLF Emporio Mall in

Vasant Kunj, New Delhi and conducted the investigation has been filed

alongwith annexures. It is stated in the affidavit that during the course of

the investigation, the staff at the said store consistently pronounced the

said trade mark as ZEN - YAH.
</p>
<p id="p_22">18.         The Division Bench of the Bombay High Court in the case of

Encore Electronics Ltd. v Anchor Electronics and Electricals Pvt. Ltd.

2007 (35) PTC 714 has dealt with a similar point about the phonetically

similarity between two trade marks "Encore" and "Anchor". The same

reads as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">       "The phonetic similarity between "Anchor" on the one
       hand and "Encore" on the other, is striking. The two marks
       are phonetically, visually and Page 0646 structurally
       similar. The overall impression conveyed by a mark as a
       whole, has to be assessed in evaluating whether the mark of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">CS(OS) No.629/2011                                             Page No.9 of 19</span>
        the defendant is deceptively similar to the mark of the
       plaintiff. Phonetic similarity constitutes an important index
       of whether a mark bears a deceptive or misleading
       similarity to another. The phonetic structure indicates how
       the rival marks ring in the ears. Courts in a country such as
       ours whose culture is enriched by a diversity of languages
       and scripts have to consider how the rival marks are spelt
       and pronounced in languages in which they are commonly
       used. Counsel for the Defendant submits before the Court
       that whiel "Encore" is a word of Frensh origin, „Anchor‟ is
       a word of English usage and the pronounciation of the two
       words must differ. The submission misses the point. The
       case before the Court is not about how an Englishman
       would pronounce „Anchor‟ or a Frenchman would
       pronounce "Encore". The Court must consider the usage of
       words in India, the manner in which a word would be
       written in Indian languages and last but not least, the
       similarity of pronunciation if the rival marks are used. The
       manner in which the „a‟, as in „anchor‟ is pronounced by an
       Englishman or Notting Hill may well appear to be
       discerning traveller to be distinct from a Frenchman‟s
       pronunciation of the „e‟ in „encore‟ on a fashionable by
       lane near Champs Elysees. That is no defence to an action
       in our Courts for passing off. For the ordinary consumer in
       Ahmedabad and her counterpart in Mumbai‟s shopping
       streets, the „a‟ in „anchor‟ and the „e‟ in „encore‟ are
       perilously and deceptively similar. The Court must assess
       the make up of an Indian consumer and, associated with
       that, the cultural traits that underlie the spelling and
       pronunciation of words. The case of the Plaintiff is that in
       Gujarti as well as in Hindi, there is no even a subtle
       distinction between the manner in which „Anchor‟ and
       "Encore" would be pronounced and we find merit in the
       submission. The overall impact in terms of phonetical usage
       is one of striking similarity. The test is not whether a
       customer who wishes to buy the product of the plaintiff is
       likely to end up buying the product of the Defendant. The
       test is whether the ordinary customer is likely to be led to
       believe that „Encore‟ is associated with the mark and the
       trading style of the plaintiff. The phonetical, visual and
       structural get up of the two words is so strikingly similar as
       to lead to a likelihood of deception. The question of
       deception is a matter for the Court to determine,
       particularly at the interlocutory stage. (para 9).

<p id="p_24">20.         In the case of Laxmikant V.Patel vs Chetanbhat Shah &amp;

              associated therewith. It does not matter whether the
              latter person does so fraudulently or otherwise. The
              reasons are two. Firstly, honesty and fair play are, and
              ought to be, the basic policies in the world of
              business. Secondly, when a person adopts or intends
              to adopt a name in connection with his business or
              services which already belongs to someone else it
              results in confusion and has propensity of diverting the
              customers and clients of someone else to himself and
              thereby resulting in injury."

 the trade mark "Trevical" is similar to "Fevicol". Further in the case of

The Bombay Oil Industries v Ballrapur Industries Ltd.; AIR 1989 Del

77 decided by this Court, it was held that the two trade marks "Shapola"

and "Saffola" are similar. In the case of Bulova Accutron Trade Mark

Application; [1969] RPC 102, the trade mark „Bulova Accutron was

held to be similar to „Accurist‟. Similarly, in Amritdhara Pharmacy v.

Satya Deo Gupta, AIR 1963 SC 449, the Apex Court held that the trade

mark „Amritdhara‟ is similar to „Lakshmandhara‟. In yet another case of

Tata Iron &amp; Steel Co. Ltd. v Mahavir Steels &amp; others; 47(1992) DLT

412 this court came to the conclusion that the trade mark „Tisco‟ and

„Fisco‟ are deceptively similar and issued the interim injunction against

the defendant. Similar view was taken by the Division Bench of this

court in the case of Castrol Ltd. and Another Vs. A.K. Mehta and Anr.

reported in 2003(27)PTC600(Del) wherein two marks CASTROL and

BESTROL were held to be similar. In the case of Oil Mill Co. vs. Wipro

              resemblance between the two marks, but ocular
              comparison is not always the decisive test.          The
              resemblance between the two marks must be
              considered with reference to the ear as well as the
              eye. There is a close affinity of sound between Ambal
              and Andal.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">              12. The name Andal does not cease to be deceptively
              similar because it is used in conjunction with a
              pictorial device. The case of Decordova v. Vick
              Chemical Coy., 1951-68 RPC 103 is instructive.
              From the Appendix printed at page 270 of the same
              volume it appears that Vick Chemical Coy. were the
              proprietors of the registered trade mark consisting of
              the work "Vaporub" and another registered trade
              mark consisting of a design of which the words
              "Vicks Vaporub Salve" formed a part. The appendix
              at page 226 shows that the defendants advertised their
              ointment as "Karsote vapour Rub". It was held that
              the defendants had infringed the registered marks.
              Lord Radcliffe said: "...... a mark is infringed by
              another trader if, even without using the whole of it
              upon or in connection with his goods, he uses one or
              more of its essential features."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_27">23.         Learned counsel for the plaintiff has also argued on the

question of dilution. He argued that the defendant‟s use of the impugned

marks in the course of the same trade and for the same products is bound

to cause serious prejudice to the ability of the trade mark ZEGNA to

exclusively identify the plaintiff and its group companies and their

products leading to grave dilution of the trade mark ZEGNA.

Additionally, the Defendant‟s use of the impugned marks is bound to lead

 to tarnishment, diminution, weakening and eventual erosion of the

goodwill, reputation and the positive associations linked to the plaintiff‟s

trade mark ZEGNA.

<p id="p_28">24.         In the most recent case referred as T.V. Venugopal v

Ushodaya Enterprises Ltd. and Anr.; (2011) 4 SCC 85 it has been held

by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court that permitting the appellant to carry on

his business in the name of "Eenadu" in the State of Andhra Pradash

would lead to eroding extraordinary reputation and goodwill acquired by

the respondent company over a passage of time. It is further submitted by

him that that the sophistication of the consumer cannot be a determining

factor in ascertaining the likelihood of confusion, especially since a

consumer who is sophisticated with respect to one particular field may

not necessarily be sophisticated with respect to all fields.

</p><p id="p_29">25.         The other aspect of the matter is that the plaintiff is also

holding the registration of mark जेनिया in Hindi. The plaintiff also


sought protection on that registration. Learned counsel for the defendants

however argued that the said mark is registered in favour of the plaintiff

but the same has not been used as of today and is liable to be rectified

under Section 47 of the Trademarks and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_3">Merchandise Marks Act</a>. Let

me now deal with the said aspect of the matter.

 defendants have not challenged the registration of the mark जेनिया (in


Hind). Therefore, the registration granted in favour of the plaintiff at this

stage is a valid registration.

<p id="p_31">27.         The legal effect of Registration

            Registration of a mark gives the registered proprietor the

exclusive right to use the registered mark (Section 28 of the Trademark

Act, 1999) and the use of an "identical" or "deceptively similar" mark by

another without any permission/authority amounts to infringement of the

registered mark (<a href="/doc/1373361/" id="a_4">Section 29</a> of the Act).

to the facts of the present case as in the said para it was clearly stated

<blockquote id="blockquote_21">              "The mark applied for by the respondent No.1
