HEADNOTE:



JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
VENKATACHALA,  J.-  These are the appeals in  which  special
leave  is  granted under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_1">Article 136</a>  of  the  Constitution.
They are directed against the common judgment dated 3-8-1993
of  a Division Bench of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh  by
which  Writ Appeal Nos. 1389 of 1991 and 608 of	 1993  filed
against	 the  orders  dated 10-3-1989  and  30-3-1989  of  a
learned Single Judge of the same court in Writ Petition Nos.
13439  of  1986 and 7689 of 1989  respectively	refusing  to
quash  acquisition  of certain land acquired  for  a  public
purpose under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_2">Land Acquisition Act</a>, 1894 (the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_3">L.A. Act</a>),
are dismissed.
</p><p id="p_2">2. That on 23-4-1976 Bhainsa Regulated Market Samiti made  a
request	 to the State Government to acquire a compact  block
of  6  acres and 29 guntas of land in  Survey  Nos.  342/1A,
342/IB	and 343 of Bhainsa Village needed for  extension  of
its existing Cotton Market Yard.  That on 6-7-1977 the State
Government which regarded the said request to acquire  land,
to be a case involving urgency, invoked its power under sub-
section (4) of <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_4">Section 17</a> of the L.A. Act and made an  order
directing that the provisions of <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_5">Section 5-A</a> of the L.A. Act
shall  not  apply.   Further,  that  on	 21-7-1977,  it	 got
published in the State Gazette a notification under  <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_6">Section
4(1)</a>  of the L.A. Act and a declaration under  <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_7">Section	6(1)</a>
thereof, in respect of the said land, as was required  under
sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_8">Section 17</a> of the L.A. Act.	 Thereafter,
the   District	Collector  who	got  published	the   notice
mentioned in <a href="/doc/1015358/" id="a_9">Section 9(1)</a> of the L.A. Act took possession of
the said acquired land on 10-7-1978 as	provided for in sub-
section	 (1) of <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_10">Section 17</a> of the L.A. Act.  Such taking  of
possession  made the said land vest absolutely in the  State
Government free from all encumbrances as provided for in the
said sub-section itself.  Thereupon, the District  Collector
gave  possession  of the said acquired land to	the  Bhainsa
Regulated Market Samiti for whom it had been acquired.	When
the said 6 acres and 29 guntas of land, had been so acquired
and  its possession was taken by the Collector resulting  in
its  vesting  in the State, the appellants  in	the  present
appeals	 filed WP Nos. 8433 of 1978 and 3416 of 1978 in	 the
High  Court  of Andhra Pradesh and sought  the	quashing  of
<a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_11">Section	 4(1)</a> notification and 6(1) declaration	 insofar  as
they  related  to 1 acre 29 guntas of land claimed  to	have
been purchased by them in April 1977.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">489</span>
<p id="p_3">WP No. 3416 of 1978 was disposed of by the High Court by   a
judgment dated 23-8-1982 which read thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	      "In this writ  petition the acquisition of Ac.
	      1-29  guntas  in	S.  No.	 342/IA	 of  Bhainsa
	      Village is challenged by the writ petitioners.
	      This  land  is sought to be acquired  for	 the
	      purpose  of  extention of	 agriculture  market
	      yard of that place.  The gazette	notification
	      was  made	 under	<a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_12">Section	 4(1)</a>  of  the	Land
	      Acquisition  Act on 21-1-1977 and in  view  of
	      the  alleged urgency, <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_13">Section 5-A</a> enquiry	 has
	      been   dispensed	with.	That  is   to	say,
	      possession has been taken nearly a year  after
	      <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_14">Section 4(1)</a> notification was published.	This
	      circumstances is alone sufficient to show that
	      the  invoking  of	 the  emergency	 clauses  to
	      dispense	with  <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_15">Section 5-A</a>  enquiry  is	done
	      mechanically.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	      In  these	 circumstances, the  order  made  on
	      21-7-1977 dispensing with <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_16">Section 5-A</a>  enquiry
	      is set aside and there will be a direction  to
	      the   Revenue   Divisional  Officer,   Nirmal,
	      Respondent 3 to give notice to the petitioners
	      and   hold   <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_17">Section  5-A</a>	 enquiry   and	 the
	      proceedings will commence from that point.
	      The  writ	 petition is  allowed  as  indicated
	      above,   but  in	the  circumstances   without
	      costs."
</blockquote><p id="p_4">Again Writ Petition No. 8433 of 1978 was disposed of on	 the
same date by the High Court by a judgment which reads thus:
"No orders are necessary."
</p><p id="p_5">3.  An enquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_18">Section 5-A</a> of the L.A. Act appears  to
have  been  held pursuant to the said judgment of  the	High
Court in Writ Petition No. 3416 of 1978 and a decision taken
by  the State Government, on the basis of the report of	 the
enquiry	 to  the  effect that the land	concerned  shall  be
acquired. Thereafter, on 29-11-1984, a declaration has	come
to be made under <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_19">Section 6(1)</a> of the L.A. Act in respect  of
the  said 1 acre 29 guntas of land and the  notification  of
declaration  is got published on the same date in the  State
Gazette.
</p><p id="p_6">4.  One	 of  the appellants who had,  as  other	 appellants,
purchased  a building plot out of the said  land  respecting
which the declaration dated 29-11-1984 was made, filed	Writ
Petition No. 13439 of 1986 in the High Court challenging the
validity  of the said declaration made on the basis  of	 the
opinion	 of  the  Government,  formed  on  consideration  of
<a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_20">Section	  5-A</a>  enquiry	report.	  That	writ  petition	 was
dismissed by a learned Single Judge of the High Court on 10-
3-1989.	  Despite the dismissal of that writ  petition,	 all
other  appellants  appear  to have  joined  and	 filed	Writ
Petition  No.  7689  of 1989 on the very  grounds  on  which
dismissed  writ	 petition  had been filed.   But  that	writ
petition  also has come to be dismissed subsequently.	Both
the writ petitions had been dismissed by the learned  Single
Judge  concerned finding that the grounds raised in  support
of  those petitions lacked in merit.  Since  the  appellants
who  were  the petitioners in the said	writ  petitions	 had
filed Writ Appeal Nos. 1389 of 1991 and 608 of 1993  against
the orders dated 10-3-1989 and 30-3-1989 by which their writ
petitions were dismissed,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">490</span>
a Division Bench of the High Court heard those appeals on 3-
8-1993.	  At the hearing of the appeals, a fresh  ground  is
said  to  have been raised in support of the  appeals.	 The
fresh  ground  was  that <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_21">Section 6(1)</a>  declaration  made  on
29-11-1984 and under challenge, had not been made within the
period allowed by the first proviso to <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_22">Section 6(1)</a> thereof,
inserted  into	the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_23">L.A. Act</a> by the  <a href="/doc/41392/" id="a_24">L.A.  (Amendment)	Act</a>,
1984,  and  hence was liable to be  quashed.   However,	 the
Division Bench of the High Court, by its judgment  delivered
on  the	 same day, dismissed the appeals,  rejecting,  inter
alia,  the fresh ground urged in support of the	 appeals  at
the hearing thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	      "The  learned counsel for the appellants	also
	      submits  that in any view of the	matter,	 the
	      declaration  under  <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_25">Section  6</a>  published	  on
	      24-11-1984  is beyond three years.   In  fact,
	      this  plea  has  not been taken  in  the	writ
	      petitions.   As  already	stated,	 when	Writ
	      Petition	No. 3416 of 1978 was filed, stay  of
	      further proceedings was granted.	Finally, the
	      writ  petition was allowed on 23-8-1982.	 The
	      respondents must know about the said order and
	      after receipt of a copy of the judgments	they
	      have conducted enquiry and also published	 the
	      draft declaration.  Under these circumstances,
	      it  cannot  be said that the  declaration	 was
	      published beyond the time allowed under law."
</blockquote><p id="p_7">5.  The	 appellants in the said writ appeals,  who  are	 the
appellants  in	the present appeals by	special	 leave	have
questioned  the correctness of the judgment of the  Division
Bench  of  the	High Court made in  the	 writ  appeals.	 The
grievance  of  the  appellants in the  present	appeals,  as
ventilated  before us by their learned counsel, is  confined
to  non-acceptance by the Division Bench of the High  Court,
the  fresh ground argued before it against declaration	made
on 24-11-1984 under <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_26">Section 6(1)</a> of the L.A. Act as that was
made  beyond  the time allowed under the  first	 proviso  to
<a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_27">Section 6(1)</a>inserted  by the <a href="/doc/41392/" id="a_28">L.A. (Amendment) Act</a>,  1984.
The  ground urged in support of the present appeals  by	 the
learned	 counsel for the appellants, to be precise, is	that
when  <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_29">Section 6(1)</a> declaration impugned by them was made  on
24-11-1984  while notification under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_30">Section 4(1)</a>  concerned
was  published on 21-7-1977, the declaration had  been	made
beyond the period envisaged in the proviso and hence it	 was
void  and liable to be quashed. We may say, it	 once,	that
the ground so urged in support of the present appeals  would
merit  acceptance,  if the judgment dated 23-8-1982  of	 the
High Court in Writ Petition No. 3416 of 1978 had the  effect
of  restoring ownership of 1 acre 29 guntas of land  to	 the
appellants and reviving <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_31">Section 4(1)</a> notification which	 had
been published on 21-7-1977 in respect of that land also, as
is  assumed  on behalf of the appellants, for  the  reasons,
which we shall presently, state.
</p><p id="p_8">6.  <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_32">Section  6(1)</a>  of the L.A. Act  and	 the  first  proviso
inserted  under	 the  <a href="/doc/41392/" id="a_33">L.A. (Amendment) Act</a>,  1984  on  which
reliance is placed in support of the ground urged by learned
counsel	 for  the  appellants in support  of  their  appeals
reads:

	      stayed  by  an  order  of	 a  court  shall  be
	      excluded."
</blockquote><p id="p_10">7.  As	becomes clear from a reading of	 the  said  proviso,
there  is  a prohibition imposed in the matter of  making  a
declaration under <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_41">Section 6(1)</a> in respect of any  particular
land  governed	by  the notification under  <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_42">Section  4</a>	sub-
section	 (1),  beyond the respective  periods  mentioned  in
clauses (i) and (ii) thereof. However, from the	 Explanation
1  to the said proviso it becomes clear that either  of	 the
periods	 referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) of the  proviso
could  be computed by excluding the period during which	 any
action or proceeding  to  be  taken  in	 pursuance  of	 the
notification issued under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_43">Section  4</a>  sub-section  (1)	 was
stayed by an order of court.
</p><p id="p_11">8.  When we come to the facts of the present case which	 had
given  rise to Writ Petition Nos. 3416 of 1978 and  8433  of
1978  in  the High Court there was no order  made  by  court
which stayed the taking of any action or proceeding pursuant
to <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_44">Section 4(1)</a> notification concerned, in that <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_45">Section 6(1)</a>
declaration  of the land concerned was made,  possession  of
such land was  taken  under <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_46">Section 17(1)</a> resulting  in	 the
vesting of the land in the Government and possession of that
land  in turn had been handed over to the Bhainsa  Regulated
Market	Samiti	for whom the same had  been  acquired,	even
prior to the filing of the writ petitions. Insofar as clause
</p><p id="p_12">(ii)  of the proviso is concerned, that cannot	apply  since
the notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_47">Section 4</a>   sub-section (1) concerned
published  on 21-7-1977 could not be regarded as  that	made
after coming into force of the <a href="/doc/41392/" id="a_48">Land Acquisition	 (Amendment)
Act</a>, 1984.  Then, as is assumed on behalf of the  appellants
in the present appeals,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">492</span>
<a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_49">Section 6(1)</a> declaration made on 21-7-1977 in respect of the
appellants'  land, taking the possession of that land  under
<a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_50">Section	 17(1)</a> and its vesting in the State  Government	 and
the  handing over of possession of that land to the  Bhainsa
Agricultural Market Committee, all of which had taken  place
before the filing of WP Nos. 3416 of 1978 and 8433 of  1978,
are regarded as set aside by the judgment of the High  Court
dated  23-8-1982 in WP No. 3416 of 1978 and <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_51">Section  4</a>	sub-
section	 (1)  notification  published on  21-7-1977  of	 the
appellants' land is regarded as having been revived by	that
judgment, the ground urged on behalf of the appellants	that
<a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_52">Section 6(1)</a> declaration dated 24-11-1984 made in respect of
the appellants' land was prohibited under clause (1) of	 the
proviso, is well founded and merits acceptance. It would  be
so for the reason that making of a declaration under <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_53">Section
6(1)</a>  in  respect  of  any  particular	land  covered  by  a
notification   published  under	 <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_54">Section  4(1)</a>	 after	 the
commencement   of  the	Land  Acquisition   (Amendment	 and
Validation)  Ordinance,	 1967  (1 of 1967)  but	 before	 the
commencement ofthe  <a href="/doc/41392/" id="a_55">Land Acquisition  (Amendment)  Act</a>,
1984 after the expiry of 3 years is clearly prohibited under
clause (i) of the first proviso to <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_56">Section 6(1)</a> of the	L.A.
Act  and the impugned declaration dated 24-11-1984 has	been
in fact made long after the expiry of 3 years' time referred
to in clause (1) of the first proviso, after the publication
of <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_57">Section 4</a> sub-section (1) notification on 21-7-1977.
</p><p id="p_13">9.  But, when <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_58">Section 5-A</a> enquiry is made and  <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_59">Section	6(1)</a>
declaration  is	 made,	only  on  the  assumption  that	 the
judgment dated 23-8-1982 of the High Court in WP No. 3416 of
1978 had set aside the earlier <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_60">Section 6(1)</a> declaration made
in  respect of the same land and restored the  ownership  of
the  said  land	 which had vested absolutely  in  the  State
Government  under  <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_61">Section  17(1)</a>, to  the  appellants,	 and
revived <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_62">Section 4(1)</a> notification  published on 21-7-1977,
while  in  fact	 the said judgment had not  done  so,  there
arises	no need to void the impugned declaration  which	 had
not  brought about any legal consequence. The reasons as  to
how and why <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_63">Section 6(1)</a> declaration and the steps taken for
taking	possession of the land under <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_64">Section 17(1)</a>  and	 its
vesting	 in the State and giving possession of the  land  to
the Samiti for which it was acquired stood unaffected by the
judgment dated 3-8-1982 in WP No. 3416 of 1978 are not	far
to seek. <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_65">Section 17(1)</a> of the L.A. Act contains a  provision
which  confers on the appropriate Government,special  powers
in  relation to the acquisition of land in case of  urgency.
Further,   sub-section	(4)  of	 <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_66">Section  17</a>  empowers	 the
appropriate  Government	 to direct that	 the  provisions  of
<a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_67">Section	 5-A</a>  shall not apply. This sub-section	 says	when
such  direction is given,, a declaration may be	 made  under
<a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_68">Section 6</a> in respect of the land concerned at any time after
the date of publication of the notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_69">Section  4</a>
sub-section  (1). However, when <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_70">Section 5-A</a> is made  not  to
apply to acquisition of a land, the appropriate	  Government
can  publish a notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_71">Section 4</a> sub-section	 (1)
if  not already published and then make a declaration  under
<a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_72">Section 6(1)</a>. When once <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_73">Section 6(1)</a> declaration is made, by
operation of sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_74">Section 6</a>, such	 declaration
becomes conclusive evidence
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">493</span>
that  the  land	 is  needed for a public  purpose  or  of  a
company,  as  the  case	 may  be,  and	after  making	such
declaration  appropriate Government may acquire the land  in
the  manner  appearing in the subsequent provisions  of	 the
<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_75">L.A.  Act</a>.  Insofar as the land to be acquired	pursuant  to
the  direction	of  the appropriate  Government	 under	sub-
section	  (4)  of  <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_76">Section  17</a>	which  makes   <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_77">Section	 5-A</a>
inapplicable,  sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_78">Section 17</a> is required  to
be  followed  for  the purpose of acquisition  of  the	land
concerned.  That provision reads thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">	      "17.  (1)	 In cases of urgency,  whenever	 the

	      notice  mentioned	 in <a href="/doc/1990166/" id="a_79">Section  9</a>,	 sub-section
	      (1),  take possession of any land	 needed	 for
	      public  purpose.	 Such land  shall  thereupon
	      vest  absolutely in the Government, free	from
	      all encumbrances."
</blockquote><p id="p_14">10. The said provision enables the appropriate Government to
take	  possession of the land concerned on the expiration
of  15 days from the publication of the notice mentioned  in
<a href="/doc/1990166/" id="a_80">Section	 9</a> sub-section (1) notwithstanding the fact that  no
award has been made in respect of it. When the possession of
the land concerned is once taken as provided for  thereunder
such land is made to vest absolutely in the Government	free
from  all  encumbrances. It must be noted here	that  taking
possession of the land concerned and its vesting  absolutely
in the Government free from all encumbrances does not depend
upon  an award to be made under <a href="/doc/291273/" id="a_81">Section 11</a>, making of  which
award alone in the case of ordinary acquisition of land could
have empowered the Collector to take possession of the	land
under  <a href="/doc/562722/" id="a_82">Section 16</a> and the taking of which  possession  would
have made the land  vest  absolutely in the Government	free
from all encumbrances. As seen from the judgment dated 23-8-
1982  of  the  High Court in WP No.  3416  of  1978,  taking
possession of the appellants' land along with land of others
by  the	 Collector on 10-7-1978 under <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_83">Section 17(1)</a>  is,  in
fact,  made  the  basis for its	 holding  that	invoking  of
urgency clause to dispense with <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_84">Section 5-A</a> enquiry was made
by the Government mechanically. No doubt, when the     High
Court  took the view that acquisition of the land  concerned
under <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_85">Section 17</a> of the Act was made pursuant to an order of
the Government without application of its mind in the matter
of making <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_86">Section 5-A</a> not to apply, it was open to it to set
aside  or  quash  the  subsequent   acquisition	 proceedings
except	<a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_87">Section	 4(1)</a> notification which  had  followed	 and
restore the ownership of the land to the appellants' land if
it had to order fresh  enquiry on the basis of <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_88">Section	4(1)</a>
notification. Such a setting aside or	quashing	 was
inevitable  because  the acquisition  proceedings  had	been
completed  under <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_89">Section 17</a> and the land had vested  in	 the
State  Government, inasmuch as, without setting	 aside	that
vesting	 of the land in the State Government  and  restoring
the land to the appellant-owners,  hat land was	 unavailable
for  subsequent	 acquisition  by  following  the   procedure
under  <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_90">Section	5-A</a>, <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_91">Section 6</a>, <a href="/doc/291273/" id="a_92">Section 11</a> and	<a href="/doc/562722/" id="a_93">Section	 16</a>.
Thus in the circumstances of the case in respect of the land
of the appellants, when
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">494</span>
publication  of <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_94">Section 4(1)</a> notification was made on  21-7-
1977,  when  declaration under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_95">Section 6</a>  was  published  on
21-7-1977  and taking possession of that land under  <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_96">Section
17(1)</a> by the Collector was made on 10-7-1978 and the vesting
in  the State Government of that land had occurred  on	that
day,  setting aside by the judgment of the High Court in  WP
No.  3416  of  1978 of merely the  direction  given  by	 the
Government  relating to nonapplicability of <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_97">Section  5-A</a>  to
the land, given on 7-7-1977, in our view, did not enable  to
Court  to  order  the  starting	 of  fresh  proceedings	 for
acquisition  of	 the  land  concerned  under  <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_98">Section	5-A</a>,
inasmuch   as,	 that  land  concerned	 on   <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_99">Section	4(1)</a>
notification had already become the land of the	 Government.
In this state of facts, when the previous acquisition of the
land of the appellants made under <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_100">Section 17</a> of the Act	 did
never	stood  affected.   <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_101">Section  5-A</a>	 enquiry  held	 and
subsequent  declaration	 made were  superfluous	 proceedings
which were inconsequential.  Hence, we feel that there is no
need  to set aside the impugned declaration inasmuch as	 the
earlier	 acquisition  was   complete  and  had	resulted  in
vesting of the land in the State Government and there was no
land available for acquisition in the subsequent proceedings
which have been carried pursuant to the judgment of the High
Court made in WP No. 3416 of 1978.  Therefore, in the stated
facts,	although we find that no need arises to declare	 the
impugned  declaration  as void we clarify that	the  earlier
proceedings  which  had	 taken	place  in  respect  of	 the
appellants'  land,   resulting in its vesting in  the  State
Government free from encumbrances, has stood unaffected	 and
any award made by the Collector or be made by him under	 the
<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_102">L.A.  Act</a>  shall  be  regarded	as  that  based	 on  earlier
acquisition proceedings.
</p><p id="p_15">11.  We	 may, however, state that  though we  have  examined
the  fresh  ground of challenge in respect of  <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_103">Section	6(1)</a>
declaration raised on behalf of the appellants nearly  seven
years  after it had become available to them, the  same	 had
been done solely to decide on the scope and applicability of
the  first  proviso  to <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_104">Section 6(1)</a>  and  its	explanation,
inserted  into	the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_105">L.A. Act</a> by the  <a href="/doc/41392/" id="a_106">L.A.  (Amendment)	Act</a>,
1984.  Such examination cannot, therefore, be understood  as
laying down that notwithstanding the lapse of time or laches
in raising a legal ground in a proceeding under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_107">Article	 226</a>
of the Constitution or a proceeding under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_108">Article 136</a> of the
Constitution there is an obligation on the part of the court
concerned to examine such fresh ground. In fact, in relation
to acquisition proceeding involving acquisition of land	 for
public	purposes,  the	court concerned must  be  averse  to
entertain  writ	 petitions involving the challenge  to	such
acquisition  where there is avoidable delay or laches  since
such  acquisition,  if	set aside, would  not  only  involve
enormous loss of public money but also cause undue delay  in
carrying out projects meant for general public good. When  a
fresh  ground of attack to acquisition proceedings, even  if
it  involves  purely a question of  law,  its  entertainment
cannot be governed by a principle different from that  which
governs	 entertainment	of writ petitions  before  the	High
Court  or  proceedings arising therefrom before	 this  Court
under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_109">Article 136</a> of the Constitution.

however without costs.
