HEADNOTE:
The appellant received a notice on January 24, 1963 from the
Commissioner  of  Income-tax,  West  Bengal,  initiating   a
revision  under<a href="/doc/666826/" id="a_8"> s. 33B</a> of the Income-tax Act, 1922,  of	 her
assessments for the years 1952-53 to 1960-61.  The appellant
thereupon filed a petition in the High Court tinder <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_9">Art. 226</a>
of  the Constitution praying that the notice be quashed	 and
the  respondent	 restrained  from giving effect	 to  it.   A
single Bench of the High Court dismissed the petition and in
appeal to a Division Bench was also dismissed.
it  was	 contended on behalf of the appellant (i)  that	 the
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_10">Income-tax  Act</a>,  1922, having been repealed by the  Act  of
1961  which came into force on April 1, 1962 the  respondent
had  no	 power, authority or jurisdiction  to  initiate	 the
proceedings under<a href="/doc/666826/" id="a_11"> s. 33B</a> of the 1922 Act; (ii) that<a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_12"> s. 6</a>  of
the General Clauses Act, 1897, did not authorise the initia-
tion  of the proceedings inasmuch as no steps were taken  in
respect thereof while the 1922 Act was in force; (iii)	that
s.  298	 of  the 1961 Act was void; and in  any	 event,	 the
powers	under  the  section..  under  which  the  Government
promulgated  the Income-tax (Removal of Difficulties)  Order
1962,  clause 4 of which purported to cover a case like	 the
present one, can be exercised only in respect of the matters
dealt  with in<a href="/doc/677785/" id="a_13"> s. 297</a> of that Act which does not  deal	with
proceedings tinder<a href="/doc/666826/" id="a_14"> s. 33B</a> of the 1922 Act.
HELD : (i) The proceedings initiated by the respondent	were
valid  as they were covered by the expression "	 proceedings
for  the  .assessment of that person" in Clause	 (a)  of <a href="/doc/1724815/" id="a_15"> s.
297(2)</a> of the 1961 Act. [841E; 846B]
The word "assessment" can bear a very comprehensive meaning;
it  can comprehend the whole procedure for ascertaining	 and
imposing liability upon the tax-payer.	There was nothing in
the  context  of <a href="/doc/677785/" id="a_16"> s.  297</a>  which  required  the	  expression
"procedure  for	 the  assessment" to  be  given	 a  narrower
meaning.  S. 297 is meant to provide as far as possible	 for
all  contingencies which may arise out of the repeal of	 the
1922 Act. [845A-<a href="/doc/1865729/" id="a_17">C]

	      of assessment passed by the Income-tax Officer
	      'D'  Ward, Howrah, on 7th February, 1961,	 are
	      erroneous in so far as they are prejudicial to

	      under <a href="/doc/666826/" id="a_29">Section 33B</a> of the Income-tax Act, 1922.

</p><p id="p_8">The   assessee	on  February  1,  1963,	 protested  to	 the
Commissioner against the issue of the notice and stated that
the said notice was absolutely bad in law, illegal and void.

appeal.	  The  Division Bench came to  the  conclusion	that
"the.  provision for assessment are contained in Chapter  IV
of  the	 Act  of 1922 and <a href="/doc/666826/" id="a_70">section 33B</a> finds  place  in	this
Chapter and the expression "proceedings for the	 assessment"
indicates that any of the proceedings relating to assessment

the proceeding by way of Revision under <a href="/doc/666826/" id="a_72">section 33B</a> of	the,

assessee  that cl. (c) affected the scope of cl.  (it).	  It
concluded that cls. (d) and (f) had been inserted by way  of
abundant caution.  It also repelled the contention that	 cl.
(4) of the Income-tax (Removal of Difficulties) Order, 1962,
was  bad,  and observed that "what clause (4)  has  done  is
simply to make explicit what was implicit in clause (a)	 and
it  is with the object of removing the doubt or	 difficulty,
if  any, existing in respect of the construction  of  clause
</p><p id="p_18">(a) of <a href="/doc/1724815/" id="a_73">section 297(2)</a> that a specific provision like  clause

available for the purpose of interpreting the provisions  of

Division  Bench	 failed	 and was  dismissed.   The  assessee
having	obtained a certificate of fitness under <a href="/doc/1325025/" id="a_75">Art. 133</a>  of
the Constitution, the appeal is now before us.

<p id="p_19">The  learned  counsel  for the assessee	 contends  that	 the

</p><p id="p_20">(a)  of	 the  1961 Act meant original  proceedings  for	 the
assessment  of	a  person and not  appellate  or  revisional
proceedings.  He says that Parliament has left the  question
of  appeal and revision to be determined by  the.application
of <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_77"> s. 6</a> of the General Clauses Act.  He further  says	that
the  word "assessment" has not been used in its	 wide  sense
because	 Parliament  has  provided  for	 the  imposition  of
penalty	 in cls. (f) and (g), which ordinarily falls  within
the wide sense of "assessment".
</p><p id="p_21">It  has	 also  provided for what is  to	 happen	 to  pending
proceedings in cl. (c).	 He urges that the High Court  erred
in  holding that these subclauses had been added by  way  of
abundant caution.
</p><p id="p_22">The  learned  counsel for the respondent, Mr. S.  T.  Desai,
conends	 that<a href="/doc/677785/" id="a_78"> s. 297</a> (2) (a) is comprehensive in  its  scope
and ampliude to include any proceedings under<a href="/doc/666826/" id="a_79"> s. 33B</a> of	 the
1922  Act. de further says that<a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_80"> s. 6</a> of the General  Clauses
Act will apply of the extent there is no contrary  intention
in <a href="/doc/677785/" id="a_81"> s.	297</a> (2) of the 1961 Act.  He finally  contends	that
even if there is any doubt regarding the scope of cl. (a) it
is  removed  by the, Removal of	 Difficulties  Order  issued
under<a href="/doc/1240926/" id="a_82"> s. 298</a>.
</p><p id="p_23">It seems to us that the High Court is right in holding	that
297  (2)  (a)  of the 1961 Act includes	 with  its  scope  a
proceeding under<a href="/doc/666826/" id="a_83"> s. 33B</a> of the 1922 Act.  There is no  doubt
that the word 'assessment" does have subject to the  context
a  very wide meaning.  The Privy Council in <a href="/doc/1865729/" id="a_84">Commissioner  of
Income Tax, Bombay  v.	 Khemchand Ramdas</a>(l) observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_27">	      "In  order to answer them, it is essential  to

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_28">	      <a href="/doc/178760161/" id="a_85">In   A.  N.  Lakshman  Shenoy  v.	  Income-tax

	      effect  to  the  financial  proposals  of	 the

<blockquote id="blockquote_31">	      tax".	In   our   opinion,    both    these
	      circumstances  point towards  a  comprehensive
	      meaning; for it could not have been  intended,
	      as  part	of  the	 proposal  of  the   Central
	      Government,   that  those	 whose	income	 had
	      totally  escaped assessment should  be  liable
	      but  those who had been under-assessed  should
	      go scot free.  We can see nothing in the words
	      of  the  section which would  justify  such  a
	      distinction; we say this quite apart from	 the
	      argument	 that	<a href="/doc/1187491/" id="a_89">section	 13(1)</a>	 should	  be
	      interpreted  in consonance with the  financial
	      agreement entered into between the  Rajpramukh
	      and  the	President, an argument to  which  we
	      shall   presently	  advert.    Moreover,	 the
	      collocation  of the words, "levy,	 assessment,
	      and  collection" indicates that what is  meant
	      is  the  entire process by which	the  tax  is
	      ascertained, demanded and realised."
	      In  C.  A.  Abraham.  v.	 Income-tax  Officer
	      Kottayam(1) this Court observed :
	      "A  review of the provisions of Chapter IV  of
	      the  Act sufficiently discloses that the	word
	      "assessment"  has	 been  used  in	 its  widest
	      connotation in that Chapter.  The title of the
	      chapter  is "Deductions and Assessment".	 The
	      section which deals with assessment merely  as
	      computation  of  income  is  <a href="/doc/1218766/" id="a_90">section  23</a>;	 but
	      several sections deal not with computation  of
	      income,	but  determination   of	  liability,
	      machinery	 for  imposing	liability  and	 the
	      procedure	 in that behalf.  <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_91">Section 18A</a>  deals
	      with advance payment of tax and imposition  of
	      penalties	  for  failure	to  carry  out	 the
	      provisions  therein.  <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_92">Section 23A</a>	 deals	with
	      power to assess individual members of  certain
	      companies	 on the income deemed to  have	been

	      assessment  of  incomes  which  have   escaped
	      assessment.  The expression "assessment"	used
	      in  these sections is not used merely  in	 the
	      sense of computation of income and there is in
	      our  judgment no ground for holding that	when

	      partners	or members of the association  shall

	      opinion  the words "for the purposes of  levy,
	      assessment   and	collection   of	  incometax"
	      include all procedure for the levy, assessment
	      and collection of income-tax, for without	 the
	      procedure there can be no levy, assessment  or
	      collection;    and   taking   in	  particular
	      "assessment"  with which we are  concerned  on
	      this  petition  the assessment  is  not  final
	      until all remedies by way of appeals which are
	      given by the Act are exhausted.  This view  is
	      emphasized  by the concluding, words  of	sub-
	      section  (1)  which are "for any	purposes  in
	      connection  with	such  levy,  assessment	 and
	      collection."  There  can in any  event  be  no
	      doubt   that  the	 procedure  for	  assessment
	      including rights of appeal are included in the
	      words "purposes connected with assessment." In
	      my  opinion. therefore. the true	construction
	      of  sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1849490/" id="a_116">section 7</a> is  that	 the
	      Baroda   Act   continues	to  apply   to	 the
	      assessments of the petitioners even as regards
	      the right of apeal which was given under	that
	      Act to the Huzur Adalat."

	      It  is quite clear from the authorities  cited
	      above  that the word .assessment" can  bear  a
	      very comprehensive meaning; it can  comprehend
	      the  whole  procedure  for  ascertaining	 and
	      imposing	liability  upon the  tax-payer.	  Is
	      there then any thing in the context of<a href="/doc/677785/" id="a_117"> s.	 297</a>
	      which  compels  us to give to  the  expression
	      "procedure  for the assessment"  the  narrower
	      meaning  suggested by the learned counsel	 for
	      the  appellant  ? In our view, the  answer  to
	      this  question  must be in the  negative.	  It
	      seems to us that<a href="/doc/677785/" id="a_118"> s. 297</a> is meant to provide as
	      far  as possible for all	contingencies  which
	      may arise out of the repeal of the 1922  Act.'

It is true that whether a different intention appears or not
must  depend on the language and content of<a href="/doc/1724815/" id="a_130"> s.	297(2)</a>.	  It

evidenced an intention to the contrary.
If<a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_133"> s. 6</a> of the General Clauses Act is out of the way,  there
is no doubt that Parliament should not be credited with	 the

very comprehensive the-meaning
