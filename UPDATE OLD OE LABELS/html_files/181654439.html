<p id="p_14">3)     Press Note-12 dated August 31, 1998 is of some relevance in the

       present case. This was the result of liberalization policy of the

       Central Government. After embarking on liberalization and

       globalization, in order to ease the doing of business, the

       Government decided to relax the control over various types of

       industries. By the aforesaid Notification dated August 31, 1998,

       the Government exempted persons from taking licenses to set up

       a sugar factory. This was done in exercise of power contained

       under <a href="/doc/774360/" id="a_6">Section 29(b)</a> of the Act subject to the condition that a

       minimum distance of 15 km would continue to be observed

       between an existing sugar mill and a new mill. Pertinently, insofar

       as Sugarcane Control Order, 1966 is concerned, there was no

       provision of minimum distance between the two sugar mills. For

       this reason, the aforesaid Press Notes were held to be

       administrative guidelines, not having statutory character by

       Allahabad High Court.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">4)     The appellant herein had made an application for permission to

       establish a new sugar factory.      One, M/s. Raibagh Sahakari,

       which was in the same vicinity where the appellant was seeking to

       establish its factory, gave a ‘no objection’ certificate to the

       appellant for establishing a sugar factory in the year 1995. The

       application of the appellant was processed and the Government

       of India issued a Letter of Intent (LOI) to the appellant on July 03,

       1996 permitting it to establish a sugar factory at Village Saundatti,

       Tehsil Raibagh, District Belgaum. This was done before the new

       policy was announced vide Press Note-12 dated August 31, 1998,

       i.e., during the Licence Raj . After the aforesaid Press Note, there

       was paradigm shift in the approach as no licence was now

       required and instead requirement was to file an Industrial

       Entrepreneurs Memoranda (IEM) only. Accordingly, only condition

       which was to be fulfilled by the appellant was that there was no

       sugar factory existing within the radius of 15 km from the

       appellant’s proposed site which was so stipulated in Press Note

       dated August 31 1988, i.e., by administrative decision. On June

       05, 2006, the Commissioner of Cane Development/Director of

       Sugar issued a certificate to this effect certifying that there was no

       such sugar factory within the radius of 15 km from the appellant’s

       site. After the issuance of this certificate, the appellant filed its

       IEM which was duly acknowledged by the Ministry of Commerce

       and Industries.

</p><p id="p_18">5)     We may point out, at this stage, that the present dispute is about

       the existence of Raibagh Sahakari Factory, i.e., whether it is

       within the radius of 15 km from the appellant’s factory or not?

       Pertinently, on January 24, 2004, the Government of Karnataka

       had passed an order of liquidation of Raibagh Sahakari in

       exercise of its power under Section 72 of the Karnataka

       Co-operative Societies Act, 1951.       Certain developments took

       place qua Raibagh Sahakari thereafter. We would like to state

       those events and developments subsequently, though these

       events were taking place simultaneously with the process of

       setting up of the factory by the appellant. It would be apposite to

       first take note of the manner in which the appellant has set up its

       factory at the proposed site.

<p id="p_19">
</p><p id="p_20">6)     As pointed out above, the appellant filed its IEM on August 08,

       2006, supported by the certificate issued by the Cane

       Development Commissioner that there was no existing sugar

       factory within the radius of 15 km. Thereafter, on October 20,

       2006, the Government of Karnataka granted permission to the

       appellant for purchase of agricultural lands for industrial purposes

       in Raibagh Taluk in village Yadrav.       Similar permission was

       granted under Section 109(1) of the Karnataka Land Reforms Act,

       1961. Similar permission under <a href="/doc/774360/" id="a_7">Section 109(1)</a> on November 20,

       2006 for land admeasuring a total of 38 acres and 11 guntas for

       setting up a sugar factory in village Yadrav and Saundutti was

       also granted by the Deputy Commissioner, Belgaum.

       establishment of factory and start of production in the said factory

       by the appellant herein, we now advert to the contentious issue of

       setting up of this factory within 15 km from the sugar factory,

       Raibagh Sahakari. As pointed out above, on November 06, 1995,

       M/s. Raibagh Sahakari had issued ‘no objection’ certificate to the

       appellant. In any case, on January 24, 1995, order of liquidation

       in respect of Raibagh Sahakari was passed by the Government of

       Karnataka.        On September 14, 2006, the Cane Commissioner

       had written to the Secretary, Government of Karnataka bringing to

       its notice the fact that in Raibagh Taluk, the total production of

       sugarcane was 23.32 lakh tonnes as on that date Raibagh

       Sahakari factory was lying closed. According to the appellant,

       because of this reason there was excess cane available which

       was being taken to Maharashtra from Karnataka, thus, causing

       the loss to the exchequer.      In this backdrop, another factory

       Doodhganga Krishna Sahakari which was in the same vicinity

       (though more than 15 kms away) had given ‘no objection’ dated

       August 12, 2006 for allocating six villages to the appellant’s

       proposed factory.

       Government, however, made endeavour thereafter to revive this

       sugar mill. For this purpose on July 19, 2007 the Government

       notified tenders for giving this factory by way of lease.          This

       Notification inviting tender was challenged by certain persons in

       the form of writ petition filed in the High Court. The High Court

       dismissed the writ petition, thereby upholding the action of the

       Government to invite tenders. In this order dated January 10,

       2008 passed by the High Court, it was categorically noted as a

       fact that this Raibagh factory was lying closed from the year

       2001-2002.          Be as it may, the tender process went on and

       ultimately tender of Respondent No. 1 herein, i.e., Shree Renuka

       Sugar Limited was accepted and lease deed dated October 16,

       2008 was executed in favour of Respondent – 1 thereby allowing

       it to restart the said factory.      Even this grant of lease was

       challenged in a bunch of writ petitions which were dismissed by

       the High Court on February 10, 2010. In this order as well, the

       High Court again noticed that since the factory had been lying

       closed since 2001-2002, it needed a restart which was in public

       interest. In this manner, it is Respondent no. 1 which is now

       running Raibagh Sahakari factory and has now taken a position

       the place where appellant had set up its factory, as per the

       provided in the Amendment Order, 2006 and this amendment was

       held to be retrospective by this Court, advice of the Additional

       Solicitor General of India was sought as to whether the Bank

       Guarantees given by such persons should be accepted or not.

       The Additional Solicitor General of India in his letter dated June

       18, 2007 advised the Government that the Department should not

       accept the Bank Guarantees from the first or earlier persons

       whose IEMs were acknowledged in the years 1998/1999/2000 i.e.

       prior to June, 2003 and who had not taken effective steps. He

       further advised that Bank Guarantees can only be accepted from

       the first or earlier IEM holders in terms of Clause 6E of the Control

       Order, 2006 if the time limit of four years, as prescribed in Clause

       6C has not expired. The Union of India further stated that the

       matter of the appellant was examined in the light of the aforesaid

       opinion and that the extension of time for completing the project

       and to commence the project was given.              Insofar as issue of

       distance is concerned, as per the Union of India, since the

       certificate issued by the Survey of India was on record, which was

       valid and since it disclosed that the sugar factory was beyond 15

       km from the existing factory, the appellant was allowed to go up

       with the setting up of the said factory.

</p><p id="p_82">17)    The Sugarcane Commissioner in his statement of objections to

       the writ petitions mentioned that the State Government had, vide

       its order dated November 07, 2007, granted ‘in-principle

       clearance’ for establishment of the sugar factory. It was found

       that Raibag Sahakari factory was lying close for several years and

       the order of liquidation has been passed by the State

       Government.           From the year 2001-2002 itself, the crushing

       activity of the said Raibag Sahakari factory came to be stopped.

       It was also pointed out that in the year 1995 itself, Raibag

       Sahakari        had     conveyed   a   ‘No   Objection   Certificate’ for

       establishment of factory by the appellant. Apart from this, on a

       recommendation made by the Deputy Commissioner regarding

       the viability and availability of the cane in the area concerned,



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">Civil Appeal No. 5040 of 2014 &amp; Ors.                             Page 24 of 58</span>
       respondent-Authority has passed an order known as ‘The

       Karnataka         Sugarcane     (Regulation   of   Distribution)        M/s.

       Shivashakti Sugars, Saudatti Village, Raibag Taluk, Order 2007’.

       The said order admittedly is not called into question by the

       appellant nor by Raibag Sahakari Sakkare Karkhane. They have

       accepted the said order. According to the Cane Commissioner,

       the allocation of cane area made in favour of M/s. Shivashakti

       Sugars (the appellant) is an informed decision. It is a decision

       made on the basis of relevant materials. It is a decision made

       eminently in public interest, that is to say, in the interest of

       sugarcane farmers growing sugarcane in and around Raibag

       Taluk. The Cane Commissioner also emphasised in his affidavit

       filed in the High Court, that Deputy Commissioner, Belgaum vide

       its communication dated August 25, 2006 has made a

       recommendation for allocation of 16 villages situated in Raibag

       Taluk and 7 villages situated in Chikodi Taluk to be allocated in

       favour of the appellant and on receipt of this communication, a

       meeting was convened under the Chairmanship of the Secretary,

       Commerce &amp; Industries Department, on May 12, 2006. It was

       noticed that the Taluk Agricultural Officer had reported that the

       total potential of sugarcane growth is 23.22 lakh tones per year


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">Civil Appeal No. 5040 of 2014 &amp; Ors.                           Page 25 of 58</span>
       and that the necessity of the appellant was merely 5 lakh tone per

       year. It was also noticed that in view of the closure of Raibag

       Sahakari Sakkare Karkhane, sugarcane growers of the said area

       were forced to supply sugarcane to Doodhganga Sahakari

       Sakkare Karkhane and Halasiddanatha Sahakara Sakkare

       Karkhane. Those two factories also were unable to receive the

       sugarcane so grown, resulting in the sugarcane farmers being

       forced to carry their sugarcane to the neighbouring State of

       Maharashtra, which has counter productive of the interest of the

       farmers in general. It was also pointed out that thereafter notices

       were issued to Doodhganga Sahakari Sakkare Karkhane as well

       as Raibag Sahakari Sakkare Karkhane for another meeting which

       was held on 04.06.2007 wherein the Managing Director of Raibag

       Sahakari Sakkare Karkhane concurred with the recommendation

       made by the Deputy Commissioner and Doodhganga Sahakari

       Sakkare Karkhane also issued no objection. Taking into account

       these factors, the State Government had passed the order dated

       November 07, 2007.              Another significant aspects highlighted by

       the Sugarcane Development Commissioner were that for the year

       2008-2009, Raibag Sahakari Sakkare Karkhane had crushed only

       20,573 tonnes of sugarcane, whereas its crushing capacity is 4


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">Civil Appeal No. 5040 of 2014 &amp; Ors.                              Page 26 of 58</span>
       lakh tonnes. Out of 23 lakh tones of sugarcane so grown in that

       area, if the entire 4 lakh tones is given away to Raibag Sahakari

       Sakkare Karkhane, yet there would be excess cane available in

       the area.        In these circumstances, the commencement of the

       appellant’s factory would be actually in the interest of sugarcane

       farmers, which would encourage sugarcane growth and it will also

       prevent the farmers from transporting their sugarcane outside the

       State. There has been under-crushing of sugarcane frown in the

       entire State as such.           In fact, for the year 2007-2008, it was

       noticed that as against the growth of 340 lakh tonnes of

       sugarcane, only 270 lakh tones was crushed, thereby leaving

       about 70 lakh tonnes of sugarcane remaining uncrushed. For the

       year 2008-2009, it was projected that 90 lakh tonnes would go

       without crushing. Therefore, the State Government announced

       several incentives to sugarcane farmers for paying compensation

       for uncrushed sugarcane and also incentives to Sugar Factory

       were given to crush sugarcane apart from the allocated area, with

       an incentive of Rs.100/- for every tone of sugarcane so crushed.

       All these would go to show that commencement of new Sugar

       Factories would be in the interest of all concerned and in the

       public interest.

       from reiterating the aforesaid facts, submitted that entire action of

       the appellant, in this behalf, was bonafide and it had invested

       substantial amounts for the establishment of the factory.

</p><p id="p_100">21)    Thereafter, the High Court discussed, in great detail, each of the

       aforesaid points and came to the conclusion that ‘effective steps’

       as required under the provision of Sugarcane (Control) Order

       were not taken by the appellant; the order giving extensions to the

       appellant for completing the objections were not valid; there could

       not be any new sugar factory established by the appellant in view

       of existing sugar mills, namely, Doodhganga Sugar Mills and

       Raibag Sugar Mills within 15 km from the sugar factory of the

       appellant; the Survey of India had not determined the distance by

       conducting the measurements independently; clause 6A of the

       Sugarcane Control Order was mandatory and retrospective in

       nature and, therefore, was applicable in the case of the appellant

       as well. In the process, the High Court also held that Raibag

       Sugar Factory was an existing factory within the meaning of

       clause 6A of the Sugarcane Control Order 2006.


</p><p id="p_101">22)    The appellant has challenged the aforesaid findings of the High

       Court.      In the first instance, it is argued that interpretation of

       clause 6A of the Sugarcane Control Order by this Court in M/s.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">Civil Appeal No. 5040 of 2014 &amp; Ors.                          Page 30 of 58</span>
       Ojas Industries case holding it to be retrospective, is per

       incuriam. It is also argued that, in any case, since M/s. Raibag

       Sahakari Sakkare Karkhane was not an existing sugar factory at

       the relevant time, rigours of clause 6A was not applicable in the

       case of the appellant as the question of distance did not arise. It

       was also argued that the findings of the High Court that the

       appellant did not take effective steps as per explanation to clause

       6A was clearly erroneous and, therefore, it resulted in an

       automatic de-recognition of the IEM of the appellant.                  The

       appellant has questioned the correctness of the decision of the

       High Court insofar as it holds that extensions given by the Union

       of India were inappropriate. Even the locus standi of the writ

       petitioners who filed the writ petitions is challenged. It was also

       submitted that having regard to the subsequent events and

       particularly to the effect that very substantial amount was spent by

       the appellant on the establishment of the factory and appellant

       had taken all possible steps and sanctions from various

       Authorities, it should not be made to suffer the closure of the

       factory since the factory of the appellant is in business from the

       year 2011.         In nutshell, following issues have been raised for

       consideration:

               entrepreneur, who has been granted an IEM prior to the

               amendment on November 10, 2006 and whether the

               judgment of this Court in the case of Ojas Industries case,

<p id="p_126">
</p><p id="p_127">               Clause 6A also defines what is an existing sugar factory and

       what is a new factory. This Clause also stipulates the distance

       requirement and how the minimum distance of 15 km provided

       therein shall be determined.        With this, we advert to the

       discussion on issues (b) and (g) in the first instance.


       Issue (b)


</p><p id="p_128">26)    M/s. Chidambaram and Kavin Gulati, senior advocates argued the

       matter on behalf of the appellant. It was their submission that on

       the date when the appellant applied for and got acknowledged its

       IEM on June 08, 2006, M/s. Raibag Sahakari Sugar factory was

       not in operation on that date. Therefore, distance requirement as

       provided for under Clause 6A was not applicable in the instant

       case. It was also emphasised that M/s. Raibag Sahakari had not

       crushed sugarcane since 2001-2002 i.e. in the last five crushing

       seasons prior to June 08, 2006, which was also a relevant

       consideration to hold that distance requirement was inapplicable

       in this case. It was submitted that there was a clinching evidence

       to prove the aforesaid facts inasmuch as this has been judicially

       acknowledged in the orders of the High Court itself while dealing


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">Civil Appeal No. 5040 of 2014 &amp; Ors.                         Page 38 of 58</span>
       with the challenge to the action of the State Government in

       inviting tenders for giving lease to M/s. Raibag Sahakari and while

       deciding challenge to the grant of the said lease in favour of

       respondent No.1.
</p>
<p id="p_129">
</p><p id="p_130">27)    We may point out at this stage that the aforesaid fact is not in

       dispute. There cannot be any quarrel about the same having

       regard to plethora of evidence produced in support of this

       submission which has already been recorded above.                     The

       question is as to whether M/s. Raibagh Sahakari would be treated

       as ‘existing sugar factory’ within the meaning of Clause 6A of the

       Sugarcane Control Order. It is the case of the appellant that

       Clause 6A of the Sugarcane Control Order provides a minimum

       distance of 15 km to be maintained between an existing sugar

       factory and another new sugar factory. Explanation 1, defines an

       existing sugar factory. This explanation is in three parts. The first

       part provides that a factory shall be considered as an existing

       sugar factory to be a sugar factory ‘in operation’. The second part

       provides that, it shall also include a sugar factory that has taken

       all effective steps as specified in explanation 4. The third part

       provides that a sugar factory shall not be considered as an



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">Civil Appeal No. 5040 of 2014 &amp; Ors.                         Page 39 of 58</span>
       existing sugar factory if ‘a sugar factory that has not carried out its

       crushing operations for the last five sugar seasons’.              It is

       submitted that if a sugar factory, is not ‘in operation’ on the date

       when a new sugar mill applies for an IEM, the old sugar factory,

       shall not be considered as an existing sugar mill.


</p><p id="p_131">28)    The learned counsel for respondent no. 1 heavily relied upon the

       reasoning in the impugned judgment of the High Court to support

       his case. There appears to be force in the aforesaid submissions

       of the appellant. Requirement of Explanation 1 to Clause 6A is

       that in order to qualify as an existing sugar mill, it needs to crush

       for five consecutive years.     We find that the High Court has

       wrongly recorded that the requirement is of crushing for any of the

       one season out of five and this has led to error on the part of the

       High Court in holding that M/s. Raibagh Sahakari was an existing

       sugar factory.
</p>
<p id="p_132">
</p><p id="p_133">29)    Another aspect which becomes relevant in this behalf (and would

       also have bearing while deciding issue (g)) is that the case of the

       appellant for setting up of the factory was processed keeping in

       view the fact that M/s. Raibagh Sahakari was not in operation.

       Further, in one case way back in the year 1995, it had even



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">Civil Appeal No. 5040 of 2014 &amp; Ors.                          Page 40 of 58</span>
       granted ‘no objection’ certificate for setting up of the factory by the

       appellant. Another significant aspect which is to be borne in mind

       is that the State Government had passed order of liquidation of

       M/s. Raibagh Sahakari in exercise of its power under Section 72

       of the Karnataka Co-operative Societies Act, 1951.             Even a

       liquidator was appointed to undertake the liquidation process.

       From this scenario, everybody would get a bonafide impression

       that such a factory which is non-operational, is going to be

       liquidated in due course of time.      No doubt, subsequently the

       State Government decided to revive this factory and steps in this

       behalf were taken in the year 2008. However, much before that

       IEM of the appellant was got acknowledged on June 08, 2006. As

       on that date, there was no ‘existing’ sugar factory within the

       meaning of Clause 6A of the Sugarcane Control Order.

       Therefore, the requirement of distance as prescribed in Clause 6A

       would be inapplicable.
</p>
<p id="p_134">
</p><p id="p_135">30)    Insofar as M/s. Doodhganga Sahakari factory is concerned, two

       aspects need to be stressed upon. First, as per the certificate of

       Survey of India given on June 05, 2006, distance between the

       said factory and the then proposed factory of the appellant is



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">Civil Appeal No. 5040 of 2014 &amp; Ors.                          Page 41 of 58</span>
       shown to be 15 km. Secondly, M/s. Doodhganga Sahakari had

       given their no objection to the setting up of the factory by the

       appellant on the basis of which matter was processed further.


</p><p id="p_136">31)    We have to keep in mind that the requirement of distance

       mentioned in the Amendment Order was inserted keeping in mind

       the benefit of the existing sugar factories. In a situation like this,

       when such a factory itself gave ‘no objection’ certificate, thereby

       waived the requirement, the bonafides of the appellant cannot be

       doubted.         We would like to reproduce here the following

       observations from the judgment in the case of <a href="/doc/1129467/" id="a_10">Rajendra Singh v.

                   SCC 104.] While examining complaints of violation of
                   statutory rules and conditions, it must be remembered
                   that violation of each and every provision does not
                   furnish a ground for the court to interfere. The
                   provision may be a directory one or a mandatory one.
                   In the case of directory provisions, substantial
                   compliance would be enough. Unless it is established
                   that violation of a directory provision has resulted in
                   loss and/or prejudice to the party, no interference is
                   warranted. Even in the case of violation of a
                   mandatory provision, interference does not follow as a
                   matter of course. A mandatory provision conceived in
                   the interest of a party can be waived by that party,
                   whereas a mandatory provision conceived in the
                   interest of the public cannot be waived by him. In other
                   words, wherever a complaint of violation of a
                   mandatory provision is made, the court should enquire
                   — in whose interest is the provision conceived. If it is
                   not conceived in the interest of the public, question of
                   waiver and/or acquiescence may arise — subject, of
                   course, to the pleadings of the parties. This aspect has
                   been dealt with elaborately by this Court in <a href="/doc/1865791/" id="a_14">State Bank
                   of Patiala v. S.K. Sharma</a> [(1996) 3 SCC 364 : 1996

                   were rendered with reference to the statutory rules
                   and statutory provisions (besides the principles of
                   natural justice) governing the disciplinary enquiries
                   involving government servants and employees of
                   statutory corporations, the principles adumbrated
                   therein are of general application. It is necessary to
                   keep these considerations in mind while deciding
                   whether any interference is called for by the court —
                   whether under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_15">Article 226</a> or in a suit. The function of
                   the court is not a mechanical one. It is always a
                   considered course of action.”

</p><p id="p_140">32)    Another aspect which is to be borne in mind is that the purpose of

       distance requirement is that there is sufficient availability of

       sugarcane in the area so that it could easily cater to all the sugar

       factories.       It is not disputed that appellant’s factory has not

       adversely affected the utilisation of crushing capacity of either

       M/s. Doodhganga Sahakari factory or M/s. Raibagh Sahakari

       factory.      It was pointed out by the learned counsel for the

       appellant during arguments, which fact was not denied by either

       had crushed more sugarcane than their target.

       judicial wing, while undertaking the task of performing its judicial

       function, is also required to perform its role in this direction. It

       calls for an economic analysis of law approach, most commonly

       referred to as ‘Law and Economics’ 1. In fact, in certain branches

       of law there is a direct impact of economics and economic

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">1</span>

       Richard A. Posner in his book ‘Frontiers of Legal Theory’ explains this concept as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_24">               “Economic analysis of law has heuristic, descriptive, and normative aspects.
              As a heuristic, it seeks to display underlying unities in legal doctrines and
              institutions; in its descriptive mode, it seeks to identify the economic logic and
              effects of doctrines and institutions and the economic causes of legal change;</blockquote><p id="p_164">
</p><p id="p_165">              in its normative aspect it advises judges and other policymakers on the most
              efficient methods of regulating conduct through law. The range of its subject
              matter has become wide, indeed all-encompassing. Exploiting advances in
              the economics of nonmarket behavior, economic analysis of law has
              expanded far beyond its original focus on antitrust, taxation, public utility
              regulation, corporate finance, and other areas of explicitly economic
              regulation. (And within that domain, it has expanded to include such fields as
              property and contract law). The “new” economic analysis of law embraces
              such nonmarket, or quasi-nonmarket, fields of law as tort law, family law,
              criminal law, free speech, procedure, legislation, public international law, the
              law of intellectual property, the rules governing the trial and appellate process,
              environmental law, the administrative process, the regulation of health and
              safety, the laws forbidding discrimination in employment, and social norms
              viewed as a source of, an obstacle to, and a substitute for formal law.”

                Posner also mentioned that this interface between Law and Economics might
       grandly be called ‘Economic Theory of Law’, which is built on a pioneering article by Ronald
       Coase {R.H. Coase, “The Problem of Social Cost”, 3 Journal of Law and Economics 1
       (1960)}:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_25">               “The “Coase Theorem” holds that where market transaction costs are zero,
              the law’s initial assignment of rights is irrelevant to efficiency, since if the
              assignment is inefficient the parties will rectify it by a corrective transaction.</blockquote><p id="p_166">
</p><p id="p_167">              There are two important corollaries. The first is that the law, to the extent
              interested in promoting economic efficiency, should try to minimize transaction
              costs, for example by defining property rights clearly, by making them readily
              transferable, and by creating cheap and effective remedies for breach of
              contract…

               The second corollary of the Coase Theorem is that where, despite the law’s
              best efforts, market transaction costs remain high, the law should simulate the
              market’s allocation of resources by assigning property rights to the
              highest-valued users. An example is the fair-use doctrine of copyright law,

       considerations play predominant role, which are even recognised

       as legal principles. Monopoly laws (popularly known as ‘Antitrust

       Laws’ in USA) have been transformed by economics. The issues

       arising in competition laws (which has replaced monopoly laws)

       are decided primarily on economic analysis of various provisions

       of the <a href="/doc/109474639/" id="a_16">Competition Commission Act</a>. Similar approach is to be

       necessarily adopted while interpreting bankruptcy laws or even

       matters relating to corporate finance, etc.                            The impress of

       economics is strong while examining various facets of the issues

       arising under the aforesaid laws.                     In fact, economic evidence

       plays a big role even while deciding environmental issues. There

       is a growing role of economics in contract, labour, tax, corporate

       and other laws. Courts are increasingly receptive to economic

       arguments while deciding these issues. In such an environment it

       becomes the bounden duty of the Court to have the economic

       analysis and economic impact of its decisions. We may hasten to

       add that it is by no means suggested that while taking into

       account these considerations specific provisions of law are to be

              which allows writers to publish short quotations from a copyrighted work
              without negotiating with the copyright holder. The costs of such negotiations
              would usually be prohibitive; if they were not prohibitive, the usual result would
              be an agreement to permit the quotation, and so the doctrine of fair use brings
              about the result that the market would bring about if market transactions were
              feasible.”

       ignored. First duty of the Court is to decide the case by applying

       the statutory provisions. However, on the application of law and

       while interpreting a particular provision, economic impact/effect of

       a decision, wherever warranted, has to be kept in mind. Likewise,

       in a situation where two views are possible or wherever there is a

       discretion given to the Court by law, the Court needs to lean in

       favour of a particular view which subserves the economic interest

       of the nation. Conversely, the Court needs to avoid that particular

       outcome which has a potential to create an adverse affect on

       employment, growth of infrastructure or economy or the revenue

       of the State. It is in this context that economic analysis of the

       impact of the decision becomes imperative 2. At times, this Court

       has laid emphasis on this aspect, al beit in other context. For

       example,         in    <a href="/doc/952082/" id="a_17">Raunaq        International         Limited        v.    I.V.R.

                   challenging the award of a contract by a public
                   authority or the State, the court must be satisfied that
                   there is some element of public interest involved in
                   entertaining such a petition. If, for example, the
                   dispute is purely between two tenderers, the court
                   must be very careful to see if there is any element of
                   public interest involved in the litigation. A mere
                   difference in the prices offered by the two tenderers
                   may or may not be decisive in deciding whether any
                   public interest is involved in intervening in such a
                   commercial transaction. It is important to bear in mind
                   that by court intervention, the proposed project may be
                   considerably delayed thus escalating the cost far more
                   than any saving which the court would ultimately effect
                   in public money by deciding the dispute in favour of
                   one tenderer or the other tenderer. Therefore, unless
                   the court is satisfied that there is a substantial amount
                   of public interest, or the transaction is entered into
                   mala fide, the court should not intervene under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_18">Article

                   court must satisfy itself that the party which has

                   conflicting public interests before intervening.
                   Intervention by the court may ultimately result in delay
                   in the execution of the project. The obvious
                   consequence of such delay is price escalation. If any
                   retendering is prescribed, cost of the project can
                   escalate substantially. What is more important is that
                   ultimately the public would have to pay a much higher
                   price in the form of delay in the commissioning of the
                   project and the consequent delay in the contemplated
                   public service becoming available to the public. If it is
                   a power project which is thus delayed, the public may
                   lose substantially because of shortage in electricity
                   supply and the consequent obstruction in industrial
                   development. If the project is for the construction of a
                   road or an irrigation canal, the delay in transportation
                   facility becoming available or the delay in water supply
                   for agriculture being available, can be a substantial
                   setback to the country&#x27;s economic development.

                   court when interim orders are passed in such
                   petitions. The party at whose instance interim orders
                   are obtained has to be made accountable for the
                   consequences of the interim order. The interim order
                   could delay the project, jettison finely worked financial
                   arrangements and escalate costs. Hence the
                   petitioner asking for interim orders in appropriate
                   cases should be asked to provide security for any
                   increase in cost as a result of such delay or any

                   190 at p. 196) that an interim order should not be
                   granted without considering the balance of
                   convenience, the public interest involved and the
                   financial impact of an interim order. Similarly,
                   in <a href="/doc/1102476/" id="a_19">Ramniklal N. Bhutta v. State of Maharashtra</a> [(1997)
                   1 SCC 134] the Court said that while granting a stay,
                   the court should arrive at a proper balancing of
                   competing interests and grant a stay only when there
                   is an overwhelming public interest in granting it, as
                   against the public detriment which may be caused by
                   granting a stay. Therefore, in granting an injunction or
                   stay order against the award of a contract by the
                   Government or a government agency, the court has to
                   satisfy itself that the public interest in holding up the
                   project far outweighs the public interest in carrying it
                   out within a reasonable time. The court must also take
                   into account the cost involved in staying the project
                   and whether the public would stand to benefit by
                   incurring such cost.”               [Emphasis supplied]
