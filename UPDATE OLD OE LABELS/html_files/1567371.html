HEADNOTE:
The suit for eviction of defendant-appellant from the ground
floor	of  premises  No.  16/lA,  Ram	Ratan	Bose   Lane,
Shyambazar, which the appellant was occupying as a tenant on
a monthly rent of Rs. 37/- on the ground that the respondent
required the same for his own use and occupation, ended in a
decree	in  favour of the respondent and  was  confirmed  in
appeal	by the First Appellate Court.  In the Second  Appeal
to  the	 High  Court  at  Calcutta,  the  appellant   sought
permission to adduce additional evidence to the effect	that
the  requirement of the landlord stood satisfied because  he
had  recovered	possession of four rooms on  the  first	 and
second	floors	of the same building.	The  appellant	also
contended that the suit filed by the respondent-landlord was
incompetent, it having been instituted within a period of  3
years of the acquisition of his interest as landlord in	 the
premises by transfer and was accordingly hit by	 sub-section
3-A of s. 13 of the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act,  1956,
as  amended  by	 the West Bengal  Premises  Tenancy  (Second
Amendment)  Act,  1969.	  The  contentions  raised  by	 the
appellant  in the Second Appeal were overruled by  the	High
Court and the appeal was dismissed and the decree for  evic-
tion  was  affirmed.   Upon a  certificate  granted  by	 the
learned	 Single	 Judge	of  the	 High  Court  the  appellant
preferred  an appeal under clause-15 of the Letters  Patent.
When  the appeal under Clause-15 of the Letters	 Patent	 was
pending	 in the High Court, respondent-plaintiff in view  of
the  Court's decision in <a href="/doc/843614/" id="a_3">B. Banerjee v. Anita Pan</a>, [1975]  2
S.C.R.	774, sought and obtained leave to amend	 the  plaint
and  consequently the appellant defendant  filed  additional
written	 statement  and thereafter the	Court  framed  fresh
issues arising from the amended pleadings as under:
	      1.    Is	the premises in	 dispute  reasonably
	      required	by the plaintiff respondent for	 his
	      own  occupation and for the occupation of	 the
	      members of his family ?
	      2.    Is	  the	 plaintiff-respondent	  in
	      possession   of	any   reasonably    suitable
	      accommodation?
Oral  and documentary evidence were permitted to be  adduced
and  thereafter	 the  appeal  was  set	down  for   hearing.
Ultimately  the appeal was dismissed, affirm the decree	 for
eviction.
148
Allowing the tenant's appeal by certificate, the Court
HELD : 1. The retroactive operation of sub-section 3A of  s.
13  of the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1956  does	 not
offend	<a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_4">Art. 19 (1) (f)</a> on the ground  of  unreasonableness.
[153 <a href="/doc/843614/" id="a_5">F]
B.   Banerjee v. Anita Pan</a>, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 774 reiterated.
2.   While   working  out  the	mechanics  consequent	upon
upholding the validity of sub-section 3-A it was open to the
Court  hearing	the appeal under Clause-15  of	the  Letters
Patent to grant permission to amend pleadings. [153 G]
3.   Ordinarily,  an appellant is not entitled in an  appeal
under clause-15 of the Letters Patent to be heard on  points
which  have  not  been raised before the  Judge	 from  whose
judgment  of appeal is preferred.  If in second	 appeal	 the
findings  of fact recorded by the first Appellate Court	 are
taken  as  binding,  unless  fresh  additional	evidence  is
permitted  to be led when again appreciation of evidence  to
record	a  finding  of fact  would  become  necessary,	that
position  is not altered, even if amendment of pleadings  is
granted	 which puts into controversy some new facts  allowed
in  amended pleadings and therefore, the Court	hearing	 the
second	appeal after granting amendment could not take	over
the function of the trial court or the first Appellate Court
and  undertake appreciation of evidence and record  findings
of facts.  That is not the function of the Court hearing the
second appeal under s. 100 as envisaged by the Code of Civil
Procedure.  The provision contained in s. 103 which  defines
the power of the High Court to determine a question of	fact
while  hearing	second appeal makes this clear.	  But,	this
power  of the Court is limited to evidence on  record  which
again is sufficient to determine an issue of fact  necessary
for disposal of the appeal and which has not been determined
by  the	 lower appellate court or 'which  has  been  wrongly
determined by such Court. [154 D-G]
4.   When  pleadings are amended at the stage of the  appeal
under clause-15 Of the Letters Patent and fresh	 allegations
of  facts  are	thus introduced	 in  the  controversy  which
necessitate  additional evidence being permitted,  it  would
not  be open to the Court to proceed to record evidence	 and
to  appreciate the evidence and record findings of  fact,  a
function which even ordinarily is not undertaken by the High
Court  hearing the Second Appeal, much less can it  be	done
while  hearing	an  appeal under Clause-15  of	the  Letters
Patent. [154 G-H]
5.   When  on  account	of  a  subsequent  change  in	law,
amendment of the pleadings is granted which raises  disputed
questions of fact the situation would not be one governed by
0.41  R.27  of the Civil Procedure Code.  At that  stage  it
could  not  be said that the Appellate Court  is  permitting
production  of additional evidence, oral or  documentary  on
the  ground that the Court from whose decree the  appeal  is
preferred has refused to admit evidence which ought to	have
been  admitted or the Appellate Court requires any  document
to be produced or any witness to be examined to enable it to
pronounce  the	judgment.  Nor would the  situation  be	 one
which  could  be covered under the expression  "other  subs-
tantial cause". [154 H, 155 A]
6.   To	 avoid	hardship to the plaintiff the  proper  thing
would  be to grant leave to amend the pleadings and to	give
an equal opportunity to the defendant to controvert if he so
chooses	 what the plaintiff contends by	 amended  pleadings.
But   once  that  is  done  immediately	 the   question	  of
jurisdiction of the Court hearing the appeal under clause-15
of  the	 Letters Patent would arise and if  the	 appeal	 was
entertained against a judgment rendered by the High Court in
Second Appeal the limitations on the power of the High Court
hearing	 the  Second  Appeal  will  ipso  facto	 limit	 and
circumscribe  the jurisdiction of the Appellate	 Bench.	  If
the  High Court while hearing the Second Appeal,  where	 the
amended pleadings substantially raise disputed questions  of
fact which need resolution afresh after additional evidence,
could  not undertake the exercise of recording evidence	 and
appreciating  it and recording findings of fact,  but  could
appropriately remand the case to the trial Court, the  Bench
hearing	 appeal against the judgment in Second Appeal  could
not  enlarge its jurisdiction by undertaking that  forbidden
exercise. [155 C-F]
149
7.   When  a  Bench  of a High Court is	 hearing  an  appeal
preferred upon a certificate granted under Clause-15 of	 the
Letters	 Patent by a Single Judge of the High Court  who  by
his  judgment has disposed of the of the Second Appeal,	 the
Appellate  Bench would be subject to the limitation  on	 its
power  and  jurisdiction  to  appreciate  or   re-appreciate
evidence and to record findings fact which were never raised
before	the trial court or the First Appellate Court as	 the
pleadings  were	 permitted  to	be amended  by	it  and	 the
question  was  raised for the first time before it,  to	 the
same extent as the High Court hearing the Second Appeal with
constrains  of	Ss.  100 and 103  of  the  Code.   Admitting
evidence  is  entirely different from  appreciating  it	 and
acting upon it. [155 F-G]
	      Indrajit	Pratap Sahi v. Amar Singh and  Ors.,
	      Law  Reports 50 I.A. 183, <a href="/doc/108617/" id="a_6">Surinder  Kumar	 and
	      Ors. v. Gian Chand &amp; Ors</a>, [1958] SCR 548, held
	      inapplicable.
8.   If the Court lacks inherent jurisdiction, no amount  of
consent can confer jurisdiction.  The failure on the part of
the appellant to object to the High Court hearing an  appeal
under  Clause-15 of the Letters Patent taking oral  evidence
in  respect  of the amended pleadings would not	 clothe	 the
Bench  with jurisdiction to record fresh oral  evidence	 and
proceed to appreciate the same and record findings of facts.

	      Law  Reports,  14	 I.A.  160;  discussed	 and
	      applied.
9.   When  the leave is limited on certain grounds it  would
not  be	 appropriate  to put in	 a  narrow  and	 grammatical
construction  of the grounds as if construing a	 statute  or
some  rule, regulation or order of a public  authority.	  As
far  as	 possible the grounds should not  be  very  strictly
construed or should not be construed in such a manner as  to
make  the  special leave grant	under  Art.  self-defeating.
Attempt	 of  the  Court must be to find	 out  what  was	 the
grievance or contention that was being put forth before	 the
Court which appealed to the Court in granting special  leave
under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_7">Art. 136.</a> [157 G. H, 158 A]
10.  (a)  <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_8">Article 136</a> confers power on the Supreme Court  in
its  discretion	 to grant special leave	 from  any  judgment
decree,	 determination,	 sentence or order in  any  case  or
matter,	 passed	 or  made by any court or  tribunal  in	 the
territory  'of	India.	 Ordinarily once  special  leave  is
granted it is against the judgment, decree etc.	 However, by
practice Supreme Court sometimes limits the leave to certain
specific  points.   If	the leave  is  limited	to  specific
points,	 obviously  the whole case is not  open	 before	 the
Court hearing the appeal.

	      Chanchamma  &amp; Anr</a>. [1964] 2 SCR 933; held	 not
	      applicable.
10.  (b)   Once	  a  certificate  is  granted	this   Court
undoubtedly  has the power as a Court of Appeal to  consider
the correctness of the decision appealed against from, every
stand point whether on questions of fact or law.  It may  in
Its  wisdom  not interfere with the concurrent	findings  of
fact   but  there  is  no  bar	to  its	 jurisdiction	from
interfering with the same.  But when an appeal is  preferred
under  <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_11">Art.  136</a> and the leave is limited  to  the  specific
grounds	 the  scope of appeal cannot be enlarged  so  as  to
extend beyond what is permissible to be urged in support  of
the grounds to which the leave is limited.  Undoubtedly	 the
scope  of  the	appeal would be limited to  the	 grounds  in
respect	 of which the leave is granted but the grounds	must
be  broadly  construed	to  ascertain  the  question  raised
therein	 and not in a narrow or pedantic manner	 by  literal
interpretation of the language used. [158 G. H, 159 A-B]
10.  (c)  Although an order of this Court confining  special
leave  under  <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_12">Art.  136</a>, to certain  points  would  imply  a
rejection  of it so far as other points are concerned,	yet,
this  Court  has a constitutional power under  <a href="/doc/249731/" id="a_13">Art.  137</a>  of
reviewing   its	 own  orders.	This  power  may   in	very
exceptional cases consistently with
150
rules  made  under  <a href="/doc/1537130/" id="a_14">Art.  145</a>  of  the	Constitution  be  so
exercised in the interest of justice as to expand the  leave
itself	subject to due notice to the  respondents  concerned
and fair opportunity to meet the results of an extension  of
grounds of appeal. [159 B-C]
10.  (d)  In  the  instant case,  the  appellant-tenant	 was
substantially contending that in view of the introduction of
Sub-<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_15">Section  3-A</a>  of  S. 13, the suit  when  instituted	 was
incompetent and that on a construction of<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_16"> S. 17E</a>  introduced
in  the	 parent Act by S. 4 of the  West    Premises Tenancy
(complete)  Act,  1970, the decree would  be  unenforceable.
The contention was that by amendment of pleading a suit when
instituted  was incompetent, should not have  been  rendered
competent.  From that springs the question about the court's
jurisdiction  to deal with the suit subsequent to  amendment
of  pleadings.	If it is one compact ground it can  be	said
that  the contention raised herein, if not  explicit,  would
certainly  be  implicit	 in the	 grounds  limited  to  which
special Leave was granted and, therefore, this Court can not
refuse to entertain it.
[159-C-E]
11.  Sub-section  (3A) of S, 13 bars a suit for eviction  on
any of the grounds mentioned in clause&amp; (f) and (ff) of Sub-
section	 (1) of<a href="/doc/1813508/" id="a_17"> S. 13</a> for a period of three years since	 the
acquisition  of interest by landlord in the  premises.	 The
suit  should, therefore, have been filed three	years  after
the  purchase  of  the	property  by  the  respondent.	 The
respondent  would  have	 been then required to	show  as  to
whether	 he required the premises and whether he  had  other
reasonably  suitable accommodation.  The enquiry would	have
been  related  to  the time when the suit  could  have	been
competently  instituted.  After focusing attention  on	this
point, the trial Court would appreciate evidence and  record
findings  of  fact  which can be re-examined  by  the  first
Appellate  Court being the final court of facts.  This	very
opportunity  was  denied  to  the  appellant  by  the  Bench
arrogating the jurisdiction to itself to record evidence and
to  proceed to appreciate the same and reach conclusions  of
fact which become final.  Therefore, considerable  prejudice
was caused to the appellant by the procedure followed by the
Court and this Court will be amply justified in	 interfering
with it and remand  the same. [159 G-H, 160 A-B]
12.  (a) By<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_18"> S. 17E</a> power was conferred upon the Court to set
aside the decrees   passed  in suits brought by	 transferee-
landlord  within  three years from the date of the  date  of
transfer.   When appeal is pending it would be open  to	 the
tenant	to  raise the contention that the  suit	 has  become
incompetent;  but  where  the appeal is not  pending  or  an
execution application is pending and the tenant is still not
physically  evicted,  it  would	 be  open  to  him  to	take
advantage of the provisions contained in<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_19"> S. 17E</a>. [160 C-E]
12.  (b)  The  provision  contained in<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_20"> S.  17E</a>	provides  an
additional  remedy  covering  classes of  cases	 of  tenants
against	 whom decree for eviction was made but there was  no
pending	 appeal against the decree.  If the  tenant  applies
under<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_21"> S. 17E</a> he could get relief on the only ground that the
decree	was  on the ground mentioned in Clause (f)  of	Sub-
section	 (1)  of <a href="/doc/1813508/" id="a_22"> S. 13</a> and not the  other  grounds  because
relief was sought to be granted by the provisions  contained
in <a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_23"> S.	17E</a>  to those tenants against whom  the	 decree	 for
eviction was made under 8.13(1)(f). Therefore, it could	 not
be said that once a specific remedy under<a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_24"> S. 17E</a> is provided
for the:benefit of tenant under a decree for eviction on the
ground mentioned in<a href="/doc/1813508/" id="a_25"> S. 13</a> (1) (f), that is the only way	 and
no  other in which he could get relief.	 If so,	 his  appeal
would  become  incompetent.   Remedy  under <a href="/doc/1806623/" id="a_26"> S.	 17E</a>  is  an
additional  remedy.   More particularly it appears  for	 the
benefit	 of these tenants against Whom decree  for  eviction
was made under S.13(1)(f) and appeal by whom was not pending
so  that they could protect themselves against eviction,  by
landlords whose suits had become incompetent in view of	 the
provisions  contained in Sub-section (3A) of<a href="/doc/1813508/" id="a_27"> S. 13</a>. [160  G,

A. K. Sen and Sukumar Ghosh for the Appellant.
Niren De and D. N. Mukherjee for the Respondent.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
DESAI,	J.-This appeal by special leave arises from  a	suit
filed by the plaintiff respondent for eviction of  defendant
appellant  from the ground floor of premises No. 16/lA,	 Ram
Ratan  Bose  Lane,  Shyambazar,	 which	the  appellant	 was
occupying as a tenant on a monthly rent of Rs. 37/-, on	 the
ground that the respondent required the same for his own use
and occupation.	 The suit ended in a decree in favour of the
respondent  and	 was confirmed in appeal by  the  Additional
District  Judge.  The appellant thereupon  preferred  Second
Appeal to the High Court at Calcutta.  In the second  appeal
the   appellant	 sought	 permission  to	 adduce	  additional
evidence to the effect that the requirement of the  landlord
stood satisfied because he had recovered possession of	four
rooms  on the first and second floors of the same  building.
A  contention was also raised by him that the suit filed  by
the  landlord  was incompetent, it  having  been  instituted
within	a  period of three years of the acquisition  of	 his
interest  as  landlord in the premises by transfer  and	 was
accordingly  hit  by sub-section (3A) of section 13  of	 the
West  Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1956, as amended  by	 the
West  Bengal Premises Tenancy (Second Amendment) Act,  1969.
The contentions raised by the appellant in the second appeal
were  overruled	 by  the  High	Court  and  the	 appeal	 was
dismissed and the decree for eviction was affirmed.  Upon  a
certificate granted by the learned single Judge of the	High
Court the appellant preferred appeal under clause 15 of	 the
Letters	 Patent.   When the appeal under clause	 15  of	 the
Letters	 Patent	 was pending in the High  Court,  respondent
plaintiff sought and obtained leave to amend the plaint	 and
consequently   the  appellant  defendant  filed	  additional
written statement.  Thereafter the court framed fresh issues
arising from the amended pleadings as under :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	      "1.  Is  the premises  in	 dispute  reasonably
	      required	by the plaintiff-respondent for	 his
	      own  occupation and for the occupation of	 the
	      members of his family?</blockquote><pre id="pre_2">
	      2.    Is	  the	 plaintiff-respondent	  in
	      possession   of	any   reasonably    suitable
	      accommodation ?"
</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_2">Oral  and documentary evidence was permitted to	 be  adduced
and  thereafter	 the  appeal  was  set	down  for   hearing.
</blockquote><p id="p_3">Ultimately the appeal was dismissed affirming the decree for
eviction.  Hence the present appeal by special leave.
It  is an admitted position that the building of which	suit
promises form part was purchased by the landlord on  October
1,  1963  and  notice dated June 16,  1964  terminating	 the
tenancy	 was  served upon the tenant.	The  landlord  filed
title  suit No. 198 of 1964 on August 27, 1964, against	 the
tenant.

</p><p id="p_8">While upholding constitutional validity of sub-s. (3A) of<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_45"> s.
13</a>, in order to work out the mechanics of the application of
amending  provisions  to  pending actions, with	 a  view  to
avoiding  multiplicity of litigation as well as	 protraction
of  litigation it was suggested that the plaintiff  landlord
may put in fresh pleadings wherever the suit is pending	 and
the  tenant  should be given an opportunity  to	 fit,--	 his
written statement and the Court should dispose of the matter
after  giving  both  sides  the	 right	to  lead  additional
evidence.  It was observed that it would certainly be opened
to  the appellate court either to take evidence directly  or
to  call  for a finding.  Expeditious  disposal	 of  belated
litigation  will  undoubtedly be a  consideration  with	 the
Court in exercising this discretion.  The proviso to  sub-s.
(3A)  can  also be complied with if the plaintiff  gets	 the
permission  of the Rent Controller in the manner  laid	down
therein before filing his fresh pleadings.
Pursuant  to  the  decision rendered by	 this  Court  in  B.
Banerjee's  case  (supra),  the High Court  in	the  pending
Letters	 Patent Appeal permitted the plaintiff to amend	 the
plaint	whereupon  the defendant  filed	 additional  written
statement  and fresh issues were framed as hereinbefore	 set
out  and  after	 permitting the parties	 to  lead  oral	 and
documentary   evidence	the  appeal  was  disposed   of	  as
hereinabove mentioned.
</p><p id="p_9">Mr.  Niren  De	appearing for the respondent  at  one  stage
attempted to contend that to the extent sub-s. (3A) of<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_46"> s. 13</a>
is made retroactive it is ultra vires <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_47">article 19 (1) (f)</a> and
thus  he  wanted to reopen the controversy settled  by	this
Court  in B. Banerjee's case.  We were not persuaded by	 any
such  submission  and we accept the ratio in  B.  Banerjee's
case that the retroactive operation of sub-s. (3A) of<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_48"> s.  13</a>
does  not  offend  <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_49">article  19 (1)  (f)</a>	 on  the  ground  of
unreasonableness.
</p><p id="p_10">Mr. A. K. Sen learned counsel who appeared for the appellant
vigorously  contended  that the Bench hearing  appeal  under
clause 15 of the Letters Patent has no jurisdiction to	take
fresh	evidence  even	if  it	permits	 amendment  of	 the
pleadings.  While working out the mechanics consequent	upon
upholding  the	validity of sub-s. (3A) it was open  to	 the
Court  hearing	the appeal under clause 15  of	the  Letters
Patent	to  grant permission to amend the  pleadings.  By  a
catena	of decisions Order 6, Rule 17 of the Code  of  Civil
Procedure  has been interpreted to mean that leave to  amend
may  be	 granted at any stage of the proceedings  which	 may
include	 appeal or even second appeal.	But, urged Mr.	Sen,
that  the jurisdiction of the Court hearing an appeal  under
clause 15 does not extend to
11-211SCI/78
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">154</span>
taking	and appreciating evidence and recording findings  of
facts on issues that may_have to be determined arising	from
amended pleadings.  It was said that Order 41, Rules 25	 and
27  are exhaustive of the powers of the appellate  court  to
take additional evidence.  Simultaneously it was pointed out
that<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_50"> s. 100</a> prescribes the peripheral limits of the  Court's
jurisdiction while hearing a second appeal.  <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_51">Section 100</a>  as
it  stood at the relevant time permitted a second appeal  to
the  High  Court from every decree passed in appeal  by	 any
Court  subordinate  to High Court on  any  of  the_following
grounds, viz., (a) the decision being contrary to law or  to
some usage having the force of law; (b) the decision  having
failed	to  determine some material issue of  law  or  usage
having	the force of law; (c) a substantial error or  defect
in  the procedure provided by the Code or by any  other	 law
for  the  time	being  in force,  which	 may  possibly	have
produced  error or defect in the decision of the  case	upon
the merits.  It was submitted that if this is the peripheral
limit  of jurisdiction of a court hearing second appeal,  it
is just not conceivable that a Bench hearing an appeal under
clause	15 of the Letters Patent upon a certificate  granted
by the single Judge could have a wider jurisdiction than the
court hearing the second appeal.
</p><p id="p_11">There  is a near concensus amongst the various	High  Courts
that  ordinarily an appellant is not entitled in  an  appeal
under clause 15 to be heard   on points which have not	been
raised before the judge'from whose judgment  the  appeal  is
preferred.  Now, if in second appeal the findings of	fact
recorded  by the first appellate court are taken as  binding
unless fresh additional evidence is permitted to be led when
again  appreciation of evidence to record a finding of	fact
would become necessary, that position is not altered even if
amendment   of	 pleadings  is	granted	 which	 puts	into
controversy some new facts alleged in amended pleadings	 and
therefore the Court hearing the second appeal after granting
amendment  could  not take over the function  of  the  trial
court  or  the first appellate court  and  undertake  appre-
ciation of evidence and record finding,, of facts.  That  is
not the function envisaged by the Code of the Court  hearing
second appeal under<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_52"> s. 100</a>.  This becomes crystal clear from
the provision contained in<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_53"> s. 103</a> which defines the power of
the High Court to determine a question of fact while hearing
second	appeal.	 But this power of the Court is	 limited  to
evidence on record which again is sufficient to determine an
issue of fact necessary for disposal of the appeal and which
has not been determind by the lower appellate Court or which
has  been wrongly determined by such court.  When  pleadings
are  amended at the stage of the appeal under clause  15  of
the  Letters Patent and fresh allegations of facts are	thus
introduced  in the controversy which necessitate  additional
evidence  being permitted it would not be open to the  Court
to proceed to record evidence and to appreciate the evidence
and   record  findings	of  fact,  a  function	which	even
ordinarily  is hot undertaken by the High Court bearing	 the
second	appeal,	 much less can it be done while	 hearing  an
appeal	under  clause  15 of the Letters  Patent.   When  on
account	 of  a subsequent change in law,  amendment  of	 the
pleadings  is  granted which raises  disputed  questions  of
fact, the situation would not be one governed by Order
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">155</span>
41, r. 27.     At  that stage it could not be said that	 the
appellate court is permitting production    of	  additional
evidence, oral or documentary on the ground  that the  court
from  whose  decree the appeal is preferred has	 refused  to
adduce	evidence  which ought to have been admitted  or	 the
appellate court requires any documents to be produced or any
witness	 to be examined to enable it to pronounce  judgment.
Not would the situation be one which could be covered  under
the expression "other substantial cause".  Once pleading are
permitted  to be amended which bring into  focus  altogether
new  or	 fresh disputed questions of fact which have  to  be
resolved  on additional evidence that would be necessary  to
be led, the function is one of appreciation of evidence more
appropriately to be undertaken by the trial court or at	 the
most  the  first  appellate court but  not  the	 High  Court
hearing	 the second appeal or an appeal under clause  15  of
the  Letters Patent.  It is not for a moment suggested	that
at  the	 stage at which leave to amend	pleadings  has	been
granted	 the  High Court was not competent  to	grant  it.In
fact,  in  an  identical situation  in	B.  Banerjee's	case
(supra) 'this  Court  had in terms indicated that  to  avoid
hardship to the plaintiff     landlord the appropriate thing
would  be to grant leave to amend the pleading and  five  an
equal  opportunity to the defendant to controvert if lie  so
chooses	 what  the plaintiff contends by  amended  pleading.
But   once  that  is  done  immediately	 the   question	  of
jurisdiction of the court hearing the appeal under clause 15
of  the	 Letters Patent would arise and if  the	 appeal	 was
entertained against the judgment rendered by the High  Court
in  second appeal the limitations on the power of  the	High
Court  hearing the second appeal will ipso facto  limit	 and
circumscribe  the jurisdiction of the appellate	 Bench.	  If
the  High Court while hearing second appeal, conceding	that
it  could  have	 allowed amendment of  pleading,  where	 the
amended pleadings substantially ;raise disputed questions of
fact which need resolution afresh after additional evidence,
could  not undertake the exercise of recording evidence	 and
appreciating  it and recording findings of fact,  but  would
appropriately remand the case to the trial court, the  Bench
hearing	 the  appeal against the judgment in  second  appeal
could  Pot  enlarge  its  jurisdiction	by-undertaking	that
forbidden exercise.  It would, therefore, appear that when a
Bench of a High Court is hearing an appeal ;preferred upon a
certificate granted under clause 15 of the Letters Patent by
a  single  judge of the High Court who by his  judgment	 has
disposed  of the second appeal the appellate bench would  be
subject	 to the limitation on its power and jurisdiction  to
appreciate or reappreciate evidence and to record finding of
fact  which were never raised before the trial court or	 the
first appellate court as the pleadings were permitted to  be
amended by it and the question was raised for the first time
before	it,  to the same extent as the	High  Court  hearing
second	appeal	with constraints of ss. 100 and 103  of	 the
Code.	It  must  be distinctly	 understood  that  admitting
evidence  is  entirely different from  appreciating  it	 and
acting upon it.	 The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council
in  <a href="/doc/744766/" id="a_54">Indrajit  Pratap  Sahi  v. Amar  Singh  &amp;  Ors</a>.,(1)	 was
concerned  with the ambit of jurisdiction of  the  appellate
court to admit evidence under Order 41, r. 27.	It was	held
that the jurisdic-
</p><p id="p_12">(1)  Law Reports 50 I.A. 183.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">156</span>
<p id="p_13">tion  can  be exercised at the instance of a party  and	 the
Judicial Committee has unrestricted power to admit documents
where  sufficient grounds have been shown for  their  having
not  been produced at the initial stage of  the	 litigation.
This  view  was affirmed by this Court in <a href="/doc/438234/" id="a_55">Surinder  Kumar  &amp;
Ors.  v. Gian Chand &amp; Ors</a>.(1) But that has no  relevance  to
the situation under discussion here.
</p><p id="p_14">Mr. De, however, contended that the appellant had agreed  or
in fact had never objected to the appellate Bench  examining
witnesses and recording findings of fact on appreciation  of
evidence and that it would not now be open to the  appellant
to  resile  from  the  position adopted by  him	 and  he  is
estopped  from doing it.  This contention raises  the  vexed
question whether consent can confer jurisdiction on a  court
which  lacks  inherent	jurisdiction.  If  the	Court  lacks
inherent  jurisdiction	no  amount  of	consent	 can  confer
jurisdiction.	This is settled by a long line of  decisions
commencing  from Ledgard v. Bull, (2) wherein  the  Judicial
Committee  was	examining the question	whether	 a  District
Judge  could  entertain a suit complaining  infringement  of
patent not upon institution before him but by transfer	from
the Court of the subordinate Judge where it was	 instituted.
It was accepted that if the suit was instituted in the court
of the District Judge, the Distt.  Judge had jurisdiction to
entertain  it  but a very narrow and  limited  question	 was
examined  whether  the Distt.  Judge could entertain  it  on
transfer  from the Court of the Subordinate Judge.   It	 was
also  pointed  out  that  the defendant	 who  had  raised  a
contention  as to the jurisdiction of the Distt.   Judge  to
hear the suit had given his positive consent to the transfer
of  the	 suit.	Even then the Judicial,	 Committee  held  as
under :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">	      "The District Judge was perfectly competent to
	      entertain	 and  try  the	suit,  if  it	were
	      competently  brought, and their  Lordships  do
	      not  doubt that, in such a case,	a  defendant
	      may  be  barred,	by  his	 own  conduct,	from
	      objecting to irregularities in the institution
	      of  the suit.  When the Judge has no  inherent
	      jurisdiction  over  the  subject-matter  of  a
	      suit,  the  parties cannot,  by  their  mutual
	      consent,	convert	 it into a  proper  judicial
	      process,	although  they	may  constitute	 the
	      Judge  their  arbiter,  and be  bound  by	 his
	      decision	 on  the  merits  when	 these	 are
	      submitted to him'.
</blockquote><p id="p_15">Consent	 in  such a situation could not	 be  interpreted  as
waiver	of  the objection nor could it	confer	jurisdiction
where-	the Court inherently lacked jurisdiction to try	 the
suit.
</p><p id="p_16">This  very principle was reaffirmed in Meenakshi  Naidoo  V.
Subramamya  Sastri,(3)	wherein	 the High  Court  in  appeal
against	 the order of the District-Judge had set  aside	 the
order  of the Distt.  Judge appointing the appellant on	 the
Committee of the Pagode in the Madras Presidency.  When	 the
matter was before the High Court it was never

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">157</span>
<p id="p_19">contended  that	 the  appeal  was  incompetent	and  such  a
contention was raised before the Judicial Committee for	 the
first  time.   Following  the decision in  Ledgard  v.	Bull
(supra),  it  was held that when the Judge has	no  inherent
jurisdiction over the subject matter of a suit, the  parties
cannot	by  their mutual consent convert it  into  a  proper
judicial  process,  although they may constitute  the  Judge
their  arbiter, and be bound by his decision on	 the  merits
when these are submitted to him.  Therefore, the failure  on
the  part  of  the appellant to object	to  the	 High  Court
hearing	 an  appeal under clause 15 of	the  Letters  Patent
taking	oral  evidence in respect of the  amended  pleadings
would not cloth the Bench with jurisdiction to record  fresh
oral evidence and proceed to Appreciate the same and  record
findings of facts.
</p><p id="p_20">Mr. De next contended that the contention now raised by	 the
appellant  is not open to him in view of the  limited  leave
granted by this Court under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_56">Article 136</a> of the Constitution.
While granting special leave to appeal against the  judgment
of the Division Bench of the High Court, this Court made  an
order as under :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">	      "Special	leave  is granted  limited  only  to
	      grounds  Nos.  2 and 5 of	 the  special  leave
	      petition."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">	      Grounds Nos. 2 and 5 are as under
	      "2. For that the impugned judgment of the High
	      Court  is	 vitiated by manifest error  in	 law
	      that  by granting amendment of plaint on	July

	      the  suit premises by the landlord,  the	suit
	      can be taken out of the mandatory	 prohibition

	      the provisions of sub-section (3A) of  <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_57">section
	      13</a> of the Act should be vacated."
</blockquote><p id="p_21">A    very  narrow,  literal  and  verbal  interpretation  of
grounds	 Nos.  and  5  may prima  facie	 indicate  that	 the
question in terms now raised would not be covered by  ground
either 2 or 5.But it would not be proper to put tomorrow  an
interpretation on the language employed in grounds nos. 2
and 5. When leave is limited to certain grounds it would  no
the  appropriate  to  put  a  very  narrow  and	 grammatical
construction  of  the  grounds as if we	 were  construing  a
statute	 or  some  rule, regulation or	order  of  a  public
authority.   More often it is our experience  while  hearing
applications  for  special  leave that grounds	set  out  in
special	 leave application are overlapping and fairly  often
repeated, and even occasionally vague.	Therefore, as far as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">158</span>
possible, the grounds should not be very strictly  construed
or  should not be construed in such a manner as to make	 the
special	 leave grant-ed under Article.	136  self-defeating.
Attempt	 of  the  Court must be to find	 out  what  was	 the
grievance or contention that was being put, forth before the
Court which appealed to the Court in granting special  leave
under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_58">Article 136.</a>  <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_59">Article 136</a> confers power on this  Court
in its discretion to grant special leave from any  judgment,
decree,	 determination,	 sentence or order in  any  case  or
matter,	 passed	 or  made by any court or  tribunal  in	 the
territory  of  India.	Ordinarily  once  special  leave  is
granted	 it is against the judgment, decree, etc.   However,
by practice this Court sometimes limits the leave to certain
specific: points.   If	the  leave is  limited	to  specific
points, obviously the whole case is	not open before	 the
Court hearing the appeal. <a href="/doc/1319429/" id="a_60">In Nafe Singh &amp; Anr.	  v.   State
of  Haryana</a>,(1) this Court declined to examine the  question
whether on evidence the case was proved to the	satisfaction
of  the	 Court,	 because special leave was  limited  to	 the
question of sentence.  Similarly, in <a href="/doc/6060506/" id="a_61">Jagdev Singh &amp; Anr.  v.
State  of Punjab</a>,(-) leave was limited to the  applicability
of  the	 Probation of Offienders Act  and  accordingly	this
Court did not permit enlargement of the leave observing that
the  scope  of	the leave was confined	to  the	 limitations
specified  in the order granting special leave and will	 not
be   enlarged  for  considering	 the  correctness   of	 the
conviction  for	 the particular offence.  It  was,  however,
urged that where a certificate is granted by the high  Court
under <a href="/doc/1325025/" id="a_62">Article 133</a> specifying the question of law in  respect
of  which  the certificate is granted, this  Court  did	 not
limit  the  scope  of  the  appeal  to	the  terms  of	 the
certificate.   <a href="/doc/388201/" id="a_63">In  Addagada Raghavamma &amp;  Anr.	v.  Addagada
Chenchamma   &amp;	Anr</a>.(3),  while	 negativing  a	 preliminary
objections to the effect that the certificate granted by the
High Court under <a href="/doc/1011888/" id="a_64">Article 133(1)</a> must govern the scope of the
appeal	 to  the  Supreme  Court  for  otherwise  the	said
certificate  would  become otiose, the Court held  that	 the
terms  of the certificate did not circumscribe the scope  of
the  appeal  and once a proper certificate  is	granted	 the
Supreme Court undoubtedly has power as a court of appeal to,
consider  the correctness of the decision  appealed  against
from  everystand point whether of questions of fact or	law.
It was held that if the certificate is good, the  provisions
of  <a href="/doc/1325025/" id="a_65">Article 133</a> did not confine the scope of the  appeal  to
the  certificate.  This decision cannot help  the  appellant
because when a certificate is granted under <a href="/doc/1011888/" id="a_66">Article 133	 (1)</a>
as. it stood prior to the Constitution (Thirtieth Amendment)
Act,  1972,  an	 appeal lay to the Supreme  Court  from	 any
judgment,  decree  or  final'  order,  if  the	High   Court
certified  the case falling under clauses (a), (b)  or	(c).
Once a certificate is granted this Court undoubtedly has the
power  as a Court of Appeal to consider the  correctness  of
the decision appealed against from every standpoint  whether
on  questions  of  fact or law.	 It may in  its	 wisdom	 not
interfere with the concurrent findings of fact but there  is
no  bar to its jurisdiction from interfering with the  same.
But  when an appeal is preferred under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_67">Article 136</a>  and	 the
leave  is  limited  to the specific grounds,  the  scope  of
appeal cannot be

<p id="p_24">enlarged  so as to extend beyond what is permissible  to  be
urged  in  support  of the grounds to  which  the  leave  is
limited.   Undoubtedly, therefore, the scope of	 the  appeal
would  be  limited to the grounds in respect  of  which	 the
leave  is  granted, but having said this, it  must  be	made
distinctly clear that the grounds must be broadly  construed
to ascertain the real question raised therein and not in  it
narrow	or pedantic manner by literal interpretation of	 the
language used.
</p><p id="p_25">Again, it must be borne in mind that, although, an order  of
this  Court  confining special leave under  <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_68">article  136</a>  to
certain points would imply a rejection of it so far as other
points	are concerned, yet, this Court as  a  constitutional
power  under <a href="/doc/249731/" id="a_69">article 137</a> of reviewing its own  order.	This
power  may,  in very exceptional cases,	 consistently  with,
rules  made  under <a href="/doc/1537130/" id="a_70">article 145</a> of the  Constitution,  be  so
exercised,  in	the interests of justice, as to	 expand	 the
leave  itself  subject	to due	notice	to  the	 respondents
concerned  that fair opportunity to meet the results  of  an
extension of grounds of appeal.,
The  appellant tenant was substantially contending  that  in
view  of the introduction of sub-section (3A) of<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_71"> s. 13</a>,	 the
suit  when instituted was incompetent and that on  a  proper
construction of<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_72"> s. 17E</a> introduced in the parent Act by s.  4
of  the West Bengal Premises Tenancy (Complete)	 Act,  1970,
the decree would be unenforceable.  The contention was	that
by  amendment  of  pleading  a	suit  when  instituted	 was
incompetent, should not have been rendered competent.	From
that springs the question about the court's jurisdiction  to
deal with the suit subsequent to amendment of pleadings.  If
it is one compact ground it can be said that the  contention
raised herein, if not explicit, would certainly be  implicit
in  the grounds limited to which special leave	was  granted
and, therefore, we cannot refuse to entertain it.
 It was lastly urged that ultimately whether the High  Court
should	appreciate the evidence and record findings of	fact
or  remand  it to, the trial Court is a	 matter	 within	 the
discretion of the High Court and that if the High Court	 has
exercised  the	discretion one way, this  Court	 should	 not
interfere with the same.  It was further said that rules  of
procedure are not made for the, purpose of hindering justice
but for advancing substantial justice.	It was, further said
that  the  appellant tenant was given  full  opportunity  to
produce his evidence and had the benefit of. appreciation of
evidence by a Bench of two judges of the High Court and that
it would be paying undue and undeserved respect to the rules
of  procedure to remand the matter at this stage.  Once	 the
amendment  is allowed, the basic approach to the suit  would
undergo a change.  Sub-section (3A) of<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_73"> s. 13</a> bars a suit for
eviction on any of the grounds mentioned in clauses (f)	 and
(ff)  of  sub-s. (1) of<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_74"> s. 13</a> for a period  of	three  years
since  the  acquisition	 of  interest  by  landlord  in	 the
premises.  The suit should, therefore, have been filed three
years after the purchase of property by the respondent.	 The
respondent  would  have	 been then required to	show  as  to
whether	 he required the premises and whether he  had  other
reasonably  suitable accommodation.  The enquiry would	have
been  related  to  the time when the suit  could  have	been
competently instituted.	 After focusing attention on this
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">160</span>
point, the trial court would appreciate evidence, and record
findings  of  fact  which can be  reexamined  by  the  first
appellate  court being the final court of facts.  This	very
opportunity  was  denied  to, the  appellant  by  the  Bench
arrogating the jurisdiction to itself to record evidence and
to  proceed to appreciate the same and reach conclusions  of
fact which become final.  Therefore, considerable  prejudice
was caused to the appellant by the procedure followed by the
court and this Court will be amply justified in	 interfering
with the same.	Ile remand, there fore, is inevitable.
Before	concluding  the	 judgment, we  must  advert  to	 one
contention  raised  by Mr. De for the  respondent.   It	 was
urged  that  the  appellant tenant leaving  failed  to	take
advantage  of<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_75"> s. 17E</a> introduced-by the West Bengal  Premises
Tenancy	 Amendment (Complete) Act, 1970, it is not  open  to
him to challenge the decree of eviction passed against	him.
By <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_76"> s. 17E</a> power was conferred upon the court to  set  aside
certain	 decrees  passed  in  suits  brought  by  transferee
landlords  within three years of the date of  transfer.	  In
fast this was the necessary corollary of the introduction of
sub-s. (3A) in<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_77"> s. 13</a> and making it 'retroactive.  There	 may
be tenants against whom decree- for eviction was made at the
instance  of  transferee  landlords  whose  suits  would  be
otherwise  incompetent	in view of sub-s. (3A.)	 of <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_78"> s.	 13</a>.
Now, it may be that even though the decree for eviction	 was
passed	by  the	 Court, the tenant  may	 have  continued  in
possession  because some proceedings may be pending  or	 for
some other reason.  In such a situation, upon an application
made by the tenant within a period of 60 days, from the date
of commencement of the <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_79">Amending Act</a>, the Court was  required
to  set	 aside	the decree for	eviction.   When  appeal  is
pending	 it  would  Pe	open to	 the  tenant  to  raise	 the
contention  that the suit has become incompetent, but  where
the  appeal is not pending or an execution  application	 is-
pending	 and the tenant is still not physically evicted,  it
would  be  open to him to take advantage of  the  provisions
contained in<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_80"> s. 17E</a>.  The present appellant appears to	have
made  an application purporting to be under<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_81"> S. 17E</a>  on	25th
April 1970 in the Court of Additional Munsif at Sealdah.  On
this  application  notice was ordered to be  issued  to	 the
other side.  Notice of the application appears to have	been
refused by the respondent looking to the order sheet of	 the
learned	 Munsif dated 9th September 1970.  This was  treated
as proper service and the present appellant was directed  to
take  steps to produce certain unpunched  court-fee  stamps.
The appellant appears to have failed to take necessary steps
and  the application was rejected for want  of	prosecution.
It  was contended that once the appellant applied  under <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_82"> S.
17E</a> for setting aside the decree of eviction, the decree has
become	binding	 and it is not open to him to  question	 the
correctness  of	 the  decree.  There is no  merit-  in	this
connection  because  the  appeal in  which  the	 decree	 was
questioned was still pending.  The provision contained in<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_83"> S.
17E</a> provides an additional remedy covering classes of  cases
of  tenants  against whom decree for eviction was  made	 but
there  was  no pending appeal against the  decree.   If	 the
submission  of Mr. De is accepted, the provisions  contained
in<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_84"> S. 17E</a> would be rendered nugatory.  We specifically asked
Mr. De a question as to what would
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">161</span>
be  the position where a decree for eviction is made on	 two
grounds,  one under<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_85"> s. 13(1)</a> (f) and the other	under  other
provisions of<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_86"> s. 13</a> and the appeal of the tenant is pending.
Would the appeal become incompetent if the-.tenant does	 not
apply  under<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_87"> s. 17E</a> ? If the tenant applies under<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_88"> s. 17E</a>  he
can get relief on the only ground that the decree was on the
ground	mentioned in clause (f) of sub-s. (1) of<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_89"> s.  13</a>	 and
not  the  other	 grounds because relief	 was  sought  to  be
granted	 by  the  provisions contained in<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_90"> s.  17E</a>  to  those
tenants	 against whom decree for eviction was made under <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_91"> s.
13(1)</a>  (f).   Would the appeal in such	a  situation  become
incompetent in part and remain competent for the other	part
?  Therefore,  it  could not be said that  once	 a  specific
remedy	under<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_92"> s. 17E</a> is provided for the benefit of  tenants
under  a decree for eviction on the ground mentioned  in <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_93"> s.
13(1)</a>  (f),  that is the only way and no other in  which  he
could	get  relief.   If  so,	his  appeal   would   become
incompetent.   Remedy under<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_94"> s. 17E</a> is an additional  remedy.
More  particularly  it	appears for  the  benefit  of  those
tenants	 against whom decree for eviction was made under <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_95"> s.
13</a>  (1) (f) and appeal by whom was not pending so that	they
could protect themselves against eviction by landlords whose
suits  had  become  incompetent in view	 of  the  provisions
contained in sub-s. (3A) of<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_96"> s. 13</a>.
</p><p id="p_26">Accordingly,  this  appeal  is allowed and  the	 decree	 for
eviction made by all the Courts against the appellant is set
aside and the suit is remanded to the trial court to proceed
further	 from the stage after amendments of  pleadings	were
granted	 by  the  High Court and the  relevant	issues	were
framed	 pursuant   to	the  amended  pleadings.    In	 the
circumstances  of  this case there shall be no order  as  to
costs of appeal in this Court.
