<p id="p_1">P.Sathasivam,J.
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">1)    Leave granted.
2)    These appeals are filed against the common final  judgment  and  order
</pre><p id="p_2">dated 17/18.03.2010 passed by the High Court  of  Judicature  at  Bombay  in
Criminal Appeal Nos. 287 and 288 of 2009 whereby  the  Division  Bench  held
that the complaint under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_1">Section 138</a>  of  the  Negotiable  Instruments  Act,
1881 (in short “the  Act”)  without  signature  is  maintainable  when  such
complaint was subsequently verified by the complainant.
</p><p id="p_3">3)    Brief facts:
</p><p id="p_4">(a)   Indra Kumar Patodia  and  Mahendra  Kumar  Patodia  –  the  appellants
herein are accused in Criminal  Complaint  being  CC  No.  1866/SS  of  2007
(1866/MISC/1998) filed before the 16th  Court  of  Metropolitan  Magistrate,
Ballard Estate, Bombay, for the offence punishable under  <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_2">Section  138</a>  read
with <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_3">Sections 141</a> and <a href="/doc/595945/" id="a_4">142</a>  of  the  Act.     Respondent  No.3  herein  is  a
Company duly registered under  the  <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_5">Companies  Act</a>,  1956,  presently  under
liquidation and official liquidator has been appointed by  the  High  Court,
which has alleged to have issued the cheques to respondent No.1.
</p><p id="p_5">(b)   Respondent No.1 is the complainant and the manufacturers of  Partially
Oriented Yarn (POY) and other textile goods.  From time to time,  Respondent
No. 3 used to place orders for the supply of POY to  Respondent  No.  1  and
had issued 57 cheques between 02.12.1997 to 09.03.1998 for  the  payment  of
the same.
</p><p id="p_6">(c)   The aforesaid cheques were deposited by the complainant on  05.04.1998
and were returned by  the  Bank  on  06.04.1998  with  the  remark  “exceeds
arrangement”.  Pursuant to the same, Respondent No.1 issued a  notice  dated
16.04.1998 to the appellants and demanded the  aforesaid  amount  for  which
they  replied  that  they  have  not  received  any  statement  of  accounts
maintained by the complainant regarding the transactions with  the  accused.
In addition to the same, Respondent  No.3,  vide  letter  dated  29.05.1998,
made various claims for the rate difference, discounts etc., in  respect  of
the transactions, however, Respondent No.1 filed a complaint  on  03.06.1998
being Complaint No. 1866/SS of 2007 (1866/MISC/1998) under <a href="/doc/1824845/" id="a_6">Section 138</a>  read
with <a href="/doc/1225786/" id="a_7">Sections 141</a> and <a href="/doc/594692/" id="a_8">142</a> of the  Act.    On  30.07.1998,  the  Metropolitan
Magistrate recorded the verification statement and  issued  summons  against
the appellants and respondent No.3 herein.
</p><p id="p_7">(d)   The appellants preferred an application  being  C.C.  No.  1332/9/1999
before the Metropolitan Magistrate, 33rd Court,  Ballard  Pier,  Mumbai  for
recalling the process issued against them. By order  dated  28.08.2003,  the
Metropolitan Magistrate, dismissed the said application.
</p><p id="p_8">(e)   Challenging the said order, the appellants and respondent No.3  herein
filed an application in the Court of Sessions for Greater Bombay  at  Bombay
bearing Criminal Revision Application No.  749  of  2003.   By  Order  dated
08.10.2004, the  Sessions  Judge  dismissed  the  said  application  as  not
maintainable.
</p><p id="p_9">(f)   By order dated 26.11.2008, the Metropolitan Magistrate  dismissed  the
complaint and acquitted the accused persons.
</p><p id="p_10">(g)   Challenging the acquittal of  the  accused  persons,  respondent  No.1
herein-the complainant, filed appeals being Criminal  Appeal  Nos.  287  and
288 of 2009 before the learned single Judge of the High Court.  The  learned
single  Judge,  by  order  dated  09.07.2009,  referred   two   points   for
consideration by the larger Bench, viz.,  (1) In  the  matter  of  complaint
for the offence  punishable  under  <a href="/doc/1824845/" id="a_9">Section  138</a>  of  the  Act  whether  the
complaint without the signature of the complainant, inspite of  verification
of complaint, is “non-entia” and whether no  prosecution  can  lie  on  such
complaint?; and (2) If answer to point No.1 is negative then whether  it  is
a mere irregularity and it  can  be  cured  subsequently  and  whether  such
subsequent amendment would  relate  back  to  the  date  of  filing  of  the
complaint or whether it would hit by the Law of Limitation.
</p><p id="p_11">(h)   By impugned common judgment dated 17/18.03.2010,  the  Division  Bench
of the High Court, disposed of the matter by answering  point  No.1  in  the
affirmative holding that the complaint under  <a href="/doc/1824845/" id="a_10">Section  138</a>  of  the  Act  is
maintainable and  when  such  complaint  is  subsequently  verified  by  the
complainant and the process is issued by the Magistrate after  verification,
it  cannot  be  said  that  the  said  complaint  is  “non-entia”  and   the
prosecution of such complaint is maintainable.    Further, it was held  that
since the answer to point No.1 was in affirmative, it was not  necessary  to
decide point No.2 and directed to place the appeals for  deciding  the  same
on merits.
</p><p id="p_12">(i)   Aggrieved by the said decision, the appellants have  filed  the  above
appeals by way of special leave before this Court.
</p><p id="p_13">4)    Heard Mr. Bhagwati Prasad, learned senior counsel for  the  appellants
and Mr. Uday U. Lalit, learned senior  counsel   for  respondent  No.1,  Ms.
Asha Gopalan Nair, learned counsel for  respondent  No.2  and  Ms.  Sangeeta
Kumar, learned counsel for respondent No.3.
</p><p id="p_14">5)    Mr. Bhagwati Prasad, learned senior counsel for the  appellants  after
taking us through the relevant provisions of the <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_11">Negotiable Instrument  Act</a>,
1881, the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short  ‘the  Code’)  and  the
order of the learned single Judge as well as the reference answered  by  the
Division Bench raised the following contentions:
</p><p id="p_15">i)    the complaint under <a href="/doc/686130/" id="a_12">Section 141</a> in  respect  of  dishonour  of  cheque
under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_13">Section 138</a> of the Act without signature of  the  complainant  is  not
maintainable;
</p><p id="p_16">ii)   there is  no  provision  in  the  Act  regarding  verification.   Even
otherwise, the verification was signed by the complainant  after  expiry  of
the limitation period,  hence,  the  impugned  complaint  is  liable  to  be
rejected; and
</p><p id="p_17">iii)  inasmuch as the Act is a special Act, it must prevail over  procedures
provided in the Code.
</p><p id="p_18">On the other hand, Mr. Lalit, learned  senior  counsel  for  the  contesting
first  respondent-the  complainant  contended  that  in  the  light  of  the
language used in <a href="/doc/328668/" id="a_14">Section 2(d)</a> read with various provisions of the  Code  and
<a href="/doc/595945/" id="a_15">Section 142</a> of the Act, the complaint, as filed  and  duly  verified  before
the  Magistrate  and  putting   signature   therein,   satisfies   all   the
requirements.  He further submitted that  the  conclusion  of  the  Division
Bench upholding the complaint and the issuance of summons for appearance  of
the accused are valid and prayed for dismissal of the above appeals.
</p><p id="p_19">6)    We have carefully considered the rival  submissions  and  perused  all
the relevant materials.
</p><p id="p_20">7)    From the  rival  contentions,  the  only  question  for  consideration
before this Court is that whether the complaint  without  signature  of  the
complainant  under  <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_16">Section  138</a>  of  the  Act  is  maintainable  when  such
complaint is verified by the complainant and the process is  issued  by  the
Magistrate after verification.
</p><p id="p_21">8)    The word “complaint” has been defined in  Section  2(d)  of  the  Code
which reads thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      “2 (d) “complaint” means any allegation made orally or in writing to a
      Magistrate, with a view to his taking action  under  this  Code,  that
      some person, whether known or unknown, has committed an  offence,  but
      does not include a police report.”

Keeping the above definition in mind, let us see the scheme of  the  statute
and the legislative intent in bringing the Act.
</blockquote><p id="p_22">9)    <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_17">The Act</a> was amended by  Banking,  Public  Financial  Institutions  and
<a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_18">Negotiable Instruments Laws (Amendment Act</a>) 1988 wherein  new  Chapter  XVII
was incorporated for penalties in  case  of  dishonour  of  cheques  due  to
insufficiency of funds in the account of the drawer of  the  cheque.   These
provisions were incorporated in order to encourage the  culture  of  use  of
cheques and enhancing the credibility of the instrument.  The  insertion  of
the new Chapter and amendments in the Act are aimed  at  early  disposal  of
cases relating to dishonour of cheques, enhancing punishment for  offenders,
introducing electronic image of a truncated  cheque  and  a  cheque  in  the
electronic form as well as exempting  an  official  nominees  director  from
prosecution under the Act.  For our purpose,  <a href="/doc/595945/" id="a_19">Section  142</a>  of  the  Act  is
relevant which reads thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">      “142. Cognizance of offences.- Notwithstanding anything  contained  in
      the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974)-
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">      (a) no court shall take cognizance of  any  offence  punishable  under
      <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_20">section 138</a> except upon a complaint, in writing, made by the payee or,
      as the case may be, the holder in due course of the cheque;
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      (b) such complaint is made within one month of the date on  which  the
      cause of action arises under clause (c) of the proviso to <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_21">section 138</a>:
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">            Provided that the cognizance of a complaint may be taken by  the
      Court after the prescribed period, if the  complainant  satisfies  the
      Court that he had sufficient cause for not making a  complaint  within
      such period.</blockquote>


<p id="p_23">      (c) no court inferior to  that  of  a  Metropolitan  Magistrate  or  a
      Judicial  Magistrate  of  the  first  class  shall  try  any   offence
      punishable under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_22">section 138</a>.”

As pointed out, the controversy in our case,  concentrates  on  construction
of <a href="/doc/1779303/" id="a_23">Section 142(a)</a> of the Act  and  in  particular  phrase  “a  complaint  in
writing”  employed  therein.   It  provides  that  notwithstanding  anything
contained in the Code,  no  Court  shall  take  cognizance  of  any  offence
punishable under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_24">Section  138</a>  of  the  Act  except  upon  a  “complaint  in
writing” made by the payee or as the case may be the holder  in  due  course
of the cheque.  The important question in the instant case is what is  meant
by  ‘complaint  in  writing’.   Whether  complaint  should  be  in   writing
simpliciter or complaint being in  writing  requires  signature  below  such
writing.
</p><p id="p_24">10)   The object and scope of <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_25">Sections 138</a> and  <a href="/doc/595945/" id="a_26">142</a>  of  the  Act  has  been
considered by this Court in <a href="/doc/1070947/" id="a_27">Pankajbhai Nagjibhai Patel vs. State of  Gujarat
and Another</a>, (2001) 2 SCC 595.  In that case,  Judicial  Magistrate  of  the
First Class, after convicting an accused for an offence  under  <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_28">Section  138</a>
of the Act sentenced him to imprisonment for six months along  with  a  fine
of Rs.83,000/-  The conviction and sentence were confirmed by  the  Sessions
Judge in  appeal  and  the  revision  filed  by  the  convicted  person  was
dismissed by the High Court.  When the SLP was moved, the  counsel  confined
his contention to the question whether a Judicial Magistrate  of  the  First
Class could have imposed sentence of fine beyond Rs. 5,000/- in view of  the
limitation contained in Section 29(2) of the Code.  Learned counsel for  the
respondent contended  the  decision  of  this  Court  in  <a href="/doc/529907/" id="a_29">K.  Bhaskaran  vs.
Sankaran Vaidhyan Balan</a>, (1999) 7 SCC  510  to  the  effect  that  power  of
Judicial Magistrate of First Class is limited in the matter  of  imposing  a
sentence of fine of Rs. 5,000/- is not correct in view of the  non  obstante
clause contained in  <a href="/doc/595945/" id="a_30">Section  142</a>  of  the  Act.   After  hearing  both  the
parties, this Court held that <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_31">Section 138</a> of the Act provides punishment  as
imprisonment for a term which may extend to  one  year  or  fine  which  may
extend to twice the amount of cheque or with both.   Section  29(2)  of  the
Code contains limitation for a Magistrate of First Class in  the  matter  of
imposing fine as a sentence or as part of sentence.  After  quoting  Section
29(2) of the Code as well  as  <a href="/doc/595945/" id="a_32">Section  142</a>  of  the  Act,  this  Court  has
concluded thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">      “6. It is clear that the aforesaid non obstante expression is intended
      to operate only in respect of three aspects,  and  nothing  more.  The
      first is this: Under the Code a Magistrate can take cognizance  of  an
      offence either upon receiving a complaint, or upon a police report, or
      upon receiving information from any person, or upon his own  knowledge
      except in the cases differently indicated in Chapter XIV of the  Code.
      But <a href="/doc/595945/" id="a_33">Section 142</a> of the NI Act says that insofar as the  offence  under
      <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_34">Section 138</a> is concerned no court shall take cognizance except upon  a
      complaint made by the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">      7. The second is this: Under the Code a complaint could be made at any
      time subject to the provisions of Chapter XXXVI. But  so  far  as  the
      offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_35">Section 138</a> of the NI Act is  concerned  such  complaint
      shall be made within one month of the cause of action.  The  third  is
      this: Under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_36">Article 511</a> of the First Schedule  of  the  Code,  if  the
      offence is punishable with imprisonment for less than 3 years or  with
      fine only under any enactment (other than<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_37"> the Indian Penal Code</a>)  such
      offence can be tried by any Magistrate. Normally <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_38">Section 138</a> of the NI
      Act which is punishable with a maximum sentence  of  imprisonment  for
      one year would have fallen within the scope of the said  Article.  But
      <a href="/doc/595945/" id="a_39">Section 142</a> of the NI Act says that for the offence under <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_40">Section 138</a>,
      no court inferior to that of a  Metropolitan  Magistrate  or  Judicial
      Magistrate of the First Class shall try the said offence.</blockquote>


<p id="p_25">      8. Thus, the non obstante limb provided in <a href="/doc/595945/" id="a_41">Section 142</a> of the  NI  Act
      is not intended to expand the powers of  a  Magistrate  of  the  First
      Class beyond what is fixed in Chapter III of  the  Code.  <a href="/doc/1339321/" id="a_42">Section  29</a>,
      which falls within Chapter III of the Code, contains  a  limit  for  a
      Magistrate of the First Class in the matter of imposing a sentence  as
      noticed above i.e. if the sentence is imprisonment it shall not exceed
      3 years and if the sentence is  fine  (even  if  it  is  part  of  the
      sentence) it shall not exceed Rs 5000.”


</p><p id="p_26">11)   It is also relevant to refer a decision  of  this  Court  in  <a href="/doc/1438532/" id="a_43">M.M.T.C.
Ltd. and Another vs. Medchl Chemicals  and  Pharma  (P)  Ltd.  and  Another</a>,
(2002) 1 SCC 234.  The question in that decision  was  whether  a  complaint
filed in the name and on behalf of  the  company  by  its  employee  without
necessary authorization  is  maintainable.   After  analyzing  the  relevant
provisions and language used in <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_44">Sections 138</a> and <a href="/doc/1779303/" id="a_45">142(a)</a>  of  the  Act,  this
Court held that such  complaint  is  maintainable  and  held  that  want  of
authorization can be rectified even  at  a  subsequent  stage.   This  Court
further clarified that the only eligibility criteria prescribed  by  <a href="/doc/595945/" id="a_46">Section
142</a> is that the complaint must be by the payee or the holder in due  course.
 This Court held that this criteria is satisfied as the complaint is in  the
name and on behalf of the appellant-Company.  It was further held that  even
presuming, that initially there was no authority, still the company can,  at
any stage, rectify the defect.  It was further held  that  at  a  subsequent
stage the company can send a  person  who  is  competent  to  represent  the
company and concluded that the complaint could thus not  have  been  quashed
on this ground.
</p><p id="p_27">12)   It is clear that the non obstante clause has to  be  given  restricted
meaning and when the section containing the said clause does  not  refer  to
any particular provisions which intends to  over  ride  but  refers  to  the
provisions of the statute generally, it is not permissible to hold  that  it
excludes the whole Act and stands all alone  by  itself.   In  other  words,
there requires to be a determination as  to  which  provisions  answers  the
description and  which  does  not.   While  interpreting  the  non  obstante
clause, the  Court  is  required  to  find  out  the  extent  to  which  the
legislature intended to do so and the context  in  which  the  non  obstante
clause is used.  We have already referred to the definition of complaint  as
stated in <a href="/doc/915147/" id="a_47">Section 2(d)</a> of the Code which provides that the same needs to  be
in oral or in writing.  The non obstante clause, when it refers to<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_48"> the  Code</a>
only excludes the oral part in such definition.
</p><p id="p_28">13)   According to  us,  the  non  obstante  clause  in  <a href="/doc/1779303/" id="a_49">Section  142(a)</a>  is
restricted to exclude two things only from<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_50"> the Code</a> i.e.  (a)  exclusion  of
oral complaints and (b) exclusion of  cognizance  on  complaint  by  anybody
other than the payee or the holder in due course.   <a href="/doc/276703/" id="a_51">Section 190</a> of the  Code
provides that  a  Magistrate  can  take  cognizance  on  a  complaint  which
constitutes such an offence irrespective of who had made such  complaint  or
on a police report or upon receiving information from any person other  then
a police officer or upon his own knowledge.  Non obstante  clause,  when  it
refers  to  the  core,  restricts  the  power  of  the  Magistrate  to  take
cognizance only on a complaint by a payee or the holder in  due  course  and
excludes the rest of <a href="/doc/276703/" id="a_52">Section 190</a> of the Code.  In other words, none  of  the
other provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_53"> of the Code</a> are excluded by the said non  obstante  clause,
hence, the Magistrate is therefore required to follow  the  procedure  under
<a href="/doc/943588/" id="a_54">Section 200</a> of the Code once he has taken the complaint of the  payee/holder
in due course and  record  statement  of  the  complainant  and  such  other
witnesses as  present  at  the  said  date.   Here,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_55">  the  Code</a>  specifically
provides that the same is required to be signed by the complainant  as  well
as the witnesses making the statement.  <a href="/doc/943588/" id="a_56">Section 200</a> of the Code reads thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">      “200. Examination of complainant.- A Magistrate taking  cognizance  of
      an offence on complaint shall examine upon oath  the  complainant  and
      the witnesses present, if any, and the substance of  such  examination
      shall be reduced to writing and shall be signed by the complainant and
      the witnesses, and also by the Magistrate:
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_9">           Provided that, when  the  complaint  is  made  in  writing,  the
      Magistrate need not examine the complainant and the witnesses-
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_10">      (a)   if a public servant acting or purporting to act in the discharge
      of his official duties or a Court has made the complaint; or


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">      (b)   if the Magistrate makes over the case for inquiry  or  trial  to
      another Magistrate under <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_57">section 192</a>:</blockquote>
<p id="p_29">      Provided further that if the Magistrate makes over the case to another
      Magistrate under <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_58">section 192</a> after examining the complainant  and  the
      witnesses, the latter Magistrate need not re-examine them.”

Mere presentation of the complaint is only the first step and no action  can
be taken unless the process of verification  is  complete  and,  thereafter,
the Magistrate  has  to  consider  the  statement  on  oath,  that  is,  the
verification statement under <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_59">Section 200</a> and the statement of  any  witness,
and the Magistrate has to decide  whether  there  is  sufficient  ground  to
proceed.  It is also relevant to note <a href="/doc/1096902/" id="a_60">Section 203</a> of the  Code  which  reads
as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">      “203. Dismissal of complaint.- If, after considering the statements on
      oath (if any) of the complainant and of the witnesses and  the  result
      of the inquiry or  investigation  (if  any)  under  <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_61">section  202</a>,  the
      Magistrate is of opinion  that  there  is  no  sufficient  ground  for
      proceeding, he shall dismiss the complaint, and in every such case  he
      shall briefly record his reasons for so doing.”

It is also clear that a person could be called upon to answer  a  charge  of
false complaint/perjury only on such verification statement and not mere  on
the presentation  of  the  complaint  as  the  same  is  not  on  oath  and,
therefore, need to obtain the signature  of  the  person.   Apart  from  the
above section, the legislative intent becomes clear that “writing” does  not
pre-suppose that the same has to be signed.  Various sections  in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_62">  the  Code</a>
when contrasted with <a href="/doc/328668/" id="a_63">Section 2(d)</a> clarify that the legislature  was  clearly
of the intent that a written complaint need not  be  signed.   For  example,
<a href="/doc/1532960/" id="a_64">Sections 61</a>, <a href="/doc/1518771/" id="a_65">70</a>, <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_66">154</a>, <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_67">164</a> and <a href="/doc/1132672/" id="a_68">281</a> are reproduced below:

A perusal of the above shows that the legislature has  made  it  clear  that
wherever it  required  a  written  document  to  be  signed,  it  should  be
mentioned specifically in the section itself, which  is  missing  both  from
<a href="/doc/328668/" id="a_70">Section 2(d)</a> as well as <a href="/doc/595945/" id="a_71">Section 142</a>.
</p><p id="p_41">14)   <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_72">The General Clauses Act</a>, 1897 too draws a distinction between  writing
and signature and defines them separately.  <a href="/doc/1485731/" id="a_73">Section 3(56)</a> defines  signature
and <a href="/doc/1485731/" id="a_74">Section 3(65)</a> defines writing which reads thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">      “In this Act, and in all <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_75">Central Act</a>s and Regulations made  after  the
      commencement of this Act, unless there is anything  repugnant  in  the
      subject or context,-</blockquote>
       
<p id="p_42">      56. "Sign" with its grammatical variations  and  cognate  expressions,
      shall, with reference to a person who is unable  to  write  his  name,
      include,  "mark",  with  its   grammatical   variation   and   cognate
      expressions,


</p><p id="p_43">      65. Expressions referring to "writing" shall be construed as including
      references to printing, lithography, photography and  other  modes  of
      representing or reproducing words in a visible form,”

Writing as defined  by  <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_76">General  Clauses  Act</a>  requires  that  the  same  is
representation or reproduction of “words” in a visible  form  and  does  not
require signature.  “Signature” within the meaning  of  “writing”  would  be
adding words to the section which the legislature did not contemplate.
</p><p id="p_44">15)   In the case on hand, the complaint was presented in person on June  3,
1998 and on the direction by the Magistrate, the complaint was  verified  on
July 30, 1998 and duly signed by the authorized officer of  the  Company-the
complainant.  As rightly pointed out by the  Division  Bench,  no  prejudice
has  been  caused  to  the  accused  for  non-signing  the  complaint.   The
statement made  on  oath  and  signed  by  the  complainant  safeguards  the
interest  of  the  accused.   In  view  of  the  same,  we  hold  that   the
requirements of <a href="/doc/1779303/" id="a_77">Section 142(a)</a>  of  the  Act  is  that  the  complaint  must
necessarily be in writing and the complaint can be presented  by  the  payee
or holder in due course of the cheque and it  need  not  be  signed  by  the
complainant.   In  other  words,  if  the  legislature  intended  that   the
complaint under the Act, apart from being in writing, is  also  required  to
be signed by the complainant, the  legislature  would  have  used  different
language and inserted the same at the appropriate place.   In  our  opinion,
the correct interpretation would be that the complaint under <a href="/doc/1779303/" id="a_78">Section  142(a)</a>
of the Act requires to be in writing as at the time  of  taking  cognizance,
the Magistrate will examine the complainant on  oath  and  the  verification
statement will be signed by the complainant.
</p><p id="p_45">16)   It is the contention of Mr. Bhagwati Prasad,  learned  senior  counsel
for the appellant  that  the  limitation  period  expired  on  the  date  of
verification and the complaint cannot be entertained.  In view of the  above
discussion, we are unable to accept the said contention.
</p><p id="p_46">17)   <a href="/doc/1432851/" id="a_79">In Japani Sahoo vs. Chandra Sekhar Mohanty</a>, (2007) 7 SCC 394, in  para
48, this Court held that “so far as the complainant is  concerned,  as  soon
as he files a complaint in a competent court of law, he has done  everything
which is required to be done by him at that stage.  Thereafter,  it  is  for
the Magistrate to consider the matter to apply  his  mind  and  to  take  an
appropriate decision of taking cognizance,  issuing  process  or  any  other
action which the law contemplates”.   This  Court  further  held  that  “the
complainant  has  no  control  over  those  proceedings”.   Taking  note  of
<a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_80">Sections 468</a> and <a href="/doc/649216/" id="a_81">473</a> of the Code, in para 52, this Court held that “for  the
purpose of computing the period of limitation, the  relevant  date  must  be
considered as the date of filing of the  complaint  or  initiating  criminal
proceedings and not the  date  of  taking  cognizance  by  a  Magistrate  or
issuance of process by a Court”.
</p><p id="p_47">18)   In the light of the scheme of the Act and various  provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_82">  of  the
Code</a>, we fully endorse the above view and hold that  the  crucial  date  for
computing the period of limitation is the date of filing  of  the  complaint
or initiating criminal proceedings and not the date of taking cognizance  by
the Magistrate.  In the case on hand, as pointed out earlier, the  complaint
was filed on June 3,  1998  which  is  well  within  the  time  and  on  the
direction  of  the  Magistrate,  verification   was   recorded   by   solemn
affirmation by authorized  representatives  of  the  complainant  and  after
recording the statement and securing his signature, the  learned  Magistrate
passed an order issuing summons against the accused under  <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_83">Sections  138</a>/<a href="/doc/595945/" id="a_84">142</a>
of the Act.
</p><p id="p_48">19)   In  the  light  of  the  above  discussion,  taking  note  of  various
provisions of the Act and<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_85"> the Code</a> which we have  adverted  above,  we  hold
that the complaint under  <a href="/doc/1823824/" id="a_86">Section  138</a>  of  the  Act  without  signature  is
maintainable when such complaint is verified  by  the  complainant  and  the
process  is  issued  by  the  Magistrate  after   due   verification.    The
prosecution of  such  complaint  is  maintainable  and  we  agree  with  the
conclusion  arrived  at  by  the  Division  Bench   of   the   High   Court.
Consequently, both the appeals fail and are dismissed.
