ACT:
Income-tax-Evasion    of    taxation-Case    referred	  to
Investigation  Commission-Commencement of the  Constitution-
Settlement  of case --Constitutional validity  of-Waiver  of
fundamental   right,  if  permissible-<a href="/doc/1959284/" id="a_1">Taxation	 of   Income
(Investigation	Commission) Act</a>, 1947 (30 Of 1947), <a href="/doc/1959284/" id="a_2"> s.	 8A</a>-
Constitution of India, <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_3">Art. 14</a>, Part III.



HEADNOTE:
The two questions for determination in this appeal were, (1)
whether	 a settlement under<a href="/doc/1959284/" id="a_4"> s. 8A</a> of the Taxation of  Income
(Investigation Commission) Act, 1947 (30 Of 1947) made after
the  commencement of the Constitution  was  constitutionally
valid and (2) whether the waiver of a fundamental right	 was
permissible  under the Constitution.  The  appellant's	case
was  on	 July 22, 1948, referred by the	 Central  Government
under <a href="/doc/449774/" id="a_5"> S. 5(1)</a> of the Act to the  Investigation	 Commission.
for  investigation and report.	The Commission directed	 the
authorised  official  under<a href="/doc/1934111/" id="a_6"> s. 6</a> of the Act to	examine	 the
appellant's accounts.  He submitted his final report by	 the
end of 1953.  The Commission considered the report heard the
assessee  and came to the conclusion that Rs.  4,47,915	 had
escaped	 assessment.   Thereupon the appellant	on  May	 20,
1954, applied to the Commission for a settlement of his case
under<a href="/doc/1959284/" id="a_7"> s. 8A</a> of the Act, agreeing to pay Rs. 3,50,000 by	 way
of tax and penalty at the concessional rate.  The Commission
reported   to  the  Central  Government	 approving  of	 the
settlement,  the Central Government accepted it and  it	 was
recorded by the Commission.  The Central Government directed
the  recovery of the said amount under<a href="/doc/1959284/" id="a_8"> s. 8A(2)</a> of the	Act.
The  appellant	was permitted to make  payments	 by  monthly
instalments  of Rs. 5,000 and the total amount thus paid  up
to  September 8, 1957, aggregated to Rs. 1,28,000.   In	 the
meantime  the  Income Tax Officer issued a  certificate	 and
certain properties of the appellant were attached.   Relying
on  the decisions of this Court in <a href="/doc/1623923/" id="a_9">Suraj Mall Mohta and	 Co.
v.  A. V. Visvanatha Sastri</a>, [1955] 1 S.C.R. 448 and <a href="/doc/1125816/" id="a_10">M.	 Ct.
Muthiah v. The Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras</a>, [1955]  2
S.C.R.	1247, the appellant applied to the  Commissioner  of
Income-tax  challenging the validity of the settlement	made
under<a href="/doc/1959284/" id="a_11"> s. 8A</a> of the Act on the ground that<a href="/doc/449774/" id="a_12"> S. 5(1)</a> Of the Act
on  which  it  was founded had been declared  void  by	this
Court,	and  claimed that his properties might	be  released
from  attachment  and the amount paid under  the  settlement
might  be  refunded  to	 him.,	On  January  29,  1958,	 the
Commissioner  of  Income Tax sent a reply to  the  appellant
maintaining that the settlement was valid and
		    529
that  the  appellant  was bound thereunder  to	pay  up	 the
arrears of instalments and requesting him to continue to pay
in  future.   Against this decision of the  Commissioner  of
Income	Tax the. appellant came up to the Supreme  Court  by
special leave.	It was contended on behalf of the respondent
that   the  Act	 laid  down    two   distinct	and separate
procedures,   one  for	investigation  and  the	 other	 for
settlement and it was the former alone and not the D, latter
that  was affected by the decisions of this Court. and	that
the  appellant by voluntarily entering into  the  settlement
had  waived his fundamental right founded on <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_13">Art. 14</a> of	 the
Constitution.
Held (Per Curiam), that both the contentions must fail.
It  was not correct to say that the Taxation of Income	(In-
vestigation  <a href="/doc/131273063/" id="a_14">Commission) Act</a>, 1947, laid down two  different
procedures,  one for investigation and assessment  under <a href="/doc/129630/" id="a_15"> s.
8(2)</a>  of the Act and another for settlement under<a href="/doc/1959284/" id="a_16"> s.  8A</a>  of
the Act and assessment in terms of such settlement and	that
while  the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1125816/" id="a_17">M. Ct.  Muthiah v.	 The
Commissioner of Incometax, Madras</a>, declaring<a href="/doc/449774/" id="a_18"> s. 5(1)</a> of	 the
Act  to be discriminatory and therefore void, affected	only
the former procedure and not the latter.  <a href="/doc/1959284/" id="a_19">The Act</a> laid	down
but  one  procedure  and  in  entertaining  a  proposal	 for
settlement  as	in the investigation itself  the  Commission
exercised the same jurisdiction, and powers and followed the
one and the same procedure as laid down by<a href="/doc/574258/" id="a_20"> ss. 5</a>, <a href="/doc/1934111/" id="a_21">6</a> and <a href="/doc/1267418/" id="a_22">7</a> Of
the  Act.  Since the settlement in the instant case  was  no
exception  to that rule, it was covered by the decision	 and
must be held to be violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_23">Art. 14</a> Of the Constitution.
<a href="/doc/1125816/" id="a_24">M.   Ct. Muthiah v. The Commissioner of Income-tax,  Madras</a>,

The observations made in the majority judgment of this Court
in <a href="/doc/1063853/" id="a_25">Syed Qasim Razvi v. The State of Hyderabad</a>, [1953] S.C.R.
589, must be kept strictly confined to the special facts  of
that case and had no application to the facts of the present
case.
<a href="/doc/1063853/" id="a_26">Syed  Qasim Razvi v. The State of Hyderabad</a>,  [1953]  S.C.R.
589, held inapplicable.
Per Das, C. J., and Kapur J.-There could be no waiver of the
fundamental right founded on <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_27">Art. 14</a> Of the Constitution and
it  was	 not correct to contend that the  appellant  had  by
entering into the settlement under<a href="/doc/1959284/" id="a_28"> s. 8A</a> of the Act,  waived
his  fundamental right under that Article.  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_29">Article  14</a>	 was
founded	 on a sound public policy recognised and valued	 all
over  the civilised world, its language was the language  of
command	 and it imposed an obligation on the State of  which
no  person could, by his act or conduct, relieve it.  As  it
was  not strictly necessary for the disposal of	 this  case,
the  question whether any other fundamental right  could  be
waived need not be considered in this connection.

v. The State</a>, A.I.R. 1958 Punj. 294, distinguished and	held

Per  Bhagwati  and gubba Rao, jj.-There could be  no  waiver
'.,not	only of the fundamental right enshrined in  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_33">Art.  14</a>
but  also of any other fundamental right guaranteed by	Part
III   of  the  Constitution.   The  Constitution   made	  no
distinction  between  fundamental  rights  enacted  for	 the
benefit	 of the individual and those enacted in	 the  public
interest  or on grounds of the public policy.  There  could,
therefore,  be	no  justification  for	importing   American
notions	 or authority of decided cases to whittle  down	 the
transcendental	character  of  those  rights,  conceived  in
public interest and subject only to such limitations as	 the
Constitution had itself thought fit to impose.
<a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_34">Article	 13(2)</a> was in terms a constitutional mandate to	 the
State  in respect of all the fundamental rights	 enacted  in
Part III of the Constitution and no citizen could by  waiver
of  any	 one  of  them	relieve	 the  State  of	 the  solemn
obligation  that lay on it.  The view expressed by  Mahajan,
C.  J., in <a href="/doc/1683423/" id="a_35">Behram Khurshed Pesikaka v. The State of  Bombay</a>,
[1955]	1  S.C.R. 613, correctly laid down the	law  on	 the
point.	Since the arguments in the instant case had  covered
the entire field of fundamental rights, there was no  reason
why the answer should be confined to <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_36">Art. 14</a> alone.
<a href="/doc/1683423/" id="a_37">Behram	Khurshed Pesikaka v. The State of Bombay</a>,  [1955]  1
S.C.R.	613; <a href="/doc/1334665/" id="a_38">State of Travancore-Cochin v. The	Bombay	Co.,
Ltd</a>., [1954] S.C.R. 1112 and <a href="/doc/212098/" id="a_39">The State of Bombay v. R. M. D.
Chamarbaugwala</a>, [1957] S.C.R. 874, referred to.
Per  S.	 K. Das, J.-It seems clear that <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_40">Art. 13</a>	 itself	 re-
cognises  the  distinction between  absence  of	 legislative
power  which  will  make  the law  made	 by  an	 incompetent
legislature  wholly void, and exercise of legislative  power
in  contravention of a restriction or check on	such  power,
which  will  make  the	law  void  to  the  extent  of	 the
inconsistency  or contravention; therefore the mere  use  of
the  word " void " in <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_41">Art. 13</a> does not necessarily  militate
against the application of the doctrine of waiver in respect
of the provisions contained in Part III of the Constitution.
<a href="/doc/1683423/" id="a_42">Behram	Khurshed Pesikaka v. The State of Bombay</a>,  [1955]  1
S.C.R. 613, considered.
<a href="/doc/762155/" id="a_43">Bhikaji	 Narain	 Dhakyas  v. The State	of  Madhya  Pradesh</a>,
[1955] 2 S.C.R. 589; <a href="/doc/1125816/" id="a_44">M. Ct.  Muthiah v. The Commissioner  of
Income-tax,  Madras</a>, [1955] 2 S.C.R. 1247 and <a href="/doc/212098/" id="a_45">The  State  of
Bombay v. R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala</a>, [1957] S.C.R. 874, referred
to.
There was nothing in the two preambles to the Indian and the
American  Constitutions	 that  could make  the	doctrine  of
waiver applicable to the one and not to the other; since the
doctrine
531
applied	 to  the constitutional rights	under  the  American
Constitution, there is no reason why it should not apply  to
the fundamental rights under the Indian Constitution.
Case-law considered.
But it must be made clear that there is no absolute rule, or
one  formulated in the abstract, as to the applicability  of
that  doctrine to fundamental rights and such  applicability
must depend on (1) the nature of fundamental right to  which
it  is	sought to be applied and (2) the foundation  on	 the
basis  of which the plea is raised.  The true test  must  be
whether the fundamental right is one primarily meant for the
benefit	 of  individuals or for the benefit of	the  general
public.
Where,	therefore, the Constitution vested the right in	 the
individual,  primarily	intending to benefit  him  and	such
right  did not impinge on the rights of others, there  could
be  a waiver of such right provided it was not forbidden  by
law or did not contravene public policy or public morals.
As  in the instant case the respondents who had	 raised	 the
plea,  had failed to prove the necessary facts on  which  it
could be sustained, the plea of waiver must fail.
Per  Subba  Rao, J.-Apart from the question  as	 to  whether
there  could be a waiver in respect of a fundamental  right,
s. 5(1) of the <a href="/doc/1959284/" id="a_46">Taxation of Income (Investigation Commission)
Act</a>, 1947, having been declared void by this Court in <a href="/doc/1125816/" id="a_47">M. Ct.
Muthiah v. The Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras</a>, as  being
violative of the fundamental right founded on Art' 14 Of the
Constitution  and such decision being binding on all  courts
in India, the Commissioner of Income-tax had no jurisdiction
to continue the proceedings against the appellant under that
Act  and  the appellant could not by a waiver of  his  right
confer jurisdiction on him.
No  distinction could be made under <a href="/doc/1010805/" id="a_48">Art. 13(1)</a> of  the	Con-
stitution  between  the	 constitutional	 incompetency  of  a
legislature  and  constitutional limitation  placed  on	 its
power of legislation, for a statute declared void on  either
ground would continue to be so, so long as the inconsistency
continued.  As the inconsistency of<a href="/doc/449774/" id="a_49"> S. 5(1)</a> of the Act	with
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_50">Art. 14</a> continued, it must continue to be void.
<a href="/doc/656658/" id="a_51">Keshavan Madhava Menon v. The State of Bombay</a>, [1951] S.C.R.

1, 1947, by a notification issued by the Central  Government
under s.  (1)  (3)  thereof, has had a short  but  chequered
career, as     will   appear  from  the	 facts	 hereinafter
stated.
</p><p id="p_3">In  order  to  appreciate the  several	questions  canvassed
before us it is necessary to refer to the provisions of	 the

which  the  Central Government has prima facie	reasons	 for
believing  that a person has to a substantial extent  evaded
payment	 of taxation on income, together with such  material
as  may be available in support of such belief, and  may  at
any  time  before the 30th day of June, 1948, apply  to	 the

submitted  by the Central Government with reference  to	 any
case or points in a case and making such investigation as it
considers  necessary, report to the Central Government	that
in its opinion further investigation is not likely to reveal
any  substantial evasion of taxation on income and  on	such
report	being made the investigation shall be deemed  to  be
closed.
</p><p id="p_9">(3)  No reference made by the Central Government under	sub-
section (1), at any time before the 30th day of June,  1948,

investigated in any manner by any Court.

On  July  5, 1949, the total wealth statement  was  received
back  from the authorised official.  Our  Constitution	came
into force on January 26, 1950.	 The order-sheet shows	that
the authorised official on May 26, 1950, issued a notice  to
the  assessee  fixing the hearing for June 10,	1950,  which
indicates  that the authorised official was proceeding	with
the  investigation  set in motion by the  reference  of	 the
assessee's
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">68</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">538</span>
case  to  the  Commission.  The	 assessee  appears  to	have
attended on June 6, 1950, with an application for  extension
of time which apparently was given.  On September 30,  1950,
the  assessee supplied certain statements of his firm.	 The
entry  in  the order-sheet ,,,against the date	October	 31,
1950, shows that the assessee asked for further extension of
time.	There  appears to be a hiatus of about 3  years	 and
evidently  nothing  was done until June 9,  1953,  when	 the
authorised  official fixed the hearing of the case  on	June
15,  1953.   The authorised official submitted	his  interim
report to the Commission on June 9. 1953.  The assessee	 was
examined  on October 9, 10 and 13, 1953, and the  authorised
official submitted his final report on October 19, 1953.  On
January	 30,  1954,  notice was issued to  the	assessee  to
appear	 before	 the  Commission  on  February	 15,   1954.
Presumably  to	get ready for the hearing the  assessee,  on
February 5, 1954, asked for inspection of certain assessment
orders	concerning  his case-, for the return of  his  lease
deed  filed  by him and a copy of the statement	 of  one  L.
Kalidas	 and for production of certain documents before	 the
Commission.  The hearing, which had been fixed for  February
15, 1954, was adjourned till March 4, 1954.  Witness Kalidas
was  examined  on March 4,. 1954.  On March  29,  1954,	 the
assessee  asked for a, copy of the deposition given  by	 the
witness Durgadas before the Commission.	 After the  evidence
was closed notice was issued to the assessee on May 1, 1954,
asking him to appear before the Commission on May 19,  1954.
On that date the assessee attended, arguments were heard and
orders	were  reserved.	 Learned counsel  for  the  assessee
states	that at the close of the arguments on May 19,  1954,
the  Commission announced its view that the income,  profits
and  gains that had escaped assessment in the hands  of	 the
assessee  for the period beginning with April 1,  1939,	 and
ending	March 31, 1947, were the sum of Rs.  4,47,915,	that
the  Commission also threw a hint that should  the  assessee
accept the said finding he would be granted the benefit of a
settlement  on the lower concessional basis of.	 payment  of
75% and a small penalty of Rs. 14,064
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">539</span>
other  alternative than to make the best of the bad  job  by
proposing  a  settlement  under<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_87"> s. 8A</a> offering	to  pay	 Rs.
3,50,000 by way of tax and penalty.  This sequence of events
is  amply borne out by paragraphs 3 and 4 of the  settlement
application filed by the assessee on May 20, 1954, a copy of
which  has been produced before us by the respondents.	 The
Commission on May 24, 1954, made a report under<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_88"> s. 8A</a> (1) to
the Central Government that it was of opinion that the terms
of   settlement	 contained  in	the  application  might	  be
approved.   The	 Central  Government  having  accepted	 the
proposed  settlement, the Commission had the  terms  thereof
recorded.  The Central Government by its Order C No. 74	 (9-
IT)  54	 made  on  July 5, 1954, under	s.  8A	(2)  of	 the
<a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_89">Investigation Act</a> directed that demand notice in  accordance
with the said terms be served immediately by the Income	 Tax
Officer and that all such other proceedings under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_90">Indian
Income	Tax  Act</a> or other law as may be necessary  be  taken
with  a view to enforce the payment of the demand  and	that
the  entire sum of Rs. 3,50,000 be demanded in one sum.	  It
appears,  however,  that the assessee was  allowed  to	make
payments by instalments of Rs. 5,000, per month.
In  the	 meantime  on May 28,  1954,  this  Court  delivered
judgment  in  <a href="/doc/1623923/" id="a_91">Suraj Mall Mohta and Co. v. A.  V.  Visvanatha
Sastri</a> (1).  In that case in the course of investigation  of
the  case of Messrs.  Jute and Gunny Brokers Ltd. which	 had
been  referred	to  the Commission under<a href="/doc/65305/" id="a_92"> s.  5</a>	(1)  of	 the
<a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_93">Investigation Act</a>, it was alleged to have been discovered by
the Commission that Suraj Mall Mohta and Co. had made  large
profits	 which	they had not disclosed and had	thus  evaded
taxation.   A  report  to that effect having  been  made  on
August 28, 1953, by the Commission to the Central Government
under <a href="/doc/65305/" id="a_94"> s.  5</a>  (4)  of  the  <a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_95">Investigation  Act</a>	the  Central
Government  on September 9, 1953, referred the case  against
Suraj  Mall  Mohta  and	 Co. to	 the  Commission  under	 the
provisions  of	s.  5  (4).   On  September  15,  1953,	 the
Commission notified Suraj Mall
[1955]	1 S.C.R.448
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">540</span>
Mohta  and  Co.	 that  their cases  had	 been  referred	 for
investigation  and  called  upon  them	to  furnish  certain
materials, details of which were set out in annexure to	 the
petition.  On April 12, 1954, Suraj Mall Mohta and Co. filed
a  petition under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_96">Art. 32</a> of the Constitution asking for  an
appropriate writ restraining the, Commission from taking any
action	 on   the  ground  that	 the   provisions   of	 the
<a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_97">Investigation  Act</a> had become void being  discriminatory  in
character.  By that judgment this Court held that both<a href="/doc/1306401/" id="a_98"> s. 34</a>
of  the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922, as it then	 stood,	 and
sub-s.	(4)  of	<a href="/doc/161822037/" id="a_99"> s. 5</a> of the Investigation  Act	 dealt	with
persons who had similar characteristics of being persons who
had not truly disclosed their income and had evaded  payment
of tax on their income but that as the procedure  prescribed
by the <a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_100">Investigation Act</a> was substantially more	 prejudicial
than  the procedure under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_101">Indian Income Tax	 Act</a>,  1922,
sub-s.	(4)  of	<a href="/doc/65305/" id="a_102"> s. 5</a> and the procedure	 prescribed  by	 the
<a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_103">Investigation	Act</a>,-in	 so  far  as  it  affected   persons
proceeded  against  under that sub-section was	a  piece  of
discriminatory legislation which offended the provisions  of
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_104">Art.  14</a>  of the Constitution and was, therefore,  void	 and
unenforceable.
</p><p id="p_27">Sub-section (4) of<a href="/doc/161822037/" id="a_105"> s. 5</a> of the Investigation Act having been
declared  void,	 Parliament  passed the	 <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_106">Indian	 Income	 Tax
Amendment  Act</a>	(33 of 1954) amending<a href="/doc/1306401/" id="a_107"> s. 34</a>  of	 the  Indian
Income	Tax  Act,  1922.  Paradoxical as it  may  seem,	 the
result	of this amendment was that persons  who	 originally,
fell only within the ambit of<a href="/doc/65305/" id="a_108"> s. 5</a> (1) of the  <a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_109">Investigation
Act</a>  and formed a distinct class of substantial tax  evaders
also came within the amended<a href="/doc/1306401/" id="a_110"> s. 34</a> of the Indian Income	 Tax
Act, 1922.  The position after the amendment, therefore, was
that  the Income Tax Officers could pick out some  of  these
persons and refer their cases under<a href="/doc/65305/" id="a_111"> s. 5</a> (1) of the Investi-
gation Act and thereby subject them to the drastic and harsh
procedure  of  that Act, while they could  deal	 with  other
persons	 similarly situate under<a href="/doc/1306401/" id="a_112"> s. 34</a> as amended and  apply
to  them  the comparatively more beneficial  procedure	laid
down  in the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_113">Indian Income Tax Act</a>, 1922.  Promptly  several
applications were
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">541</span>
made  under  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_114">Art. 32</a> of the  Constitution  complaining	that
after  the amendment of<a href="/doc/1306401/" id="a_115"> s. 34</a> of the Indian Income Tax	Act,
s.  5 (1) of the <a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_116">Investigation Act</a> became discriminatory  in
that the persons falling within it could be dealt with under
the  drastic, prejudicial and harsh procedure prescribed  by
the  <a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_117">Investigation  Act</a>,  while	   other   persons similarly
situate and belonging to the same category could at the whim
or  pleasure  of  the Income Tax  authorities  be  proceeded
against under the more beneficial procedure prescribed under
the  <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_118">Indian  Income Tax Act</a>.  All  those  applications	were
disposed of by a common judgment reported as <a href="/doc/1179473/" id="a_119">Shree Meenakshi
Mills  Ltd.  v. Sri A. V. Visvanatha Sastri</a> (1)	 This  Court
held  that <a href="/doc/1306401/" id="a_120"> s. 34</a> of the Income Tax Act, as amended  by	 the
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_121">Indian Income Tax Amendment Act</a>, 1954 (33 of 1954), operated
on the same field as<a href="/doc/65305/" id="a_122"> s. 5</a> (1) of the <a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_123">Investigation Act</a>, and,
therefore,<a href="/doc/65305/" id="a_124"> s. 5</a> (1) had become void and unenforceable as the
procedure  applied to persons dealt with  thereunder  became
discriminatory	in  character.	It should be noted  that  in
none of those petitions disposed of by that judgment had any
assessment  been made under the <a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_125">Investigation Act</a>  and	this
Court	only  prohibited  further  proceedings	before	 the
Commission  under  the	<a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_126">Investigation  Act</a>.   The   assessee
appellant  now before us who had entered into  a  settlement
under<a href="/doc/38185116/" id="a_127"> s. 8</a> of the Investigation Act and had been assessed in
accordance with the terms of the settlement continued to pay
the tax by monthly instalments of Rs. 5,000 as before.
Finally	 on  December 20, 1955, came the  decision  of	this
Court in <a href="/doc/1125816/" id="a_128">M. CT.	 Muthiah v. The Commissioner of Income	Tax,
Madras</a> (2). In that case the Central Government had under<a href="/doc/65305/" id="a_129"> s.

recorded its findings and held that an aggregate sum of	 Rs.

period under investigation.  The Commission having submitted
its  report  to the Central Government,	 the  latter  acting
under <a href="/doc/971685/" id="a_131"> s.  8</a>  (2) of the  <a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_132">Investigation	 Act</a>  directed	that

with  a	 view to assess or re-assess the  income  which	 had
escaped	 assessment for the period 1940-41 to 1948-49.	 The
Income	Tax Officer accordingly issued notices and made	 the
re-assessment for the years 1940-41, 1941-42 and 1943-44  to
1948-49 based upon the finding of the Commission, which	 was
treated	 as final and conclusive.  These  assessment  orders
were  served on that assessee.	There was, however,  no	 re.
assessment  order  for the year 1942-43.  In regard  to	 the
assessment  orders  which  had	been  served  the   assessee
concerned applied to the Commissioner of Income Tax under<a href="/doc/971685/" id="a_134"> S.

Court on questions of law arising out of those re-assessment
orders.	  During  the  pendency	 of  those  proceedings	 the
assessee, in that case on December 6, 1954, filed a petition
contending that the provisions of the <a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_136">Investigation Act</a> were
illegal, ultra vires and unconstitutional.  The majority  of
this Court held that different persons, though falling under
the same class or category of substantial evaders of income.
tax,  were  being subjected to different procedures,  one  a
summary	 and  drastic  procedure and the  other	 the  normal
procedure  which gave to the assessees various rights  which
were  denied to those who were specially treated  under	 the
</p><p id="p_30">-procedure   prescribed	 by  the  <a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_137">Investigation	  Act</a>	and,
therefore, the assessments made under<a href="/doc/38185116/" id="a_138"> s. 8</a> (2) were void and
unenforceable.	That was a case of assessment under<a href="/doc/38185116/" id="a_139"> s. 8</a> (2)
in  invitum after an investigation under  the  <a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_140">Investigation

of  the	 investigation entered into a  settlement  and	been
assessed  in accordance with the terms of  such	 settlement,
however, went on making payments in discharge of the balance
due  under the terms of settlement right up to September  8,
1957,  when he made the last payment of Us.  8,000  bringing
the aggregate payment up to Rs. 1,28,000.
</p><p id="p_31">In   the  meantime  the	 Income	 Tax  Officer  had  sent   a
certificate  requesting	 the  Collector	 of  Delhi  for	 the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">		    543</span>
the   properties  belonging  to	 the  assessee	situate	  in
Dharamsalla and Hissar were attached.  On December 27, 1957,
the   assessee	made  an  application  to  the	Income	 Tax
Commissioner.  After pointing out that between July 5, 1954,
and  December 27, 1957, the petitioner had paid in  all	 Rs.
1,28,000 towards the-' discharge of his liability under	 the
settlement  and referring to the decisions of this Court  in
suraj  Mall  Mohta's  case (1) and Muthiah's  case  (2)	 the
assessee  submitted that the settlement under a. 8<a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_141">A  of	 the
Investigation Act</a> had no force and did not bind the petitio-
ner and that the settlement had been made under the pressure
of  the situation and in view of the coercive  machinery  of
the <a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_142">Investigation Act</a> and that from either point of view the
settlement was not binding.  His contention was that when<a href="/doc/161822037/" id="a_143"> s.
5(1)</a> of the Investigation Act had been held unconstitutional
the  settlement under<a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_144"> s. 8A</a> could not be enforced,  for	 the

</p><p id="p_40">Being aggrieved by the above decision the assessee thereupon
moved  this  Court  and obtained  special  leave  to  appeal
against	 that order.  The appeal has now come up  for  final
disposal before us.
</p><p id="p_41">It may be mentioned here that as the respondents are anxious
to  have  the matters of controversy raised in	this  appeal
decided	 and  set at rest by a decision of this	 Court,	 the
respondents,  for  the	purposes of this  appeal,  have	 not
insisted  on  their objection that an appeal  does  not	 lie
under  <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_150">Art. 136</a> of the Constitution against an order of	 the
Commissioner  of  Income  Tax.	 Learned  counsel  for	 the
assessee  also has not pressed his claim for refund  of	 the
amounts	 already paid and has pressed the  appeal  regarding
the  balance  that remains to be paid under  the  settlement
which	is   characterised  as	invalid.    Model   Knitting
Industries  Ltd. which has a case pending in the High  Court
of Calcutta where the same questions as are in issue in	 the
appeal	before us, are also in issue has been. permitted  to
intervene  and	we  have heard counsel	appearing  for	that
intervener.
</p><p id="p_42">In  view  of the three decisions referred to  above  learned
Attorney General does not seriously contend that the  powers
conferred  on the Commission by<a href="/doc/128858156/" id="a_151"> s. 6</a> and the procedure	laid
down   by  <a href="/doc/112968079/" id="a_152"> s.	 7</a>  of	the  Investigation   Act   are	 not
discriminatory,	 but what he urges is that none of the	said
decisions has held that<a href="/doc/161822037/" id="a_153"> s. 5(1)</a> is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">		    545</span>
wholly	void  and inoperative.	He says that <a href="/doc/161822037/" id="a_154"> s.  5(1)</a>	only
authorises the Central Government to refer certain cases  to
the  Commission.   Upon	 such  a  reference  two  lines	  of
procedure  are clearly indicated by the	 <a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_155">Investigation	Act</a>,
namely,	 (1)  that an investigation may be held	 in  invitum
following the procedure prescribed and exercising the powers
conferred by the lnvestigation Act and (2) that a settlement
may be made under<a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_156"> s. 8A</a>.  If the first procedure is followed
and an assessment is made under<a href="/doc/38185116/" id="a_157"> s. 8(2)</a> such assessment will
undoubtedly  be invalid as has been held in  Muthiah's	case
(1),  but  if  on  a  case  being  referred  the  settlement
procedure  is  followed	 then  the  consequential  order  of
assessment under<a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_158"> s. 8A</a> cannot be questioned.  We are  unable
to  accept this line of argument as permissible in  view  of
the  provisions	 of  the  <a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_159">Investigation	 Act</a>.	It  will  be
recalled that when the case of the assessee was referred  to
the Commission under<a href="/doc/161822037/" id="a_160"> s. 5(1)</a> on July 22, 1948, there was  no
provision for settlement in the Act at all.  Therefore, that
reference,  when it was made, consigned the assessee to	 the
only procedure of investigation that was then prescribed  by
the  Act.   In the next place it should be  remembered	that
after <a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_161"> s. 8A</a> was added in the <a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_162">Investigation Act</a> by<a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_163"> s. 33</a>  of
Act 67 of 1949 an authorised official was appointed under<a href="/doc/174382300/" id="a_164"> s.
6(3)</a>  to  investigate  the affairs of the  assessee  and  to
examine	 the books and to interrogate any person  or  obtain
any  statement	from  any person and under  sub-s.  (4)	 the
authorised  official  was  empowered to	 exercise  the	same
powers	as had been vested in the Commission  under  sub-ss.
(1) and (2) of<a href="/doc/128858156/" id="a_165"> s. 6</a>. Further, by its own terms<a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_166"> s. 8A</a> made it
clear that the person concerned in any case referred to	 the
Commission  for investigation might apply to the  Commission
at  any	 time  during such investigation to  have  the	case
settled.   Therefore  this provision for settlement  was  an
integral part of the entire investigation procedure.  It was
not  a	separate  or independent procedure  apart  from	 the
investigation procedure.  It is true that there was  nothing
to prevent the assessee from straightaway
(1)  [1955] 2 S.C.R. 1247.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">69</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">546</span>
<p id="p_43">making	a  proposal for settlement before  any	actual	step
towards	  investigation	 -was  taken  by  the	Income	 Tax
authorities,  but  before  the Commission  could  refer	 the
proposal for settlement to the Central Government it had  to
be  satisfied that the terms of settlement contained in	 the
application were such as might be approved.  For the purpose
of satisfying itself the Commission had obviously to go into
the facts either by itself or through an authorised official
and  to consider the materials collected by  the  authorised
official  and  in  the process of doing so had	to  hold  an
investigation of some sort and that investigation had neces-
sarily	 to  be	 made  in  accordance  with  the   procedure
prescribed   by	 the  <a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_167">Investigation  Act</a>  itself.   It	 is,
therefore,  not	 correct to say that there could be  a	pro-
ceeding for settlement without any investigation at all.  In
our  opinion<a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_168"> s. 8A</a> did not provide for a separate  procedure
at  all.   When	 a case was referred under<a href="/doc/161822037/" id="a_169"> s.  5(1)</a>  it	 was
really	for  investigation and a  settlement  was  something
which  could  crop up in the process of	 that  investigation
just  as in the course of a suit parties may arrive at	some
compromise.   In  recording  the compromise  and  passing  a
judgment  in  accordance with the  compromise  thereof,	 the
court  exercises  the same jurisdiction as it  exercises  in
entertaining and disposing of the suit itself.	Likewise  in
entertaining  a	 proposal  for	settlement  the	  Commission
exercised  its	jurisdiction of investigation  under <a href="/doc/161822037/" id="a_170"> s.  5</a>,
followed the procedure prescribed by<a href="/doc/112968079/" id="a_171"> s. 7</a> and exercised	 all
its  powers  under<a href="/doc/128858156/" id="a_172"> s. 6</a>. As already stated the	language  of
s.8A  itself  shows that a settlement can be  proposed	only
during such investigation.  In our judgment, therefore,	 the
contention   of	 the  learned  Attorney	 General  that	 the
<a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_173">Investigation  Act</a>  prescribed two procedures is  not  well-
founded.
</p><p id="p_44">Learned	  Attorney   General  then  points  out	  that	 the
<a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_174">Investigation Act</a> was a pre-<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_175">Constitution Act</a> and that before
the commencement of the Constitution when there was no	such
thing  as a fundamental right, its provisions could  not  be
questioned  however  discriminatory the procedure  may	have
been.	 He  urges  that  after	 the  commencement  of	 the
Constitution the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">547</span>
assessee  has not been subjected to the	 coercive  procedure
laid   down  by	 the  <a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_176">Investigation  Act</a>,  but	 voluntarily
</p><p id="p_45">-proposed  a  settlement which was accepted by	the  Central
Government on the recommendation of the Commission.  In that
situation  he  was in the same position as Qasim  Razvi	 had
been in and the observations to be found in the judgment  of
Mukherjea,  J., who delivered the majority judgment in	<a href="/doc/1063853/" id="a_177">Syed
Qasim  Razvi  v. The State of Hyderabad</a> (1) applied  to	 the
present	 appeal.  We do not think it is necessary,  for	 the
purpose	 of  this appeal, to go minutely into the  facts  of
Qasim	Razvi's	 case  (1)  with  reference  to	 which	 the
observations  relied  on had been made, or  to	analyse	 the
correctness of the reasoning adopted in that case, for	that
can  only be done by a larger Bench.  We are  definitely  of
opinion, however, that the observations made in the majority
judgement  should not be extended but must be kept  strictly
confined to the special facts of that case. In our judgement
those observations have no ~application to the facts of	 the
present	  appeal  before  us,  for  here  even	 after	 the
commencement   of   the	  Constitution,	  the	process	  of
investigation continued in that the authorised official went
on   collecting	  materials  by	 following   the   procedure
prescribed  by<a href="/doc/112968079/" id="a_178"> s. 7</a> and exercising the powers  conferred  on
him by<a href="/doc/128858156/" id="a_179"> s. 6</a> of the Investigation Act.
</p><p id="p_46">The  last argument advanced by the learned Attorney  General
is  that  if  there  had been a	 breach	 of  the  assessee's
fundamental  right  by subjecting him  to  a  discriminatory
</p><p id="p_47">-procedure laid down in the <a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_180">Investigation Act</a>, the  asessee,
by voluntarily entering into a settlement, must be taken  to
have  waived such breach and cannot now be permitted to	 set
up  his fundamental right.  Immediately two questions  arise
for  consideration, namely, (1) whether the  assessee  could
waive  the breach of the fundamental right in  question	 and
(2)  whether in the facts and circumstances of this case  he
had actually done so.
</p><p id="p_48">Re. (1): <a href="/doc/1683423/" id="a_181">In Behram Khurshed Pesikaka v. State of
Bombay</a> (2) there was a general discussion whether a

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">548</span>
<p id="p_50">fundamental right could be waived.  At page 638	 Venkatarama
Aiyar, J., observed:-
</p><p id="p_51">"  The	question is, what is the legal effect of  a  statute
being  declared unconstitutional.  The answer to it  depends
on  two	 considerations	 firstly  does	the   constitutional
prohibition  which has been infringed affect the  competence
of  the	 Legislature  to enact the law	or  does  it  merely
operate	 as  a check on the exercise of a  power  which	 is-
within	its  competence;  and secondly, if it  is  merely  a
check, whether it is enacted for the benefit of	 individuals
or  whether  it is imposed for the benefit  of	the  general
public	on  grounds  of public policy.	If  the	 statute  is
beyond	the competence of the Legislature, as  for  example,
when  a	 State enacts a law which is  within  the  exclusive
competence of the Union, it would be a nullity.	 That  would
also  be  the position when a limitation is imposed  on	 the
legislative  power in the interests of the public,  as,	 for
instance, the provisions in Chapter XIII of the Constitution
relating  to inter-State trade and commerce.  But  when	 the
law  is	 within the competence of the  Legislature  and	 the
unconstitutionality  arises by reason of its  repugnancy  to
provisions enacted for the benefit of individuals, it is not
a   nullity   but   is	merely	 unenforceable.	   Such	  an
unconstitutionality  can be waived and in that case the	 law
becomes	 enforceable.	In America this	 principle  is	well
settled. (Vide Cooley on Constitutional Limitations,  Volume
1, pages 368 to 371 ; Willis on Constitutional Law at  pages
524,  531, 542 and 558 ; Rottschaefer on Constitutional	 Law
at pages 28 and 29-30)."
</p><p id="p_52">After  referring to three decisions of the American  Supreme
Court  which are also now relied on by the learned  Attorney
General, the learned Judge concluded as follows:-
" The position must be the same under our Constitution	when
a law contravenes a prescription intended for the benefit of
individuals.   The rights guaranteed under <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_182">Art. 19  (1)	 (f)</a>
are enacted for the benefit of owners of properties and when
a law is found to infringe that provision, it is open to any
person whose rights have been infringed to waive it and when
there
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">		    549</span>
is waiver there is no legal impediment to the enforcement of
the  law.   It	would  be otherwise if	the  statute  was  a
nullity;  in  which  case  it  can  neither  be	 waived	 nor
enforced.   If then the law is merely unenforceable and	 can
take  effect when waived it cannot be treated as non and  as
effaced	 out of the statute book.  It is scarcely  necessary
to  add	 that  the question of waiver  is  relevant  to	 the
present	 controversy  not as bearing on any  issue  of	fact
arising	 for determination in this case but as	showing	 the
nature	of the right declared under <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_183">Art. 19 (1) (f)</a> and	 the
effect in law of a statute contravening it."
When the case came up before the court on review Mahajan, C.
J.,  with  the concurrence of Mukherjea,  Vivian  Bose,	 and
Ghulam Hassan, JJ., said at page 653:-
</p><p id="p_53">" In our opinion, the doctrine of waiver enunciated by	some
American  Judges  in construing	 the  American	Constitution
cannot	be introduced in our Constitution without  a  fuller
discussion of the matter.  No inference in deciding the case
should have been raised on the basis of such a theory.	 The
learned Attorney General when questioned about the  doctrine
did  not  seem to be very enthusiastic	about  it.   Without
finally	 expressing an opinion on this question we  are	 not
for the moment convinced that this theory has any  relevancy
in  construing the fundamental rights conferred by Part	 III
of our Constitution.  We think that the rights described  as
fundamental  rights  are  a  necessary	consequence  of	 the
declaration  in the preamble that the people of	 India	have
solemnly  resolved  to	constitute India  into	a  sovereign
democratic  republic  and  to secure  to  all  its  citizens
justice, social, economic and political; liberty of thought,
expression belief, faith and worship; equality of status and
of opportunity.	 These fundamental rights have not been	 put
in  the Constitution merely for individual  benefit,  though
ultimately   they   come  into	operation   in	 considering
individual rights.  They have been put there as a matter  of
public	policy	and  the  doctrine of  waiver  can  have  no
application to provisions of law which have been enacted  as
a matter of constitutional policy.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">550</span>
<p id="p_54">Reference to some of the Articles, inter alia, Arts. 15 (1),
20, 21, makes the proposition quite plain.  A citizen cannot
get   discrimination  by  telling  the	State  "   You	 can
discriminate  ", or get convicted by waiving the  protection
given under Arts. 20 and 21."
</p><p id="p_55">On  that  occasion one of us preferred not  to	express	 any
opinion on this subject and said at page 670:-
" In coming to the conclusion that I have, I have in a large
measure	 found	myself	in  agreement  with  the  views	  of
Venkatarama Aiyar, J., on that part of the case. 1, however,
desire	to  guard myself against being understood  to  agree
with  the  rest	 of  the observations to  be  found  in	 his
judgment,   particularly   those  relating  to	 waiver	  of
unconstitutionality,  the  fundamental rights being  a	mere
check on legislative power or the effect of the	 declaration
under <a href="/doc/1010805/" id="a_184">Art. 13(1)</a> being " relatively void ". On those  topics
I prefer to express no opinion on this occasion."
It  will, however, be noticed that the observations  of	 the
learned	 judges	 made  in that case did not  relate  to	 the
waiver of a breach of the fundamental right under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_185">Art. 14.</a>
The  fundamental right, the breach whereof is complained  of
by the assessee, is founded on <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_186">Art. 14</a> of the  Constitution.
The problem, therefore, before us is whether a breach of the
fundamental  right flowing from <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_187">Art. 14</a> can be waived.	 For
disposing  Of  this  appeal it is not necessary	 for  us  to
consider  whether  any	of  the	 other	fundamental   rights
enshrined  in Part III of our Constitution can or cannot  be
waived.	  We take the view that this court should  not	make
any  pronouncement  on any question which  is  not  strictly
necessary for the disposal of the particular case before it.
We, therefore, confine our attention to <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_188">Art. 14</a> and  proceed
to discuss the question on that footing.
</p><p id="p_56">   <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_189">Article 14</a> runs as follows:-
</p><p id="p_57">"   The State shall not deny to any person  equality  before
the  law  or  the equal protection of the  laws	 within	 the
territory of India."
</p><p id="p_58">It is the first of the five Articles grouped together  under
the heading " Right to Equality". - The underlying object of
this Article is undoubtedly to secure to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">		    551</span>
all persons, citizen or non-citizens, the equality of status
and  of oppotunity referred to in the glorious	preamble  of
our  Constitution.  It combines the English doctrine of	 the
rule  of law and the equal protection T. clause of the	14th
Amendment to the American Federal Constitution which enjoins
that   no  State  shall	 deny  to  any	person	within	 its
jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws ". There	can,
therefore,  be	no  doubt or dispute that  this	 Article  is
founded	 on a sound public policy recognised and  valued  in
all  civilised States.	Coming then to the language  of	 the
Article it must be noted, first and foremost that this Arti-
cle  is, in form, an admonition addressed to the  State	 and
does not directly purport to confer any right on any  person
as  some  of  the other Articles, e.g.,	 <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_190">Art.  19</a>,  do.	 The
obligation  thus imposed on the State, no doubt, enures	 for
the  benefit of all persons, for, as a necessary  result  of
the  operation	of  this Article, they	all  enjoy  equality
before	the  law.  That is, however,  the  indirect,  though
necessary  and	inevitable,  result  of	 the  mandate.	 The
command	 of  the Article is directed to the  State  and	 the
reality	 of the obligation thus imposed on the State is	 the
measure	 of the fundamental right which every person  within
the  territory	of  India is to enjoy.	The  next  thing  to
notice is that the benefit of this Article is not limited to
citizens,  but	is  available  to  any	person	within	 the
territory of India.  In the third place it is to be observed
that, by virtue of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_191">Art. 12</a>, " the State " which is, by	<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_192">Art.
14</a>,  forbidden to discriminate between persons includes	 the
Government  and Parliament of India and the  Government	 and
the legislature of each of the States and all local or other
authorities  within  the  territory of India  or  under	 the
control of the Government of India.  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_193">Article 14</a>,  therefore,
is  an	injunction to both the legislative as  well  as	 the
executive  organs  of the State and  the  other	 subordinate
authorities.  As regards the legislative organ of the State,
the fundamental right is further consolidated and  protected
by  the provisions of <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_194">Art. 13.</a>	Clause (1) of  that  Article
provides that all laws in force in the territories of  India
immediately before the commencement of the Constitution,  in
so
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">552</span>
far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of Part III
shall, to the extent of the inconsistency be void.  Likewise
el. (2) of this Article prohibits the State from making	 any
law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by the
same  Part and follows it up by saying that any law made  in
contravention  of  this clause Shall, to the extent  of	 the
contravention, be void.	 It will be observed that- so far as
this  Article  is concerned, there is no relaxation  of	 the
restriction  imposed by it such as there are in some of	 the
other  Articles, e.g., <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_195">Art. 19</a>, cls. (2) to (6).  Our  right
to  equality before the law is thus completely	and  without
any  exception secured from all legislative  discrimination.
It  is	not  necessary, for the purpose of  this  appeal  to
consider  whether an executive order is a " law" within	 the
meaning of <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_196">Art. 13</a>, for even without the aid of <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_197">Art. 13</a>	 our
right  to  the	equal protection of  the  law  is  protected
against	 the vagaries, if any, of the  executive  Government
also.  In this connection the observations of Lord Atkin  in
Eshugbayi  Eleko v. Officer Administering the Government  of
Nigeria	 (1)  are apposite.  Said his Lordship at  page	 670
that  in accordance with British jurisprudence no member  of
the executive can interfere with the liberty or property  of
a British subject except when be can support the legality of
his  act  before  a court of justice That  apart,  the	very
language  of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_198">Art. 14</a> of the Constitution  expressly  directs
that " the State ", which by <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_199">Art. 12</a> includes the  executive
organ, shall not deny to any person equality before the	 law
or  the equal protection of the law.  Thus <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_200">Art. 14</a>  protects
us  from  both legislative and executive tyranny by  way  of
discrimination.
</p><p id="p_59">Such  being  the  true	intent and effect  of  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_201">Art.  14</a>	 the
question  arises, can a breach of the obligation imposed  on
the  State be waived by any person ? In the face of such  an
unequivocal  admonition	 administered by  the  Constitution,
which  is  the supreme law of the land, is it  open  to	 the
State  to disobey the constitutional mandate merely  because
'a  person  tells  the	State that it may do  so  ?  If	 the
Constitution asks the State as
(1)  L.R. [1931] A,.C. 662.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">553</span>
<p id="p_60">to  why the State did not carry out its behest, will  it  be
any  answer for the State to make that " true, you  directed
me not to deny any person equality before the law, but	this
person	said that I could do so, for he had no objection  to
my doing it." I do not think the State will be in any better
position than the positions in which Adam found himself when
God asked him as to why he had eaten the forbidden fruit and
the  State's above answer will be as futile as was  that  of
Adam  who pleaded that the woman had tempted him and  so  he
ate  the forbidden fruit.  It seems to us absolutely  clear,
on  the language of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_202">Art. 14</a> that it is a command  issued  by
the  Constitution to the State as a matter of public  policy
with a view to implement its object of ensuring the equality
of status and opportunity which every welfare State, such as
India,	is by her Constitution expected to do and no  person
can, by any act or conduct, relieve the State of the  solemn
obligation  imposed on it by the Constitution.	 What.	ever
breach of other fundamental right a person or a citizen	 may
or  may	 not waive, he cannot certainly give up or  waive  a
breach of the fundamental right that is indirectly conferred
on him by this constitutional mandate directed to the State.
The learned Attorney General has relied on various  passages
in  text-books	written by well-known and  eminent  writers,
e.g.,  Cooley,	Willoughby, Willis and Rottschaefer  and  on
eight American decisions.  In considering the statements  of
law  made  by  American writers	 and  judges  the  following
observations  of  Patanjali Sastri, C. J., in <a href="/doc/1334665/" id="a_203">The  State  of

The  American  authorities  cited by  the  Attorney  General
relate	to  waiver of obligations under a contract,  of	 the
deprivation of right to property without due process of	 law
or  of	the constitutional right to trial by  jury  and	 the
like.  They have no bearing on the question of the waiver of
the  equal  protection clause of the 14th  Amendment  which,
like our <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_206">Art. 14</a>, is a mandate to the State.  It is signifi-
cant that no American decision is forthcoming which  upholds
the  waiver  of the breach of that clause.  When a  case  of
breach	of  any of the fundamental rights akin to  what	 are
dealt  with in the American authorities will come before  us
it  will,  then,  be  the  time	 for  us  to  discuss  those
authorities  and  to  consider their  applicability  in	 the
matter of the interpretation of the corresponding provisions
of  our Constitution.  For the moment we prefer	 to  confine
our observations to a consideration of waiver of the  breach
of the fundamental right under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_207">Art. 14.</a>
</p><p id="p_64">Learned	 Attorney General has relied on three  decisions  of
this  Court:  (1) <a href="/doc/108021/" id="a_208">Laxmanappa Hanumantappa Jamkhandi  v.	 The
Union  of India</a> (2), (2) <a href="/doc/763703/" id="a_209">Dewan Bahadur Seth Gopal Das  Mohta
v.  The Union of India</a> (3) and (3) <a href="/doc/1108730/" id="a_210">Baburao Narayanrao  Sanas
v.  The	 Union of India</a>(4) in support of his thesis  that  a
breach	of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_211">Art. 14</a> may well be waived by a person.  In	none
of  those cases, all of which were disposed of on  the	same
day   (October	21,  1954)  was	 the  question	 of   waiver
specifically  or  seriously discussed.	As  learned  counsel
appearing  for the intervener points out, the first  of	 the
above mentioned cases proceeded on the footing that as	<a href="/doc/1405898/" id="a_212">Art.
265</a>  was not a fundamental right conferred by Part  III,  it
could  not be enforced under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_213">Art. 32.</a>  Learned	counsel	 for
the  intervener further submitted that the decision  in	 the
2nd  case  mentioned above could also be explained  on	that
basis and on -the further ground that proceeding under	<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_214">Art.

</p><p id="p_67">intended  to  be  used	for  obtaining	relief	against	 the
voluntary action of a person and that appropriate remedy for
recovery  of money lay in a suit.  The decision in  the	 3rd
case  proceeded	 on  the same basis and did  not  carry	 the
matter any further.  It is impossible to treat any of  those
decisions  as  representing the considered opinion  of	this
Court  on  the	question  of  waiver  of  a  breath  of	 the
fundamental  right  under  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_215">Art.	 14</a>  of	 the   Constitution.
Reference  was also made by the learned Attorney General  to
the  decision of a Single Judge of the Allahabad High  Court
in  <a href="/doc/227612/" id="a_216">Subedar v. State</a> (1) where it was held that	 <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_217">Art.  20(3)</a>
conferred  merely a privilege and that such privilege  could
always	be waived It was overlooked that if a person  volun-
tarily answered any question then there was no breach of his
fundamental right at all, for the fundamental right is	that
a  person  shall not be compelled  to  incriminate  himself.
That  case, therefore, is not a case of waiver at all.	 The
case of <a href="/doc/1399611/" id="a_218">Pakhar Singh v. The State</a> (2) is also, for the	same
reason, not a case of waiver.
</p><p id="p_68">Be.  (2):  The answer to this question	depends	 upon  facts
which  have not been properly investingated.  The appeal  is
against the order of the income tax authorities which  order
makes  no  reference  to the plea of  waiver.	Further	 the
filing of the statements of case having been dispensed with,
we  have  not had the benefit of the statement of  facts  on
which  this plea is said to be founded.	 The view  taken  on
question (1), however, relieves us of the necessity of going
into this question.
</p><p id="p_69">On  a consideration of the nature of the  fundamental  right
flowing from <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_219">Art. 14</a>, we have no doubt in our mind that	 it-
is  not	 for a citizen or any other person who	benefits  by
reason	of  its	 provisons  to	waive  any  breach  of	 the
obligation on the part of the State.  We are, therefore,  of
the  opinion that this appeal should be accepted, the  order
of  the	 Income Tax Commissioner, Delhi, dated	January	 29,
1958,  should be set aside and all proceedings	now  pending
for  implementation  of the order of  the  Union  Government
dated July 5, 1954,

get the costs of this appeal.
</p><p id="p_72">BHAGWATI,  J.-I	 agree with the reasoning  adopted  and	 the
conclusion reached in the judgments prepared by My Lord	 the
Chief  Justice and my brother, S. K. Das, J., in  regard  to
the  ultra vires character of the proceedings adopted  under
s. 8-A of the Taxation on <a href="/doc/1959284/" id="a_220">Income (Investigation	 Commission)
Act</a>,  1947  (30	 of 1947), and the  void  character  of	 the
settlement reached thereunder.	As regards the parts of	 the
judgments which deal with the question whether a fundamental
right guaranteed by the Constitution can be waived at all, I
find  myself in agreement with the judgment prepared  by  my
brother, Subba Rao, J., and am of the opinion that it is not
open to a citizen to waive the fundamental rights  conferred
by Part III of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_73">The  question of waiver came to be argued before us in	this
way.If the proceedings and the settlement under <a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_221">section	 8-A</a>
of the Act were void as aforesaid, the respondent  contended
that   the  appellant  had  waived  the	 fundamental   right
enshrined  in <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_222">Art. 14</a> of the Constitution and was  therefore
not entitled to challenge the settlement.  This was only  by
way of reply to the contention of the appellant and was	 not
set  out in proper details in any affidavit filed on  behalf
of  the respondent.  The learned Attorney-General,  however,
relied upon the application made by the appellant before the
Investigation  Commission and the contents thereof  as	also
the  payments made by the appellant from time to  time	both
before and after the pronouncement of our decision in <a href="/doc/1125816/" id="a_223">M. Ct.
Muthiah	 v.  The Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras</a>  (1)  in
order  to  support  this plea of waiver	 and  the  arguments
before	us proceeded on that basis.  No objection was  taken
by  either of the parties before us to the issue  of  waiver
being decided on such materials and the question was  argued
at  considerable length before us.  The	 arguments  moreover
extended  to the whole field of fundamental rights and	were
not confined to <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_224">Art. 14</a> only.

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">		    557</span>
<p id="p_75">We,  therefore,	 see no reason why we  should  refrain	from
pronouncing our opinion on that question.
The  preamble to our Constitution, <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_225">Art. 13</a> and the  language
in  which the fundamental rights have been enacted  lead  to
one conclusion and one conclusion only that whatever be	 the
position  in America, no distinction can be drawn  here,  as
has been attempted in the United States of America,  between
the  fundamental  rights  which may be	said  to  have	been
enacted for the benefit of the individual and those  enacted
in public interest or on grounds of public policy.  Ours  is
a  nascent  democracy.	and situated as	 we  are,  socially,
economically,  educationally  and  politically,	 it  is	 the
sacred	   duty	 of  the  Supreme  Court  to   safeguard the
fundamental  rights  which  have been  for  the	 first	time
enacted in Part III of our Constitution.  The limitations on
those  rights have been enacted in the Constitution  itself,
e.g., in Arts. 19, 33 and 34.  But unless and until we	find
the  limitations on such fundamental rights enacted  in	 the
very   provisions   of	the  Constitution,   there   is	  no
justification  whatever for importing any notions  from	 the
United	States of America or the authority of cases  decided
by  the	 Supreme Court there in order to  whittle  down	 the
plenitude of the fundamental rights enshrined in Part III of
our Constitution.
</p><p id="p_76">The genesis of the declaration of fundamental rights in	 our
Constitution can be traced to the following passage from the
Report of the Nehru Committee (1928):-
</p><p id="p_77">" Canada, Australia and South Africa have no declaration  of
rights in their Constitutions but there are various articles
to  be	found in the Constitution of the  Irish	 Free  State
which  may  properly  be grouped under the  general  head  "
fundamental  rights  ". The reason for this is	not  far  to
seek.	Ireland	 is the only country  where  the  conditions
obtaining  before  the treaty were the nearest	approach  to
those we have in India.	 The first concern of the people  of
Ireland was, as indeed it is of the people of India  to-day,
to secure fundamental rights that have been denied to  them.
The other dominions had their rise from earlier British
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">558</span>
settlements  which were supposed to have carried the law  of
England	 with  them.  Ireland was taken and kept  under	 the
rule of England against her own will and the acquisition  of
dominion status by her became a matter of treaty between the
two  nations.  We conceive that the constitutional  position
in India is very much the same.	 That India is a  dependency
of  Great  Britain cannot be denied.  That position  can  be
altered	 in one of two ways-force or mutual consent.  It  is
the  latter  in furtherance of which we are called  upon  to
recommend  the principles of a constitution for	 India.	  In
doing so it is obvious that our first care should be to have
our fundamental rights guaranteed in a manner which will not
permit their withdrawal under any circumstances."
At  the Round Table Conference that preceded the  making  of
the  Government of India Act, 1935, therefore,	the,  Indian
leaders	 pressed  for  a  Bill of  Rights  in  the  proposed
<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_226">Constitution  Act</a>, in order to bind the administration	with
certain	 declarations  of  individual  rights.	 This	was,
however,  rejected  by	the  Simon  Commission	with   these
observations:
</p><p id="p_78">"  We are aware that such provisions have been	inserted  in
many Constitutions, notably in those of the European  States
formed	after the War.	Experience, however, has  not  shown
them   to  be  of  any	great  practical  value.    Abstract
declarations  are  useless unless there exist the  will	 and
means to make them effective."
</p><p id="p_79">The  framers  of  our  Constitution  however  followed	 the
American  view represented by the famous words of  Jefferson
in preference to that expressed by the Simon Commission :-
"  The	inconveniences of the declaration are, that  it	 may
cramp  government in its useful exertions.  But the evil  of
this   is   short-lived,  moderate   and   reparable.	 The
inconveniences	of the want of a declaration are  permanent,
afflictive   and   irreparable.	  They	 are   in   constant
progression  from  bad	to  worse.   The  executive  in	 our
governments  is not the sole, it is scarcely  the  principal
object	of my jealousy.	 The tyranny of the legislatures  is
the most formidable dread...................

Constitution.
</p><p id="p_82">The object sought to be achieved was as the preamble to	 the
Constitution  states  "	 to secure  to	all  its  -citizens:
JUSTICE, social, economic and political; -]LIBERTY of status
and of opportunity; and to promote among them all FRATERNITY
assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity of	 the
Nation and <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_227">Art. 13</a> provided:-
</p><p id="p_83">"  13.	(1)  All laws in force in  the	territory  of  India
immediately before the commencement of this Constitution, in
so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of	this
Part, shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, be void.
(2)  The  State shall not make any law which takes  away  or
abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law	made
in contravention of this clause shall, to the extent of	 the
contravention, be void...........
</p><p id="p_84">" Laws in force " were defined in <a href="/doc/654960/" id="a_228">Art. 13(3)</a> to include :
"  Laws passed or made by a Legislature or  other  competent
authority in the territory of India before the	commencement
of   this   Constitution  and	not   previously   repealed,
notwithstanding	 that any such law or any part	thereof	 may
not  be	 then in operation either at all  or  in  particular
areas "
</p><p id="p_85">and  they  were	 declared  void, in  so	 far  as  they	were
inconsistent with the provisions of this Part, to the extent
of such inconsistency.	As regards laws to be enacted  after
the  commencement  of the Constitution, the  State,  in	 the
wider significance of the term as including " the Government
and   Parliament  of  India  and  the  Government  and	 the
legislature  of	 each of the States and all local  or  other
authorities  within  the  territory of India  or  under	 the
control	 of  the Government of India " (Vide  <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_229">Art.  12</a>)	 was
enjoined  not to make any law which takes away	or  abridges
the rights conferred by this Part and 'any law made in	con-
travention of this clause was to the extent of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">560</span>
contravention  declared	 void.	 It will be  seen  that	 the
prohibition  was  thus effective both against past  laws  as
well as future laws and both were equally void in so far  as
they -were " inconsistent with " or " in derogation of " the
fundamental   rights   enshrined   in  Part   III   of	 the
Constitution. no distinction was made between the past	laws
and future laws in this respect and they were declared	void
to  the	 extent of the inconsistency or the  extent  of	 the
contravention a,,; the case may be, leaving the	 unoffending
parts thereof untouched.
</p><p id="p_86">It will be also seen that under <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_230">Art. 13(2)</a> an admonition was
administered  to the State not to enact any law which  takes
away  or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and	 the
obligation thus imposed on the State enured for the  benefit
of  all	 citizens  of Bharat alike in  respect	of  all	 the
fundamental rights enacted in Part III of the  Constitution.
No  distinction	 was made in terms between  the	 fundamental
rights	said  to have been enacted for the  benefit  of	 the
individual  and those enacted in the public interest  or  on
grounds of public policy.
</p><p id="p_87">The question then arises whether a breach of the  obligation
thus  imposed on the State can be waived by a  citizen.	  To
borrow the words of My Lord the Chief Justice " In the	face
of   such   unequivocal	 admonition  administered   by	 the
Constitution,  which is the supreme law of the land,  is  it
open  to  the State to disobey	the  Constitutional  mandate
merely because a citizen told the State that it may do so  ?
if  the Constitution asks the State as to why the State	 did
not  carry  out its behest, will it be any  answer  for	 the
State to make that " True, you directed me not to take	away
or  abridge  the  rights conferred by this  Part,  but	this
citizen said that I could do so, for he had no objection  to
my doing so." I do not think the State will be in any better
position than the position in which Ad-am found himself when
God asked him as to why he had eaten the forbidden fruit and
the  State's above answer will be as futile as that of	Adam
who pleaded that the woman had tempted him and Bo he ate the
forbidden  fruit."  It is absolutely clear on a	 perusal  of
<a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_231">Art.  13(2)</a> of the Constitution that it is a  constitutional
mandate
561,
to  the	 State	'and no citizen can by any  act	 or  conduct
relieve the State of the solemn obligation imposed on it  by
<a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_232">Art. 13(2)</a> and no distinction can be made at all between the
fundamental rights enacted for the benefit of the individual
and  those enacted in the public interest or on	 grounds  of
public policy.
</p><p id="p_88">What  then  is the basis of this distinction  which  has  be
strenuously   urged  before  us	 that  there   are   certain
fundamental  rights which are enacted only for	the  private
benefit of a citizen, e.g., rights of property, which can be
waived by him and there are other fundamental rights enacted
for the public good or as a matter of public policy which it
would not be open to a citizen to waive even though he	were
affected by the breach thereof.	 Reliance is placed in	this
behalf	on  certain decisions of the Supreme  Court  of	 the
United	States of America, passages from Willoughby,  Willis
and   Rottschaeffer,  quoted  in  the  judgment	 of  T.	  L.
Venkatarama  Aiyar, J., in <a href="/doc/1683423/" id="a_233">Behram Khurshed Pesikaka  v.	 The
State of Bombay</a> (1) and the observations of the said learned
Judge in that case adopting the said distinction. (Vide	 pp.
638-643 of the Report).	 I am afraid this distinction cannot
be  accepted.  There is nothing in the terms of the  various
articles embodying the fundamental rights in Part III of our
Constitution   which  warrants	such  a	 distinction.	 The
fundamental  rights  are  enacted  with	 all  precision	 and
wherever  limitations on their exercise are thought of	they
are also similarly enacted.  Such constitutional limitations
are to be found within the terms of the articles  themselves
and  there is no justification for reading in the  terms  of
the  articles  anything more than what is  expressly  stated
therein.   There  is further this  distinction	between	 the
American  Constitution	and ours that whereas  the  American
Constitution  was  merely enacted in order to  form  a	more
perfect	  union,   establish   justice,	  insure    domestic
tranquillity,  provide	for  common  defence,  promote	 the
general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty and	 was
an outline of government and nothing more, our	Constitution
was

Equality  and  Fraternity and laid emphasis on	the  welfare
state and contained more detailed provisions,, defining	 the
rights	and also laying down restrictions thereupon  in	 the
interest of the general welfare, etc. -As observed by  Wills
in his Constitutional Law at p. 477:-
</p><p id="p_90">"The  conflict between man and the state is as old as  human
history.   For	this reason some compromise must  be  struck
between private liberty and public authority.  There is some
need  of  protecting personal liberty  against	governmental
power  and  also some need of limiting personal	 liberty  by
governmental  power.   The ideal situation is  a  matter  of
balancing  one against the other, or  adjusting	 conflicting
interests."
</p><p id="p_91">" In the United States Constitution an attempt has been made
to  strike  a proper balance between  personal	liberty	 and
social control through express limitations written into	 the
Constitution  and  interpreted	by  the	 Supreme  Court,  by
implied limitations created by the Supreme Court, and by the
development of the governmental powers of regulation,  taxa-
tion,  and eminent domain by the Supreme Court."  (Ibid	 pp.
477-478),
whereas our Constitution has expressly sought to strike	 the
balance between a written guarantee of individual rights and
the collective interests of the community by making  express
provisions  in that behalf in Part III of the  Constitution.
(Vide Gopalan v. State of Madras) (1).
</p><p id="p_92">Moreover in the matter of considering the statements of law
made  by the text book writers in America and the  dicta  of
the  judges  of	 the  Supreme Court  there  in	the  various
decisions  cited  before  us,  we  must	 bear  in  mind	 the
following  admonition  of Patanjali Sastri, C.	J.,  in	 the
<a href="/doc/1334665/" id="a_234">State of Travancore-Cochin v. The Bombay Co., Ltd</a>. (2).

commerce  and industry, and we are of opinion that not	much
help  can  be  derived	from them in  the  solution  of	 the
problems arising under <a href="/doc/433847/" id="a_235">Art. 286</a>	 of the Indian Constitution"
or   for  the  matter  of  that,  articles   embodying	 the
fundamental rights in Part III of our Constitution (see also
<a href="/doc/212098/" id="a_236">The State of Bombay v. R. M. D. Chamarbaugwala</a>(1)
The  rights conferred on citizens may be thus  classified  :
</p><p id="p_94">(i) statutory rights; (ii) constitutional rights; and  (iii)
fundamental  rights.   One need not consider  the  statutory
rights	in  this context but the constitutional	 rights	 are
those  created and conferred by the Constitution.  They	 may
or  may not be waived by a. citizen, as stated in  the	text
books  and the decisions of the Supreme Court of the  United
States	of America above referred to.  But when	 the  rights
conferred  are	put  on a high pedestal and  are  given	 the
status	of fundamental rights, which though embodied in	 the
Constitution itself are in express terms distinguished	from
the  other constitutional rights (e.g.,	 fundamental  rights
which are enshrined in Part III of the Constitution and	 are
enacted as immune from any legislation inconsistent with  or
derogatory thereto and other constitutional rights which are
enacted	 in other provisions, for instance in Arts. 265	 and
286  and  in  Part  XIII  of  the  Constitution),  they	 are
absolutely  inviolable	save  as expressly  enacted  in	 the
Constitution  and  cannot  be  waived  by  a  citizen.	 The
Constitution  adopted by our founding fathers is  sacrosanct
and  it is not permissible to tinker with those	 fundamental
rights	by any ratiocination or analogy of the decisions  of
the Supreme Court of the United States of America.  The only
manner in which that can be done is by appropriate amendment
of the Constitution and in no other manner whatever.
There is no difficulty whatever in working out this position
and to my mind the difficulties pointed out
(1)  [1957] S.C.R. 874, 918.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">564</span>
<p id="p_95">are more imaginary than real.  If a citizen wanted to assert
his fundamental right under the circumstances envisaged	 for

discretion refuse him the relief prayed for.  The remedy  is
purely	discretionary  and no Court in	those  circumstances
would  exercise @ its discretion in his favour	(<a href="/doc/763703/" id="a_239">Vide  Dewan
Bahadur Seth Gopal Das Mohta v. Union of India</a> (1),  <a href="/doc/1108730/" id="a_240">Baburao

Hoonmantappa Janakhandi v. Union of India</a> (3).	Even then he
might merely obtain a relief declaring the legislation ultra
vires the Constitution and the Court would not grant him any
consequential  relief  For  that relief	 he  would  have  to
approach  the regular courts of law, when all  questions  of
law, apart from the mere constitutionality of the  provision
would  be considered by the Court on a contest	between	 the
par. ties, e.g., estoppel, acquiescence, limitation and	 the
like (Compare our observations in <a href="/doc/1263190/" id="a_242">Sales Tax Officer, Banaras
v.  Kanayalal  Mukundlal Saraf</a> (4) ). The only	thing  which
parties	 would be concluded by would be the adjudication  as
to the ultra vire's character of the measure in question and
the  citizen  would not be entitled to	the  relief  claimed
merely for the asking.	These considerations, therefore,  do
not  militate  against the position that  a  citizen  cannot
waive the fundamental rights conferred upon him by Part	 III
of the Constitution.

have  no  application to provisions of law which  have	been

This,  in  my  opinion is the true position  and  it  cannot

</p><p id="p_104">S.   K.	 DAS J.-This is an appeal by special leave  from  an
order dated January 29, 1958, passed by the Commissioner  of
Income-tax,   Delhi,   respondent  no.	1  before   us,	  in
circumstances  which  are somewhat unusual and	out  of	 the
ordinary.   We shall presently relate  those  circumstances;
but  at the very outset it may be stated that two  questions
of  far-reaching importance fall for consideration  in	this
appeal.	  One is the validity of a settlement made under <a href="/doc/1403203/" id="a_244"> s.
8A</a> of the Taxation on <a href="/doc/1959284/" id="a_245">Income (Investigation Commission) Act</a>,
1947 (30 of 1947) hereinafter referred to as the Act,  after
the  coming  into force of the Constitution on	January	 26,
1950, and the second is if a fundamental right guaranteed by
the  Constitution  can be said to have been  waived  by	 the
appellant in the circumstanoes of this case.
'The  appellant before us is Basheshar Nath, whom  we  shall
hereafter call the assessee.  As we have already stated, the
Commissioner of Income-tax, Delhi, is the first	 respondent,
The second respondent
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">566</span>
is  the Union of India.	 We also allowed the Model  Knitting
Industries, a limited liability Company with its  registered
office	in  Calcutta,  to intervene in the  appeal,  on	 the
ground	that the intervening Company has a case	 pending  in
the  High Court of Calcutta where the same questions are  in
issue.	We have also heard the intervener in support of	 the
appeal.
</p><p id="p_105">On  behalf of the appellant it has been' contended that	 the
Commissioner of Income-tax, Delhi, is a tribunal within	 the
meaning	 of  Art,  136 of  the	Constitution  and  exercised
judicial  functions  when it passed the	 impugned  order  of
January	 29,  1958.  The respondents pointed  out,  however,
that  the  so-called  order was nothing but  a	reply  which
respondent no.	1 gave to a communication received, from the
assessee.  However, the respondents have waived any prelimi-
nary objection to the maintainability of the present appeal,
and   the  learned  Attorney  General  appearing   for	 the
respondents has frankly stated before us that he is  raising
no  such preliminary objection, as the Union  Government  is
equally	 anxious  to have a decision on the  question,	very
important  from	 its  point of view  and  with	far-reaching
financial  consequences,  as to whether	 a  settlement	made
under <a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_246"> s.  8A</a>  of the Act after January 26,  1950,  and	 the
orders passed thereon by the Union Government are valid.  We
have,  therefore, proceeded on the footing that the  present
appeal	is competent, and have considered it unnecessary  to
decide	in the abstract the more general question as to	 the
circumstances in which an order made by a revenue  authority
like   the  Commissioner  of  Income-tax  partakes  of	 the
character of A judicial or quasi-judicial order.
Now,  for the facts and circumstances which have led  up  to
this  appeal.  <a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_247">The Act</a> received the assent of the  Governor-
General	 on  April 18, 1947, and came into force on  May  1,
1947.	On  July  22, 1948, the case  of  the  assessee	 was
referred  to the Investigation Commission, constitued  under
s.  3 of the Act.  The reference was made under<a href="/doc/161822037/" id="a_248"> s.  5(1)</a>  of
the  Act,  and it ,stated that the  Central  Government	 had
prima  facie reasons for believing that the assessee  either
alone or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">		    567</span>
in  combination	 with'	other  persons	evaded	payment	  of
taxation  on income to a substantial extent,  and  therefore
the  case  of  the asseesee was sent  to  the  Investigation
Commission  for	 investigation and report.   The  period  of
investigation was from April 1, 1939 to March 31, 1947.	 The
report	of the Investigation Commission which has been	made
available to us shows that the case against the assessee was
that he carried on a business of supplying tents,  executing
contract works, and commission agency for some textile mills
on  a  fairly  extensive scale,	 both  individually  and  in
partnership  With  his brother.	 It appears that  the  total
wealth	statement of the assessee was filed on November	 10,
1948, and was forwarded to an authorised official  appointed
under <a href="/doc/174382300/" id="a_249"> s. 6(3)</a> of the Act.  From January 8, 1949 to  October
14,  1949  the	authorized  official  was  engaged  in	 the
collection  of assessment records of the assessee  from	 the
income-tax  authorities	 and  of materials  from  the  Civil
Supplies  Directorate.	 On July 5, 1949, the  total  wealth
statement was received back from the assessee and the order-
,sheet	shows  that  on May 26, 1950, (that  is,  after	 the
coming	into  force  of	 the  Constitution)  the  authorised
official is-sued a notice to the assessee fixing the hearing
for June 10, 1950.  The assessee then asked for time, and it
appears	 that for a period of about three years	 till  June,
1953, nothing was done.	 Thereafter, the authorised official
held a preliminary investigation and computed intially	that
the  undisclosed income ,of the assessee for the  period  in
question   was	Rs.  12,07,000;	 on  further  scrutiny	 and
examination  of	 accounts and after heating  the  assessee's
explanation,  the authorised official reduced the amount  in
his  final  report, submitted sometime towards	the  end  of
1953,	to  Rs.	 9,56,345.   The  Investigation	  Commission
considered the report of the authorised official, heard	 the
assessee,  and came to the conclusion that the total  amount
to  be	assessed  in  the hands	 of  the  assessee  was	 Rs'
4,47,915.    In	 their	report	dated  May  24,	  1954	 the
Investigation Commission said:
</p><p id="p_106">"   During the course of the hearing before us,the  assessee
as well as his Auditors applied for a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">568</span>
settlement after admitting liability for the aforesaid	sum.
In  the	 circumstances, we consider it proper to  allow	 the
assessee   the	benefit	 of  a	settlement  on	 the   lower
concessional basis of 75% of evaded income payable by way of
tax and a moderate penalty of Rs, 14,064....... The assessee
accepting our findings both as regards the amount of  income
that  escaped assessment and the amount of tax	and  penalty
payable, offered a settlement.	In the circumstances, we re-
commend	 the acceptance by the Government of the  assessee's
offer of a settlement."
</p><p id="p_107">The  Central Government accepted the settlement under<a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_250"> s.  8A</a>
of  the	 Act and on July 5, 1954, passed an order  under <a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_251"> s.
8A(2)</a> directing the issue of a demand notice by the  Income-
tax  Officer concerned for a sum of Rs. 3,50,000  (including
the  penalty  of  Rs. 14,064) on the  assessee	and  further
directing that " all such other proceedings under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_252">Indian
Income-tax Act</a> or under any other law, as may be  necessary,
should be taken with a view to enforcing the payment of	 the
demand	and the terms and conditions of settlement."  Though
under the terms of settlement no instalments were given,  it
appears	 that the assessee was allowed to pay the amount  at
the rate of Rs. 5,000 per month.  It further appears that up
to and including September 8, 1957, the assessee had paid in
all a sum of Rs. 1,28,000 towards the demand.  In  December,
1955 was given the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1125816/" id="a_253">M. CT.  Muthiah
v. The Commissioner of Income</a> tax, Madras (1), in which	 the
majority  of Judges held that<a href="/doc/161822037/" id="a_254"> s. 5(1)</a> of the Act  was  ultra
vires  the  Constitution,  as  it  was	discriminatory	 and
violative of the fundamental right guaranteed by <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_255">Art. 14</a>  of
the Constitution by reason of two amendments which were made
in <a href="/doc/1306401/" id="a_256"> s. 34</a> of the Indian Income-tax Act 1922-one in  1948  by

(Amendment) Act</a>, 1948 (48 of 1948) and the other in 1954  by
the enactment of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_258">Indian Income-tax (Amendment) Act</a>, 1954
(33  of	 1954).	 Sometime earlier than the  aforesaid  deci-
sion, the Income-tax Officer concerned had sent a
(1)  [1955] 2 S.C.R. 1247,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">		    569</span>
recovery  certificate to the Collector, New Delhi,  and	 the
assessee  stated that in execution of the  said	 certificate
his  properties	 situated  in  Dharamsala  and	Hissar	were
attached.   On	December  27, 1957,  the  assessee  filed  a
petition  to  the Income-tax Commissioner, Delhi,  in  which
after stating the relevant facts, the assessee claimed that,
after  the  decision in Muthiah's case (1),  the  settlement
made under<a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_259"> s. 8A</a> of the Act had no force and was not binding
on   him:  the	assessee  then	prayed	that  the   attached
properties  should  be	released  from	attachment  and	 the
amounts recovered under the terms of settlement refunded  to
him.   On January 29, 1958, the Commissioner  of  Income-tax
sent the following reply-
</p><p id="p_108">"  With reference to your petition dated 27th December	1957
regarding  the settlement arrived at under <a href="/doc/1403203/" id="a_260">section 8A(2)</a>  of
the Taxation on <a href="/doc/1959284/" id="a_261">Income (Investigation Commission) Act</a>, 1947,
1 am to inform you that the settlement is valid and  binding
on you.
</p><p id="p_109">2.   You are' therefore, requested to make good the  arrears
of  instalments	 which	you have not paid  recently  by	 5th
February,  1958 and also to continue making the payments  in
accordance  with the instalments' scheme agreed to,  failing
which  the recovery proceedings will be	 vigorously  pursued
through the usual recovery channels."
</p><p id="p_110">The assessee asked for and obtained special leave from	this
Court  on  February 17, 1958, to appeal from  the  aforesaid
order.	In the appeal as orginally filed in pursuance of the
special	 leave granted to the assessee, the  prayer  portion
was  inadvertently  left out.	Subsequently,  the  assessee
prayed	that-(a) the report of the Investigation  Commission
dated  May 24, 1954, be quashed, (b) the settlement made  on
the  basis  of the report and the directions  given  by	 the
Central Government in pursuance thereof and the	 proceedings
for  recovery of arrears of tax be all quashed, and (c)	 the
amounts	 already  recovered may be ordered to  be  refunded.
With  regard to the last prayer, we may state here  that  it
was not pressed before us and we are relieved from the task,
at least in this appeal, of
(1)  [1955] 2 S.C.R. 1247.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">72</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">570</span>
<p id="p_111">deciding in what circumstances and on what considerations  a
refund of tax voluntarily paid can be claimed.
Therefore, the first and foremost question before us is	 the
validity  of the settlement made under<a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_262"> S. 8A</a> of	 ,-the	Act.
On behalf of the assessee the main argument is that<a href="/doc/161822037/" id="a_263"> s.	5(1)</a>
of  the Act having been held ultra vires  the  Constitution,
the  very  foundation for the report  of  the  Investigation
Commission has disappeared and a settlement based thereon is
neither	 valid,	 nor can it be enforced.  On behalf  of	 the
respondents, the learned Attorney General has contended that
there  is no decision of this Court which has held  that <a href="/doc/161822037/" id="a_264"> s.
5(1)</a> of the Act is wholly void and on a proper	construction
of  the various sections of the Act, it will be	 found	that
there	are   two  separate  and  distinct   procedures	  or
jurisdictions which the Investigation Commission may  follow
or  exercise: one is investigation and the other relates  to
settlement.    He  has	submitted  that	  the	jurisdiction
conferred on the Investigation Commission under<a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_265"> s. 8A</a>, which
was inserted in the Act in 1949 by<a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_266"> s. 33</a> of Act 67 of  1949,
is  not affected by the decision in Muthiah's case (1),	 and
if   the  Investigation	 Commission  had   jurisdiction	  to
entertain  an application from the assessee for	 settlement,
approve of the same, and refer it to the Central Government,
the  latter  had also jurisdiction to accept it	 under	sub-
s.(1) and make necessary orders under sub.s. (2) of<a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_267"> s. 8A</a>.In
short, the argument of the learned Attorney General is	that
there is nothing in Muthiah's decision (1), which renders<a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_268"> s.
8A</a> constitutionally invalid.
</p><p id="p_112">It  is	necessary  to  read  at	 this  stage  the   relevant
provisions  of	the  Act in so far as  they  bear  upon	 the
problems  before  us.  We have said that the Act  came	into
force on May 1, 1947.  This was before the coming into force
of  the	 Constitution  of  India, and  no  question  of	 the
violation  of  any  fundamental	 rights	 guaranteed  by	 the
Constitution  arose  on	 that date.  <a href="/doc/4472878/" id="a_269">Section 3</a>	of  the	 Act

(1) became void and unenforceable as being discriminatory in
character.   It was further held that when an Act was  valid
in  its entirety before the date of the	 Constitution,	that
part  of the proceedings regulated by the special  procedure
and  taken during the pre-Constitution period could  not  be
questioned  how. ever discriminator it might have been,	 but
the  discriminatory procedure could not be  continued  after
the  coming  into force of the Constitution.  In  that	case
(Meenakshi Mills' case(1)) the Investigation Commission	 had
not even commenced the proceedings though a period of  seven
years had elapsed and the investigation was pending when the
writ  petitions were filed.  In those circumstances  it	 was
held   that   the  proceedings	before	 the   Investigation
Commission  which had become discriminatory could no  longer
be continued.  Then came the decision in <a href="/doc/1125816/" id="a_306">M. CT.	 Muthiah  v.
The,  Commissioner  of	Income-tax,  Madras</a>(2).	  The  facts
relevant  to  that  decision  were  that  the  Investigation
Commission held an enquiry into three cases and submitted  a
report	on August 26, 1952, finding a particular sum  to  be
the undisclosed income during the investigation period.	 The
Central	 Government accepted the report and passed an  order
under <a href="/doc/38185116/" id="a_307"> s.  8(2)</a> of the Act on September 16,  1952.   Notices
under <a href="/doc/1306401/" id="a_308"> s. 34</a> of the Indian Income-tax Act were	then  issued
and  reassessments  except  for one year were  made  on	 the
findings of the Commission, which were treated as final	 and
conclusive.   The  re-assessment orders were served  on	 the
assessees  in February and May 1954.  On December  6,  1954,
the  assessees	filed their writ petitions  challenging	 the
constitutionality  of<a href="/doc/161822037/" id="a_309"> S. 5</a> (1) of the Act.  It was  held  by

cases  which were already concluded by reports made  by	 the
Commission and directions given by Government before January
26, 1950, the cases which were pending before the commission
for   investigation  as	 also  assessment  or	reassessment

</p><p id="p_141">Now, we come back to the problems before us: (1) what is the
effect of Muthia's decision(1) in the present ease, and	 (2)
does  the  Act contemplate two separate	 and  distinct,	 but
severable,  procedures	or jurisdictions  -one	relating  to
investigation and the other to settlement, so that the	vice
of  discrimination  (if any) attaches to  the  investigation
procedure only and not to the other ?
</p><p id="p_142">We  do not see how the learned Attorney General	 can  escape
from  the  position  that Muthia's  decision  (1)  holds  in
express terms that<a href="/doc/161822037/" id="a_316"> s. 5</a> (1) of the Act was hit by <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_317">Art. 14</a> of
the  Constitution on and after January 26, 1950.  The  ratio
of the decision was thus explained in the majority  judgment
at page 1260, 1261:-
</p><p id="p_143">"  After the 8th September, 1948, there were two  procedures
simultaneously	in operation, the one under Act XXX of	1947
and the other under the Indian Income tax Act with reference
to persons who fell within the same class or category, viz.,
that  of the substantial evaders of income-tax.	  After	 the
8th September, 1948, therefore, some persons who fell within
the  class of substantial evaders of income-tax	 were  dealt
with  under  the drastic and  summary  procedure  prescribed
under Act XXX of 1947, while other

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">73</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">578</span>
<p id="p_144">persons	 who  fell  within the	same  class  of	 substantial
evaders	 of  income-tax	 could	be  dealt  with	 under	 the
procedure  prescribed  in the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_318">Indian  Income-tax  Act</a>  after
service of notice upon them under the amended <a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_319">section 34</a> (1)
of  the	 Act.  Different persons, though falling  under	 the
same class or category of substantial evaders of income-tax,
would, therefore, be subject to different procedures, one  a
summary	 and  drastic  procedure  and  the  other  a  normal
procedure  which gave to the assessees various rights  which
were  denied to those who were specially treated  under	 the
procedure prescribed in Act XXX of 1947.
</p><p id="p_145">The  legislative competence being there,  these	 provisions,
though discriminatory, could not have been challenged before
the   advent  of  the  Constitution.   When,  however,	 the
Constitution came into force on the 26th January, 1950,	 the
citizens  obtained the fundamental rights enshrined in	Part
III  of the Constitution including the right to equality  of
laws  and  equal protection of laws enacted  in	 <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_320">article  14</a>
thereof,  and  whatever may have been  the  position  before
January	 26,  1950, it was open to the	persons	 alleged  to
belong to the class of substantial evaders thereafter to ask
as  to	why some of them were subjected to the	summary	 and
drastic	 procedure prescribed in Act XXX of 1947 and  others
were subjected to the normal procedure prescribed in <a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_321">section
34</a>  and the cognate sections of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_322">Indian  Income-tax	Act</a>,
the procedure prescribed in Act XXX of 1947 being  obviously
discriminatory and, therefore, violative of the	 fundamental
right guaranteed under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_323">article 14</a> of the Constitution."
That ratio is equally applicable in the present case, and if
s. 5(1) of the Act is unenforceable after January 26,  1950,
the reference made thereunder against the assessee must also
fall after that date and with it must go overboard all	that
was done under the drastic and summary procedure  prescribed
under the Act after January 26,1950.  Two possible arguments
that  (1) substantial evaders whose s were referred  by	 the
Central Government for investigation by the Commission
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">		    579</span>
before	September 1, 1948, formed a class by themselves	 and
(2)  that proceedings having started before  the  Commission
under a reference valid at the time when it was made  cannot
be  affected by any subsequent amendment of  the  Income-tax
Art,  1922,  were  raised, but not accepted  in	 Suraj	Mall
Mohta's	 Meenakshi  Mills'  or Muthia's case  (1)  (2)	(3).
There  has  been some argument before us as to how  the	 two
procedures-one	prescribed under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_324">Income-tax	 Act</a>,  1922,
and  the other under the Act-compare and contrast with	each
other;	but  this is a point which was	canvassed  at  great
length	in  each of the three cases mentioned  above.	This
Court	found  in  unequivocal	terms  that  the   procedure
prescribed  under the Act was more summary and drastic,	 and
in  Suraj  Mall	 Mohta's case  the  substantial	 differences
between the two procedures were summarised at pp. 463-466 of
the  report.   We do not propose to cover  the	same  ground
again, but cop-tent ourselves with drawing attention to what
was  pointedly said in Suraj Mall Mohta's case namely,	that
it  was conceded on behalf of Government that the  procedure
prescribed by the impugned Act in<a href="/doc/128858156/" id="a_325"> ss. 6</a> and <a href="/doc/112968079/" id="a_326">7</a>, which we have
read earlier, was more drastic than the procedure prescribed
in <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_327"> ss.	 37</a>  and <a href="/doc/356467/" id="a_328">38</a> of the Indian Income-tax  Act.   It	 was
stated	 therein  that	though	in  the	 first	 stages	  of
investigation  there  was some similarity  between  the	 two
procedures, the overall picture was not the same.
The learned Attorney General has not seriously contested the
correctness  of this position, but has argued that  what  we
are  concerned	with  in the present case is  not  the	mere
possibility  of a differential treatment, but what  actually
was  done  by  the Commission in the  case  of	the  present
assessee after January 26, 1950.  He has submitted that	 the
assessee was not subjected to any differential treatment  in
fact,  and has invoked to his aid the ratio of our  decision
in <a href="/doc/1063853/" id="a_329">Syed Qasim Razvi v. The State of Hyderabad</a> (4), where the
majority  judgment laid down the following tests: in a	case
where part of the trial cannot be challenged as

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">580</span>
<p id="p_148">bad, it is incumbent on the court to consider, first whether
the  discriminatory provisions of the law can  be  separated
from  the  rest	 and even without them	a  fair	 measure  of
equality  in  the matter of procedure can  be  secured,	 and
secondly,  whether the procedure -actually followed 'did  or
did  not, proceed upon the discriminatory provisions and  it
was  stated  that a; mere threat or possibility	 of  unequal
treatment  was not sufficient to invalidate  the  subsequent
proceedings.   A  reference was there made  to	the  earlier
decisions,  of this Court in <a href="/doc/656658/" id="a_330">Keshavan Madhava Xenon  v.	 The
State  of Bombay</a> (1), and <a href="/doc/1691358/" id="a_331">Lachmandas Kewalram Ahuja  v.	 The
State  of Bombay</a> (2 ), and the decision in  Lachmandas	case
(supra), again a majority decision, was distinguished on two
grounds: first, the question as to whether after eliminating
the  discriminatory  provisions	 it was	 still	possible  to
secure a fair measure of equality with the normal  procedure
was neither raised nor considered ; secondly, it was assumed
that  it was not possible to proceed with the trial  without
following the discriminatory procedure and as that procedure
became	void on the coming into force of  the  Constitution,
the jurisdiction to proceed under that procedure came to  an
end.  Applying the tests laid down in the majority  decision
of Syed Qasim Razvi's case (3), the learned Attorney General
has  contended that in the present case	 the  discriminatory
provisions  can be separated from the rest of the  Act,	 and
the assessee was not in fact subjected to any discriminatory
procedure.   He has sought to distinguish Muthia's  case  on
the same ground, viz., that the re-assessments made in	that
case were actually based on a discriminatory procedure.
In our view the ratio of the majority decision in Syed Qasim
Razvi's	 case (3) has no application in the case  under	 our
consideration,	and the principle which applies is what	 was
laid down in Lachmandas's case (2). The majority decision is
Syed  Qasim Razvi's case proceeded on the finding (to  quote
the  words  of	Mukherjea, J., who  delivered  the  majority
judgment)  that " although there were deviations in  certain
particulars,
(1) [1951] S. C. R. 228.	   (2) [1952] S. C. R. 71O.
(.3) [1953] S. C. R. 589.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">		    581</span>
<p id="p_149">the  accused  had  substantially the  benefit  of  a  normal
trial".	  The minority judgments, however, very	 pertinently
pointed	 out  that  the discriminatory	provisions  were  an
integral  part	of the Regulation under	 which	the  accused
person in that case was tried and in fact the discriminatory
provisions were applied.  Bose, J. (as he then was expressed
the  view  (at p. 618) " that in testing the validity  of  a
law,  it is irrelevant to consider what has been done  under
it,  for  a  law is either constitutional  or  not  and	 the
validity  or  otherwise	 cannot depend upon  what  has	been
accomplished under its provisions."
</p><p id="p_150">It  is,	 we think, unnecessary to go  into  the	 controversy
which arises out -of the two views expressed above.  For the
present	 case,	it  is	sufficient  to	say  that  (1)	 the
discriminatory	provisions  are	 an  integral  part  of	 the
procedure prescribed under the Act which cannot be separated
from  the  rest; and (2) we are satisfied  that	 the  report
which  led to the settlement was made by  the  Investigation
Commission  in	pursuance of and as a direct result  of	 the
discriminatory	procedure  which it followed.	Indeed,	 the
Investigation  Commission  followed the	 only  procedure  of
investigation prescribed under the Act, which was a  drastic
and summary procedure, and if that procedure became void  on
the coming into force of the Constitution, the	jurisdiction
of  the Investigation Commission practically came to an	 end
(see Lachmandas's case, supra).
</p><p id="p_151">It  is	necessary to explain here why we cannot	 accept	 the
contention  of the learned Attorney General that  there	 are
two procedures or two jurisdictions under the Act.  What  in
substance is the effect of the provisions of the Act, in  so
far as they relate to the Commission's duty under<a href="/doc/4472878/" id="a_332"> s. 3</a>	(b)?
The  Commission	 receives a reference under<a href="/doc/161822037/" id="a_333"> s. 5</a> (1)  if  it
does  not proceed under<a href="/doc/161822037/" id="a_334"> s. 5</a> (2), it exercises such  of	 its
powers	under <a href="/doc/128858156/" id="a_335"> s.  6</a> as it  considers  necessary.   It	then
follows	 the  procedure laid down in<a href="/doc/112968079/" id="a_336"> s. 7</a>  and	submits	 its
report	under<a href="/doc/38185116/" id="a_337"> s. 8</a>. On that report, the	 Central  Government
takes  action  under<a href="/doc/38185116/" id="a_338"> s. 8</a> (2).	If,  however,  the  assessee
applies	 for settlement, even then the Commission  has	the,
duty to report to Government if the terms of settlement are
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">582</span>
approved  by it.  To fulfil this duty, the  Commission	must
get the materials by exercising its powers under<a href="/doc/128858156/" id="a_339"> s. 6</a> and by
following  the procedure laid down in<a href="/doc/112968079/" id="a_340"> s. 7</a>. That is  exactly
what  was done in the present case.  An authorised  official
was  asked to examine the accounts etc. under<a href="/doc/128858156/" id="a_341"> s. 6</a> (3).	  He
examined  the  accounts and submitted an interim  report  in
1953.	He followed the procedure laid down in the Act	with
regard to inspection of documents, examination of  witnesses
etc.  He then submitted a final report.	 The Commission then
heard the assesee on May 19, 1954, and reserved orders.	  On
May 20, 1954, after the assessee knew what the final finding
of  the Commission was going to be, he filed an	 application
for  settlement.  The Commission made its final report	four
days  after.   It  is difficult to  understand	how  in	 the
circumstances  stated  above,  it  can	be  said  that	 the
Commission  followed a non-discriminatory procedure or	that
it  had two jurisdictions-one relating to investigation	 and
the  other to settlement.  The jurisdiction was really	one,
and  the  procedure followed also the same.  It	 is  not  as
though the Act provided a separate procedure for purposes of
effecting  a  settlement;  nor	is  this  a  case  where   a
settlement  has	 been  made  without  applying	any  of	 the
provisions relating to investigation.  A full  investigation
was  made, and after the assessee had been subjected to	 the
drastic	 and  summary procedure under the Act, he  was	told
what the result of the investigation was.  Then, he made  an
application  for  settlement,  which  was  approved  by	 the
Commission under<a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_342"> s. 8A</a>.
</p><p id="p_152">We  are	 accordingly of the view that the  learned  Attorney
General	 has failed to make out his case that  (1)  Muthia's
decision (1) does not apply and (2) the settlement under <a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_343"> s.
8A</a> of the Act is a legally valid settlement by reason of the
severability   or  non-application  of	the   discriminatory
procedure under the Act in the case of the assessee..
This  brings me to the second question, that of waiver of  a
fundamental  right, which is as important as it is  complex.
It is a question on which unfortunately we

<p id="p_153">have  not been able to achieve unanimity.  It is beset	with
this initial difficulty that the present appeal is not	from
a  judgment  or order rendered after the trial	of  properly
framed issues; it is from an order which merely rejected the
prayer	of  the	 assessee that his  properties	attached  in
execution of the recovery certificate should be released and
the amounts paid under the terms of the settlement refunded.
The  question of waiver was neither raised, nor	 tried;	 and
the  necessary facts were not ascertained or  determined  by
the revenue authority concerned.  Unfortunately, the  filing
of  a  statement  of  their case by  the  parties  was	also
dispensed  with,  the  result  whereof	has  been  that	 the
question of waiver has been urged for the first time in	 the
course	of  arguments here.  We have,  however,	 heard	full
arguments  on  it,  and	 proceed  to  consider	it  on	such
materials as have been placed before us.  It is necessary to
make one point clear.  The respondents have raised the	plea
of  waiver, and the onus lies heavily on them  to  establish
the essential requirements in support of the plea.
Two   points  arise  in	 this  connection:  (1)	  have	 the
respondents  established,  on the materials before  us,	 the
necessary  facts on which a plea of waiver can be founded  ;
and  (2)  if so, can a fundamental right guaranteed  by	 the
Constitution  be  waived  at all.  If  the  first  point  is
answered  in  the  negative, the second point  need  not  be
answered in the abstract.  On behalf of the respondents,  it
has  been submitted that assuming (without  conceding)	that
the discriminatory provisions of the Act were applied in the
case  of the assessee before he asked for a settlement,	 the
materials  on  record -show that he never  objected  to	 the
procedure  adopted, voluntarily asked for a settlement,	 got
by the settlement the benefit. of reducing his liability for
both  tax and penalty, and paid without demur the  following
instalments (some even after Muthia's decision (1) )

</pre><p id="p_154">The  learned  Attorney	General	 has  in  this-	  connection
referred  us  to the application for  settlement  which	 the
assessee  had made to the Commission, wherein the  following
statements were made:-
</p><p id="p_155">"  in view of the fact that though no  disclosure  statement
had  been made before the submission of his reports  by	 the
authorised  official,, still during the enquiry	 before	 the
Commission,,  the assessee and his auditors  admitted  their
liability  to  tax in respect of the aforesaid	sum  of	 Rs.
4,47,915,  the	Commission  was	 of  the  opinion  that	 the
assessee  should be granted the benefit of a  settlement  on
the  lower concessional basis of payment of 75 per cent.  of
the  undisclosed income by way of tax.	The  Commission	 was
also  of the opinion that the assessee should pay by way  of
penalty a sum of Rs. 14,064.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">		    585</span>
<p id="p_156">The  assessee accepts the conclusions of the  Commission  as
regards	 the amount of income that escaped  assessment,	 the
tax payable thereon and the penalty payable as aforesaid."
On  the	 basis	of these statements,  the  learned  Attorney
General	 has  argued  that there is no	foundation  for	 the
suggestion   made  on  behalf  of  the	assessee  that	 the
application for settlement was made " under the pressure  of
circumstances  and in view of the coercive machinery of	 the
Act." He has submitted that the necessary facts on which the
plea of waiver is founded have been established, and he	 has
relied on three cases decided by this Court, where according
to him the effect of the decisions was to accept such a plea
in circumstances very similar: <a href="/doc/763703/" id="a_344">Dewan Bahadur Seth Gopal	 Das
Mohta v. The Union of India</a>(1); <a href="/doc/1108730/" id="a_345">Baburao Narayanrao Sanas  v.
The   Union  of	 India</a>	(2);  and  <a href="/doc/108021/" id="a_346">Laxnanappa	Hanumantappa
Jamkhandi  v.  The  Union  of India</a> (3)	 On  behalf  of	 the
assessee, it is contended on the contrary that the necessary
facts  to found a plea of waiver are totally absent  in	 the
present	 case,	and none of the	 aforesaid  three  decisions
which were all pronounced on the same day proceed on a	plea
of waiver.
</p><p id="p_157">Two  of	 the three decisions referred to above relate  to  a
settlement  made under<a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_347"> s. 8A</a> and the third to an order	made
under <a href="/doc/38185116/" id="a_348"> s.  8(2)</a> of the Act.  All the  three  decisions	were
pronounced  on	applications  made  under  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_349">Art.	 32</a>  of	 the
Constitution,  and  not on any appeal from an order  of	 the
revenue	 authority.   In  Gopal Das  Mohta's  case  (1)	 the
argument  urged was, inter alia, that<a href="/doc/161822037/" id="a_350"> ss. 5</a>, <a href="/doc/128858156/" id="a_351">6</a>, <a href="/doc/112968079/" id="a_352">7</a> and  <a href="/doc/38185116/" id="a_353">8</a>  of
the Act were invalid and ultra vires as they contravened the
provisions  of	Arts.  14,  19	(1)  (f),  and	31  of	 the
Constitution  and  the	prayer	made  was  that	 the  entire
proceedings should be quashed as also all orders made by the
Central	 Government in pursuance of the settlement under <a href="/doc/51730711/" id="a_354"> s.
8A</a>.   In rejecting the argument and prayer, Mahajan, C.	 J.,
who delivered the , judgment of the Court said at p. 776-

<p id="p_158">"  In  our judgment this petition  is  wholly  misconceived.
Whatever tax the petitioner has already paid, or whatever is
still recoverable from him, is being recovered on the  basis
of  the	 settlement  proposed by him  and  accepted  by	 the
Central Government.  Because Of his request for a settlement
no assessment was made against him by following the whole of
the  -procedure	 of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_355">Income-tax Act</a>.	 In  this  situation
unless	and  until  the petitioner can	establish  that	 his

thereby	 he  cannot  complain that any	of  his	 fundamental
rights	has been contravened for which he can  claim  relief
under  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_356">art.  32</a> of the Constitution.  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_357">Article 32</a>  of  ',,the
Constitution   is  not	intended  for  relief  against	 the
voluntary actions of a person.	His remedy, if any, lies  in
other appropriate proceedings."
</p><p id="p_159">There  has been a good deal of argument before us as to	 the
true  effect of the decision in Gopal Das Mohta's case	(1).
While  I recognise that the reason stated for the  decision,
viz.,  that  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_358">Art.  32</a> is not  intended	for  relief  against
voluntary  actions  of a person, comes very near  to  saying
that  a	 person has waived his protection in  a	 given	case
since  whatever	 injury he may incur is due to his  own	 act
rather	than  to  the  enforcement  of	an  unconstitutional
measure	 against him, I am unable to hold that the  decision
proceeded strictly on the doctrine of waiver; it is  perhaps
true  to say that some of the observations made therein	 are
of a " Delphic nature to be translated into concreteness  by
the process of litigating elucidation" (to borrow the  words
of Frankfurter, J., in Machinists v. Gonzales (2).  It seems
to  me	that the decision proceeded more upon the  scope  of
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_359">Art. 32</a> than upon the doctrine of waiver.  I am fortified in
this view by the circumstance that in a decision given	only
a  month earlier (see <a href="/doc/1683423/" id="a_360">Behram Khurshed Pesikaka v. The  State
of  Bombay</a>  (3)) the same learned  Chief  Justice  expressed
himself strongly, though tentatively, against introducing in
our  Constitution  the doctrine of waiver as  enunciated  by
some   American	  Judges   in	construing   the    American
Constitution, without a full discussion of the matter.	 The
report of Gopal
(1) [1955] 1 S.C.P. 773.       (2) (1958) 356 U.S. 617,619
(3) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 613 653,654.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">587</span>
<p id="p_160">Das  Mohta's case (1) does not contain any reference to	 the
doctrine  of  waiver,  and it is  obvious  that	 no  ,fuller
discussion  of the doctrine took place in that case.  It  is
not, therefore, reasonable to hold that the effect of  Gopal
Das Mohta's case is to uphold the doctrine of waiver.	Babu
Rao's case (2) merely followed Gopal Das Mohta (1) and	gave
no separate reasons.  Laxmanappa Jamkhandi's case (3)  dealt
with an order under<a href="/doc/971685/" id="a_361"> s. 8(2)</a> of the Act and said at p. 772:-
"  From	 the  facts  stated  above  it	is  plain  that	 the
proceedings  taken  under  the	impugned  Act  XXX  of	1947
concluded   so	far  as	 the  Investigation  Commission	  is
concerned  in  September, 1952, more than two  years  before
this  petition was presented in this Court.  The  assessment
orders under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_362">Income-tax Act</a> itself were made against the
petitioner in November, 1953.  In these circumstances we are
of  the opinion that -he is entitled to no relief under	 the
provisions  of <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_363">Article 32</a> of the Constitution.	It was	held
by  this Court in <a href="/doc/233559/" id="a_364">Ramjilal v. Income-tax Officer,  Mohindar</a>-
garh,  [1951]  S.C.R. 127, that as there is a  special	pro.
vision in <a href="/doc/1405898/" id="a_365">Article 265</a> of the Constitution, that no tax shall
be  levied or collected except by authority of	law,  clause
(1)  of <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_366">Article 31</a> must therefore be regarded  as  concerned
with   deprivation  of	property  otherwise  than   by	 the
imposition  or collection of tax, and inasmuch as the  right
conferred  by <a href="/doc/1405898/" id="a_367">Art. 265</a> is not a right conferred by Part	 III
of the Constitution, it could not be enforced under  Article
</p><p id="p_161">32.   In  view of this decision it has to be held  that	 the
petition  under	 <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_368">Article  32</a>  is  not  maintainable  in	 the
situation  that	 has arisen and that even otherwise  in	 the
peculiar circumstances that have arisen it would not be just
and proper to direct the issue of any of the writs the issue
of which is discretionary with this Court."
Here,  again,  there  is no reference  to  the	doctrine  of
waiver,	 and the case was decided on the ambit and scope  of
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_369">Art. 32</a> of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_162">I  would hold, therefore, that the decisions of	 this  Court
relied on by the learned Attorney General do
(1) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 773.	(2) [1954] 26 I.T.R. 725.
(3)[1955] 1 S.C.R.769.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">588</span>
<p id="p_163">not help him in establishing waiver.  Let me now examine the
circumstances  on which the learned Attorney General  founds
his  plea of waiver.  Indeed, it is true that  the  assessee
submitted to the discriminatory procedure applied to him  by
the  Commission; he also asked for a settlement under  which
he  agreed  to pay 75% of his alleged tax  liability  and  a
small amount of penalty; he made some payment in instalments
even  after Muthia's decision in December, 1955.   Do  these
circumstances amount to waiver ? It is to be remembered that
in  1953-1954 when the discriminatory procedure of  the	 Act
was  applied to him and the report against him was  made  by
the  Commission	 on  which  the	 settlement  is	 based,	 the
assessee  did not know, nor had it been declared by a  court
of competent jurisdiction that<a href="/doc/1128347/" id="a_370"> s. 5(1)</a> of the Act was  ultra
vires.	In his application for a settlement, he said clearly
in  paragraph  3 that the Commission announced - it  as	 its
view  that  the income, profits and gains that	had  escaped
assessment  in the hands of the assessee was  Rs.  4,47,915.
The  assessee also knew that under the Act this finding	 was
final  and binding on him.  If in these	 circumstances,	 the
assessee made an application for settlement, can it be	said
that  it is a voluntary or intentional relinquishment  of  a
known right ? I venture to think not.  It has been said that
'  waiver' is a troublesome term in the law.  The  generally
accepted connotation is that to constitute ' waiver',  there
must  be an intentional relinquishment of a known  right  or
the  voluntary	relinquishment	or abandonment	of  a  known
existing  legal	 right,	 or  conduct  such  as	warrants  an
inference  of  the  relinquishment  of	a  known  right	  or
privilege.   Waiver differs from estoppel in the sense	that
it  is contractual and is an agreement to release or not  to
assert a right; estoppel is a rule of evidence. (<a href="/doc/351394/" id="a_371">See  Dawson
Bank  Limited v. Nippon Menkwa Kabushiki Kaisha</a>) (1).	What
is  the known legal right which the  assessee  intentionally
relinquished or agreed to release in 1953-1954 ? He did	 not
know then that any part of the Act was invalid, and I  doubt
if in
(1) (1935) L.R.62 I.A.100,108.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">		    589</span>
<p id="p_164">the  circumstances of this case, a plea of 'waiver'  can  be
founded on the maxim of 'ignorance of law is no excuse'.   I
do not think that the maxim 'ignorance of law is no  excuse'
can  be	 carried to the extent of saying that  every  person
must be presumed to know that a piece of legislation enacted
by  a legislature of competent jurisdiction must be held  to
be-invalid, in case it prescribes a differential  treatment,
and he must, therefore, refuse to submit to it or incur	 the
peril  of the bar of waiver being raised against him.  I  do
not think that such pre-science is a necessary corollary  of
the maxim.  On the contrary, the presumption, if any,  which
operated at the relevant time was the presumption that a law
passed by a competent legislature is valid, unless  declared
unconstitutional  by  a	 court	of  competent  jurisdiction.
Furthermore, I do not think that any inference of waiver can
be retrospectively drawn from the instalments paid in  1956-
57, particularly when the question of refund of the  amounts
already paid is no longer a live issue before us.  It would,
I  think, be going too far to hold that	 every	unsuspecting
submission  to a law, subsequently declared to	be  invalid,
must  give  rise  to  a plea  of  waiver:  this	 would	make
constitutional	rights	depend	for their  vitality  on	 the
accident of a timely challenge and render them illusory to a
very large extent.
</p><p id="p_165">I  hold,  therefore,  that  the	 necessary  foundation	 for
sustaining  the	 plea of waiver has not been  laid  in	this
case,  and the onus being on the respondents, the plea	must
fail.
</p><p id="p_166">In view of my finding that the necessary foundation on facts
for sustaining the plea of waiver has not been laid in	this
case, it becomes unnecessary to decide, in the abstract, the
further	 question  if  a  right guaranteed  by	any  of	 the
provisions in Part III of the Constitution can be waived  at
all.   I  am of the view -that this Court should  indeed  be
rigorous  in avoiding to pronounce on constitutional  issues
where  a  reason.  able	 alternative  exists;  for  we	have
consistently  followed	the two principles (a)	that  "	 the
Court  will not anticipate a question of constitutional	 law
in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">590</span>
advance	 of  the  necessity  of deciding  it  "	 (Weaver  on
Constitutional	Law,  p. 69) and (b) " the  Court  will	 not
formulate  a  rule  of constitutional law  broader  than  is
required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied "
(ibid, p. 69).
</p><p id="p_167">My Lord the Chief Justice and my learned brother Kapur,	 J.,
have  however expressed the view that the fundamental  right
guaranteed  under  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_372">Art.	 14</a> cannot  be	waived;	 my  learned
brethren,  Bhagwati and Subba Rao, JJ., have  expressed	 the
view  that none of the fundamental rights guaranteed by	 the
Constitution can be waived.
</p><p id="p_168">I  greatly  regret  to have to say that I  have	 come  to  a
conclusion  different  from  theirs  with  regard  to	this
question,  and	as they have thought fit  to  express  their
views  on  it  proceed now to explain why I have come  to  a
conclusion  different from those of my learned	brethren  on
this question.
</p><p id="p_169">This  question	was mooted, though not	fully  answered,  in
Behram Khurshed Pesikaka's case (1).  Venkatarama Aiyar, J.,
expressed  his	views  at pages 638 to 643  of	the  report.
Mahajan, C. J., with whom Mukherjea, Vivian Bose and  Ghulam
Hasan,	JJ., concurred, expressed his views at pages 651  to
655 of the report, and my Lord the Chief Justice as Das, J.,
reserved  his  opinion	on the	question.   The	 view  which
Venkatarama   Aiyar,   J.,  expressed  was  this:   if	 the
constitutional	provision which has been  infringed  affects
the competence of the legislature which passed the law,	 the
law is a nullity; as for example, when a State enacts a	 law
which is within the exclusive competence of the Union; when,
however,  a law is within the competence of the	 legislature
which passed it and the unconstitutionality arises by reason
of  its repugnancy to provisions enacted for the benefit  of
individuals,   it   is	not  a	nullity,   but	 is   merely
unenforceable; such unconstitutionality can be waived and in
that  case  the law becomes enforceable.  He  said  that  in
America	 this principle was well settled and he referred  to
Cooley on Constitutional Limitations, Volume 1, pages 368 to
371 ; Willis on Constitutional Law at
(1)  [1955] 1 S.C.R. 613, 653, 654.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">591</span>
<p id="p_170">pages 524, 531, 542 and 558; Rottschaefer on  Constitutional
Law  at	 pages 28 and 29-30.  He then  referred	 to  certain
American decisions in support of his views and then said:-
" The position must be the same under our Constitution	when
a law contravenes a prescription intended for the benefit of
individuals............	 It  is	 open to  any  person  whose
rights	have  been infringed to waive it and when  there  is
waiver,	 there is no legal impediment to the enforcement  of
the law.  It will be otherwise if the statute was a nullity;
in  which  case it can neither be waived nor  enforced.	  If
then  the  law is merely unenforceable and can	take  effect
when waived, it cannot be treated as non est and as effaced
out of the statute book."
</p><p id="p_171">The  contrary view expressed by Mahajan, C. J., can be	best
explained in his own words:
</p><p id="p_172">"  We  think  that  it is not  a  correct  proposition	that
constitutional	provisions in Part III of  our	Constitution
merely	operate	 as a check on the exercise  of	 legislative
power.	 It is axiomatic that when the lawmaking power of  a
State  is restricted by a written fundamental law, then	 any
law  enacted and opposed to fundamental law is in excess  of
the legislative authority and is thus a nullity.  Both these
declarations  of unconstitutionality go to the root  of	 the
power itself and there is no real distinction between  them.
They represent but two aspects of want of legislative power.
The  legislative  power	 of the	 Parliament  and  the  State
legislatures  as  conferred  by Arts. 245  and	246  of	 the
Constitution  stands  curtailed by  the	 fundamental  rights
chapter of the Constitution.  "
</p><p id="p_173">His  Lordship then referred to <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_373">Art. 13</a> of  the	Constitution
and said that it was a clear and unequivocal mandate of	 the
fundamental  law prohibiting the State from making any	laws
which came into conflict with Part III of the  Constitution.
His Lordship added:
</p><p id="p_174">" In our opinion the doctrine of, waiver enunciated by	some
American  Judges  in construing	 the  American	Constitution
cannot	be introduced in our Constitution without  a  fuller
discussion of the matter......... Without finally expressing
an opinion on this question, we
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">592</span>
are  not for the moment convinced that this theory  has	 any
relevancy in construing the fundamental rights conferred  by
Part  III  of the Constitution.	 We think  that	 the  rights
described as fundamental rights are a necessary	 consequence
of the declaration in the ,preamble that the people of India
have solemnly resolved to constitute India into a  sovereign
democratic  republic  and  to secure  to  all  its  citizens
justice, social, economic and political; liberty of thought,
expression,  belief, faith and worship; equality  of  status
and of opportunity.  These fundamental rights have not	been
put  in	 the  Constitution merely  for	individual  benefit,
though	ultimately they come into operation  in	 considering
individual rights.  They have been put there as a matter  of
public	policy	and  the doctrine of  waiver  can,  have  no
application to provisions of law which have been enacted  as
a matter of constitutional policy."
</p><p id="p_175">It would appear that the two main reasons which Mahajan,  C.
J.,  gave  in  support of the views expressed  by  him	were
these.	 Firstly, he held that the effect of <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_374">Art. 13</a> of	 the
Constitution was to prohibit the State from making any	laws
which  came into conflict with Part III of the	Constitution
and  he	 recognised  no such distinction  as  was  drawn  by
Venkatarama Aiyar, J., between absence of legislative  power
(that	is,  incompetence  of  the  legislature)  and	non-
observance of provisions which operate merely as a check  on
the exercise of legislative power.  He thought that  absence
of  legislative	 power and check on the exercise  of  legis-
lative power were both aspects of want of legislative power.
Secondly, he referred to the preamble and the scheme of Part
III  of	 the Constitution in support of his  view  that	 the
doctrine  of  waiver  did not  apply.	I  shall  take-these
reasons in the order in which I have stated them.
First,	as  to the effect of <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_375">Art. 13</a>  of  the  Constitution.
<a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_376">Article 13</a> is in two parts: the first part deals with "	 all
laws  in force in the territory of India immediately  before
the commencement of this Constitution "'and says that so far
as  such laws are inconsistent with the provisions  of	Part
III, they shall to the extent of such
inconsistency be void; the second part deals with laws	made
after  the commencement of the Constitution and says that  "
the  State  shall  not make any law  which  takes.  away  or
abridges  the  rights  conferred  by  Part  III	 "  of	 the
Constitution and any law made in contravention of cl. (2) of
<a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_377">Art.  13</a> shall to the extent of	 the contravention  be void.
It seems clear to me that the Article itself recognises	 the
distinction between absence of legislative power which	will
make the law made by an incompetent legislature wholly void,
and  exercise  of legislative power in	contravention  of  a
restriction or check on such power, which will make the	 law
void  to the extent of the inconsistency  or  contravention.
The use, of the words " to the extent of the inconsistency "
and  "	to  the extent of the  contravention  "	 indubitably
points	to such a distinction, and indeed this	was  pointed
out in <a href="/doc/762155/" id="a_378">Bhikaji Narain Dhakras v. The State of Madhya Pradesh</a>
(1).   This  was  an unanimous decision of  this  Court	 and
several earlier decisions including the decision in  Kesavan
Madhava Menon's case (2), on which Mahajan, C. J., placed so
much  reliance,	 were considered therein.  The	decision  in
Behram	Khurshed Pesikaka (3)was also considered,  and	then
the following observations were made with regard to <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_379">Art.  13</a>
of the Constitution at p. 598-

</p><p id="p_178">The  aforesaid view expressed in Bhikaji Narain's  case	 (1)
was accepted in many later decisions including the  decision
in  Muthia's  case  (2).  The  same  distinction  was  again
referred  to in another unanimous decision of this Court  in
<a href="/doc/212098/" id="a_384">The State of Bombay v. R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala</a> (3) where at p.
885 it was observed:
</p><p id="p_179">The  Court of Appeal has rightly pointed out that  when	 the
validity  of an Act is called in question, the	first  thing
for  the court to do is to examine whether the Act is a	 law
with   respect	to  a  topic  assigned	to  the	  particular
Legislature  which enacted it. if it is, then the  court  is
next  to consider whether, in the case of an Act  passed  by
the  Legislature of a Province now a State),  its  operation
extends beyond the boundaries of the Province or the  State,
for under the provisions conferring legislative powers on it
such Legislature can only make a law for its territories  or
any  part thereof and its laws cannot, in the absence  of  a
territorial nexus, have any extra territorial operation.  If
the  impugned law satisfies both these tests,  then  finally
the court has to ascertain if there is anything in any other
part  of  the Constitution which places ~any fetter  on	 the
legislative  powers of such Legislature.  The  impugned	 law
has to pass all these three test."
</p><p id="p_180">Therefore,  the mere use of the word ~(6 void " in  <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_385">Art.  13</a>
does not necessarily militate against the application of the
doctrine of waiver in respect of the provisions contained in
Part   III   of	 our  Constitution.   Under   the   American
Constitution   also,   a  law  made  in	  violation   of   a
constitutional guarantee is struck down, because under	Art.

supreme law of the land." I am unable, therefore, to  accept
the view that <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_386">Art. 13</a> shows that the doctrine of waiver	 can
never be applied in respect of the provisions in Part III of
the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_182">Let  me now go to the second reason. Is there any  thing  in
the  preamble  and  the scheme	of  our	 Constitution,	with
particular  reference  to  Part III,  which  will  make	 the
doctrine of waiver inapplicable ? Let me first place the two
preambles side by side:

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_69">596</span>
<p id="p_188">American  Constitution	were : (a) to form  a  more  perfect
Union;	(b)  to establish justice; (c)	to  insure  domestic
tranquillity;  (d)  to promote general welfare; and  (e)  to
secure	the blessings of liberty.  In our Constitution,	 the
emphasis  is  on  the Welfare  State-on	  Justice,  Liberty,
Equality and Fraternity.  But the question before us is	 the
limited	 question  of  the application of  the	doctrine  of
waiver.	 I do not find any. thing in the two preambles which
will  make  the	 doctrine applicable in	 one  case  and	 not
applicable in the other.
</p><p id="p_189">It  is necessary to refer here to one important	 distinction
between	 the  two  Constitutions.   Speaking  broadly,	 the
American  Constitution	of  1787, except  for  defining	 the
enumerated powers of the Federal Government and limiting the
powers	of  the	 States, was an outline	 of  government	 and
nothing	 more.	 Its  provisions  were	written	 in  general
language  and  did  not	 provide  minute  specifications  of
Organisation   or   power.    It   contemplated	  subsequent
legislation  and interpretation for carrying the  provisions
into  effect.  In other words, it was early recognised	that
the   Constitution  was	 not  self-executing.	The   Indian
Constitution  is  more	detailed, and in  Part	III  of	 the
Constitution  are  provisions which not	 merely	 define	 the
rights	but  also state to what extent they are	 subject  to
restrictions  in the interests of general welfare, etc.	  In
other words, there is an attempt at adjustment of individual
rights	with social good, and in that sense the	 limitations
or  restrictions are also defined.  But I do not think	that
this distinction has any particular bearing on the  question
at issue before us.  The rights as also the restrictions are
justiciable,  and an interpretation of the rights given	 and
of   the  restrictions	imposed,  by  courts  of   competent
jurisdiction is contemplated.
</p><p id="p_190">Indeed,	 I recognise that there is a  constitutional  policy
behind	 the   provisions  enacted  in	Part  III   of	 the
Constitution.  In a, sense, there is a legislative policy in
all  statutory	enactments.   In  my  opinion,	the  crucial
question  is  not  whether  there  is  a  constitutional  or
legislative  policy behind a particular provision,  but	 the
question is-is the provision meant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_70">		    597</span>
primarily  for the benefit of individuals or is it  for	 the
benefit	 of  the general public ? That	distinction  has,  I
think, been recognised in more than one decision.  Take, for
example,  an ordinary statutory enactment like s. 80 of	 the
Code  of  Civil Procedure which says that no suit  shall  be
instituted  against  the  Government  or  against  a  public
officer in respect of any act purporting to be done by	such
public officer in his official capacity until the expiration
of two months next after a notice in writing has been given,
etc.  There is undoubtedly a reason of public policy  behind
this  provision,  but  it is open to  the  party  for  whose
benefit the vision has been made to waive notice and  indeed
the  party may be estopped by his conduct from pleading	 the
want  of  notice.  As the Privy Council pointed out  in	 AL.
AR.   Villavar	Chettiar v. Government of  the	Province  of
Madras	 (1),	there  is  no  inconsistency   between	 the
propositions that the provisions of a section are  mandatory
and  must  be  enforced by the court and that  they  may  be
waived by the authority for whose benefit they are provided.
The question then is-is there anything in the statute  which
militates against the application of the doctrine of  waiver
to  such  right, subject to the safeguards  and	 precautions
necessary for the application of the doctrine, provided	 the
right is for the benefit of individuals ?
</p><p id="p_191">I  am  conscious that rights which the	Constitution  itself
characterises as fundamental must be treated as such and  it
will  be wrong to whittle them down.  But are  we  whittling
down  fundamental  rights when we say that the	question  of
waiver	of  fundamental	 rights cannot be  answered  in	 the
abstract-by a general affirmative or a general negative; the
question  must always depend on (a) the nature of the  right
guaranteed and (b) the foundation on the basis of which	 the
plea  of waiver is raised.  It is to be remembered that	 the
rights	guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution  are	 not
confined  to  citizens	alone.	 Some  of  the	rights	 are
guaranteed to non-citizens also.  Moreover, they are not all
rights	 relating   to	justice,   liberty,   equality	 and
fraternity; some of the provisions define the rights
(A)  (1947) L.R. 74 I.A. 223, 228.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_71">698</span>
<p id="p_192">while others indicate the restrictions or checks subject  to
which the rights are granted.  <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_387">Article 33</a>, for example, does
not  give any right to any person; on the contrary it  gives
power  to Parliament to modify the rights conferred by	Part
III in their application to persons.  <a href="/doc/846153/" id="a_388">Article 34</a> lays down a
conferred by Part III while in any area.  It is not,  there-
fore,  quite correct to say that all the provisions in	Part
III  grant  fun	 amental  rights,  though  the	heading	  is
'Fundamental Rights'.
</p><p id="p_193">There is, I think, a three-fold classification: (1) a  right
granted	 by  an ordinary statutory enactment;  (2)  a  right
granted by. the Constitution; and (3) a right guaranteed  by
Part  III of the Constitution.	With regard to	an  ordinary
statutory  right  there is, I think, no difficulty.   It  is
well  recognised  that a statutory right which	is  for	 the
benefit	 of  an individual can in  proper  circumstances  be
waived by the party for whose benefit the provision has been
made.	With  regard to a constitutional right,	 it  may  be
pointed	 out  that  there  are	several	 provisions  in	 our
Constitution  which do not occur in Part III, but which	 yet
relate	to  certain rights; take, for  example,	 the  rights
relating  to the Services under the Union and the States  in
Part XIV.  I do not think that it can be seriously contended
that  a right which is granted to a Government	servant	 for
his benefit cannot be waived by him, provided no question of
jurisdiction is involved.  I may refer in this connection to
the provisions in Part XIII which relate to trade,  commerce
and  intercourse  within  the  territory  of  India.   These
provisions   also   impose  certain  restrictions   on	 the
legislative  powers  of	 the Union and of  the	States	with
regard	to trade and commerce.	As these provisions are	 for
the benefit of the general public and not for any particular
individual, they can not be waived, even though they do	 not
find place in Part III of the Constitution.  Therefore,	 the
crucial	 question is not whether the rights or	restrictions
occur in one part or other of the Constitution.	 The crucial
question  is  the nature of the right given: is it  for	 the
benefit of individuals or is it for the general public?
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_72">599</span>
<p id="p_194">That,  in  my opinion, is the true test.  I may	 here  state
that  the source of the right-contractual or statutory	--is
not  the  determining  factor.	The doctrine  of  waiver  is
grounded  on  the  principle  that  a  right,  statutory  or
otherwise, which is for the benefit of an individual can  be
waived	by  him.  I am aware that a right which is  for	 the
benefit	 of the general public must in its actual  operation
relate to particular individuals, in the same way as a right
for the benefit of individuals will in its actual  operation
arise  in connection with individual A or individual B.	 The
test  is  not  whether in its operation	 it  relates  to  an
individual.   The test is -for whose benefit the  right	 has
been primarily granted for the benefit of the general public
or for individuals ?
</p><p id="p_195">Let me now apply this test to some of the provisions in Part
III  of	 the  Constitution.   These  provisions	 have	been
classified under different heads: (1) right to equality, (2)
right to freedom, (3) right against exploitation, (4)  right
to freedom of religion, (5) cultural and educational rights,
(6)  right  to	property and  (7)  right  to  constitutional
remedies.   There can be no doubt that some of these  rights
are  for  the  benefit of the  general	public.	  Take,	 for
example,  <a href="/doc/1071750/" id="a_389">Art. 23</a> which prohibits traffic in  human  beings,
etc  ; so also <a href="/doc/1540780/" id="a_390">Art. 24 '</a>which says that no child  below	 the
age  of 14 shall be employed to work in any factory or	mine
or engaged in any other hazardous employment.  I do not wish
to  multiply  examples and it is sufficient  to	 state	that
several of these rights are rights which are meant primarily
for  the  benefit  of  the general public  and	not  for  an
individual.   But can we say the same thing in	-respect  of
all  the  rights ? Let us take <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_391">Art. 31</a>, which says  that  no
person	shall be deprived of his property save by  authority
of  law and that no property shall be compulsorily  acquired
or  requisitioned  save	 for a public purpose  and  save  by
authority of law which provides for compensation, etc.	Take
a case where a man's property is acquired under a law  which
does  not  fix	the amount of compensation  or	specify	 the
principles on which or the manner in which the	compensation
is to be determined and given.	The man whose
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_73">600</span>
property  is taken may raise no objection to the  taking  of
his property under such law.  Indeed, he may expressly agree
to Government taking his land for a public purpose under the
law  in	 question,  though  it	does  not  comply  with	 the
requirements  as to compensation.  Can such a man after	 two
or  three  years  change his mind and say that	the  law  is
invalid	 and  his land on which a school or a  hospital	 may
have  been built in the meantime should be restored to	him,
because	 he could not waive his fundamental right ?   In  my
opinion,  if  we express the view in the  abstract  that  no
fundamental  right  can ever be waived, many  startling	 and
unforeseen  results  may  follow.   Take  another   example.
Suppose	 a man obtains a permit or a licence for  running  a
motor vehicle or an excise shop.  Having enjoyed the benefit
of  the permit for several years, is it open to him  to	 say
when action is proposed to be taken against him to terminate
the licence, that the law under which the permit was granted
to  him was not constitutionally valid ? Having derived	 all
the  benefit from the permit granted to him, is it  open  to
him  to	 say  that the very Act under  which  a	 permit	 was
granted	 to  him  is  not valid in  law	 ?  Such  and  other
startling results will follow if we decide in the  abstract,
by a general negative, that a fundamental right can never be
waived.	 Take <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_392">Art. 32</a>, which is a right to a  constitutional
remedy,	 namely,  the  right to move the  Supreme  Court  by
appropriate  proceedings for the enforcement of	 the  rights
conferred  by Part III.	 It is now well settled	 by  several
decisions  of  this court that the right under	<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_393">Art.  32</a>  is
itself a fundamental right.  Suppose a person exercises that
right and initiates appropriate proceedings for	 enforcement
of  a  fundamental right' Later he thinks better of  it	 and
withdraws his application.  Still later he changes his mind.
Can he then say that he could not waive his right under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_394">Art.
32</a>  and the order passed on his application  for  withdrawal
had  no legal validity ? We may take still another  example.
Under  <a href="/doc/1687408/" id="a_395">Art.  30(1)</a>  of	the  Constitution,  all	 minorities,
whether	 based	on religion or language, have the  right  to
establish and administer educational institutions of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_74">601</span>
their  choice.	 Suppose, there is  a  minority	 educational
institution  and  the minority has the right  to  administer
that institution, but they want grant from Government.	 The
minority  may  have  to	 surrender  part  of  its  right  of
administration	in  order to get Government  aid.   Can	 the
minority  waive	 its  right?   Such  a	question  arose	 for
consideration  in  the	advisory opinion which	we  gave  in
connection with the Kerala Education Bill and-, so far as  I
have  been able to understand, the effect of our opinion  is
that  the  minority  can  surrender part  of  its  right  of
administration of a school of its own choice in order to get
aid  from Government.  If we now hold that the minority	 can
never  surrender its right, then the result will be that  it
will never be able to ask for Government aid.
I  do  not  see	 any  such  vital  distinction	between	 the
provisions  of	the American Constitution and those  of	 our
Constitution  as  would lead me to the conclusion  that	 the
doctrine  of  waiver applies in	 respect  of  constitutional
rights guaranteed by the American Constitution but will	 not
apply  in  respect of fundamental rights guaranteed  by	 the
Indian Constitution.  Speaking generally, the prohibition in
Part  III  is against the State from taking  any  action  in
violation of a fundamental right.  The word 'State' in	that
Part includes the Government and Parliament of India as also
the  Government	 and Legislature of each of the	 States	 and
also all local or other authorities within the territory  of
India or under the control of the Government of India.	 The
American  Constitution also says the same thing	 in  effect.
By Art.	 VI it states that the Constitution and the laws  of
the  United States which shall be made in pursuance  thereof
shall be the supreme law of the land.  It is well settled in
America	 that the first ten amendments to the original	Con-
stitution  were substantially contemporaneous and should  be
construed  in pari materia.  In many of the  amendments	 the
phraseology  used  is  similar to  the	phraseology  of	 the
provisions of Part III of our Constitution.
The position under the American Constitution is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">76</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">602</span>
well settled and a succinct statement of that position	will
be  found in Rottschaefer on Constitutional Law, pp.  28-29.
The learned author has summarised the position thus:
"  There are certain constitutional provisions that  may  be
waived	by  the	 person	 for  whose  protection	 they	were
intended.   A  person who has waived that  protection  in  a
given instance may not thereafter. raise the issue that his,
constitutional rights have been infringed in that  instance,
since  whatever	 injury he may incur is due to his  own	 act
rather	than  to  the  enforcement  of	an  unconstitutional
measure against him.
</p><p id="p_196">A  person  who	would  otherwise  be  entitled	to  raise  a
constitutional issue is sometimes denied that right  because
he  is	estopped to do so.  The factor	usually	 present  in
these  cases  is  conduct  inconsistent	 with  file  present
assertion  of that right, or conduct of such character	that
it  would  be  unjust  to others  to  permit  him  to  avoid
liability  on  constitutional  grounds.	 A  person  may	 not
question  the  constitutionality of the	 very  provision  on
which  he bases the right claimed to be	 infringed  thereby,
nor  of	 a  provision  that  is	 an  integral  part  in	 its
establishment  or definition.  The acceptance of  a  benefit
under one provision of an Act does not ordinarily preclude a
person	from  asserting'  the  invalidity  of  another	 and
severable  provision  thereof, but there are  exceptions  to
this  rule.   The.' promoters of a public  improvement	have
been  denied' the right to contest the validity of the	rule
apportioning its cost over the benefited lands, and a person
who  has received the benefits of a statute may not  there-'
after  assert its invalidity to defeat the claims of  those,
against	 whom  it has been enforced in his  own	 favour.   A
state is estopped to claim that its own statute deprives it.
of  its	 property  without due process of  law	but  it	 is-
permitted to assert that its own statute invades rights that
its  constitution  confers  upon  it.	Prior	inconsistent
conduct	 will not,however preclude a person  from  asserting
the, invalidity of an act if under all the circumstances its
assertion involves no
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">603</span>
unfairness or injustice to those against whom it is raised."
The   learned  Attorney	 General  placed  reliance  on	 the
following decisions: (1) Pierce v. Somerset Railway (1); (2)
Wall v. Parrot Silver and Copper Company (2); (3) Pierce Oil
Corporation v. Phoenix Refining Company (3) ; (4) Shepard v.
Barron(4)  ; (5) United States V. Murdock(5); (6) Patton  v.
United States (6) ; and (7) Adams v. United States (7).	 The
position  in America is so well settled that I think  it  is
unnecessary to examine the aforesaid decisions in detail.  I
need  only refer to the observations of Frankfurter, J.,  in
William A. Adam's case (supra).	 The observations were	made
in  connection with a case where a trial was held without  a
jury  at the request of the accused person himself in  spite
of the guarantee of Amendment VI. The observations were-
"  What was contrived as protections for the accused  should
not be turned into fetters.  To assert as an absolute that a
layman,	 no  matter how wise or experienced he	may  be,  is
incompetent to choose between judge and jury as the tribunal
for  determining  his guilt or innocence, simply  because  a
lawyer	has not advised him on the choice, is  to  dogmatize
beyond the bounds of learning or experience."
I have not been able to find any real reason on the basis of
which the decisions given above with regard to the  American
Constitution can be held to be inapplicable to similar cases
arising under the Indian Constitution.
</p><p id="p_197">Two subsidiary reasons have been given for holding that	 the
position under the Indian Constitution is different.  One is
that  ours  is	a  nascent  democracy  and,  therefore,	 the
doctrine  of  waiver should not apply.	With respect,  I  am
unable to concur in this view.	I do not think that we shall
be  advancing  the  cause  of  democracy  by  converting   a
fundamental  right into a fetter or using it as a means	 for
getting out of an

that  waiver  is not to be light heartedly  applied,  and  I

necessary safeguards and cautions.  What I seriously  object
to  is	a statement in the abstract and "in  absolute  terms

been  retained	by the people and can  never  be  interfered
with.	I  am unable to acquiesce in this.   The  expression
natural	 rights'  is in itself somewhat	 vague.	  Sometimes,
rights	have  been divided into	 natural rights'  and  civil
rights',  and  natural rights' have been stated to be  those
which are necessarily inherent or innate and which come from
the very elementary laws of nature whereas civil rights	 are
those  which arise from the needs of civil as  distinguished
from  barbaric communities.  I am unable, however, to  agree
that any such distinction is apparent from the provisions in
Part  III  of our Constitution: all the rights	referred  to
therein appear to be created by the Constitution.  I do	 not
think  that Locke's doctrine of natural rights',  which	 was
perhaps	 the  authority	 for  the  American  Declaration  of
Independence,  played  any  part in  the  enactment  of	 the
provisions  of Part III of our Constitution.   The  doctrine
which  has long since ceased to receive general	 acceptance,
has  been thus explained by E. W. Paterson (see Natural	 Law
and  Natural  Rights, Southern Methodist  University  Press,
Dallas, 1955, p. 61):
</p><p id="p_205">" The theory of natural rights, for which we are indebted to
the seventeenth-century English philosopher, John Locke,  is
essentially different from the theories of natural law	just
discussed   in	 that	it   lacked   the   two	   important
characteristics	  above	 -mentioned:  the  concept   of	  an
immutable   physical  order  and  the  concept	 of   divine
reason............ He begins with the purpose of  justifying
the  existence of a government with coercive  powers.	What
inconveniences would arise if there were no government?	 Men
would live in a " stage of nature'; to avoid confusion	with
the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_79">		    605</span>
political  state I shall call this a  condition of  nature'.
In such a condition man would be free to work, to enjoy	 the
fruits	of his labour, and to barter with others;  he  would
also  be free to enforce the law of nature  (whose  precepts
Locke did not define) against every other man.	Since  Locke
was an optimist about human nature he thought men would	 get
along  pretty  well  in this  lawless  condition.   Yet	 the
condition  of  nature  is  for	Locke  a  fiction  like	 the
assumption  of	a frictionless machine	in  mechanics.	 The
chief disadvantages that men in this condition would  suffer
were,  he thought, the absence of an established  law,,	 the
absence	 of  a	known and  impartial  magistrate  to  settle
disputes, the absence of a. power sufficient to execute	 and
enforce	 the  judgment of the magistrate.   Moved  by  these
inconveniences,	 men would enter into a social compact	with
each  other whereby each would transfer to a  third  person,
the government, such rights over his person and property  as
the   government  must	have  in  order	 to   remove   these
inconveniences.	   All	 other	 rights,   privileges,	 and
immunities he reserved, as a grantor of land conveys the fee
simple	to  his son and reserves a life estate	to  himself.
These reserved rights were  natural' rights because they had
originated  in	the  condition of nature  and  survived	 the
social compact."
</p><p id="p_206">There  are, in my opinion, clear indications in Part III  of
the  Constitution  itself  that the doctrine  of  '  natural
rights'	 had  played  no  part in  the	formulation  of	 the
provisions  therein.   Take Arts. 33, 34 and 35	 which	give
Parliament power to modify the rights conferred by Part III.
If they were natural rights, the Constitution could not have
given  power to Parliament to modify them.  Therefore, I  am
of  the view that the doctrine of 'natural  rights'  affords
nothing but a foundation of shifting sand for building up  a
thesis	that  the doctrine of waiver does not apply  to	 the
rights guaranteed in Part III of our Constitution.
The true position as I conceive it is this: where a right or
privilege  guaranteed  by  the	Constitution  rests  in	 the
individual  and	 is primarily intended for his	benefit	 and
does not impinge on the right of others, it
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_80">606</span>
can  be waived provided such waiver is not forbidden by	 law
and does not contravene public. policy or public morals.
In  the	 case  before  us, I have  held	 that  there  is  no
foundation   on	 facts	to  sustain  the  plea	of   waiver.
Therefore,  I would allow the appeal with costs.  The  order
of the Commissioner of Income-tax, Delhi, dated January	 29,
1958, must be set aside and all proceedings now pending	 for
implementation	of the order of the Union  Government  dated
July 5, 1954, must be quashed.
</p><p id="p_207">SUBBA  RAO,  J.-I  have had the advantage  of  perusing	 the
judgments  of  my  Lord the Chief  Justice  and	 my  learned
brother, S. K. Das, J. I agree with their conclusion, but  I
would  prefer to express my opinion separately in regard  to
the question of the applicability of the doctrine of  waiver
to the fundamental rights.
</p><p id="p_208">This  case  raises a most serious  and	important  question,
viz.,  whether	the  doctrine  of  waiver  operates  on	 the
fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution, a question
not  confined to the immediate purpose of  this	 litigation,
but  to	 the public in general.	 The question  is  bound  to
arise  frequently,  and	 the  varying  observations  already
expressed  by  the learned Judges of this Court	 would	lend
scope	for  conflicting  decisions  involving	parties	  in
unnecessary litigation and avoidable hardship.	The question
was  directly  raised and fully argued before  us.   In	 the
circumstances,	I  cannot share the opinion  of	 my  learned
brother,  S.  K.  Das, J., that this Court  should  avoid  a
decision  on this question and leave it to be decided  in  a
more appropriate case.
</p><p id="p_209">The  facts  have  been fully stated by	my  Lord  the  Chief
Justice in his judgment and I need not restate them.
The learned Attorney General contended that in the  American
Law the principle of waiver was applied to rights created by
the Constitution except in cases where the protection of the
rights	was based upon public policy and that, by  the	same
analogy,  if no public policy was involved, even  in  India,
the person
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_81">		    607</span>
affected by the infringement of the fundamental rights could
waive  the constitutional protection guaranteed to him.	  It
was  said that in the present case the appellant waived	 his
fundamental  right under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_396">Art. 14</a> of the Constitution as	 the
right  was  only in respect of his liability to tax  and  he
could  legitimately waive it.  To, appreciate this  argument
it would be convenient at the outset to notice the  American
Law  on	 the subject.  Certain rights, which  are  sometimes
described as the Bill of Rights, have been introduced by the
Amendment; to the Constitution of America.  They declare the
rights of the people of America in respect of the freedom of
religion speech, press, assemblage and from illegal seizurs.
They  guarantee trial by jury in certain criminal and  civil
matters.   They give protection against	 self-incrimination.
The Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States
prescribes  that  no  person shall  be	deprived  of  life.,
liberty	 or property without due process of law;  nor  shall
private	 property  be  taken for  public  use  without	just
compensation.  The Fourteenth Amendment of the	Constitution
introduces  the rule of due process as a protection  against
the  State  action.  The said amendments are intended  as  a
protection  to citizens against the action of the Union	 and
the  States.  Though the rights so declared are general	 and
wide in their terms, the Supreme Court of America, by a long
course	of -judicial, interpretation, having regard  to	 the
social	conditions'  in that country, has given	 content  to
those  rights and imposed limitations thereon in an  attempt
to reconcile individual rights with social good, by evolving
counterbalancing   doctrines   of  police   power,   eminent
domain,,.  and	such  others.	During	the  course  of	 the
evolution.  of	the  law, attempts were made  to  apply	 the
doctrine of waiver to the provisions of the Constitution  of
America.   American Courts applied the doctrine	 with  great
caution	 and  in  applying  the	 same,	laid  down  definite
principles.
</p><p id="p_210">The  said  principles  were  culled  out  from	the  various
decisions and clearly summarized in the authoritative, text-
books on the Constitution of America under different heads:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_82">608</span>
<p id="p_211">WILLIS ON 'CONSTITUTIONAL LAW':
</p><p id="p_212">1. Self-incrimination:
</p><p id="p_213">The  privilege	against self-incrimination'  like-any  other
privilege, is one which may be waived.
</p><p id="p_214">2.   Double jeopardy:
</p><p id="p_215">Double	jeopardy is a privilege and may be waived  expressly
or impliedly.
</p><p id="p_216">3.   Immunity against unreasonable searches and seizures:
The  immunity is one which may be waived and by consent	 one
can make a search and seizure reasonable.
</p><p id="p_217">4. Jury Trial:
</p><p id="p_218">The United States Supreme Court......... held that neither a
jurisdictional	question nor the interest of the  State	 was
involved,  but only the privilege and right of the  accused,
and that these were subject to waiver in accordance with the
usual rules.
</p><p id="p_219">5.   Due  Process  of Law as a matter  of  jurisdiction:
In  order to delimit personal liberty by  exercising  social
control,  the branch of the government undertaking to do  so
must  have jurisdiction.  If it does not have  jurisdiction,
it  is taking personal liberty (life, liberty  or  property)
without	 due  process  of law.	To this rule  there  are  no
exceptions.  It cannot be waived.
</p><p id="p_220">'COOLEY'S CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS':
Where  a  constitutional  provision  is	 designed  for,	 the
protection solely of the property rights of the. citizen, it
is competent for him to waive the protection, and to consent
to  such  action as would be invalid if	 taken	against	 his
will.
</p><p id="p_221">In  criminal  cases  the  doctrine  that  a   constitutional
privilege  may	be  waived must be true to  a  very  limited
extent	only.	A  party may consent  to  waive	 rights	 of.
property, but the trial and punishment for. public  offences
are  not  within the provinces of individual  con.  sent  or
agreement.
</p><p id="p_222">CORPUS JURIS SECUNDUM:
</p><p id="p_223">It  has	 been  stated  supra (p. 1050,	note  32)  that	 the
doctrine of waiver extends to rights and privileges
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_83">		    609</span>
of any character, and since the word ' waiver' covers  every
conceivable right, it is the general rule that a person	 may
waive  any  matter  which  affects  his	 property,  and	 any
alienable  right  or privilege of which he is the  owner  or
which  belongs	to him or to which he is  legally  entitled,
whether	 secured  by  contract,	 conferred  by	statute,  or
guaranteed   by	 constitution,	provided  such	rights	 and
privileges  rest  in the individual, are intended  'for	 his
sole  benefit, do not infringe on the rights of others,	 and
further provided the waiver Of the right or privilege is not
forbidden by law, and does not contravene public policy, and
the  principle	is recognized that everyone has a  right  to
waive,	and agree to waive, the advantage of a law  or	rule
made solely for the benefit and protection of the individual
in  his	 private capacity, if it can be dispensed  with	 and
relinquished  without  infringing on any  public  right	 and
without detriment to the community at large.........
As  a general rule, rights relating to procedure and  remedy
are  subject to waiver, but if a right is so fundamental  in
its  nature  as	 to  be regarded by  the  state	 as  vitally
integrated  in	immemorially established  processes  of	 the
administration of justice, it cannot be waived by anyone.
The  cases  cited  at  the  Bar	 illustrate  the   aforesaid
principles.   The  doctrine was applied to  the	 obligations
under  a  contract  in Pierce v. Somerset  Railway  (1);  to
deprivation of property without due process of law in Pierce
Oil  Corporation v. Phoenix Refining Company(2) and  Shepard
v.  Barron (3) to trial by jury in Patton v.  United  States
(4)	and   Adams  v.	 United	 States(5);  and   to	self-
incrimination in United States v. Murdock (6).	It is  true,
as the learned counsel for the appellant contended, that  in
some  of  the aforesaid decisions, observations are  in	 the
nature	of  obiter, but they clearly indicate the  trend  of
judicial opinion in America.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_85">610</span>
<p id="p_230">The American Law on the subject may be summarized thus:	 The
doctrine of waiver can be invoked when the Constitutional or
Statutory  guarantee of a right is not conceived  in  public
interest or when it does not affect the jurisdiction of	 the
authority  infringing the said right.  But if the  privilege
conferred or the right created by the statute is solely	 for
the benefit of the individual, he can waive it.	 But even in
those  cases  the Courts invariably administered  a  caution
that  having regard to the nature of the right some  precau-
tionary	 and stringent conditions should be  applied  before
the doctrine is invoked or applied.
</p><p id="p_231">This leads me to the question whether the fundamental rights
enshrined  in  the  Indian  Constitution  pertain  to	that
category  of  rights  which  could be  waived.	 To  put  it
differently, whether the Constitutional guarantee in  regard
to   the   fundamental	rights	restricts   or	 ousts	 the
jurisdiction   of   the	 relevant  authorities	 under	 the
Constitution  to make laws in derogation of the said  rights
or  whether  the  said rights are for  the  benefit  of	 the
general public.	 At the outset I would like to sound a	note
of  warning.   While it is true that the  judgments  of	 the
Supreme Court of the United States are of a great assistance
to  this  Court	 in elucidating and  solving  the  difficult
problems  that	arise  from  time to  time,  it	 is  equally
necessary  to keep in mind the fact that the  decisions	 are
given  in  the context of a different social,  economic	 and
political  set	up,  and  therefore  great  care  should  be
bestowed  in  applying those decisions to cases	 arising  in
India	with  different	 social,  economic   and   political
conditions.   While  the principles evolved by	the  Supreme
Court of the United States of America may in certain circum-
stances	 be accepted, their application to similar facts  in
India  may  not	 always lead to the  same  results.   It  is
therefore   necessary	to  consider  the  nature   of	 the
fundamental rights incorporated in the Indian  Constitution,
the  conditions	 of  the people for whose  benefit  and	 the
purpose	 for which they were created, and the effect of	 the
laws made in violation of those rights.	 The Constitution of
India  in  its preamble promises to secure to  all  citizens
justice, social, economic and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_86">611</span>
political; liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and
worship;  equality  of	status and of  opportunity;  and  to
promote	 among them all fraternity assuring the	 dignity  of
the  individual	 and the unity of the nation.	One  of	 the
things	the  Constitution did to achieve the  object  is  to
incorporate  the  fundamental rights  in  the  Constitution.
They  are  divided  into  seven	 categories:  (i)  right  to
equality-Arts.	14 to 18; (ii) right to freedom-Arts. 19  to
22;  (iii) right against exploitation-Arts. 23 and 24;	(iv)
right  to freedom of religion Arts. 25 to 28 ; (v)  cultural
and  educational  rightsArts.  29  and	30;  (vi)  right  to
property-Arts.	31,  31	 A  and	 31B;  and  (vii)  right  to
Constitutional	remediesArts. 32 to 35.	  Patanjali  Sastri,
J., as he then was, pointed out, in <a href="/doc/1857950/" id="a_398">Gopalan v. The, State of
Madras</a>(1), that fundamental rights contained in Part III  of
the  Constitution are really rights that are still  reserved
to  the people after the delegation of rights by the  people
to the institutions of Government both at the Centre and  in
the States created by the Constitution.	 <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_399">Article 13</a> reads :-
(1) All laws in force in the territory of India	 immediately
before	the commencement of this Constitution, in so far  as
they  are inconsistent with the pro. visions of	 this  Part,
shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, be void.
(2)  The  State shall not make any law which takes away	 or,
abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law	made
in contravention of this clause, shall, to the extent of the
contravention, be void."
</p><p id="p_232">This  Article,	in  clear and unambiguous  terms,  not	only
declares  that all laws in fore before the  commencement  of
the   Constitution  and	 made  thereafter  taking  away	  or
abridging the said rights would be void to the extent of the
contravention  but also prohibits the State from making	 any
law  taking away or abridging the said rights.	Part III  is
therefore  enacted  for the benefit of all the	citizens  of
India,	in an attempt to preserve to them their	 fundamental
rights	against infringement by the institutions created  by
the Constitution; for, without that safeguard, the objects

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_87">612</span>
<p id="p_233">adumbrated in the Constitution could not be-achieve,-].	 For
the  same purpose, the said chapter imposes a limitation  on
the  power of the State to make laws in violation  of  those
rights.	 The entire part, in my view, has been introduced in
public	interest, and it is not proper that the	 fundamental
rights	 created  under	 the  various  Articles	 should	  be
dissected to ascertain whether any or which part of them  is
conceived  in  public  interest and which part	of  them  is
conceived  for	individual benefit.  Part III  reflects	 the
attempt	 of the Constitution makers to reconcile  individual
freedom	 with State Control.  While in America this  process
of reconciliation was allowed to be evolved by the course of
judicial  decisions,  in India, the fundamental	 rights	 and
their  limitations  are	 crystallized and  embodied  in	 the
Constitution  itself; while in America a freehand was  given
to the judiciary not only to evolve the content of the right
but  also its limitations, in the Indian Constitution  there
is  not	 much scope for such a process.	  The  Court  cannot
therefore import any further limitations on the	 fundamental
rights	other  than  those  contained in  Part	III  by	 any
doctrine,  such	 as  "	waiver "  or  otherwise.   I  would,
therefore, hold that the fundamental rights incorporated  in
Part III of the Constitution cannot be waived.
It  is said. that such an inflexible rule would, in  certain
cases,	defeat	the very object for  which  the	 fundamental
rights	are  created.	I  have	 carefully  scrutinized	 the
Articles in Part III of the Constitution of India, and	they
do  not,  in my view, disclose any such	 anomaly  or  create
unnecessary  hardship to' the people for whose	benefit	 the
rights	are  created.	<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_400">Article,  14</a>  embodies	the   famous
principle of equality before the law and equal protection of
the  laws,  and	 Arts. 15 to 18 and  <a href="/doc/762902/" id="a_401">Art.  29(2)</a>  relate  to
particular   applications  of  the  rule.    The   principle
underlying   these  Articles  is  the  mainspring   of	 our
democratic  form  of  government and it	 guarantees  to	 its
citizens equal protection in respect of both substantive and
procedural laws.  If the doctrine of waiver is engrafted  to
the said fundamental principles, it will mean that a citizen
can  agree  to	be discriminated.'  When  one  realizes	 the
unequal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_88">		    613</span>
positions  occupied  by the State and the  private  citizen,
particularly  in  India where illiteracy is rampant,  it  is
easy  to visualize that in a conflict between the State	 and
</p><p id="p_234">-a  citizen,  the latter may, by fear of force	or  hope  of
preferment,  give up his right.	 It is said that in  such  a
case coercion or influence can be established in a Court  of
law,  but in practice it will be well nigh impossible to  do
so.  The same reasoning will apply to Arts. 15 and 16.	<a href="/doc/1987997/" id="a_402">Art.
17</a>  illustrates	 the evil repercussion of  the	doctrine  of
waiver	in  its	 impact on  the	 fundamental  rights.	That
Article in express terms forbids untouchability;  obviously,
a   person  cannot  ask	 the  State  to	 treat	him  as	  an
untouchable.  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_403">Article 19</a> reads:-
</p><p id="p_235">"(1) All citizens shall have the right-
</p><p id="p_236">(a)  to freedom of speech and expression;
</p><p id="p_237">(b)  to assemble peaceably and without arms;
</p><p id="p_238">(c)  to form associations or unions;

</p><p id="p_242">(g)  to	 practice  any	profession,  or	 to  carry  on	 any
occupation, trade or business."
</p><p id="p_243">The right to freedom is the essential attribute of a citizen
under democratic form of government.  The freedoms mentioned
in <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_404">Art. 19</a> are subject to certain restrictions mentioned  in
cls.  (2)  to (6) of that Article.  So far as  the  freedoms
narrated  in sub-cls. (a) to (g) of Cl. (1) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_405">Art.  19</a>	 are
concerned,  I  cannot  visualise  any  contingency  where  a
citizen	 would	be -in a worse position than he	 was  if  he
could  not  exercise  the right of  waiver.   In  regard  to
freedom	 to  acquire,  hold  and  dispose  of  property,   a
plausible  argument may be advanced, namely, that a  citizen
should have a right to waive his right to acquire, hold	 and
dispose	 of property ; for, otherwise he might be  compelled
to  acquire  and hold his property, even if he	intended  to
give it up  There is an underlying fallacy in this argument.
The Article does not compel a citizen to acquire, hold and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_89">614</span>
dispose of property just as it does not compel a per. son to
do  any	 of the acts covered by the other freedoms.   If  he
does  not  want to reside in any part of  the  territory  of
India or to make a speech or to practise any profession,  he
is  at liberty not to do any of ,,these things.	 So  too,  a
person	may not acquire the property at all or practise	 any
profession  but if he seeks to acquire property or  practise
any  profession,  he cannot be told that he has	 waived	 his
right  at an earlier stage to acquire property	or  practise
the  profession.  A freedom to do a particular act  involves
the  freedom  not  to do that act.  There  is  an  essential
distinction  between  the non-exercise of a  right  and	 the
exercise  of a right subject to the doctrine of waiver.	  So
understood, even in the case of the right covered by sub-cl.
</p><p id="p_244">(f) of cl. (1), there cannot be any occasion when a  citizen
would  be worse off than when he had no	 fundamental  rights
under  the  Article.  The preservation of the  rights  under
<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_406">Art.  19</a> without any further engrafting of  any	 limitations
than  those  already  imposed  under  the  Constitution,  is
certainly  in the interest of the public ; for,	 the  rights
are  essential for the development of human  personality  in
its diverse aspects.  Some comment is made in regard to	 the
right covered by el. (3) of <a href="/doc/655638/" id="a_407">Art. 20</a>, and it is asked that if
a  person has no liberty to waive the protection under	that
clause, he could not give evidence even if he wanted to give
it  in his own interest.  This argument ignores the  content
of  the	 right under cl. (3) of <a href="/doc/655638/" id="a_408">Art.  20.</a>   The	 fundamental
right of a person is only that he should not be compelled to
be a witness against himself.  It would not prevent him from
giving evidence voluntarily.  Under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_409">Art. 21</a>, no person shall
be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according
to procedure established by law and <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_410">Art. 22</a> gives protection
against	 arrest	 and detention in certain cases.  I  do	 not
think  that  any situation can be conceived  when  a  person
could  waive  this right to his	 advantage.   <a href="/doc/705639/" id="a_411">Article  23(1)</a>
prohibits traffic in human beings and forced labour.  It  is
not  suggested that a person can waive	this  Constitutional
protection.   So  too,	the  right  under  <a href="/doc/1540780/" id="a_412">Art.	 24</a>,   which
prohibits employment
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_90">615</span>
of children in factories, cannot be waived.  That apart,  so
far as this Article is concerned, no question of waiver	 can
arise as a child cannot obviously waive his right under this
Article.   <a href="/doc/631708/" id="a_413">Article 25</a> gives guarantee for religious  liberty
subject	 to  certain  restrictions  contained  therein.	  It
declares  that all persons are	equally entitled  to freedom
of conscience and the right freely to profess, practise	 and
propagate  religion.  This right is certainly  conceived  in
the  public interest and cannot be waived.  So too,  freedom
to manage religious affairs, freedom as to payment Of  taxes
for  promotion of any particular religion and freedom as  to
attendance at religious instruction or religious worship  in
certain	 educational  institutions  are	 all  conceived	  to
enforce the religious neutrality of the State and it  cannot
be  suggested  that they are not in  public  interest.	 The
cultural and educational rights of the minorities and  their
right  to establish and administer educational	institutions
of  their choice are given for the protection of the  rights
of the minorities and it cannot be said that they are not in
public interest.  <a href="/doc/354224/" id="a_414">Article 31</a>, which prohibits the State from
depriving a person of his property save by authority of	 law
or  to acquire any property without paying compensation,  is
intended to protect the properties of persons from arbitrary
actions	 of  the State.	 This Article is  conceived  in	 the
interest  of the public and a person cannot say that he	 can
be deprived of his property without authority of law or that
his land can be acquired without compensation.
It  is	suggested  that	 if  a	person,	 after	waiving	 his
fundamental  right  to property and allowing  the  State  to
incur  heavy expenditure in improving the same, turns  round
and claims to recover the said property, the State would  be
put to irreparable injury.  Firstly, no such occasion should
arise,	as the State is not expected to take  its  citizens'
property or deprive them of their property otherwise than by
authority  of  law.  Secondly, if the owner  of	 a  property
intends to give it to the State, the State can always insist
upon  conveying to it the said property in the manner  known
to law.	 Thirdly, other remedies may be open to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_91">616</span>
recover	  compensation	or  damages  for  the	improvements
bonafide  made	or the loss incurred, having regard  to	 the
circumstances  of a particular case.  These  considerations,
in my view, are of no relevance in considering the  question
of waiver in the context of fundamental rights.	 By  express
provisions of the Constitution, the State is prohibited from
making	any  law  which takes away or  abridges	 the  rights
conferred  by  Part III of the Constitution.  The  State  is
not,  therefore, expected to enforce any right	contrary  to
the Constitutional prohibition on the ground that the  party
waived his fundamental right.  If this prohibition is  borne
in  mind,  no occasion can arise when the'  State  would  be
prejudiced.   The prejudice, if any, to the State  would  be
caused not by the non-application of the doctrine of  waiver
but  by	 its  own  action  contrary  to	 the  Constitutional
prohibition imposed on it.
</p><p id="p_245">It  is	then said that if the doctrine of waiver  is  to  be
excluded, a person can apply to the Supreme Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_415">Art.
32</a>  of	the Constitution for the  relief  provided  therein,
withdraw  the petition, get the order of the  Supreme  Court
dismissing it and then apply over again for issue of a	writ
in respect of the same right.  The apprehension so expressed
is  more  imaginary  than real; for, it	 has  no  foundation
either in fact or in law.  When an application is dismissed,
for  whatever  reason  it may be-whether  on  merits  or  on
admission-, the order of the Court becomes final and it	 can
be reopened only in the manner prescribed by law.  There  is
no  scope for the application of the doctrine of  waiver  in
such a cage.
</p><p id="p_246">Articles  33  and  34 contain  some  of	 the  Constitutional
limitations  on the application and the enforcement  of	 the
fundamental  rights.  The former.  Article confers power  on
Parliament to modify the rights conferred by Part III of the
Constitution  in their application to facts and	 the  latter
enables	 it to impose restrictions on the  rights  conferred
by' that Part, while martial law is in force in any area.
These  two  Articles, therefore, do not	 create	 fundamental
rights, but impose limitations thereon and I
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_92">		    617</span>
cannot	appreciate the argument that their presence in	Part
III  either  derogates from the content of  the	 fundamental
rights	declared therein or sustains the doctrine of  waiver
in  its application to the said rights.	 <a href="/doc/448465/" id="a_416">Article 35</a>  confers
on the Parliament, the power to legislate for giving  effect
to  the	 provisions  of Part III  to  the  exclusion  of the
Legislatures  of  the, States.	This Article also  does	 not
create	a  fundamental right, but provides a  machinery	 for
enforcing that right.
</p><p id="p_247">A  startling  result, it is suggested, would flow  from	 the
rejection  of the doctrine of waiver and the  suggestion  is
sought to be illustrated by the following example : A person
takes a permit for several years from the State for  running
a  motor  vehicle  or an excise shop.	Having	enjoyed	 the
benefit for several years and when action is proposed to  be
taken against him to terminate the licence, he contends that
the  law under which the permit was granted to him  offended
his  fundamental rights and therefore  constitutionally	 not
valid.	 It is asked whether it would be open to him to	 say
that the very Act under which the permit was granted to	 him
was  not valid in law.	To my mind, this  illustration	does
not  give  rise to any anomaly.	 Either a person can  run  a
motor  vehicle	or an excise shop with	licence	 or  without
licence.  On the basis the law is valid, a licence is  taken
and the motor vehicle is run under that licence and if	that
law  offends  his fundamental right and therefore  void,  he
continues to ran the business without licence, as no licence
is  required under a valid law.	 The aforesaid	illustration
does not, there. fore, give rise to any anomaly and even  if
it does, it does not affect the legal position.
I  have	 considered the various provisions relating  to	 the
fundamental  rights with a view to discover if there is	 any
justification  for the comment that without the aid  of	 the
doctrine  of  waiver a citizen,	 in  certain  circumstances,
would  be  in a worse position than that he would be  if  he
exercised his right.  I have shown that there is none.	 Nor
is  there any basis for the suggestion that the State  would
irreparably  suffer  under certain contingencies;  for,	 any
resulting hardship would be its
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_93">78</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_94">618</span>
own  making and could be avoided if it acted  in  accordance
with law.
</p><p id="p_248">A  large  majority  of our  people  are	 economically  poor,
educationally backward and politically not yet conscious  of
their  rights.	 Individually  or  even	 collectively,	they
cannot	be  pitted  against  the  State	 organizations	 and
institutions,  nor  can they meet them on equal	 terms.	  In
such circumstances, it is the duty of this Court to  protect
their  rights  against themselves.  I  have,  therefore,  no
hesitation in holding that the fundamental rights created by
the Constitution are transcendental in nature, conceived and
enacted	 in  national  and public  interest,  and  therefore
cannot be waived.
</p><p id="p_249">That apart, I would go further and hold that as section 5(1)
of the Act XXX of 1947 was declared to be void by this Court
in <a href="/doc/1125816/" id="a_417">M. Ct.  Muthiah v. The Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras</a>
(1),  the  appellant  can. not, by the	application  of	 the
doctrine of waiver, validate the enquiry made under the said
Act.  It is suggested that there is a distinction between  a
case   where  the  enactment  is  beyond   the	 legislative
competence  Of	the Legislature which made it and  the	case
where the law is unconstitutional on the ground of existence
of  a  constitutional limitation, that while in	 the  former
case the law is null and void, in the latter case the law is
unenforceable  and  may	 be revived by the  removal  of	 the
limitation  by	an amendment of the Constitution.   On	this
distinction an argument is sought to be built to the  effect
that  as in the present case s. 5(1) of the Act XXX of	1947
was  declared to be invalid only on the ground that  it	 was
hit  by <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_418">Art. 14</a> of the Constitution, the law must be  deemed
to  be on the statute book and therefore the  appellant	 was
within	his right to waive his constitutional guarantee.   I
am unable to appreciate this, argument.
</p><p id="p_250">The  scope of <a href="/doc/1010805/" id="a_419">Art. 13(1)</a> of the Constitution was  considered
by  this  Court in Keshavan Madhava Menon v.  The  state  of
Bombay	(2).  This Court by a majority held that <a href="/doc/1010805/" id="a_420">Art.  13(1)</a>
of the Constitution does not make
(1) [1955] 2 S.C.R. 1247.

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_95">619</span>
<p id="p_252">existing  laws which are inconsistent with  the	 fundamental
rights,	  void	ab  initio,  but  only	renders	 such	laws
unenforceable  and void with respect to the exercise of	 the
fundamental rights on and after the date of commencement  of
the  Constitution.  Mahajan, C. J., who was a party to	that
decision,  explained  the word ,void' in <a href="/doc/1010805/" id="a_421">Art. 13(1)</a>  of	 the
Constitution in <a href="/doc/1683423/" id="a_422">Behram Khurshed Pesikaka v. State of  Bombay</a>
(1).  He observed at page 652 thus:-
</p><p id="p_253">" It is axiomatic that when the law-making power of a  State
is  restricted	by  written fundamental law,  then  any	 law
enacted	 and opposed to the fundamental law is in excess  of
the legislative authority and is thus a nullity.  Both these
declarations  of unconstitutionality go to the root  of	 the
power itself and there is no real distinction between  them.
They represent but two aspects of want of legislative power.
The   legislative   power  of  Parliament  and	 the   State
Legislatures  as  conferred  by Arts. 245  and	246  of	 the
Constitution  stands  curtailed by  the	 fundamental  rights
Chapter of the Constitution."
</p><p id="p_254">This decision in clear and unambiguous terms lays down	that
there  cannot  be  any	distinction  on	 principle   between
Constitutional	incompetency and Constitutional	 limitation.
In either case, the Act is void, though in the latter  case,
the pre-constitutional rights and liabilities arising  under
the  statute  are saved.  This Court again  dealt  with	 the
meaning	 of  the word  void' in <a href="/doc/762155/" id="a_423">Bhikaji	 Narain	 Dhakras  v.
State of Madhya Pradesh</a> (2).  There the question was whether
an Act 'Which was declared void on the ground of  inconsist-
ency with the Constitution, can be revived by any subsequent
amendment  to the Constitution removing	 the  inconsistency.
This  Court answered the question in the affirmative.	Das,
acting C.; J., observed at page 598 thus:-
</p><p id="p_255">"  As  explained in Keshavan Madhava Menon's case,  the	 law
became void not in toto or for all purposes or for all times
or  for	 all  persons  but  only  to  the  extent  of	such
inconsistency  that  is	 to,say, to the	 extent,  it  became
inconsistent with the provisions of Part
(1) [1955] 1 S. C. R. 613.
</p><p id="p_256">(2) [1955] 2 S. C. R. 589.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_96">620</span>
<p id="p_257">III which conferred the fundamental rights on the  citizens.
It did not become void independently of the existence of the
rights guaranteed by Part III...... In Short, <a href="/doc/1010805/" id="a_424">Article  13(1)</a>
had  the effect of nullifying or rendering the existing	 law
which  had become inconsistent with <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_425">Art. 19(1)(g)</a> read	with
clause (6) as it then stood ineffectual, nugatory and devoid
of any legal force or binding effect only with the  exercise
of  the	 fundamental  right on and after  the  date  of	 the
commencement of the Constitution..................... It  is
only as against the citizens that they remained in a dormant
or moribund condition.	In our judgment, after the amendment
of  clause  (6)	 of  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_426">Art. 19</a> on the  18th  June,  1951,	 the
impugned  Act  ceased  to  be  unconstitutional	 and  became
revivified  and	 enforceable  against citizens	as  well  as
against non-citizens."
</p><p id="p_258">This  judgment	does not say anything  different  from	that
expressed  in Keshavan Madhava Menon's case (1) nor does  it
dissent from the view expressed by Mahajan, C. J., in Behram
Khurshed's  case  (2).	 The  problem  that  confronted	 the
learned	 Judges was a different one and they resolved it  by
applying  the  doctrine of "eclipse'.  The  legal  position,
vis-a-vis, the law declared to be void either on the  ground
of  legislative incompetence or for the reason of  constitu-
tional	limitation,  as	 stated in  the	 earlier  decisions,
</p><p id="p_259">-remains  unshaken  by	this  decision.	  So  long  as	 the
inconsistency  remains the law continues to be void, at	 any
rate  vis-a-vis the fundamental rights of a person.  We	 are
not concerned in this case with the doctrine of revival; for
the inconsistency of<a href="/doc/1128347/" id="a_427"> s. 5(1)</a> of the Act with the fundamental
right under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_428">Art. 14</a> of the Constitution has not been removed
by any amendment of the Constitution.  So long as it is	 not
done,  the  said  section  is void  and	 cannot	 affect	 the
fundamental  rights of the citizens.  <a href="/doc/1125816/" id="a_429">In M. Ct.	 Muthiah  v.
The Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras</a> (3), it was  declared
that s. 5(1) of Act XXX of 1947 was unconstitutional on	 the
ground	that  it  infringed the fundamental  rights  of	 the
citizens under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_430">Art. 14</a> of the Constitution.
(1) [1951] S.C.R. 228.		  (2) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 613.

<p id="p_260">Under <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_431">Art. 141</a> of the Constitution, the law declared by	 the
Supreme	 Court	is binding on all the Courts in	 India.	  It
follows that the Income-tax Commissioner had no jurisdiction
to continue the proceedings against the appellant under	 Act
XXX  of 1947.  If the Commissioner had no jurisdiction,	 the
appellant could not by waiving his right confer jurisdiction
on him.
</p><p id="p_261">The  scope of the doctrine of waiver was considered by	this
Court  in  Behram Khurshed's case(1).  There  a	 person	 was
prosecuted  for	 an  offence under s. 66(b)  of	 the  Bombay
Prohibition Act and he was sentenced to one month's rigorous
imprisonment.  One of the questions raised there was whether
s. 13(b) of the Bombay Prohibition Act, having been declared
to be void under <a href="/doc/1010805/" id="a_432">Art. 13(1)</a> of the Constitution in so far as
it  affected the consumption or use of liquid  medicinal  or
toilet	preparation containing alcohol, the prosecution	 was
maintainable  for infringement of that section.	  The  Court
held  that  in India once the law has been  struck  down  as
unconstitutional  by  the Supreme Court, no  notice  can  be
taken  of it by any Court, because, after it is declared  as
unconstitutional, it is no longer law and is null and  void.
Even  so, it was contended that the accused had	 waived	 his
fundamental  right  and therefore he could not	sustain	 his
defence.   Mahajan,  C. J., delivering the judgment  of	 the
majority,  repelled  this  contention  with  the   following
observations at page 653:-
</p><p id="p_262">"  The	learned Attorney General when questioned  about	 the
doctrine  did  not seem to be very  enthusiastic  about	 it.
Without	 finally expressing an opinion on this	question  we
are  not for the moment convinced that this theory  has	 any
relevancy in construing the fundamental rights conferred  by
Part  III  of our Constitution.	 We think  that	 the  rights
described as fundamental rights are a necessary	 consequence
of the declaration in the preamble that the people of  India
have solemnly resolved to constitute India into a  sovereign
democratic  republic  and  to secure  to  all  its  citizens
justice,  social,  economic  and  political  ;	liberty	 ,of
thought, expression, belief, faith and worship;
(1)  [1955] 1 S.C.R. 613.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_98">622</span>
<p id="p_263">equality  of status and of opportunity.	  These	 fundamental
rights have not been put in the Constitution merely for	 the
individual   benefit  though  ultimately  they	 come	into
operation in considering individual rights.  They have	been
put  there as a matter of public policy and the doctrine  of
waiver	can have no application to provisions of  law  which
have  been  enacted as a matter	 of  Constitutional  policy.
Reference  to  some of the articles,  inter  alia,  Articles
15(1) 20, 21, makes the proposition quite plain.  A  citizen
cannot	get  discrimination by telling the  State  'You	 can
discriminate',	or get convicted by waiving  the  protection
given  under Articles 20 and 21."
</p><p id="p_264">On  the	 question of waiver, Venkatarama Aiyar, J.,  in	 his
judgment  before review, considered the	 American  decisions
and   was  inclined  to	 take  the  view  that	 under	 our
Constitution when a law contravenes the provisions  intended
for  the benefit of the individual, it can be  waived.	 But
the  learned  Judge made it clear in his judgment  that	 the
question  of  waiver  had no bearing to any  issue  of	fact
arising for determination in that case but only for  showing
the nature of the right declared under <a href="/doc/258019/" id="a_433">Art. 19(1)(f)</a> and the
effect in law of a statute contravening it.  Das, J., as  he
then was, in his dissenting judgment, did not state his view
on this question but expressly reserved it in the  following
words:-
</p><p id="p_265">" In coming to the conclusion that I have, I have in a large
measure	 found	myself	in  agreement  with  the  views	  of
Venkatarama  Aiyar,  J.,  on  that part	 of  the  case.	  I,
however, desire to guard myself against being understood  to
agree  with the rest of the observations to be found in	 his
judgment,   particularly   those  relating  to	 waiver	  of
'unconstitutionality,  the fundamental rights being  a	mere
check  on  the	legislative  power  or	the  effect  of	 the
declaration  under <a href="/doc/1010805/" id="a_434">Art. 13(1)</a> being  relatively	 void'.	  On
those topics prefer to express no opinion on this occasion."
I respectfully agree with the observations of Mahajan, C. J.
For the aforesaid reasons,  hold that the doctrine of waiver
has  no application in the case of fundamental rights  under
our Constitution.
