HEADNOTE:
The respondent entered into a partnership agreement with the
appellant.   But  this	was not registered.   There  was  an
arbitration clause sti-
51
pulating that in case of dispute the matter will be referred
for  arbitration in accordance with <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_5">Arbitration	 Act</a>,  1940.
Dispute	 having	 arisen	 between  the  respondent  and	 the
appellant  the former wrote to the latter stating  that	 the
dispute be referred for arbitration and that the  respondent
has appointed one K as the sole arbitrator.  On the  failure
of  the appellant to agree to this the respondent  filed  an
application under<a href="/doc/411664/" id="a_6"> s. 8(2)</a> of the Indian Arbitration Act	 for
the appointment of arbitrator.	The application was heard by
a  Division  Bench  of	the  High  Court  before  which	 the
appellant contended that<a href="/doc/403386/" id="a_7"> s. 69(3)</a> of the Indian	 Partnership
Act,  1932  afforded  a	 bar to	 the  petition	because	 the
partnership  was not registered.  One of the  Judges  upheld
the  contention while the other rejected it and	 the  matter
was referred to another Judge who held that the	 application
was  competent.	  The present appeal was  filed	 by  special
leave granted by this Court.
HELD:--(i)  Thai since the arbitration clause formed a	part
of the agreement constituting the partnership it is  obvious
that the proceeding which is before the Court is to  enforce
a right which arises from a contract.  Whether one views the
contract  between the parties as a whole or one	 views	only
the  arbitration clause it is impossible to think  that	 the
right  to  proceed to arbitration is not one of	 the  rights
which  are  founded on the agreement of	 the  parties.	 The
words  of<a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_8"> s. 69(3)</a> "a right arising from a contract" are  in
either sense sufficient to cover the present matters.
(ii) Interpretation  ejusdem  genuris or noscitur  a  sociis
need not always be made when showing particular classes	 are
followed try general words.  Before the general words can be
so  interpreted	 there	must be a  genus  constituted  or  a
category disclosed with reference to which the general words
can  and  are  intended to be  restricted.   The  expression
"claim of set off" does not disclose a category or a  genus.
Set  offs are of two kinds legal and equitable and both	 are
already	 comprehended  and it is difficult to think  of	 any
right "arising from a contract' which is of the same  nature
as  a claim of set off and can be raised by a  dependent  in
suit.

(iii)  The words "other proceeding" in sub-section (3)	must
receive
their full meaning untramelled by the words "a claim of	 set
off.   The latter words neither intend nor can be  construed
to cut down the generality of the words "other	proceeding".
The   sub-section  provides  for  the  application  of	 the
provisions of sub-sections (1) and (2) to claims of set	 off
and also to other proceedings of any kind which can properly
be  said  to be for enforcement of any	right  arising	from
contract  except those expressly mentioned as exceptions  in
subsections (3) and (4).

JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 791 of 1962.
Appeal	by special leave from the judgment and	order  dated
March 22, 1960, of the Bombay High Court in Award No. 18  of
1959.
</p><p id="p_2">S.   T. Desai and I. N. Shroff, for the appellant.
B.   C. Misra, for the respondent.
</p><p id="p_3">April 29, 1964.	 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
HIDAYATULLAH  J.-This  appeal by special leave	is  directed
against an order of the High Court of Bombay dated March 22,
1960 in its ordinary original civil jurisdiction.  The facts
are  simple.   By  a letter dated  July	 30,  1955,  Messrs.
Kajaria rraders (India) Ltd., who is the respondent here and
Messrs.	   Foreign  Import  and	 Export	 Association   (sole
proprietory  firm owned by the appellant Jagdish  C.  Gupta)
entered	 into  a partnership to export between	January	 and
June 1956, 10,000 tons of manganese ore to Phillips Brothers
(India)	 Ltd.,	New  York.  Each partner  was  to  supply  a
certain	 quantity  of manganese ore.  We are  not  concerned
with the terms of the agreement but with one of its  clauses
which provided:
</p><p id="p_4">"That  in  case of dispute the matter will be  referred	 for
arbitration in accordance with the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_9">Indian Arbitration Act</a>."
The  company  alleged that Jagdish Chander Gupta  failed  to
carry out his part of the partnership agreement.  After some
correspondence,	 the company wrote to Jagdish Chander  Gupta
on February 28, 1959 that they had appointed Mr. R. J. Kolah
(Advocate  O.S.)  as  their  arbitrator	 and  asked  Jagdish
Chander Gupta either to agree to Mr. Kolah's appointment  as
sole  arbitrator or to appoint his own arbitrator.   Jagdish
Chander	 Gupta put off consideration and on March  17,	1959
the  company informed Jagdish Chander Gupta that as  he	 had
failed	to appoint an arbitrator within 15 clear  days	they
were  appointing  Mr.  Kolah as	 sole  arbitrator.   Jagdish
Chander Gupta disputed this and the corn-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">53</span>
<p id="p_5">pany  filed on March 28, 1959 an application under<a href="/doc/1232861/" id="a_10"> s. 8</a>	 (2)
of  the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_11">Indian Arbitration Act</a>, 1940 for the appointment  of
Mr. Kolah or any other person as arbitrator.
Jagdish	 Chander Gupta appeared and objected inter  alia  to
the institution of the petition.  Two grounds were urged (i)
that <a href="/doc/411664/" id="a_12"> s. 8(2)</a> of the Indian Arbitration Act was	 not  appli-
cable  as it was not expressly provided in  the	 arbitration
clause	quoted	above  that the arbitrators were  to  be  by
consent of the parties and (ii) that<a href="/doc/403386/" id="a_13"> s. 69(3)</a> of the  Indian
Partnership Act, 1932 afforded a bar to the petition because
the partnership was not registered.  The petition was refer-
red by the Chief Justice to a Divisional Bench consisting of
Mr. Justice Mudholkar (as he then was) and Mr. Justice Naik.
The  two learned Judges agreed that in the circumstances  of
the case an application under<a href="/doc/1232861/" id="a_14"> s. 8</a> of the Indian Arbitration
Act was competent and that the court had power to appoint an
arbitrator.  They disagreed on the second point: Mr. Justice
Mudholkar  was	of the opinion that<a href="/doc/403386/" id="a_15"> s. 69(3)</a> of	 the  Indian
Partnership  Act  barred the application while	Mr.  Justice
Naik  held  otherwise,	The case was then  referred  to	 Mr.
Justice K. T. Desai (as he then was) and he agreed with	 Mr.
Justice	 Naik with the result that the application was	held
to be competent.
</p><p id="p_6">In this appeal it was not contended that the conclusions  of
the learned Judges in regard to<a href="/doc/411664/" id="a_16"> s. 8(2)</a> were erroneous.	 The
decision was challenged only on the ground that<a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_17"> s. 69(3)</a> was
wrongly	 interpreted and the bar afforded by it was  wrongly
disallowed.  <a href="/doc/797638/" id="a_18">Section 69</a> of the Indian
Partnership    Act may be reproduced here :

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">55</span>
<p id="p_14">s.   (1)  prohibits  the  institution  of  a  suit   between
partners  inter se or between partners and the firm for	 the
purpose	 of  .enforcing a right arising from a	contract  or
conferred  by  the  <a href="/doc/107341/" id="a_24">Partnership	 Act</a>  unless  the  firm	  is
registered and the person suing is or has been shown in	 the
Register  of  Firms as a partner in the	 firm.	 Sub-s.	 (2)
similarly  prohibits  a	 suit by or on behalf  of  the	firm
against	 a third party for the purpose of  enforcing  rights
arising	 from a contract unless the firm is  registered	 and
the  person  suing is or has been shown in the	Register  of
Firms as a partner in the firm.	 In the third sub-section  a
claim  of set-off which is in the nature of a counter  claim
is also similarly barred.  Then that subsection bars  "other
proceedings".	The only doubt that has arisen in this	case
is  regarding  the  meaning to be given	 to  the  expression
"other	proceeding".   One way to look at the matter  is  to
give  these  words their full and natural  meaning  and	 the
other  way is to cut down that meaning in the light  of	 the
words that -precede them.  The next question is whether	 the
application  under <a href="/doc/1232861/" id="a_25"> s. 8</a> (2) of the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_26">Arbitration Act</a>  can  be
regarded as a proceeding "to enforce a right arising from  a
contract",  and therefore, within the bar of <a href="/doc/797638/" id="a_27">section  69</a>  of
the Indian Partnership Act.
</p><p id="p_15">Mr.  Justice  Mudholkar in reaching his conclusion  did	 not
interpret the expression "other proceeding" ejusdem  generis
with  the words "a claim of set-off".  He held further	that
the  application  was to enforce a right  arising  from	 the
contract of the parties.  Mr. Justice Naik pointed out	that
the  words  used were not "any proceeding"  nor	 "any  other
proceedings" but "other proceeding" and that as these  words
were juxtaposed with 'a claim of set off' they indicated  a,
proceeding  of	the nature of a claim in  defence.   On	 the
second	point  Mr.  Justice Naik held that this	 was  not  a
proceeding  to enforce a right arising from a  contract	 but
was  a claim for damages and such a claim, could  be  enter-
tained	because	 it was based on something which  was  inde-
pendent	 of the contract to supply ore.	 He held  that	the,
right which was being enforced was a right arising from	 the
<a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_28">Arbitration  Act</a> and not from the contract of  the  parties.
Mr.  Justice K. T. Desai agreed with most of  these  conclu-
sions and suggeted that the words preceding "other proceed-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">56</span>
<p id="p_16">ing",  namely, "a claim of set-off" had	 'demonstrative	 and
limiting effect'.  He seems to have ascertained the  meaning
of  the	 expression "other proceeding" by reference  to	 the
meaning	 of  the  words	 "a claim  of  set  off",  which  he
considered were associated with it.
</p><p id="p_17">Ile  first  question to decide is whether the  present	pro-
ceeding is one to enforce a right arising from the  contract
of the parties.	 The proceeding under the eighth section  of
the  <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_29">Arbitration  Act</a>  has its genesis	in  the	 arbitration
clause, because without an agreement to refer the matter  to
arbitration that section cannot possibly be invoked.   Since
the   arbitration  clause  is  a  part	of   the   agreement
constituting   the  partnership	 it  is	 obvious  that	 the
proceeding  which is before the court is to enforce a  right
which arises from a contract.  Whether we view the  contract
between	 the  parties as ;a whole or view  only	 the  clause
about arbitration, it is impossible to think that the  right
to proceed to arbitration is not one of the rights which are
founded on the . agreement of the parties.  The words of <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_30"> s.
69(3)</a> "a right arising from a contract" are in either  sense
sufficient to cover the present matter.
</p><p id="p_18">It  remains, however, to consider whether by reason  of	 the
fact that the words "other proceeding" stand opposed to	 the
words  "a claim of set-off" any limitation in  their  eaning
was contemplated.  It is on this aspect of the case that the
learned	 Judges have seriously differed.  When in a  statute
particular  classes  are  mentioned by	name  and  then	 are
followed  by general words, the general words are  sometimes
construed ejusdem generis, i.e. limited to the same category
or  genus comprehended by the particular wordsbut it is	 not
necessary that this rule must alwavs apply.
The nature of the special words and the general words must e
considered before the rule is applied.	In Allen v.
Emerson	 (1),  Asquith	J.  gave  interesting  examples	  of
particular  words  followed  by	 general  words	 where	 the
Principle  of ejusdem generis might or might not apply.	  We
ink   that  the	 following  illustration  will	 clear	 any
difflculty.  In the expression "books, pamphlets, newspapers
and other
(1)  [i944] 1 K.B. 362.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">57</span>
<p id="p_19">documents"  private  letters  may not be  held	included  it
'other	documents' be intepreted ejusdem generis  with	what
goes before.  But in a provision which reads "newspapers  or
other document likely to convey secrets to the enemy",	the,
words  'other document' would include document of  any	kind
and  would  not	 take their colour  from  'newspapers'.	  It
follows,  therefore, that interpretation ejusdem generis  or
noscitur a sociis need not always be made when words showiig
particular  classes are followed by general  words.   Before
the  general  words can be so interpreted there	 must  be  a
genus constituted or a category disclosed with reference  to
which  the  general  words  can	 and  are  intended  to	  be
restricted.  Here the expression "claim of set-off" does not
disclose a category or a genus.	 Set-offs are of two kinds--
legal and equitable-and both are already comprehended and it
is difficult to think of any right "arising from a contract"
which is of the same nature as a claim of set-off and can be
raised	by a defendant in a suit.  Mr. B. C. Misra, whom  we
invited	 to give us examples, admitted frankly that  it	 was
impossible for him to think of any proceeding of the  nature
of  a claim of set off other than a claim of  set-off  which
could be raised in a suit such as is described in the second
sub-section.   In respect of the first sub-secton  he  could
give  only two examples.  They are (i) a claim by a  pledger
of goods with an unregistered firm whose goods are  attached
and who has to make an objection under 0. 21
r.   58 of the Code of Civil Procedure and (ii) proving a
debt	before	 a   liquidator.    The	  latter   is	 not
raised as a
defence	 and cannot belong to the same genus as a "claim  of
set-off".  The former can be made to fit but by a stretch of
some  considerable imagination.	 It is difficult for Lis  to
accept that the Legislature was thinking of such far-fetched
things	when it spoke of "other proceeding" ejusdem  generis
with a claim of set-off.
</p><p id="p_20">Mr. Justice Naik asked the question that if all	 proceedings
were to be excluded why was it not considered suffi cient to
speak of proceedings along with suits in sub-ss. (1) and (2)
instead	 of framing a separate subsection about	 proceedings
and coupling 'other proceeding,' with 'a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">58</span>
the  search  for the answer in the' scheme  of	the  section
itself	gives the clue.	 The section thinks in terms of	 (a)
suits and (b) claims of set-off which are in a sense of	 the
nature	of suits and (c) of other proceedings.	The  section
first  provides	 for exclusion of suits in sub-ss.  (1)	 and
(2).   Then it says that the same ban applies to a claim  of
set-off and other proceeding to enforce a right arising from
a  contract.   Next it excludes the ban in  respect  of	 the
right  to  sue (a) for the dissolution of a  firm,  (b)	 for
accounts of. a dissolved firm and (c) for the realisation of
the property of a dissolved firm.  The emphasis in each case
is  on	dissolution  of the firm.  Then	 follows  a  general
exclusion of the section.  The fourth sub-section says	that
the  section  as  a whole, is not to apply to  firms  or  to
partners  and firms which have no place of business  in	 the
territories  of	 India	or  whose  places  of  business	 are
situated  in the territories of India but in areas to  which
Chapter	 VII is not to apply and to suits or claims  of	 set
off  not  exceeding  Rs. 100 in value.	 Here  there  is  no
insistence   on	 the  dissolution  of  the  firm.    It	  is
significant  that in the latter part of clause (b)  of	that
section the words are "or to any proceeding in execution  or
other proceeding incidental to or arising from any such suit
or claim" and this clearly shows that the word	"proceeding"
is not limited to a proceeding in the nature of a suit or  a
claim of set-off.  Subsection (4) combines suits and a claim
of set-off and then speaks of "any proceeding in  execution"
and "other proceeding incidental to or arising from any such
suit  or  clainm"  as  being outside the  ban  of  the	main
section.   It  would  hardly have been necessary  to  be  so
explicit if the words
other  proceeding  in  the main section	 had  a	 meaning  as
restricted  as	is  suggested  by  the	respondent.   It  is
possible  that the draftsman wishing to make  exceptions  of
different  kinds in respect of suits, claims of set-off	 and
other proceedings grouped suits in sub-ss. (1) and (2), set-
off  and other proceedings in sub-s. (3) made  some  special
exceptions  in respect of them in sub-s. (3) in	 respect  of
dissolved firms and then viewed them all together in  sub-s.
(4)  providing for a complete exclusion' of the	 section  in
respect of suits of particular classes.	 For convenience  of
drafting this
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">59</span>
scheme was probably followed and nothing can be spelled	 out
from the manner in which the section is sub-divided.
Some  cases noticed by the High Court were cited to  us	 but
none of them appears to be really in point.  In Hafiz  Qamar
Din v. Nur Din(') and Babutal Dhandhania v. Messrs.  Gauttam
and  Co.(') proceedings were started on an award, in one  to
make  it a rule of the Court and in the other to get it	 set
aside.	 These cases are distinguishable because  they	deal
with awards and it is not necessary to decide whether  after
an  award the proceeding is one to enforce a  right  arising
from  a	 contract.  We do not refer to them.   In  Kottamasu
Sreemannarayanamuthy  and  another v.  Chakka  Arjanadu()  a
petition for adjudication of a partner as insolvent was held
to be a right arising not from, a contract but from statute.
Here the right that is being enforced through the medium  of
the  <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_31">Arbitration  Act</a> arises from the contract	between	 the
parties	 and  is a part of it. In Jamal v.  Firm  Umar	Haji
Karim  (4  )  the bar of<a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_32"> s. 69(3)</a>  was	claimed	 during	 the
execution of a consent decree and was disallowed.  Grille C.
J. observed that the expression 'other proceeding' indicated
something which was 'sui generis of a claim of set-off'.  If
the  partners of an unregistered firm. go to  court  without
either asking for a dissolution of the firm or dissolving it
themselves  and	 enter into an agreement and  compose  their
differences  it is possible to say that the  enforcement  of
the  consent  decree is no more than the  enforcement  of  a
right arising from a contract and is within the ban.  It is,
however, not necessary to decide this point here. in Ram Lal
Harnam	Das  v. Pal Krishan and others()  it  was  expressly
pointed	 out that the expression 'other proceeding'  in	 the
third sub-section applied to proceedings of the nature of  a
claim of set-off and nothing else.  This case cannot be said
to interpret the sub-section correctly.	 Similarly, Mahendra
v.  Gurdeyal('), which lays down that<a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_33"> s. 69</a> does not  bar  a
partner of an unregistered partnership firm from applying to
the  court under<a href="/doc/1232861/" id="a_34"> s. 8</a> of the Arbitration Act  for  referring
the dispute

<p id="p_26">between partners to arbitrator as provided in the  condition
of  their  agreement,  cannot be  accepted  as	sound.	 The
,reason	 given by the Divisional Bench that as<a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_35"> s. 69</a>  allows
dissolution  and  accounts of  unregistered  partnership  it
cannot bar such an application appears to us to be not quite
in   Point.
</p><p id="p_27">In our judgment, the words 'other proceeding' in sub-
s.   (3) must receive their full meaning untramelled by the
words 'a claim of set-off'.  The latter words neither intend
nor can be construed to cut down the generality of the words
'other	proceeding'.   The  sub-section	 provides  for	 the
application  of	 the provisions of sub-ss. (1)	and  (2)  to
claims of set-off and also to other proceedings of any	Kind
which  can  properly be said to be for	enforcement  of	 any
right arising from contract except those expressly mentioned
as exceptions in sub-s. (3) and sub-s. (4).
The appeal is, therefore, allowed.  The decision of the High
Court will be set aside and the application under<a href="/doc/411664/" id="a_36"> s. 8(2)</a> of
the  Arbitration  Act  shall  stand  dismissed	with   costs
throughout on the applicant in the High Court.
Appeal allowed
