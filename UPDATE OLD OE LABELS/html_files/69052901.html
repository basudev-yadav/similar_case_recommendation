<p id="p_1">VIBHU BAKHRU, J

</p><p id="p_2">1.       These petitions are filed inter alia impugning a common order dated
14.12.2009 passed by the Central Information Commission (hereafter
'CIC') directing the Public Information Officers, Commissioner of Income-
tax (hereafter 'PIO') to provide inspection of the records and also other
information sought for by the respondent relating to the income tax returns
filed by the petitioners (other than the petitioner in W.P.(C) No.214 of
2010).

<p id="p_3"> 2.       Brief facts which are relevant for examining the controversy in the
present petitions are that on 13.01.2009, Rakesh Kumar Gupta -
respondent, who is stated to be an informer to the income tax department,
filed an application under the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_1">Information Act</a>, 2005 (hereafter the
'Act') with the PIO inter alia seeking information and all the records
available with the Income tax department in respect of nine assessees (out
of the said assesses one assessee was deleted due to repetition) for various
assessment years. The respondent had also sought:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">         "1. Inspection of all records in above respect.

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">         2. Kindly provide the copies of the documents mentioned at
         the time of inspection.

         complete request to them including all the annexure e.g.

the assessment years are as under:-

         pertaining to Assessment Year 2000-01 to 2005-06.

<p id="p_13">4.       Since the information sought by the respondent is third party
information, the Deputy Commissioner of Income-tax issued separate
notices dated 04.02.2009 under <a href="/doc/375524/" id="a_2">Section 11(2)</a> of the Act to the assessees.
The assessees submitted their separate objections and objected to the
inspection and furnishing of the information. PIO considered the objections
of the assessees and rejected the RTI application of the respondent, by its
common order dated 16.02.2009, on the ground that the respondent has
failed to substantiate the public interest involved in disclosing the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 &amp; other connected matters                  Page 4 of 29</span>
 information relating to third parties. PIO, however, held that the Tax
Evasion Petition is under compilation and would be provided in due course.
</p>
<p id="p_14">5.       The respondent preferred separate appeals before the First Appellate
Authority - Addl. Commissioner of Income-tax (hereafter the 'FAA')
against the order of PIO. By a common order dated 08.05.2009, FAA
rejected the appeal of the respondent. Aggrieved by the order dated
08.05.2009 of FAA, the respondent preferred an appeal before the CIC. By
the impugned order dated 14.12.2009, the CIC allowed the appeal and
directed PIO to provide inspection of the records and also other information
sought for by the respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_15">6.        The learned counsel for the petitioner contended:-
</p>
<p id="p_16">6.1      that the information sought for by the respondent such as income tax
returns are personal information and are exempt from disclosure under
<a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_3">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act. Reliance was placed on decision of Supreme
Court in <a href="/doc/160205361/" id="a_4">Girish Ramchandra Deshpande v. Central Information Commr</a>.:
(2013) 1 SCC 212, decision of Full Bench of this Court in Secretary

<p id="p_17">6.2      that the disclosure of the income tax returns is prohibited under
<a href="/doc/1448409/" id="a_6">Section 138</a> of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and can be made only if the
Commissioner is satisfied that the disclosure is in public interest, which in
the present case was rejected by the Commissioner. Reference was made to

New Delhi</a>: (1974) 10 DLT 96.

<p id="p_18">6.3      that the disclosure of information is also exempted under <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_8">Section
8(1)(e)</a> of the Act as the income tax department is holding the information
of the assessees in fiduciary capacity.
</p>
<p id="p_19">6.4      that the respondent has failed to disclose the public interest which is
a mandatory requirement under <a href="/doc/375524/" id="a_9">Section 11</a> of the Act for disclosure of
confidential and personal third party information.
</p>
<p id="p_20">6.5      that the disclosure of the information sought for would be violative
of the right to privacy, which has been read into <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_10">Article 21</a> of the
Constitution of India. Reference was made to paragraph 110 to 112 of the
decision of this court in Secretary General, Supreme Court of <a href="/doc/155236387/" id="a_11">India v.
Subhash Chandra Agarwal &amp; Anr</a>.: 166 (2010) DLT 305.
</p>
<p id="p_21">6.6      that the disclosure of income tax returns is expressly forbidden to be
published by a tribunal, in the present case and the CIC               therefore,
exempted under <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_12">Section 8(1)(b)</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_22">7.       The respondent contended:-
</p>
<p id="p_23">7.1      that he is an informer with the income tax department and sought the
information in public interest in order to recover the tax evaded by the
petitioners, to recover the properties mis-appropriated by the petitioners and
to curb corruption and therefore, the exemptions provided under <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_13">Section
8(1)(e)</a> and (j) of the Act are not applicable.

<p id="p_24"> 7.2      that the bank details and tax details should be given to public, where
prima facie wrong doing is detected by the government. Reliance was
placed on <a href="/doc/1232445/" id="a_14">Ram Jethmalani &amp; Ors. v. Union of India</a>: (2011) 8 SCC 1.
</p>
<p id="p_25">7.3      that the activities performed by the income tax department are public
in nature and the income tax records are public documents. Reliance was
placed on <a href="/doc/1964560/" id="a_15">Bhagat Singh v. Chief Information Commissioner and Ors</a>.:
146 (2008) DLT 385.
</p>
<p id="p_26">7.4      that the disclosure of information under <a href="/doc/1869099/" id="a_16">Section 3</a> of the Act is the
rule and exemption under <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_17">Section 8</a> of the Act is the exception.
</p>
<p id="p_27">8.       The controversy that needs to be addressed is whether income tax
returns and the information provided to the income tax authorities during
the course of assessment and proceedings thereafter, are exempt under the
provision <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_18">Section 8(1)</a> of the Act and further whether in the given
circumstances of this case, the CIC was correct in holding that such
information was required to be disclosed in public interest.
</p>
<p id="p_28">9.       By virtue of <a href="/doc/1869099/" id="a_19">Section 3</a> of the Act all citizens have a right to
information subject to provisions of the Act. The expression "information"
is defined under <a href="/doc/138145044/" id="a_20">Section 2(f)</a> of the Act as under:-
</p>

         samples, models, data material held in any electronic form and
         information relating to any private body which can be accessed
         by a public authority under any other law for the time being in

provisions of the Act have an overriding effect over any other inconsistent
law or instrument.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_29">11.      The petitioners have contended that the income tax returns and other
information provided by the assessees during the course of assessment
would be exempt from disclosure by virtue of <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_22">section 8(1)(d)</a>, <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_23">Section
8(1)(e)</a> and <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_24">8(1)(j)</a> of the Act. It is thus necessary to examine the
applicability of each of the above provisions with respect to the information
sought by the respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_30">12.      <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_25">Section 8(1)(d)</a> of the Act expressly provides an exemption in respect
of such information. At this stage, it is necessary to refer to <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_26">Section 8(1)(d)</a>
of the Act which reads as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">         "8. Exemption from disclosure of information.-- (1)

             or intellectual property, the disclosure of which would harm
             the competitive position of a third party, unless the
             competent authority is satisfied that larger public interest
             warrants the disclosure of such information;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_31">13.      Certain petitioners had specifically pleaded that information provided
in the income tax returns could not be disclosed as the information was
provided in confidence. The CIC rejected the same by holding that the
parties had failed to explain as to how that ground could apply or how


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 &amp; other connected matters                            Page 8 of 29</span>
 disclosure of information relating to commercial confidence would harm
their competitive interest.
</p>
<p id="p_32">14.      The income tax returns filed by an assessee and further information
that is provided during the assessment proceedings may also include
confidential information relating to the business or the affairs of an
assessee. An assessee is expected to truly and fairly disclose particulars
relevant for the purposes of assessment of income tax. The nature of the
disclosure required is not limited only to information that has been placed
by an assessee in public domain but would also include information which
an assessee may consider confidential. As a matter of illustration, one may
consider a case of a manufacturer who manufactures and deals in multiple
products for supplies to different agencies.     In the normal course, an
Assessing Officer would require an assessee to disclose profit margins on
sales of such products. Such information would clearly disclose the pricing
policy of the assessee and public disclosure of this information may clearly
jeopardise the bargaining power available to the assessee since the data as
to costs would be available to all agencies dealing with the assessee. It is,
thus, essential that information relating to business affairs, which is
considered to be confidential by an assessee must remain so, unless it is
necessary in larger public interest to disclose the same. If the nature of
information is such that disclosure of which may have the propensity of
harming one's competitive interests, it would not be necessary to
specifically show as to how disclosure of such information would, in fact,
harm the competitive interest of a third party. In order to test the
applicability of <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_27">Section 8(1)(d)</a> of the Act it is necessary to first and




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 &amp; other connected matters                   Page 9 of 29</span>
 foremost determine the nature of information and if the nature of
information is confidential information relating to the affairs of a private
entity that is not obliged to be placed in public domain, then it is necessary
to consider whether its disclosure can possibly have an adverse effect on
third parties.
</p>
<p id="p_33">15.      Insofar as the applicability of <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_28">Section 8(1)(e)</a> of the Act is concerned,
I am unable to accept the contention that a fiduciary relationship within the
meaning of <a href="/doc/1525538/" id="a_29">Section 8(1)(e)</a> of the Act can be attributed to a relationship
between an assessee and the income tax authority. The Supreme Court in
the case of <a href="/doc/1519371/" id="a_30">CBSE v. Aditya Bandopadhyay</a>: (2011) 8 SCC 497 had
explained that the words "information available to a person in its fiduciary
relationship" could not be construed in a wide sense but has to be
considered in the normal and recognized sense. The relevant extract of the
said decision is quoted below:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">         "41. In a philosophical and very wide sense, examining bodies
         can be said to act in a fiduciary capacity, with reference to the
         students who participate in an examination, as a Government
         does while governing its citizens or as the present generation
         does with reference to the future generation while preserving
         the environment. But the words "information available to a
         person in his fiduciary relationship" are used in <a href="/doc/1494553/" id="a_31">Section 8(1)(e)</a>
         of the RTI Act in its normal and well-recognised sense, that is,
         to refer to persons who act in a fiduciary capacity, with
         reference to a specific beneficiary or beneficiaries who are to be
         expected to be protected or benefited by the actions of the
         fiduciary--a trustee with reference to the beneficiary of the
         trust, a guardian with reference to a minor/physically
         infirm/mentally challenged, a parent with reference to a child, a

</blockquote><p id="p_37">19.      The CIC rejected the aforesaid contention by holding that the
expression "personal information" would necessarily only apply to an
individual and could not be applicable in case of corporate entities.

<p id="p_38">20.      It has been contended by the petitioners that the expression "personal

Inasmuch as they may also fall within the definition of expression "person"

1961. However, I am unable to accept this contention for the reason that the
expression "personal information" as used in clause (j) of <a href="/doc/1001313/" id="a_43">Section 8(1)</a> of
the Act has to be read in the context of information relating to an
individual. A plain reading of the aforesaid clause would indicate that the

 expression "personal information" is linked with "invasion of privacy of the
individual".        The use of the word "the" before the word "individual"
immediately links the same with the expression "personal information"
</p>
<p id="p_39">21.      Black's law dictionary, sixth edition, inter alia, defines the word
"personal" as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">         "The word "personal" means appertaining to the person;
         belonging to an individual; limited to the person; having the
         nature or partaking of the qualities of human beings, or of
         movable property."
</blockquote><p id="p_40">22.      A perusal of the above definition also indicates that the ordinary
usage of the word "personal" is in the context of an individual human being
and not a corporate entity. The U.S. Supreme Court has also interpreted the
expression "personal" to be used in the context of an individual human
being and not a corporate entity. In the case of Federal Communications
Commission v. AT&amp;T Inc: 2011 US LEXIS 1899 the US Supreme Court
considered the meaning of the expression "personal privacy" in the context
of the <a href="/doc/411331/" id="a_44">Freedom of Information Act</a>, which required Federal Agencies to
make certain records and documents publically available on request. Such
disclosure was exempt if the records "could reasonably be expected to
constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy".          The U.S.
Supreme Court held that the expression "Personal" used in the aforesaid
context could not be extended to corporations because the word "personal"
ordinarily refers to individuals. The Court held that the expression
"personal" must be given its ordinary meaning. The relevant extract of the
said judgment is as under:
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 &amp; other connected matters                  Page 14 of 29</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">          ""Person" is a defined term in the statute; "personal" is
         not. When a statute does not define a term, we typically "give
         the phrase its ordinary meaning." Johnson v. United States, 559
         U.S. ___, ___, 559 U.S. 133, 130 S. Ct. 1265, 176 L. Ed. 2d 1,
         8 (2010). "Personal" ordinarily refers to individuals. We do not
         usually speak of personal characteristics, personal effects,
         personal correspondence, personal influence, or personal
         tragedy as referring to corporations or other artificial entities.
         This is not to say that corporations do not have correspondence,
         influence, or tragedies of their own, only that we do not use the
         word "personal" to describe them.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_21">         Certainly, if the chief executive officer of a corporation
         approached the chief financial officer and said, "I have
         something personal to tell you," we would not assume the CEO
         was about to discuss company business. Responding to a
         request for information, an individual might say, "that's
         personal." A company spokesman, when asked for
         information about the company, would not. In fact, we often
         use the word "personal" to mean precisely the opposite of
         business-related: We speak of personal expenses and business
         expenses, personal life and work life, personal opinion and a
         company's                                               view.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_22">         Dictionaries also suggest that "personal" does not ordinarily
         relate to artificial "persons" such as corporations. See, e.g., 7
         OED 726 (1933) ("[1] [o]f, pertaining to . . . the individual
         person or self," "individual; private; one's own," "[3] [o]f or
         pertaining to one's person, body, or figure," "[5] [o]f, pertaining
         to, or characteristic of a person or self-conscious being, as
         opposed to a thing or abstraction"); 11 OED at 599-600 (2d ed.
         1989) (same); Webster's Third New International Dictionary
         1686 (1976) ("[3] relating to the person or body"; "[4] relating
         to an individual, his character, conduct, motives, or private
         affairs"; "[5] relating to or characteristic of human beings as
         distinct from things"); ibid. (2002) (same)."

<p id="p_41"> 23.      In my view, the aforesaid reasoning would also be applicable to the
expression "personal" used in <a href="/doc/223928/" id="a_45">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act. The expression
'individual' must be construed in an expansive sense and would include a
body of individuals. The said exemption would be available even to
unincorporated entities as also private, closely held undertaking which are
in substance alter egos of their shareholders. However, the expression
individual cannot be used as a synonym for the expression 'person'. <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_46">Under
the General Clauses Act</a>, 1897 a person is defined to "include any company
or association or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not". Thus,
whereas a person would include an individual as well as incorporated
entities and artificial persons, the expression 'individual' cannot be
interpreted to include such entities. The context in which, the expression
"personal information" is used would also exclude it application to large
widely held corporations. While, confidential information of a corporation
is exempt from disclosure under <a href="/doc/1838023/" id="a_47">Section 8(1)(d)</a> of the Act, there is no
scope to exclude other information relating to such corporations under
<a href="/doc/223928/" id="a_48">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act as the concept of a personal information cannot in
ordinary language be understood to mean information pertaining to a public
corporation.

of this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/181332670/" id="a_49">Ashok Kumar Goel v. Public Information

<blockquote id="blockquote_23">          "7. It is not in dispute that the information in the form of returns
         filed by the respondent No. 2's firm is in the nature of
         commercial confidence which is clearly inferable from <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_51">Section
         98</a> of the Act. Such information can be given only if larger
         public interest warrants the disclosure of this information. All
         the authorities below including the learned Single Judge has
         held and rightly so that no public interest is at all involved in
         seeking of this information by the appellant from the
         Sales Tax Commissioner. What to talk of public interest, the
         finding is that the information is sought with oblique motive to

information pertaining to Dr Naresh Trehan (petitioner in W.P.(C) 88/2010)
and the information contained in the income tax returns would be personal
information under <a href="/doc/223928/" id="a_53">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act. However, the CIC directed
disclosure of information of Dr Trehan also by concluding that income tax
returns and information provided for assessment was in relation to a "public
activity." In my view, this is wholly erroneous and unmerited. The act of
filing returns with the department cannot be construed as public activity.
The expression "public activity" would mean activities of a public nature
and not necessarily act done in compliance of a statute. The expression
"public activity" would denote activity done for the public and/or in some
manner available for participation by public or some section of public.
There is no public activity involved in filing a return or an individual
pursuing his assessment with the income tax authorities. In this view, the
information relating to individual assesse could not be disclosed. Unless,
the CIC held that the same was justified "in the larger public interest"

<p id="p_44"> 26.      At this stage, it may be appropriate to consider the nature of
information that is provided by an assesse to its Assessing Officer. In case
of Income from business and profession, the income tax returns mainly
disclose the final accounts (i.e. profit and loss account and balance sheets)
This information is otherwise also liable to be disclosed by companies and
is available in public domain since it is necessary for a company to file its
annual accounts with the Registrar of Companies. Other incorporated
entities are similarly required to also publically disclose their final
accounts. However, an Assessing Officer may call for further information
while determining the assessable income, which may include all books and
papers maintained by an entity. Such information may also have
information relating to other parties, the disclosure of which may be exempt
under <a href="/doc/1001313/" id="a_54">Section 8(1)</a> of the Act. As a matter of illustration, the books of
accounts would record transactions of commercial nature which may enjoin
the parties to the transactions to keep the information confidential. Further,
the books of accounts would also record salaries and other payments to
other individuals. Disclosure of such information would affect not just the
assessee but also other parties. In the circumstances, it would be necessary
to examine the details of information that are sought from the public
authority. In the present case, the respondent seems to have sought for an
omnibus disclosure of all records and returns. In my view, the same could
not be allowed without examining the nature of information contained
therein.

<p id="p_48"> 30.       In the case of Hanuman Pershad (supra), this Court considered the
question whether there was any bar on the Income Tax Department from
disclosing records produced during the assessment proceedings. The said
controversy was answered by the following words:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_31">         "It is undoubtedly open to the authorities to disclose
         information received by them from assessments or other
         proceedings under the Act. However, there are restrictions
         contained in <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_77">Section 138</a> as now existing concerning the
         manner in which that information is to be disclosed. Leaving
         aside sub-clause (a) of sub-section (1) it seems that under sub-
         clause (b), the Commissioner can disclose information if he is
         satisfied that it is within the public interest to do so. Hence, if
         some other authority applies to the Commissioner to obtain
         information, the same may be disclosed in the discretion of the
         Commissioner. Under Sub-clause (a) there is also a power to
         furnish information to other authorities. As this matter has not
         been fully argued or discussed in the present case, it is
         sufficient to note that there is no power to disclose information
         to other authorities and officers outside the provisions of the
         Section. As far as the information already given is concerned,
         we have no power to give any direction concerning the same."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_49">31.      Although by virtue of <a href="/doc/1971086/" id="a_78">Section 22</a> of the Act, the provisions of the Act
have an overriding effect over any other inconsistent law, the said
provisions of the Act insofar as they are not inconsistent with other statutes
must be read harmoniously. Undoubtedly, the income tax returns and
information provided to Income Tax Authorities by assessees is
confidential and not required to be placed in public domain. Given the
nature of the income tax returns and the information necessary to support
the same, it would be exempt under <a href="/doc/223928/" id="a_79">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act in respect of
individual and unincorporated assessees. The information as disclosed in




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 &amp; other connected matters                       Page 22 of 29</span>
 the income tax returns would qualify as personal information with regard to
several private companies which are, essentially, alter egos of their
promoters. However, in cases of widely held companies most information
relating to their income and expenditure would be in public domain and the
confidential information would be exempt from disclosure under <a href="/doc/1838023/" id="a_80">Section
8(1)(d)</a> of the Act. Further, even in cases of corporate entities, the income
tax returns and other disclosure made to authorities would also include
transactions with other parties and those parties can also claim the
exception under <a href="/doc/1001313/" id="a_81">Section 8(1)</a> of the Act. One has to also bear in mind that
an authority may not have any obligation to provide any information other
than in the form in which it is available and the information provided by an
assessee may not have been edited to remove references to other persons.
Keeping all the aforesaid considerations in view, the parliament has enacted
<a href="/doc/1448409/" id="a_82">Section 138</a> of the Income Tax Act, 1961 to provide for disclosure only
where it is necessary in public interest. Similar provisions are enacted
under the Act and clauses (d), (e) and (j) of <a href="/doc/1001313/" id="a_83">Section 8(1)</a> of the Act that
specify that information exempt from disclosure under those clauses, could
be disclosed in larger public interest. <a href="/doc/1484095/" id="a_84">Section 8(2)</a> of the Act also provides
for a non obstante clause which permits disclosure of information in larger
public interest.
</p>
<p id="p_50">32.      It would also be necessary to refer to <a href="/doc/641228/" id="a_85">Section 11</a> of the Act, which
provides for a notice to a third party before any third party information is
disclosed.        The proviso to <a href="/doc/641228/" id="a_86">Section 11</a> of the Act also specifies that
disclosure of trade or commercial secrets, which are protected by law




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 &amp; other connected matters                   Page 23 of 29</span>
 would not be allowed unless their disclosure is necessary in public interest.
<a href="/doc/839514/" id="a_87">Section 11(1)</a> of the Act reads as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_32">         "11. Third party information.--(1) Where a Central Public
         Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer, as
         the case may be, intends to disclose any information or record,
         or part thereof on a request made under this Act, which relates
         to or has been supplied by a third party and has been treated as
         confidential by that third party, the Central Public Information
         Officer or State Public Information Officer, as the case may be,
         shall, within five days from the receipt of the request, give a
         written notice to such third party of the request and of the fact
         that the Central Public Information Officer or State Public
         Information Officer, as the case may be, intends to disclose the
         information or record, or part thereof, and invite the third party
         to make a submission in writing or orally, regarding whether
         the information should be disclosed, and such submission of the
         third party shall be kept in view while taking a decision about
         disclosure of information:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_33">         Provided that except in the case of trade or commercial secrets
         protected by law, disclosure may be allowed if the public
         interest in disclosure outweighs in importance any possible
         harm or injury to the interests of such third party."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_51">33.      In the above context where the nature of income tax returns and other
information provided for assessment of income is confidential and its
disclosure is protected under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_88">Income Tax Act</a>, 1961 it is not necessary
to read any inconsistency between the Act and <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_89">Income Tax Act</a>, 1961. And,
information furnished by an assesse can be disclosed only where it is
necessary to do in public interest and where such interest outweighs in
importance, any possible harm or injury to the assesse or any other third
party. However, information furnished by corporate assessees that neither




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 &amp; other connected matters                      Page 24 of 29</span>
 relates to another party nor is exempt under <a href="/doc/1815081/" id="a_90">Section 8(1)(d)</a> of the Act, can
be disclosed.
</p>
<p id="p_52">34.      In view of the aforesaid, the principal question that is to be addressed
is whether the CIC has misdirected itself in concluding that disclosure of
income tax returns and other information relating to assessment of income
of the petitioners was in public interest.
</p>
<p id="p_53">35.      In order to address this controversy, it is important to understand the
purpose of the respondent in seeking such information. The proceedings
under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_91">Income Tax Act</a>, 1961 with respect to assessment of income are
at different stages. It is stated that in some cases, assessment is complete
and appeal proceedings are pending in other fora.            In one case, it is
contended that the Appellate Authorities have remanded the matter of
assessment to the Assessing Officer. It is apparent that the assessment
proceedings have thrown up contentious issues which are being agitated
between the income tax authorities and the assessees. The respondent,
essentially, wants to intervene in those proceedings by adding and
providing his contentions or interpretation as to the information provided
by the asseesees or otherwise available with the Income Tax Authorities.
</p>
<p id="p_54">36.      In my view, the CIC has misdirected itself in concluding that this
was in larger public interest. The CIC arrived at this conclusion by noting
that disclosure of information was in larger public interest in increasing
public revenue and reducing corruption. The assessment proceedings are
not public proceedings where all and sundry are allowed to participate and
add their opinion to the proceedings. Merely because a spirited citizen




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 &amp; other connected matters                      Page 25 of 29</span>
 wishes to assist in assessment proceedings, the same cannot be stated to be
in larger public interest. On the contrary, larger public interest would
require that assessment proceedings are completed expeditiously and by the
authorities who are statutorily empowered to do so.
</p>
<p id="p_55">37.      In the present case, there was no material to indicate that there was
any corruption on the part of the income tax authorities which led to a
justifiable apprehension that the said authorities were not performing their
function diligently. In any event, the CIC has not found that the
proceedings relating to assessment were not being conducted in accordance
with law and/or required the intervention of the respondent. Assessment
proceedings are quasi-judicial proceedings where assessee has to produce
material to substantiate their return of income.      Income tax has to be
assessed by the income tax authorities strictly in accordance with the
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_92">Income Tax Act</a>, 1961 and based on the information sought by them. In the
present case, the respondent wants to process the information to assist and
support the role of an Assessing Officer.         This has a propensity of
interfering in the assessment proceedings and thus, cannot be considered to
be in larger public interest. The CIC had proceeded on the basis that the
income tax authorities should disclose information to informers of income
tax departments to enable them to bring instances of tax evasion to the
notice of income tax authorities. In my view, this reasoning is flawed as it
would tend to subvert the assessment process rather than aid it. If this idea
is carried to its logical end, it would enable several busy bodies to interfere
in assessment proceedings and throw up their interpretation of law and facts
as to how an assessment ought to be carried out. The propensity of this to




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 &amp; other connected matters                    Page 26 of 29</span>
 multiply litigation cannot be underestimated. Further, the proposition that
unrelated parties could intervene in assessment proceedings is wholly alien
to the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_93">Income Tax Act</a>, 1961. The income tax returns and information are
provided in aid of the proceedings that are conducted under that Act and
there is no scope for enhancing or providing for an additional dimension to
the assessment proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_56">38.      The Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/55517912/" id="a_94">Bihar Public Service Commission v. Saiyed
Hussain Abbas Rizwi</a>: (2012) 13 SCC 61 held that the statutory exemption
provided under <a href="/doc/971685/" id="a_95">Section 8</a> of the Act is the rule and only in exceptional
circumstances of larger public interest the information would be disclosed.
It was also held that 'public purpose' needs to be interpreted in the strict
sense and public interest has to be construed keeping in mind the balance
between right to privacy and right to information. The relevant extract from
the said judgment is quoted below:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_34">         "21. ...... Another very significant provision of the Act is
         <a href="/doc/1815081/" id="a_96">Section 8(1)(j)</a>. In terms of this provision, information which
         relates to personal information, the disclosure of which has no
         relationship to any public activity or interest or which would
         cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual
         would fall within the exempted category, unless the authority
         concerned is satisfied that larger public interest justifies the
         disclosure of such information. It is, therefore, to be understood
         clearly that it is a statutory exemption which must operate as a
         rule and only in exceptional cases would disclosure be
         permitted, that too, for reasons to be recorded demonstrating
         satisfaction to the test of larger public interest. It will not be in
         consonance with the spirit of these provisions, if in a
         mechanical manner, directions are passed by the appropriate
         authority to disclose information which may be protected in
         terms of the above provisions. All information which has come



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 &amp; other connected matters                         Page 27 of 29</span>
          to the notice of or on record of a person holding fiduciary
         relationship with another and but for such capacity, such
         information would not have been provided to that authority,
         would normally need to be protected and would not be open to
         disclosure keeping the higher standards of integrity and
         confidentiality of such relationship. Such exemption would be
         available to such authority or department.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_35">         22. The expression "public interest" has to be understood in its
         true connotation so as to give complete meaning to the relevant
         provisions of the Act. The expression "public interest" must be
         viewed in its strict sense with all its exceptions so as to justify
         denial of a statutory exemption in terms of the Act. In its
         common parlance, the expression "public interest", like "public
         purpose", is not capable of any precise definition. It does not
         have a rigid meaning, is elastic and takes its colour from the
         statute in which it occurs, the concept varying with time and
         state of society and its needs (<a href="/doc/41868/" id="a_97">State of Bihar v. Kameshwar
         Singh</a> [AIR 1952 SC 252] ). It also means the general welfare
         of the public that warrants recognition and protection;
         something in which the public as a whole has a stake [Black's
         Law Dictionary (8th Edn.)].
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_36">         23. The satisfaction has to be arrived at by the authorities
         objectively and the consequences of such disclosure have to be
         weighed with regard to the circumstances of a given case. The
         decision has to be based on objective satisfaction recorded for
         ensuring that larger public interest outweighs unwarranted
         invasion of privacy or other factors stated in the provision.
         Certain matters, particularly in relation to appointment, are
         required to be dealt with great confidentiality. The information
         may come to knowledge of the authority as a result of
         disclosure by others who give that information in confidence
         and with complete faith, integrity and fidelity. Secrecy of such
         information shall be maintained, thus, bringing it within the
         ambit of fiduciary capacity. Similarly, there may be cases
         where the disclosure has no relationship to any public activity
         or interest or it may even cause unwarranted invasion of privacy
         of the individual. All these protections have to be given their



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">W.P.(C) Nos. 85/2010 &amp; other connected matters                       Page 28 of 29</span>
          due implementation as they spring from statutory exemptions. It
         is not a decision simpliciter between private interest and public
         interest. It is a matter where a constitutional protection is
         available to a person with regard to the right to privacy. Thus,
         the public interest has to be construed while keeping in mind
         the balance factor between right to privacy and right to
         information with the purpose sought to be achieved and the
         purpose that would be served in the larger public interest,
         particularly when both these rights emerge from the
         constitutional values under the Constitution of India."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_57">39.      Applying the aforesaid judgment to the facts of this case, it is
apparent that disclosure of information as directed has no discernable
element of larger public interest.

aside. The parties are left to bear their own costs.
