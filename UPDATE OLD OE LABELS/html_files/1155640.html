HEADNOTE:
A  common  question of law arose in  these  appeals  namely,
whether	 the Bihar Town Planning and Improvement Trust	Act,
1951 (Act 35 1951), replaced the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_5">Land Acquisition Act</a> (1  of
1894)  in  the matter of acquisition of land  for  the	said
Trust and whether the notifications issued by the Government
of Bihar under<a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_6"> ss. 4</a> and <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_7">6</a> of the Land Acquisition Act	were
valid,	after the <a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_8">Bihar Act</a> had come into force.   The	High
Court  held the notifications of the State Government  ultra
vires	and   illegal.	 On  the  principle   of   generalia
specialibus non derogant and also that if a statute  directs
a  thing to be done in a certain way that thing	 shall	not,
even if there be no negative words be done in any other way.
Held, (per Imam, Kapur and Mudholkar, JJ.), that s.71 of the
<a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_9">Bihar  Act</a>  which modified the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_10">Land Acquisition	 Act</a>  itself
contemplates  the machinery of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_11">Land Acquisition  Act</a>  as
modified  even	for the purpose of acquiring  land  for	 the
Trust.	It does not exclude the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_12">Land Acquisition Act</a>; on the
contrary   it  makes  it  applicable  but  subject  to	 its
modifications	and   exceptions.    The   first    relevant
modification  is  by  sub-cl.  (1)  of	clause	(2)  of	 the
schedule.  There the first notice under<a href="/doc/1363968/" id="a_13"> s. 46</a> of the  Bihar)
Act  is substituted for and has the same effect as  a  noti-
fication under<a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_14"> s. 4</a> (1) of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_15">Land Acquisition Act</a> but that
is subject to an important exception and that exception is a
notification under<a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_16"> s. 4</a> (1) of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_17">Land Acquisition Act</a> or a
declaration  under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_18"> s.	6</a>  of  that  Act  which	 "has	been
previously  made  and  is in force".  The  words  "has	been
previously  made"  did not merely connote the issuing  of  a
notification  before the <a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_19">Bihar Act</a> was passed,	but  include
all  notifications  made  prior or  anterior  to  the  first
publication of a notice of an improvement scheme under<a href="/doc/1363968/" id="a_20"> s. 46</a>
of the Bihar Act.
 813
Mercer	 Henderson's   Trustees	 v.   Dunferuline   District
Committee, 37 Sc.  L. R. 119, referred to.
Held,  further, that the power of the State  Government'  to
acquire	 land for the Trust was not taken away by the  <a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_21">Bihar
Act</a> was further shown by<a href="/doc/1362441/" id="a_22"> s. 33</a> of that Act which deals	with
the preparation of a Master Plan by the Trust, which has  to
designate the land subject to compulsory acquisition by	 the
various	 authorities mentioned therein including  the  State
Government.
Held, also, that s 50 (1) of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_23">Land Acquisition Act</a>  would
be  equally available for being put into force for the	pur-
pose  of  a  Trust, which shows that the  intention  of	 the
legislature  was  not to exclude the functions of  the	<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_24">Land
Acquisition  Act</a> such as<a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_25"> ss. 4</a>, <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_26">6</a>, <a href="/doc/703570/" id="a_27">50</a> etc. in the matter  of
acquisition of land for the purpose of a trust.
Per,  Subba Rao, J. Under the Act, the Trust was  authorised
to implement the improvement schemes in a particular way and
for the purposes of implementing, that to acquire land in  a
prescribed  manner.  If that be so, the Trust was  bound  to
implement the scheme in the manner prescribed and could	 not
resort	to  any other method.  The broad scheme of  the	 Act
also  supports	the  conclusion that the  Trust	 could	only
implement  the scheme involving acquisition of land  in	 the
manner	provided  by the Act, that is to say  in  accordance
with the land acquisition provisions incorporated in the Act
by reference and therefore the two principles noticed by the
High Court were apposite.

Land  Acquisition Act in para. 2 (1) of the schedule of	 the

s. 46 of the Act.

</p><p id="p_6">KAPUR  J.-In  these appeals by special	 leave	against	 the
judgment  and  order  of the High Court of  Patna  a  common
question  of  law  arose as to	the  interpretation  of	 the
provisions  relating  to acquisition under  the	 Bihar	Town
Planning  &amp;  Improvement  Trust Act 1951, Act  35  of  1951,
hereinafter   called  the  "<a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_31">Bihar  Act</a>"	 and   whether	 the
notifications  issued by the State Government under<a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_32"> s. 4</a>  of
the  Land Acquisition Act were valid.  The appellant in	 all
the  appeals is the Patna Improvement Trust but in  all	 the
four appeals the respondents are different persons.
On  January  19,  1961, the Government	of  Bihar  issued  a
notification  under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_33"> s. 4</a> of the.  <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_34">Land Acquisition  Act</a>  of
1894  proposing to acquire an area of 407.85 acres  of	land
</p><p id="p_7">-in  the  city	of  Patna  at  the  expense  of	 the   Patna
Improvement Trust for a public purpose viz., for development
of   residential  neighbourhood,  to  provide  for   housing
facilities  for various income groups and to facilitate	 the
planned	 growth	 of the city of Patna.	By  another  similar
notification of the same date the State of Bihar proposed to
acquire	  54.08	 acres of land.	 The respondents  challenged
the  legality  of  the	notices	 under	s.  4  of  the	<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_35">Land
Acquisition    Act</a> by their respective applications or writs
under	  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_36">Art. 226</a> of the Constitution.	 These notifications
were quashed by a writ in the nature
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">815</span>
of  certiorari by the High Court of Patna and  against	that
judgment and order the Patna Improvement, Trust has  brought
these appeals by special leave.
</p><p id="p_8">In  order to determine the legality of the notifications  in
dispute it is necessary to examine the various provisions of
the  <a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_37">Bihar  Act</a>.  Chapter II of that Act  provides  for	 the
constitution   of  Improvement	Trust  and   other   matters
connected   therewith  and <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_38"> s.	3</a>  therein  vests   in	 the
Improvement Trust the duty of carrying out the provisions of
the  <a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_39">Bihar  Act</a> in any local area.  Chapter III	 deals	with
improvement  schemes.  <a href="/doc/1337201/" id="a_40">Section 46</a> in that  chapter  provides
for the preparation, publication and transmission of notices
as  to	improvement  schemes.  Under that  section  when  an
improvement scheme has been framed the trust is required  to
prepare	 a  notice stating the framing of  the	scheme,	 the
boundaries of the areas comprised in the scheme and  certain
other particulars in regard to land which it is proposed  to
acquire	 and that notice has to be published in	 the  manner
therein provided.  Under<a href="/doc/460525/" id="a_41"> s. 48</a>, within 30 days following the
publication of the notice under<a href="/doc/179933/" id="a_42"> s. 46</a> the Trust has to serve
a  notice  on various persons  mentioned  therein  including
persons	 whose Ian is proposed to be acquired.	Such  notice
shall  require any person to whom- a notice is issued if  he
objects to the acquisition to state his reasons within sixty
days.	By <a href="/doc/245977/" id="a_43"> s.	71</a>  of the Bihar  Act  for  the	 purpose  of
acquiring land for the Trust under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_44">Land Acquisition	 Act</a>

Act in the case of lands proposed to be acquired under	that
section and in any other case publication of a notice  under
s.  52	to be such a substitute.  By other  clauses  in	 the
Schedule certain additional sections are deemed to have been
added to the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_65">Land Acquisition Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_13">The argument on behalf of the respondents in the High  Court
was,  as it is in this Court, that if land is sought  to  be
acquired for the purpose of the Patna Improvement Trust then
it can be acquired in accordance with the provisions of	 the
<a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_66">Bihar  Act</a>  and	 not  under  the  provisions  of  the	<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_67">Land
Acquisition  Act</a> because the former Act completely  replaces
the  <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_68">Land  Acquisition Act</a> in regard to the  acquisition  of
land for the purpose of the Improvement Trust.	It was	also
argued	before us that the purpose of the <a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_69">Bihar Act</a>  was  to
provide	 a  complete code for acquisition of  land  for	 the
purpose	 of  the Trust and that the <a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_70">Bihar Act</a> and  the	<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_71">Land
Acquisition Act</a> were inconsistent Acts and could not operate
in  the same field.  The High Court decided the petition  on
the  principle,	 generalia  specialibus	 non  derogant	 and
because both the <a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_72">Bihar Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_73">Land Acquisition Act</a> were
concerned  with	 acquisition  of land, the  former  being  a
special	 Act  relating to acquisitions for  the	 purpose  of
Improvement  Trusts,  it  applied to the  exclusion  of	 the
latter	Act  which was an-Act dealing  with  acquisition  of
lands  in  general.  Therefore the State Government  had  no
authority  to  take steps for acquisition of' land  for	 the
purpose	  of  the  Improvement	Trust  under   the   general
provisions of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_74">Land Acquisition Act</a>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">			    818</span>
after the <a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_75">Bihar Act</a> had come into force and the	 Improvement
Trust	had   been   constituted,   and	  consequently	 the
notifications  of the State Government were ultra uires	 and
illegal.  It also held that the Improvement Trust was  bound
to follow the procedure expressly laid down in the <a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_76">Bihar Act</a>
for  the  object of carrying out its duties and it  was	 not
open.  to it to adopt any other machinery for  the  carrying
out  of those duties, the principle being that if a  statute
directs	 a  statutory authority to exercise its power  in  a
particular  manner it must be exercised only in that  manner
and none other.	 The High Court also held that as under	 the
<a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_77">Bihar Act</a> the Improvement Trust is entitled to carry out its
duties for which it has been constituted it cannot carry out
development  or expansion without preparing a  matter  -plan
under <a href="/doc/1362441/" id="a_78"> s. 33</a> of the Act or without following  the  procedure
under <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_79"> s.  42A</a>	of the Act, this last  section	having	been
introduced into the <a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_80">Bihar Act</a> by an Amending, Act of 1956.
It is not necessary to go into the argument of inconsistency
between	 the <a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_81">Bihar Act</a> and the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_82">Land Acquisition Act</a>  or	 the
special	 Act excluding the general because it appears to  us
that  the  various provisions of the  <a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_83">Bihar  Act</a>  themselves
afford	the  key to the solution of the	 problem  before  us
which  is one of construction.	<a href="/doc/245977/" id="a_84">Section 71</a> of the Bihar	 Act
which modifies the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_85">Land Acquisition Act</a>, itself states	that
for  the purpose of acquisition of land for the Trust  under
the  <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_86">Land  Acquisition Act</a> that <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_87">Act (Land  Acquisition	Act</a>)
shall  be  subject  to the modifications  specified  in	 the
Schedule.  Therefore even for the purpose of acquiring	land
for  the Trust the machinery of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_88">Land Acquisition Act</a>  as
modified  is  contemplated.  It does not  exclude  the	<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_89">Land
Acquisition Act</a>, on the contrary it makes it applicable	 but
subject to its modifications and exceptions.  Now the  first
relevant  modification is by sub-cl. (1) of clause 2 of	 the
Schedule, There a first notice under<a href="/doc/1363968/" id="a_90"> s. 46</a> of the Bihar
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> 819</span>
Act  is	 substituted  for  and has  the	 same  effect  as  a
notification under<a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_91"> s. 4</a> (1) of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_92">Land Acquisition Act</a>	 but
that is subject to an important exception and that  exeption
is a notification under<a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_93"> s. 4(1)</a> of the Land Acquisition	 Act
or  a  declaration under<a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_94"> s. 6</a> of that Act which	 "'has	been
previously  made and is in force".  Thus when the  exception
applies	 the first notice under<a href="/doc/1363968/" id="a_95"> s. 46</a> of the Bihar  Act	 has
not  that effect.  The words "has been previously  made"  do
not merely connote the issuing of a notification before	 the
<a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_96">Bihar  Act</a>  was passed but include  all	 notifications	made
prior or anterior to the first publication of a notice of an
improvement scheme under<a href="/doc/1337201/" id="a_97"> s. 46</a>.	 In other words if, before a
notice	under<a href="/doc/1337201/" id="a_98"> s. 46</a> has been published a notification  under
s. 4(l) or a declaration under<a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_99"> s. 6</a> of the Land	 Acquisition
Act is made 'and is in force then the first publication of a
notice under<a href="/doc/1337201/" id="a_100"> s. 46</a> would not be substituted for or have	 the
same   effect  as  a  notification  under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_101"> s.  4(l)</a>.	This
construction  is in accord with the construction  placed  by
the  Scottish  courts  in  Mercer  Henderson's	Trustees  v.
Dunferuline  District  Committee (1) on	 similar  words	 viz
"'previously  in use".	Lord justice-Clerk  construed  those
words  as not being equivalent to prior to the passing of  a
statute.  That the power of the State Government to  acquire
land  for  the Trust is not taken away by the <a href="/doc/1054471/" id="a_102">Bihar  Act</a>  is
further	 shown	by<a href="/doc/1362441/" id="a_103"> s. 33</a> of that Act which  deals  with	 the
preparation  of	 a master plan by the Trust.   Its  relevant
part is as follows :-
</p><p id="p_14">S. 33(3)  "'Subject  to	 rules	as  may	 be  prescribed	 for
regulating  the form and contents of master plan,  a  master
plan shall include such maps and such descriptive matters as
may be necessary to illustrate any proposal of schemes	with
such  degree of details as may be appropriate  to  different
parts of the area, and any such master plan may in

the  State  Government, the Trust,  the	 planning  authority
appointed under <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_104">section 138</a> or any public utility agency any
land  allocated by the plan for the purpose of any of  their
	      functions"
</p><p id="p_17">Thus the master plan has to designate the land which will be
subject to compulsory acquisition by the various authorities
therein mentioned including the State Government.
    Again by clause I of the Schedule of the Bihar Act	sub-
s.  (ee)  is  deemed  to be inserted in<a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_105"> s.  3</a>  of  the	Land

"local authority" will include the Board of Trustees for the
improvement  of a town constituted under<a href="/doc/79199/" id="a_106"> s. 8</a> of  the  Bihar
Act  which  means  the Trust.  '<a href="/doc/703570/" id="a_107">Section 50(l)</a>  of  the	Land

equally	 available for being put into force for the  purpose

</p><p id="p_20">       The  question that falls to be considered is  whether

the  planned  growth of the City of Patna, after  the  Bihar
Town  Planning	and Improvement Trust Act, 1951 (Act  35  of
1951),	hereinafter  called the Act, came  into	 force.	  To
state  it  differently,	 the question  is  whether  the	 Act
replaces the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_117">Land Acquisition Act</a> (I of 1894) in the  matter
of acquisition of land for the said Trust.
</p><p id="p_21">       The  material provisions of the Act relevant to	this
part of the enquiry may now be read.  The long title of	 the
Act  is	 "'to provide for the improvement,  development	 and
expansion of towns in the State of Bihar".  The preamble  to
the Act reads
	"Whereas  it is expedient to make provision for	 the
improvement, development and expansion of towns in the State
of  Bihar  so  as  to secure to	 their	present	 and  future
inhabitants   sanitary	conditions,  amenity  and   conveni-

sections of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_125">Land Acquisition Act</a>, 1894 (I of 1894).	  It
is, therefore, manifest that the Act was passed with a	view
to  provide for the improvement., development and  expansion
of  towns in the State of Bihar, that a statutory  corporate
body, called the Improvement Trust, was created	 thereunder,
that certain powers were entrusted to it for the purpose  of
implementing  the object of the Act,and that the  provisions
of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_126">Land Acquisition	 Act</a>,  1894,  as  modified,   were
incorporatedthrein  by reference to enable the	Trust  to
acquire Lands necessary	 for  implementing its	schemes	 of
improvement.<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_127">That Act</a> is a special and also a  self-contained
one.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_10"> 823</span>
<p id="p_27">It the Trust intends to acquire any land for its purpose, it
can  only do so in 'the manner provided by the Act.  Can  it
ignore	the  provisions of the Act and	approach  the  State
Government  to	acquire lands for the purposes	of  the	 Act
under  the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_128">Land Acquisition Act</a>, 1894 ? That is	 the  simple
question that arises in this case.
</p><p id="p_28">The law on the subject is very well settled and, in my view,
the  learned  judges  of  the  High  Court  have   correctly
appreciated it and applied it to the facts of the case.	 Two
principles  noticed  by the High Court	are  apposite.	 The
first principle is generalia specialibus non derogant.	This
principle  is  exemplified  by the  decision  of  the  Privy
Council	 in  <a href="/doc/1334697/" id="a_129">Secretary of State	 v.  Hindustan	Co-operative
Insurance Society Ltd</a>. (1).  The second principle is that if
a  statute  directs a thing be done in	a certain  wax	that
thing  shall  not, even if there be no negative	 words,,  be
done in-any other way.	This principle is illustrated by the
decision in Ex parte Stephens (2).  A combined effect of the
said two principles may be stated thus : a general Act	must
yield  to  a special Act dealing with  a  specific  subject-
matter	and that if an Act directs a thing to be done  in  a
particular  way, it shall be deemed to have  prohibited	 the
doing  of that thing in any other way.	<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_130">Under the  Act</a>,	 the
Trust is authorized to implement the improvement schemes  in
a  particular way and for the purposes of implementing	them
to acquire land in a prescribed manner.	 If that be so,	 the
Trust  is  bound  to  implement the  scheme  in	 the  manner
prescribed and cannot resort to any other method, that is to
say it can acquire land for trust purposes only by resorting
to  the provisions of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_131">Land Acquisition Act</a>	as  modified
and incorporated by reference in the Act.
</p><p id="p_29">       A perusal of the relevant provisions of the Act	also
indicates an integrated design for drawing

<p id="p_31">schemes of improvement and implementing them by	 acquisition
or  otherwise.	 <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_132">Under	the Act</a> many  statutory	 powers	 and
duties are given to the Trust for evolving different schemes
and  implementing  them.  <a href="/doc/1362441/" id="a_133">Section 33</a> empowers the  Trust  to
prepare a master plan.	<a href="/doc/779745/" id="a_134">Sections 34</a>, <a href="/doc/448607/" id="a_135">35</a>, <a href="/doc/1842313/" id="a_136">36</a>, <a href="/doc/775887/" id="a_137">39</a>, <a href="/doc/1694707/" id="a_138">40</a>, <a href="/doc/1759624/" id="a_139">41</a>	 and
<a href="/doc/1409056/" id="a_140">42</a>  authorize the Trust to make various schemes	 within	 the
framework of the master plan.  <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_141">Section 42A</a> enables the Trust
to  make a scheme for improvement in respect of an area	 not
included in the master plan.  <a href="/doc/261576/" id="a_142">Sections 43</a> to <a href="/doc/507127/" id="a_143">47</a> provide	 for
issue of requisite notices to persons affected by the scheme
and for consideration of representations and objections that
may be made to the Trust.  <a href="/doc/460525/" id="a_144">Section 48</a> provides for notice of
the proposed acquisition of land.  <a href="/doc/703570/" id="a_145">Section 50</a> enjoins on the
Trust to consider objections or representations received and
to  hear  the  parties	if  they  so  desire.	On   hearing
objections   and  representations,  the	 Trust	may   either
abandone the scheme or apply to the State Government for the
sanction of the scheme with modifications, if any, which the
Trust	may  consider  to  be  necessary;  thereafter,	 the
Government  either gives its sanction or refuses to  do	 so.
It is, therefore, clear that under the Act before a land  is
acquired  by  the Trust for its purposes, it has got  to  go
through	 a  quasi-judicial  procedure  for  finalizing	 the
scheme.	  The  parties affected have  every  opportunity  to
object	to the scheme proposed generally or in so far as  it
affected  their land and even thereafter to file  objections
to   the  acquisition  of  their  land.	  This	 complicated
procedure  conceived  to  reconcile  individual	 rights	 and
social	purposes  cannot  be short circuited  by  the  Trust
ignoring  the  Act  altogether	and  approaching  the  State
Government for acquiring land for its purposes which it	 can
only implement in the manner provided by the Act.  The broad
scheme	of the Act also, therefore, supports the  conclusion
that  the  Trust  can only implement  the  scheme  involving
acquisition of land in the manner provided by the Act.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_12"> 825</span>
<p id="p_32">But  strong  reliance  is placed on the	 provisions  of	 the

of  the	 Schedule,  the	 argument  proceeds,  discloses	  an
intention   of	 the  Legislature  to  preserve	  the	<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_159">Land
Acquisition  Act</a>  of  1894 without any	modification  as  an
alternative  for the Trust acquiring land to  implement	 its
scheme.	  This argument, if accepted, is destructive of	 the
entire	scheme of the Act.  If the land <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_160">Acquisition  Act</a>  of
1894,  without	modification  was preserved,  what  was	 the
necessity  for modifying the said Act and incorporating	 the
modified   provisions  by  reference  in  the  Act   ?	 The
Legislature  could  as	well  have  made  a  provision	that
whenever  the Trust wanted to acquire land to implement	 its
scheme	it should apply to the Government for  taking  steps
under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_161">Land Acquisition Act</a>, 1894.  An incongruity  shall
not   be  attributed  to  the  Legislature  unless   it	  is
unavoidable.   In this case the exception in para. 2 (1)  of
the  Schedule  can easily be given a meaning  without  doing
violence  to  the  intention of	 the  Legislature.   Learned
counsel	 for  the appellant suggests that  the	notification
under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_162"> s.  4</a> or<a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_163"> s. 6</a> of the Act refers to that made  by	 the
Government under the said sections before the Act came	into
force.	 But the words "previously made"  are  comprehensive
enough to take in the notification under<a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_164"> s. 4</a> or<a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_165"> s. 6</a> of the
Act  made  after the passing of the Act, but  prior  to	 the
issue  of the first publication of notice of  implementation
of  the scheme under<a href="/doc/1337201/" id="a_166"> s. 46</a> of the Act.	The  exception	will
cover  such  notifications issued before or after  the	Act.
<a href="/doc/1362441/" id="a_167">Section 33</a> (3) of the Act contemplates such a  notification.
Under  that section a master plan prepared by the Trust	 may
designate  a  particular  land	as  subject  to	  compulsory
acquisition by the State Government.  If' a particular	land
was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14"> 827</span>
designated as land subject to compulsory acquisition by	 the
State  Government,  the State  Government  can	compulsorily
acquire	 that  land.   The Government might  have  issued  a
notification  under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_168"> s. 4</a> or<a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_169"> s. 6</a> of tile  Land	 Acquisition
'Act  in respect of such land; in such a case the  exception
is attracted and the notice under<a href="/doc/1337201/" id="a_170"> S. 46</a> of the Act cannot be
substituted   for  it.	 It  is	 not  suggested	  that	 the
notification  in  question was issued by the  Government  in
respect of a land designated under the master plan, as	land
subject	 to compulsory acquisition by the State	 Government.
On this interpretation the exception does not become  otiose
and it fits in squarely with the scheme of the Act.  So, the
exception  in cl. (3) dealing with deferred  street  schemes
under <a href="/doc/775887/" id="a_171"> s.  39</a> of the Act can be made to refer only  to	such
notification issued by the Government under<a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_172"> s. 4</a> or 6 of the
<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_173">Land  Acquisition Act</a>.	I would, therefere, hold that  when-
ever the Trust seeks to acquire land for the purpose of	 the
implementation	of the scheme for which it was	constituted,
it  can	 only acquire land in the manner prescribed  by	 the
Act, that is to say, in accordance with the land acquisition
provisions incorporated in the Act by reference.  As in	 the
present	 case  the notifications issued	 by  the  Government
under s. 4 of the LandAcquisition  Act,	 1894,	for   the
acquisition of the land in question for trust  purposes
'do not fall under  the	 exemption, the	 said  notifications
were void.  The High Court  was	 right in  quashing  the
said notificatonsunder	<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_174">Art. 226</a> of the	 Constitution.The
appeals fail and are dismissed with costs.
By COURT : In accordance with the majority view the  appeals
are  allowed and the case remitted to the High	Court.	 The
costs will abide the event.  One hearing fee in this court.
