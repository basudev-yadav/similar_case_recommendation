KAPADIA, J.
</p>

<p id="p_2">	Leave granted.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.	In these civil appeals we are concerned with the articles 
in Double Tax Avoidance Agreement ("DTAA") between India 
and United States which have implication on transfer pricing 
legislation.  The said Treaty either advocates application of 
arm's length principle or provides a mechanism for avoiding 
double taxation on income.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.	Morgan Stanley Group (MS Group) is one of the world's 
largest diversifying financial services companies.  It is a world 
wide leader in investment banking and it is ranked amongst 
the top institutions in merger and acquisitions, underwriting 
of equity and equity and related transactions.  It has a major 
presence in major securities market, with traders in numerous 
countries around the world offering a unique distribution of 
products.   It has three main lines of business, namely 
securities investment management and investment banking  
and credit services.   Morgan Stanley and Company (for short, 
'MSCo') is an investment bank engaged in the business of 
providing financial advisory services, corporate lending and 
securities underwriting.  One of the group companies of 
Morgan Stanley, Morgan Stanley Advantages Services Pvt. Ltd. 
(for short, 'MSAS') entered into an agreement for providing 
certain support services to MSCo.  MSCo outsourced some of 
its activities to MSAS.  The said MSAS was set up to support 
the main office functions in equity and fixed income research, 
account reconciliation and providing IT enabled services such 
as back office operation, data processing and support centre to 
MSCo.    
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.	On 19.5.2005 MSCo (Applicant) filed its advance ruling 
application in Form 34-C inviting its advance ruling on the 
points enumerated hereinbelow. The basic question relating to 
the transaction between the applicant and MSAS on which 
advance ruling was sought was two fold namely, whether the 
applicant was having a PE in India under <a href="/doc/1001719/" id="a_1">Article 5(1)</a> of the 
DTAA on account of the services rendered by MSAS under the 
Services Agreement dated April 14, 2005 entered into by MSAS 
with the applicant and if so, the amount of income attributable 
to such PE.
</p><p id="p_6">5.	By the impugned ruling delivered on 13.2.2006 by the 
Authority for Advance Ruling (for short, 'AAR') it was held, 
inter alia, that the applicant cannot be regarded as having a 
fixed place of business PE under <a href="/doc/1001719/" id="a_2">Article 5(1)</a> of the DTAA; that 
MSAS cannot be regarded as an agency PE under <a href="/doc/1744360/" id="a_3">Article 5(4)</a> 
of the DTAA; that the applicant would be regarded as having a 
PE in India under <a href="/doc/1188180/" id="a_4">Article 5(2)(l)</a> if it were to send some of its 
employees to India as stewards or as deputationists in the 
employment of MSAS.  Against this ruling of the AAR the 
applicant and the Department have come to this Court in  
appeal by way of special leave petition. According to the 
Department the applicant should be regarded as having a 
fixed place in India under <a href="/doc/1001719/" id="a_5">Article 5(1)</a> as the applicant 
proposes to carry on its business through MSAS in India.  
According to the Department MSAS was the PE of the MSCo in 
India.  They had a fixed place of business in Mumbai.  
According to the Department the nature of the activities 
proposed to be performed by MSAS in Mumbai indicated that 
the said company represented the business presence of the 
MSCo in India.  The Department also submitted that MSAS 
was legally and financially dependent upon the  applicant and 
consequently MSAS  constituted an agency PE of the applicant 
under <a href="/doc/1744360/" id="a_6">Article 5(4)</a> of the DTAA.  Both these contentions were 
rejected by the AAR vide the above impugned ruling.  However, 
it has been ruled by the AAR that MSAS should be regarded as 
constituting a service PE under <a href="/doc/1188180/" id="a_7">Article 5(2)(l)</a> as it proposed to 
send its employees to India for undertaking stewardship 
activities and for  undertaking to send some of its employees 
to India as deputationists in the employment of MSAS.  It is 
against this ruling of the AAR that the applicant has come to 
this Court by way of appeal.  On the second question the AAR 
ruled that the Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM) was 
the most appropriate method for the determination of the 
Arm's Length Price (ALP) in respect of the service agreement 
dated 14.4.2005 between the applicant and the MSAS and as 
the said method meets the test of arm's length as prescribed 
under Section 92-C of the 1961 Act, no further income was 
attributable in the hands of MSAS in India.  The said ruling of 
the AAR on the question of income attributable to the PE is the 
subject matter of challenge by the Department. 
EXISTENCE OF P.E. IN INDIA

</p><p id="p_7">6.	With globalization, many economic activities spread over 
to several tax jurisdiction.  This is where the concept of P.E. 
becomes important under <a href="/doc/1001719/" id="a_8">Article 5(1).</a>  There exists a P.E. if 
there is a fixed place through which the business of an 
enterprise, which is multinational enterprise (MNE), is wholly 
or partly carried on.  In the present case MSCo is a multi-
national entity.  As stated above it has outsourced some of its 
activities to MSAS in India. A general definition of the P.E. in 
the first part of <a href="/doc/1001719/" id="a_9">Article 5(1)</a> postulates the existence of a fixed 
place of business whereas the second part of <a href="/doc/1001719/" id="a_10">Article 5(1)</a>  
postulates that the business of the MNE is carried out in India 
through such fixed place. One of the questions which we are 
called upon to decide is whether the activities to be 
undertaken by MSAS consists of back office operations of the 
MSCo and if so whether such operations would fall within the 
ambit of the expression "the place through which the business 
of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried out" in <a href="/doc/1001719/" id="a_11">Article 5(1).</a> 
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.	We quote herein below Articles 5 and 7 of the DTAA :

<p id="p_9">"<a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_12">Article 5</a>

that State for a related enterprise 
(within the meaning of paragraph 1 
of <a href="/doc/260256/" id="a_15">Article 9 (Associated Enterprise).</a>
</p>

<p id="p_26">3.	Notwithstanding the preceding provisions 
of this Article, the term "permanent 
establishment" shall be deemed not to 
include any one or more of the following :
</p>
<p id="p_27">(a)	the use of facilities solely for the

advertising, for the supply of

<p id="p_32">4.	Notwithstanding the provisions of 
paragraphs 1 and 2, where a person 
other than an agent of an independent 
status to whom paragraph 5 applies is 
acting in a Contracting State on behalf of

State other Contracting State, that

<a href="/doc/735354/" id="a_16">Article 7</a>

BUSINESS PROFITS

</p><p id="p_41">1.	The profits of an enterprise of a 
Contracting State shall be taxable only in 
that State unless the enterprise carries 
on business in the other Contracting 
State through a permanent establishment 
situated therein. If the enterprise carries 
on business as aforesaid, the profits of 
the enterprise may be taxed in the other 
State but only so much of them as is 
attributable to (a) that permanent 
establishment; (b) sales in the other State 
of goods or merchandise of the same or 
similar kind as those sold through that 
permanent establishment; or (c) other 
business activities carried on in the other 
State of the same or similar kind as those 
effected through that permanent 
establishment.
</p>
<p id="p_42">2.	Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, 
where an enterprise of a Contracting 
State carries on business in the other 
Contracting State through a permanent 
establishment situated therein, there 
shall in each Contracting State be 
attributed to that permanent 
establishment the profits which it might 
be expected to make if it were a distinct 
and independent enterprise engaged in 
the same or similar activities under the 
same or similar conditions and dealing 
wholly at arm's length with the enterprise 
of which it is a permanent establishment 
and other enterprises controlling, 
controlled by or subject to the same 
common control as the enterprise, in any 
case where the correct amount of profits 
attributable to a permanent  
establishment is incapable of 
determination or the determination 
thereof presents exceptional difficulties,  
the profits attributable to the permanent 
establishment may be estimated on a 
reasonable basis. The estimate adopted 
shall, however, be such that the result 
shall be in accordance with the principles 
contained in this Article.
</p>
<p id="p_43">3.	In the determination of the profits of a 
permanent establishment, there shall be 
allowed as deductions expenses which 
are incurred for the  purposes of the 
business of the permanent 
establishment, including a reasonable 
allocation of executive and general 
administrative expenses, research and 
development expenses, interest and other 
expenses, incurred for the purposes of 
the enterprise as a whole (or the part 
thereof which includes the permanent 
establishment), whether incurred in the 
State in which the permanent 
establishment is situated or elsewhere, in 
accordance with the provisions of and 
subject to the limitations of the taxation 
laws of that State.  However, no such 
deduction shall be allowed in respect of 
amounts, if any, paid (otherwise than 
towards reimbursement of actual 
expenses) by the permanent 
establishment to the head office of the 
enterprise or any of its other offices, by 
way of royalties, fees or other similar 
payments in return for the use of patents, 
know-how or other rights, or by way of 
commission or other charges for specific 
services performed or for management, or 
except in the case of banking enterprise, 
by way of interest on moneys lent to the 
permanent establishment.  Likewise, no  
account shall be taken, in the 
determination of the profits of a 
permanent establishment, for amounts 
charged (otherwise than toward 
reimbursement of actual expenses), by 
the permanent establishment to the head 
office of the enterprise or any of its other 
offices, by way of royalties, fees or other 
similar payments in return for the use of 
patents, know-how or other rights, or by 
way of commission or other charges for 
specific services performed or for 
management, or, except in the case of a 
banking enterprise, by way of interest on 
moneys lent to the head office of the 
enterprise or any of its other offices.
</p>
<p id="p_44">4.	No profits shall be attributed to a 
permanent establishment by reason of 
the mere purchase by that permanent 
establishment of goods or merchandise 
for the enterprise.
</p>

<p id="p_45">5.	For the purposes of this Convention, the 
profits to be attributed to the permanent 
establishment as provided in paragraph 1 
</p><p id="p_46">(a) of this Article shall include only the 
profits derived from the assets and 
activities of the permanent establishment 
and shall be determined by the same 
method year by year unless there is good 
and sufficient reason to the contrary.
</p>
<p id="p_47">6.	Where profits include items of income 
which are dealt with separately in other 
Articles of the Convention, then the 
provisions of those Articles shall not be 
affected by the provisions of this Article.
</p>
<p id="p_48">7.	For the purposes of the Convention, the 
term "business profits" means income 
derived from any trade or business 
including income from the furnishing of 
services other than included services as 
defined in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_17">Article 12 (Royalties</a> and <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_18">Fees 
for Included Services)</a>  and including 
income from the rental of tangible 
personal property other than property  
described in paragraph 3 (b) of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_19">Article 12 
(Royalties</a> and <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_20">Fees for Included 
Services)."</a>
</p>
<p id="p_49">8.	In our view, the second requirement of <a href="/doc/1001719/" id="a_21">Article 5(1)</a> of 
DTAA is not satisfied as regards back office functions.  We 
have examined the terms of the Agreement along with the 
advance ruling application made by MSCo inviting the AAR to 
give its ruling.  It is clear from reading of the above Agreement 
/application that MSAS in India would be engaged in 
supporting the front office functions of MSCo in fixed income 
and equity research and in providing IT enabled services such 
as data processing support centre and technical services as 
also reconciliation of accounts.  In order to decide whether a 
P.E. stood constituted one has to undertake what is called as 
a functional and  factual analysis of each of the activities to be 
undertaken by an establishment.  It is from that point of view, 
we are in agreement with the ruling of the AAR that in the 
present case <a href="/doc/1001719/" id="a_22">Article 5(1)</a> is not applicable as the said MSAS 
would be performing in India only back office operations.   
Therefore to the extent of the above back office functions the 
second part of <a href="/doc/1001719/" id="a_23">Article 5(1)</a> is not attracted.  
</p>
<p id="p_50">9.	Lastly, as rightly held by the AAR there is no agency PE 
as the PE in India had no authority to enter into or conclude 
the contracts.  The contracts would be entered in the United 
States. They would be concluded in US.  The implementation 
of those contracts only to the extent of back office functions 
would be carried out in India, and therefore, MSAS would not 
constitute an Agency PE as contended on behalf of the 
Department.  
</p>

<p id="p_51">10.	In the DTAA, the term P.E. means a fixed place of 
business through which the business of an MNE is wholly or 
partly carried out. The definition of the word P.E. in Section 
92(F)(iii) is inclusive, however it is not under <a href="/doc/1001719/" id="a_24">Article 5(1)</a> of the 
Treaty.  It is for this reason that <a href="/doc/1188180/" id="a_25">Article 5(2)</a> of the DTAA herein 
refers to places included as P.E. of the MNE. One such place is 
mentioned in <a href="/doc/1188180/" id="a_26">Article 5(2)(l)</a> which deals with furnishing of 
services.
</p>
<p id="p_52">11.	  The concept of P.E. was introduced in 1961 Act as part 
of the statutory provisions of transfer pricing by the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_27">Finance 
Act</a> of 2001.  In <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_28">Section 92-F</a> (iii) the word "enterprise" is 
defined to mean "a person including a P.E. of such person who 
is proposed to be engaged in any activity relating to the 
production. ".  Under the CBDT circular No.14 of 2001 it has 
been clarified that the term P.E. has not been defined in the 
Act but  its meaning may be understood with reference to the 
DTAA entered into by India. Thus the intention was to rely on 
the concept and definition of P.E. in the DTAA.  However, vide 
<a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_29">Finance Act</a>, 2002 the definition of P.E. was inserted in the 
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_30">Income Tax Act</a>, 1961 (for short, '<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_31">I.T. Act</a>') vide <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_32">Section 92-F</a> 
(iiia) which states that the P.E. shall include a fixed place of 
business through which the business of the MNE is wholly or 
partly carried on. This is where the difference lies between the 
definition of the word P.E. in the inclusive sense under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_33">I.T. 
Act</a> as against the definition of the word P.E. in the exhaustive 
sense under the DTAA.  This analysis is important because it 
indicates the intention of the Parliament in adopting an 
inclusive definition of P.E. so as to cover service P.E., agency 
P.E., software P.E., Construction PE etc.

</p><p id="p_53">12.	There is one more aspect which needs to be discussed 
namely, exclusion of P.E under <a href="/doc/507956/" id="a_34">Article 5(3).</a>  Under <a href="/doc/507956/" id="a_35">Article 5(3)</a> 
</p><p id="p_54">(e) activities which are preparatory or auxiliary in character 
which are carried out at a fixed place of business will not 
constitute a P.E. <a href="/doc/507956/" id="a_36">Article 5(3)</a> commences with a non obstante 
clause. It states that notwithstanding what is stated in <a href="/doc/1001719/" id="a_37">Article 
5(1)</a> or under <a href="/doc/1188180/" id="a_38">Article 5(2)</a> the term P.E. shall not include 
maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for 
advertisement, scientific research or for activities which are 
preparatory or auxiliary in character. In the present case we 
are of the view that the above mentioned back office functions 
proposed to be performed by MSAS in India falls under <a href="/doc/507956/" id="a_39">Article 
5(3) (e)</a> of the DTAA.  Therefore, in our view in the present case 
MSAS would not constitute a fixed place P.E. under <a href="/doc/1001719/" id="a_40">Article 
5(1)</a> of the DTAA as regards its back office operations.
</p>
<p id="p_55">13.	However, the question which arises for determination in 
the present case is the nature of activities performed by 
stewards and deputationists deployed by MSCo to work in 
India as employees of MSAS.  Under <a href="/doc/1188180/" id="a_41">Article 5(2)(l)</a> furnishing of 
services through the fixed place in India can constitute a P.E.  
The AAR in the impugned ruling has held that the stewards 
and deputationists are proposed to  be sent by the MSCo from 
U.S.  According to the AAR there is a flow of service from the 
MSCo to the MSAS when the former deputes its own 
employees to work in India in MSAS.  Therefore, according to 
the AAR the service Agreement between MSCo and MSAS 
dated 14.4.2005 would fall under <a href="/doc/1188180/" id="a_42">Article 5(2)(l)</a> and 
consequently the transfer pricing regulation would apply  for 
evaluating the charges payable by MSCo to MSAS in India for 
such service contract.  This ruling has been challenged by the 
applicant. 
</p>
<p id="p_56">14.	<a href="/doc/1188180/" id="a_43">Article 5(2)(l)</a> of the DTAA applies in cases where the MNE 
furnishes services within India and those services are 
furnished through its employees.  In the present case we are 
concerned with two activities namely stewardship activities 
and the work to be performed by deputationists in India as 
employees of MSAS.  A customer like an MSCo who has world 
wide operations is entitled to insist on quality control and 
confidentiality from the service provider. For example in the 
case of software P.E. a server stores the data which may 
require confidentiality.  A service provider may also be 
required to act according to the quality control specifications 
imposed by its customer. It may be required to maintain 
confidentiality.  Stewardship activities involve briefing of the 
MSAS staff to ensure that the output meets the requirements 
of the MSCo.  These activities include monitoring of the 
outsourcing operations at MSAS.  The object is to protect the 
interest of the MSCo.  These stewards are not involved in day 
to day management or in any specific services to be 
undertaken by MSAS.  The stewardship activity is basically to 
protect the interest of the customer.  In the present case as 
held hereinabove the MSAS is a service P.E.  It is in a sense a 
service provider. A customer is entitled to protect its interest 
both in terms of confidentiality and in terms of quality control.  
In such a case it cannot be said that MSCo has been rendering 
the services to MSAS.  In our view MSCo is merely protecting 
its own interests in the competitive world by ensuring the 
quality and confidentiality of MSAS services.  We do not agree 
with the ruling of the AAR that the stewardship activity would 
fall under <a href="/doc/1188180/" id="a_44">Article 5(2)(l).</a>  To this extent we find merit in the 
civil appeal filed by the appellant (MSCo) and accordingly its 
appeal to that extent stands partly allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_57">15.	As regards the question of deputation, we are of the view 
that an employee of MSCo when deputed to MSAS does not 
become an employee of MSAS.  A deputationist has a lien on 
his employment with MSCo.  As long as the lien remains with 
the MSCo the said company retains control over the 
deputationist's terms and employment.  The concept of a 
service PE finds place in the U.N. Convention.  It is constituted 
if the multinational enterprise renders services through its 
employees in India provided the services are rendered for a 
specified period.  In this case, it extends to two years on the 
request of MSAS.  It is important to note that where the 
activities of the multinational enterprise entails it being 
responsible for the work of deputationists and the employees 
continue to be on the payroll of the multinational enterprise or 
they continue to have their lien on their jobs with the 
multinational enterprise, a service PE can emerge.  Applying 
the above tests to the facts of this case we find that on 
request/requisition from MSAS the applicant deputes its staff.  
The request comes from MSAS depending upon its 
requirement.  Generally, occasions do arise when MSAS needs 
the expertise of the staff of MSCo.  In such circumstances, 
generally, MSAS makes a request to MSCo.  A deputationist 
under such circumstances is expected to be experienced in 
banking and finance.  On completion of his tenure he is 
repatriated to his parent job.  He retains his lien when he 
comes to India.  He lends his experience to MSAS in India as 
an employee of MSCo as he retains his lien and in that sense 
there is a service PE (MSAS) under <a href="/doc/1188180/" id="a_45">Article 5(2)(l).</a>  We find no 
infirmity in the ruling of the ARR on this aspect.  In the above 
situation, MSCo is rendering services through its employees to 
MSAS.  Therefore, the Department is right in its contention 
that under the above situation there exists a Service PE in 
India (MSAS).  Accordingly, the civil appeal filed by the 
Department stands partly allowed.

<p id="p_58">Income Attributable to PE
</p><p id="p_59">16.	Under <a href="/doc/735354/" id="a_46">Article 7</a>, the taxability is of the MNE. What is to 
be taxed under <a href="/doc/735354/" id="a_47">Article 7</a> is income of the MNE attributable to 
the P.E. in India. The income attributable to the said P.E. is 
the income attributable to foreign company's operations in 
India, which in term, implies the income attributable to the 
activities carried on by the MNE through its P.E. in India. 
Therefore, there is a difference between the taxability of the 
P.E. in respect of its income earned by it in India which is in 
accordance with the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_48">Income-Tax Act</a>, 1961 and which has 
nothing to do with the taxability of the MNE, which is also 
taxable in India under <a href="/doc/735354/" id="a_49">Article 7</a>, in respect of the profits 
attributable to its P.E.. Under <a href="/doc/735354/" id="a_50">Article 7</a>, the taxability is of the 
MNE. What is taxable under <a href="/doc/735354/" id="a_51">Article 7</a> is profits earned by the 
MNE. Under the said <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_52">IT Act</a>, the taxable unit is the foreign 
company, though the quantum of income taxable is income 
attributable to the P.E. of the said foreign company in India.	
</p>
<p id="p_60">17.	An important question which arises for determination is 
whether the AAR is right in its ruling when it says that once 
the transfer pricing analysis is under taken there is no further 
need to attribute profits to a PE.  Computation of income 
arising from international transactions has to be done keeping 
in mind the principle of arm's length price.  Charges paid or 
payable by MSCo to MSAS under the service contract have to 
be accounted as income at arm's length price.  There are 
different methods for determining appropriate transfer pricing.  
Under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_53">Section 92C(1)</a> of the I.T. Act, arm's length price in 
relation to international transaction has to be determined by 
any of the following methods:
</p><p id="p_61">(a)	Comparable Uncontrolled Price Method (CUPM)
</p><p id="p_62">(b)	Resale Price Method (RPM)
</p><p id="p_63">(c)	Cost Plus Method (CPM)
</p><p id="p_64">(d)	Profit Split Method (PSM)
</p><p id="p_65">(e)	Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM)
</p><p id="p_66">(f)	Such other method as may be prescribed by CBDT

</p><p id="p_67">18.	The taxpayer is required to compute arm's length price 
for a transaction(s) using one of the five methods stipulated in 
the Income Tax Rules.  Rule 10C(1) of Income Tax Rules 
defines the most appropriate method as the method which is 
best suited to the facts and circumstances of each particular 
international transaction.  As per Rule 10C(2) the most 
appropriate method has to be selected having regard to 
number of factors which are enumerated therein.  The arm's 
length price has to be computed by the application of methods 
mentioned in <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_54">Section 92C(1)</a> of the I.T. Act.  
</p>
<p id="p_68">19.	In the present case, the applicant has taken the opinion 
of Earnest and Young (for short, 'E &amp; Y'), Consultants, as 
experts who have suggested, keeping in mind the various 
activities undertaken by MSCo and MSAS in India, TNMM as 
the most appropriate method for determination of arm's length 
price in respect of transaction between MSCo and MSAS.  The 
applicant sought a ruling from the ARR on the 
appropriateness of the said method.  On the adequacy of the 
mark-up  the applicant relied upon a transfer pricing review 
undertaken by E &amp; Y, an independent consultant, for 
benchmarking the transaction between the applicant and 
MSAS and as per that review, the average mark-up (on costs) 
of comparable companies providing similar services, was taken 
into account at 29%.  This was agreed upon by MSAS and the 
applicant (MSCo).  It has been accepted by the Transfer Pricing 
Officer and by the Assessing Officer.  It has not been disputed 
by T.N. Chopra &amp; Associates, consultants appointed by the 
Department. 
</p>
<p id="p_69">20.	Accordingly, the applicant (MSCo) preferred an applicant 
to the AAR on the following issues:
</p><p id="p_70">(i)	Appropriateness of TNMM for determination of 
arm's length in respect of transaction between 
MSCo and MSAS.
</p><p id="p_71">(ii)	Adequacy of the mark-up charged by MSAS for 
provision of service to MSCo based on arm's length 
principle.
</p><p id="p_72">(iii)	Attribution of further profits in the hands of PE of 
MSCo where the transaction is at arm's length.
</p><p id="p_73">(iv)	Appropriateness of remuneration based on margin 
on total operating cost of PE for determining profit 
attributable to service PE.
</p>
<p id="p_74">21.	As stated above, one of the main points which arises for 
determination in the present case is : whether the AAR was 
right in ruling that as long as MSAS was remunerated for its 
services at arm's length, there should be no additional profits 
attributable to the applicant or to MSAS in India.
</p>
<p id="p_75">22.	To answer the above question one has to examine the

<p id="p_159">Provided that data relating to a period not being more

<p id="p_160">Most appropriate method.

<p id="p_161">Rule 10C. (1) For the purposes of sub-section (1) of 
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_87">section 92C</a>, the most appropriate method shall be the

</p>
<p id="p_162">(2) In selecting the most appropriate method as 
specified in sub-rule (1), the following factors shall be 
taken into account, namely:-

</p><p id="p_164">(b)	the class of classes of associated 
enterprises entering into the transaction 
and the functions performed by them 
taking into account assets employed or to

enterprises:
</p><p id="p_165">(c)	the availability, coverage and reliability of 
data necessary for application of the 
method;
</p><p id="p_166">(d)	the degree of comparability existing 
between the international transaction and 
the uncontrolled transaction and between 
the enterprises entering into such

</p><p id="p_167">(e)	the extent to which reliable and accurate 
adjustments can be made to account for 
differences, if any, between the 
international transaction and the 
comparable uncontrolled transaction or 
between the enterprises entering into such

</p><p id="p_168">(f)	the nature, extent and reliability of 
assumptions required to be made in 
application of a method."   
</p><p id="p_169">(emphasis supplied)
    
</p><p id="p_170">27.	The methods, quoted above, namely, CUPM, RPM, CPM, 
PSM, TNMM etc. are mentioned in <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_88">Section 92C</a> read with Rule 
10B.  The most appropriate method has to be applied for 
computation of the arm's length price.  It will depend on the 
facts and circumstances of each particular international 
transaction (see: Rule 10C).  <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_89">Section 92C</a> inter alia provides 
that if the Assessing Officer, during the course of any 
proceedings for the assessment on income, is of the opinion on 
the basis of material or information or document that the price 
charged or paid in an international transaction has not been 
determined on arm's length basis or if he finds that the 
assessee has not maintained proper documents relating to the 
international transaction in accordance with the provisions of 
the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_90">I.T. Act</a> or if he finds that the data used in the 
computation of arm's length price is not reliable, the Assessing 
Officer may proceed to determine the arm's length price in 
relation to the said transaction.  Rules 10B, 10C and 10D 
explains the determination of ALP under each of the above 
methods.  
</p>
<p id="p_171">28.	At this stage, it may be noted that on the question of 
appropriateness of the said TNMM, the AAR did not give its 
ruling as the transfer pricing as proceedings had commenced 
before the tax officer before MSCo could seek the ruling.  
However, after the impugned ruling, Transfer Pricing Officer 
and the Assessing Officer have found the said method (TNMM) 
to be appropriate.  In our view, apart from the orders passed 
by the Assessing Officer and the Transfer Pricing Officer, the 
said method (TNMM) is the appropriate method in the case of 
Service PE as TNMM apportions the total operating profit 
arising from the transaction on the basis of sales, costs, 
assets, etc.

</p><p id="p_172">29.	As regards determination of profits attributable to a PE in 
India (MSAS) is concerned on the basis of arm's length 
principle we have quoted <a href="/doc/544105/" id="a_91">Article 7(2)</a> of the DTAA.  According 
to the AAR where there is an international transaction under 
which a non-resident compensates a PE at arm's length price, 
no further profits would be attributable in India.  In this 
connection, the AAR has relied upon Circular No.23 of 1969 
issued by CBDT as well as Circular No.5 of 2004 also issued 
by CBDT.  This is the key question which arises for 
determination in these civil appeals.
</p>
<p id="p_173">30.	To answer the above question we quote <a href="/doc/735354/" id="a_92">Article 7</a> of the 
U.N. Model Convention which reads as under:
"<a href="/doc/735354/" id="a_93">ARTICLE 7 :</a>	ATTRIBUTION OF BUSINESS PROFITS

<a href="/doc/735354/" id="a_94">Article 7</a> of the UN Model Convention states as under:
business profits
</p><p id="p_174">1.	The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be 
taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on 
business in the other Contracting State through a 
permanent establishment situated therein.  If the 
enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of 
the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so 
much of them as is attributable to (a) that permanent 
establishment; (b) sales in that other State of goods or 
merchandise of the same or similar kind as those sold 
through that permanent establishment; or (c) other 
business activities carried on in that other State of the 
same or similar kind as those effected through that 
permanent establishment.  
</p><p id="p_175">2.	Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where en 
enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in 
the other Contracting State through a permanent 
establishment situated therein, there shall in each 
Contracting State be attributed to that permanent 
establishment the profits which it might be expected to 
make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged 
in the same or similar activities under he same or similar 
conditions and dealing wholly or independently with the 
enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.
</p><p id="p_176">3.	In the determination of the profits of a permanent 
establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions 
expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the 
business of the permanent establishment including 
executive and general administrative expenses so 
incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent 
establishment is situated or elsewhere.  However, no such 
deduction shall be allowed in respect of amounts, if any, 
paid (otherwise than towards reimbursement of actual 
expenses) by the permanent establishment to the head 
office of the enterprise or any of its other offices, by way of 
royalties, fees or other similar payments in return for the 
use of patents or other rights, or by way of commission, 
for specific services performed or for management, or, 
except in the case of a banking enterprise, by way of 
interest on moneys lent to the permanent establishment.  
Likewise, no account shall be taken, in the determination 
of the profits of a permanent establishment, for amounts 
charged (otherwise than towards reimbursement of actual 
expenses), by the permanent establishment to the head 
office of the enterprise or any of its other offices, by way of 
royalties, fees or other similar payments in return for he 
use of patents or other rights, or by way of commission 
for specific services performed or for management, or, 
except in the case of a banking enterprise by way of 
interest on moneys lent to the head office of the 
enterprise or any of its other offices.
</p><p id="p_177">4.	Insofar as it has been customary in a Contracting State to 
determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent 
establishment on the basis of an apportionment of the 
total profits of the enterprise to its various parts, nothing 
in paragraph 2 shall preclude that Contracting State from 
determining the profits to be taxed by such an 
apportionment as may be customary; the method of 
apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the 
result shall be in accordance with the principles 
contained in this article.
</p><p id="p_178">5.	For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits 
to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be 
determined by the same method year-by-year unless 
there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary.
</p><p id="p_179">6.	Where profits include items of income which are dealt 
with separately in other articles of this Convention, then 
the provisions of those articles shall not be affected by the 
provisions of this article.
</p>
<p id="p_180">Note: The question of whether profits should be attributed to 
a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase 
by that permanent establishment of goods and merchandise 
for the enterprise was not resolved.  It should therefore be 
settled in bilateral negotiations."     
</p> 
<p id="p_181">31.	<a href="/doc/735354/" id="a_95">Article 7</a> of the U.N. Model Convention inter alia provides 
that only that portion of business profits is taxable in the 
source country which is attributable to the PE.  It specifies 
how such business profits should be ascertained.  Under the 
said Article, a PE is treated as if it is an independent 
enterprise (profit centre) dehors the head office and which 
deals with the head office at arm's length.  Therefore, its 
profits are determined on the basis as if it is an independent 
enterprise.  The profits of the PE are determined on the basis 
of what an independent enterprise under similar 
circumstances might be expected to derive on its own.  <a href="/doc/544105/" id="a_96">Article 
7(2)</a> of the U.N. Model Convention advocates the arm's length 
approach for attribution of profits to a PE.
</p>
<p id="p_182">32.	The object behind enactment of transfer pricing 
regulations is to prevent shifting of profits outside India.  
Under <a href="/doc/544105/" id="a_97">Article 7(2)</a> not all profits of MSCo would be taxable in 
India but only those which have economic nexus with PE in 
India.  A foreign enterprise is liable to be taxed in India on so 
much of its business profit as is attributable to the PE in 
India.  The quantum of taxable income is to be determined in 
accordance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_98">I.T. Act</a>.  All provisions of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_99">I.T. 
Act</a> are applicable, including provisions relating to 
depreciation, investment losses, deductible expenses, carry-
forward and set-off losses etc.  However, deviations are made 
by DTAA in cases of royalty, interest etc.  Such deviations are 
also made under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_100">I.T. Act</a> (for example: <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_101">Sections 44BB</a>, 
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_102">44BBA</a> etc.).  Under the impugned ruling delivered by the AAR, 
remuneration to MSAS was justified by a transfer pricing 
analysis and, therefore, no further income could be attributed 
to the PE (MSAS).  In other words, the said ruling equates an 
arm's length analysis (ALA) with attribution of profits.  It holds 
that once a transfer pricing analysis is undertaken; there is no 
further need to attribute profits to a PE.  The impugned ruling 
is correct in principle insofar as an associated enterprise, that 
also constitutes a PE, has been remunerated on an arm's 
length basis taking into account all the risk-taking functions 
of the enterprise.  In such cases nothing further would be left 
to be attributed to the PE.  The situation would be different if 
transfer pricing analysis does not adequately reflect the 
functions performed and the risks assumed by the enterprise.  
In such a situation, there would be a need to attribute profits 
to the PE for those functions/risks that have not been 
considered.  Therefore, in each case the data placed by the 
taxpayer has to be examined as to whether the transfer pricing 
analysis placed by the taxpayer is exhaustive of attribution of 
profits and that would depend on the functional and factual 
analysis to be undertaken in each case.  Lastly, it may be 
added that taxing corporates on the basis of the concept of 
Economic Nexus is an important feature of Attributable Profits 
(profits attributable to the PE).    
</p>
<p id="p_183">Conclusion:
</p><p id="p_184">33.	To conclude, we hold that the AAR was right in ruling 
that MSAS would be a Service PE in India under <a href="/doc/1188180/" id="a_103">Article 5(2)(l</a>), 
though only on account of the services to be performed by the 
deputationists deployed by MSCo and not on account of 
stewardship activities.  As regards income attributable to the 
PE (MSAS) we hold that the Transactional Net Margin Method 
was the appropriate method for determination of the arm's 
length price in respect of transaction between MSCo and 
MSAS.  We accept as correct the computation of the 
remuneration based on cost plus mark-up worked out at 29% 
on the operating costs of MSAS.  This position is also accepted 
by the Assessing Officer in his order dated 29.12.06 (after the 
impugned ruling) and also by the transfer pricing officer vide 
order dated 22.9.06.  As regards attribution of further profits 
to the PE of MSCo where the transaction between the two are 
held to be at arm's length, we hold that the ruling is correct in 
principle provided that an associated enterprise (that also 
constitutes a PE) is remunerated on arm's length basis taking 
into account all the risk-taking functions of the multinational 
enterprise.  In such a case nothing further would be left to 
attribute to the PE.  The situation would be different if the 
transfer pricing analysis does not adequately reflect the 
functions performed and the risks assumed by the enterprise.  
In such a case, there would be need to attribute profits to the 
PE for those functions/risks that have not been considered.  
The entire exercise ultimately is to ascertain whether the 
service charges payable or paid to the service provider (MSAS 
in this case) fully represents the value of the profit attributable 
to his service.  In this connection, the Department has also to 
examine whether the PE has obtained services from the 
multinational enterprise at lower than the arm's length cost?  
Therefore, the Department has to determine income, expense 
or cost allocations having regard to arm's length prices to 
decide the applicability of the transfer pricing regulations.    
</p>
<p id="p_185">34.	Economic nexus is an important aspect of the principle of 
Attribution of Profits.
</p>
<p id="p_186">35.	In the light of what is stated above, the impugned ruling 
by AAR stands modified to the extent indicated hereinabove.  
Accordingly, both the civil appeals filed by the applicant 
(MSCo) and by the Department are partly allowed with no 
order as to costs.
