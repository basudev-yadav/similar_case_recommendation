WITH
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 406 OF 2004
S. N. VARIAVA, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">	Civil Appeal No. 2350 is filed against the Judgment dated 19th 
July, 2001 passed by the Customs, Excise &amp; Gold (Control) Appellate 
Tribunal (for short `CEGAT') and Civil Appeal No. 406 of 2004 is filed 
against the Judgment dated 25th June, 2003 passed by CEGAT.   Both 
these Appeals can be disposed off by this common Judgment as the 
parties are the same and the question involved is the same.  
	Briefly stated the facts are as follows:
</p><p id="p_3">The Appellants are engaged in manufacture of Textile Printing 
Adhesives falling under Chapter Heading No. 3402 of the <a href="/doc/1469183/" id="a_1">Central 
Excise Tariff Act</a>, 1985.  The Appellants were claiming benefit of 
Notification No. 1 of 1993 as amended and Notification No. 16 of 1997.  
Show-cause-notices were issued to them alleging that they were not 
entitled to the benefit of the Notifications as they were using the logo 
of "ATR" belonging to one M/s. ATR St. Moritz A.G., Switzerland.    
Duty and penalty was demanded from them for having suppressed the 
facts and non-payment of duty.   The Appellants replied to the notices.   
However, the Deputy Commissioner confirmed the demand of 
Rs.26,74,875.75 and imposed a penalty of Rs. 26,00,000/-.   
	The Appellants filed an Appeal before the Commissioner of 
Central Excise (Appeals).  They inter alia contended that, as 
suppression has been alleged, the Superintendent who had issued the 
show-cause-notices was not competent to issue the show-cause-
notices and the Deputy Commissioner was not competent to 
adjudicate.   The Commissioner (Appeals) upheld the contention that 
the show-cause-notices were wrongly issued and had been wrongly 
adjudicated by the Deputy Commissioner in excess of powers vested in 
him by the Central Board of Central Excise (for short `Board`).   The 
Commissioner (Appeals) remitted the matter back with the following 
directions:-
</p><p id="p_4">"I.	If the matter does not really merit invocation of 
suppression of facts, willful misstatement, etc., the 
superfluous words may be got deleted from the 
subject Show Cause Notices by issuing suitable 
corrigenda and the matter may be re-adjudicated by 
the competent adjudicating authority.  The SSI 
Notification Nos. may also be duly amended and 
substituted by Notifications in force during the 
periods of demand.
</p>
<p id="p_5">II.	If the charge of misstatement suppression of facts 
etc. is to be retained, fresh Show Cause Notices may 
be issued in supersession of the impugned Show 
Cause Notices in line with the instructions contained 
in the two circulars referred to above.
</p>
<p id="p_6">III.	While re-adjudicating the matter, the appellants' 
contention that vide their letter dated 1.4.99, they 
had sent a specimen of the label to be used by them 
and that this specimen shows that their own brand 
name was more prominently displayed than the 
foreign brand name and that the price should be 
treated as cum-duty price should be examined in the 
light of the various CEGAT decisions available on this 
subject."
</p>
	
<p id="p_7">	Aggrieved by the directions given, the Appellants filed an Appeal.  
CEGAT by its Order dated 19th July, 2001 held that the Commissioner 
(Appeals) should not have remitted the matter back with the above 
directions and directed the Commissioner (Appeals) to decide the 
matter on merits.   CEGAT also held on merits that the Appellants 
were not entitled to the benefits of the above mentioned Notifications 
as they used the brand name of another Company on their products.   
Aggrieved by this Order the Appellants have filed Civil Appeal No. 2350 
of 2002. 
</p><p id="p_8">	No stay was granted in this Appeal, therefore, the Commissioner 
(Appeals) adjudicated and confirmed the demand by an Order dated 
17th July, 2002.  The Appellants then filed an Appeal before CEGAT 
wherein the only contention taken was that the Superintendent had no 
jurisdiction to issue show-cause-notices and the Deputy Commissioner 
had no jurisdiction to adjudicate.   CEGAT has dismissed the Appeal by 
the Order dated 25th June, 2003.  The Appellants have filed Civil 
Appeal No. 406 of 2004 against this Order.  
	It must be mentioned that the only point agitated is that the 
Superintendent had no jurisdiction to issue the show-cause-notices 
and that the Deputy Commissioner had no jurisdiction to adjudicate. 
This is because in an earlier round it has already been held by CEGAT, 
by its order dated 17th October, 2000 that the Appellants are not 
entitled to the benefit of the Notifications.  Against that Order Civil 
Appeal No.4050 of 2001 is pending before this Court.
	In order to consider this point it is necessary to see the relevant 
provisions.   
</p><p id="p_9">	<a href="/doc/1469183/" id="a_2">Section 11A</a>, as it stood, prior to 14th May, 1992 reads as 
follows:
</p><p id="p_10">"SECTION 11A. Recovery of duties not levied or not 
paid or short-levied or short-paid or erroneously 
refunded.(1) When any duty of excise has not been 
levied or paid or has been short-levied or short-paid or 
erroneously refunded, a Central Excise Officer may, within 
six months from the relevant date, serve notice on the 
person chargeable with the duty which has not been levied 
or paid or which has been short-levied or short-paid or to 
whom the refund has erroneously been made, requiring 
him to show cause why he should not pay the amount 
specified in the notice:
</p>
<p id="p_11">	Provided that where any duty of excise has not been 
levied or paid or has been short-levied or short-paid or 
erroneously refunded by reason of fraud, collusion or any 
willful mis-statement or suppression of facts or 
contravention of any of the provisions of this Act or of the 
rules made thereunder with intent to evade payment of 
duty, by such person or his agent, the provisions of this 
sub-section shall have effect, as if, for the words "Central 
Excise Officer", the words "Collector of Central Excise" and 
for the words "six months" the words "five years" were 
substituted.
</p>
<p id="p_12">	Explanation.Where the service of the notice is 
stayed by an order of a court, the period of such stay shall 
be excluded in computing the aforesaid period of six 
months or five years, as the case may be.
</p>
<p id="p_13">	(2) The Assistant Collector of Central Excise or, as 
the case may be, the Collector of Central Excise shall, after 
considering the representation, if any, made by the person 
on whom notice is served under sub-section (1), determine 
the amount of duty of excise due from such person (not 
being in excess of the amount specified in the notice) and 
thereupon such person shall pay the amount so 
determined.
</p>
<p id="p_14">(3)	For the purposes of this section,--
</p>
<p id="p_15">(i)	"refund", includes rebate of duty of excise 
on excisable goods exported out of India or 
on excisable materials used in the 
manufacture of goods which are exported 
out of India;
</p>
<p id="p_16">(ii)	"relevant date" means, --
</p>
<p id="p_17">(a)	in the case of excisable goods on which 
duty of excise has not been levied or 
paid or has been short-levied or short-
</p><p id="p_18">paid

(A)	where under the rules made 
under this Act a monthly return, 
showing particulars of the duty 
paid on the excisable goods 
removed during the month to 
which the said return relates, is 
to be filed by a manufacturer or 
producer or a licensee of a 
warehouse, as the case may be, 
the date on which such return is 
so filed;
</p><p id="p_19">(B)	where no monthly return as 
aforesaid is filed, the last date on 
which such return is to be filed 
under the said rules;
</p><p id="p_20">(C)	in any other case, the date on 
which the duty is to be paid 
under this Act or the rules made 
thereunder;
</p>
<p id="p_21">(b)	in a case where duty of excise is 
provisionally assessed under this Act or 
the rules made thereunder, the date of 
adjustment of duty after the final 
assessment thereof;
</p><p id="p_22">(c)	in the case of excisable goods on which 
duty of excise has been erroneously 
refunded, the date of such refund.
</p>

<p id="p_23">Thus, under <a href="/doc/1469183/" id="a_3">Section 11A</a>, as it then stood, whenever it was alleged 
that there was fraud, collusion, willful misstatement or suppression of 
facts, the show-cause-notices could only be issued by the Collector.  
<a href="/doc/1469183/" id="a_4">As the Act</a> itself laid down a requirement, it has been held, in a 
number of authorities, that a show-cause notice issued and/or 
adjudication done by an officer below the rank of a Collector would be 
invalid as such an officer had no jurisdiction.  
	With effect from 14th May, 1992 <a href="/doc/1469183/" id="a_5">Section 11A</a> was amended and 
the word "Collector" was deleted and the words "Central Excise 
Officer" were incorporated.  Thus, the Legislature purposely and 
knowingly made a change whereby it was no longer required that 
where allegations of fraud, collusion, willful misstatement or 
suppression of facts are made, a Collector should issue a show-cause 
notice or adjudicate the same.  Now a Central Excise Officer also has 
the jurisdiction.
</p><p id="p_24">	<a href="/doc/1519534/" id="a_6">Section 2(b)</a> of the Act defines a "Central Excise Officer" as 
follows:
</p><p id="p_25">"2(b).   "Central Excise Officer" means the Chief 
Commissioner of Central Excise, Commissioner of Central 
Excise, Commissioner of Central Excise (Appeals), 
Additional Commissioner of Central Excise, Deputy 
Commissioner of Central Excise, Assistant Commissioner of 
Central Excise or any other officer of the Central Excise 
Department, or any person (including an officer of the 
State Government) invested by the Central Board of Excise 
and Customs constituted under the <a href="/doc/76600/" id="a_7">Central Boards of 
Revenue Act</a>, 1963 (54 of 1963) with any of the powers of 
a Central Excise Officer under this Act."
</p>
<p id="p_26">Thus, even an Additional Commissioner or an Assistant Collector or a 
Deputy Commissioner or any other Officer of the Central Excise or any 
person invested by the Board with the power of the Central Excise 
Officer would be a Central Excise Officer.  Even though the Legislature 
made this change, the Board issued a Circular dated 27th February 
1997 which reads as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_27">	"I am directed to say that the Board has decided to 
review the powers of adjudication with the objective that 
cases are decided expeditiously, there is even distribution 
of workload and various doubts in this regard are clarified.
</p>
<p id="p_28">	2. In this connection, the following facts and legal 
position has been taken into consideration:-
</p>
<p id="p_29">(i)	By virtue of Clause (a) of <a href="/doc/139595292/" id="a_8">Section 33</a> of 
Central Excise Act, 1944, Commissioners 
can adjudicate the cases of confiscation and 
penalty without limit.   This power has been 
delegated to Deputy Commissioners by CBR 
Notification No.12-C.Ex., dated 17th May, 
1947, to Assistant Commissioners of Central 
Excise by CBR Notification No.8-C.E., dated 
2nd September, 1944 and to Superintendent 
of Central Excise by CBR Notification 
No.93/59, dated 28th November, 1959.
</p><p id="p_30">(ii)	So far as the confirmation of duty is 
concerned, it is observed that <a href="/doc/85233116/" id="a_9">Section 11A</a> 
empowers any Central Excise Officer to 
issue the notice and determine the duty 
due.
</p><p id="p_31">(iii)	Likewise, the "proper officer" i.e. 
Jurisdictional Central Excise Officer can 
issue notice and adjudicate the demands 
under Rule 9(2)/Rule 57-I/Rule 57U of 
Central Excise Rules, 1944.
</p><p id="p_32">(iv)	In order to bring about uniformity and 
objectivity the Board issued instructions 
defining powers of adjudication of specified 
Central Excise Officers taking 'duty involved' 
as the criterion.
</p>
<p id="p_33">	3.  Those show cause notices where adjudication 
orders are not passed upto 28th February, 1997, will be 
adjudicated as provided hereinafter :-
</p>
<p id="p_34">(A)	All cases involving fraud, collusion, any willful 
mis-statement, suppression of facts, or 
contravention of <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_10">Central Excise Act</a>/Rules made 
thereunder with intent to evade payment of 
duty and/or where extended period has been 
invoked in show cause notices, (including 
Modvat cases, Rule 9(2) cases of this type) will 
be adjudicated by :-</p><pre id="pre_2">

(Amt. of duty involved)

Commissioners		-	Without limit

Addl. Commissioners    -  Upto Rs. 10 lakhs

(B)	In respect of cases which do not fall 
under the category (A) above, will be 
adjudicated by :-

(Amt. of duty involved)

Commissioners		-	Without limit

Addl. Commissioners/    -  Above Rs. 2 lakhs
                 Dy. Commissioners           and upto Rs. 10 lakhs

</pre><p id="p_35">		Assistant Commissioner  -  Upto Rs. 2 lakhs

Notwithstanding the powers of Assistant Commissioners to 
adjudicate the cases involving duty amount upto Rs. 2 
lakhs only as above, all cases of determination of valuation 
and/or classification other than those covered under 
Category (A) above, will be adjudicated by the Assistant 
Commissioners without any limit as hitherto, as also 
Modvat disputes, other than those at category (A) above.
</p>
<p id="p_36">(C) 	Cases related to issues mentioned under first 
proviso to <a href="/doc/141228895/" id="a_11">Section 35B(1)</a> of Central Excise 
Act, 1944 would be adjudicated by the Addl. 
Commissioners/Dy. Commissioners without 
any monetary limit, as was the position under 
Board's Circular No. 13/93-CX., dated 15th 
October, 1993.
</p>
<p id="p_37">4. 	The value of goods/conveyance, plants, 
machinery and building etc., liable to confiscation will not 
alter above powers of adjudication which will solely depend 
upon the amount of duty/Modvat credit involved on the 
offending goods.
</p>
<p id="p_38">5.1 In respect of cases covered under Category (A) 
of Para 3 above, the show cause notices will be issued by 
the same rank of officers who will adjudicate them.  
Wherever the posts of Commissioner-I and Commissioner-
II (Judicial) are in existence, the show cause notices will 
be issued by Commissioner-I.
</p>
<p id="p_39">5.2	In respect of cases covered under Category (B) 
of Para 3 above, show cause notices will be issued by the 
Range Superintendent where they are to be adjudicated by 
the Assistant Commissioner and such notices will be issued 
by Assistant Commissioner when they are adjudicated by 
Dy. Commissioner/Addl. Commissioner/Commissioner.
</p>
<p id="p_40">5.3	In respect of cases covered under category (C) 
of Para 3 above, show cause notices will be issued by 
Assistant Commissioner.
</p>
<p id="p_41">6.	The definition of expression "Commissioner" 
contained in Rule 2(ii) was amended by Notification No. 
11/92-C.E. (N.T.), dated 14-5-1992.  Accordingly, an 
Additional Commissioner of Central Excise is not a 
Commissioner for the purposes of appeal.  Therefore, 
appeal against the Order-in-Original passed by an Addl. 
Commissioner of Central Excise shall lie to the 
Commissioner of Central Excise (Appeals) and not to the 
CEGAT.
</p>
<p id="p_42">7.	All Previous Board's Circulars relating to issue 
of show cause notices and their adjudications except the 
Circular No. 13/93-C.X., are hereby rescinded.  
</p>
<p id="p_43">8.	An immediate exercise should be undertaken 
thereafter to take the stock of the pendencies as on 1st 
March and transfer of the relevant files and records to 
respective adjudicating authorities by 15th March, 1997 
under proper receipt.  This re-cast figures should be 
reflected suitably in the Monthly Technical Report of March, 
1997 to be submitted in April, 1997.
</p>
<p id="p_44">9.	Receipt of this Circular may please be 
acknowledged.
</p>
<p id="p_45">10.	The trade and field formations may be suitably 
informed."
</p>		

<p id="p_46">By clauses 3(A) and 5.1 of this Circular, the Board is directing that in 
cases of fraud, collusion, willful misstatement or suppression of facts 
the notice must be issued and adjudication must take place by the 
Commissioner without limit and by the Deputy Commissioner up to a 
limit of Rs.10,00,000/-.   Thereafter the Board by another Circular 
dated 13th August, 1997 reiterated the above position.
	The Appellants place strong reliance upon these two Circulars 
and submit that by virtue of these Circulars the Superintendent had no 
jurisdiction to issue the show-cause-notices and that the Deputy 
Commissioner had no jurisdiction to adjudicate.  
	As noted above, the Legislature has purposely omitted the word 
"Collector" from the proviso to <a href="/doc/85233116/" id="a_12">Section 11A</a> and replaced it with the 
words "Central Excise Officer".   It is the Act which confers jurisdiction 
on the concerned Officer/s.  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_13">The Act</a> permits any Central Excise Officer 
to issue the show-cause notices even in cases where there are 
allegations of fraud, collusion, willful misstatement and suppression of 
facts.  The question therefore is: Can the Board override the provisions 
of the Act by issuing directions in the manner in which it is done and if 
the Board cannot do so then what is the effect of such Circulars?
	In order to consider the powers of the Board one needs to see 
certain provisions of the Act.  <a href="/doc/148654918/" id="a_14">Section 2(b)</a> defines the "Central Excise 
Officer" and it is mentioned therein that any Officer of the Central 
Excise Department or any person who has been invested by the Board 
with any of the powers of the Central Excise Officer would be a Central 
Excise Officer. Thus, the Board has power to invest any Central Excise 
Officer or any other Officer with powers of Central Excise Officer.  By 
virtue of <a href="/doc/847558/" id="a_15">Section 37B</a> the Board can issue orders, instructions or 
directions to the Central Excise Officers and such Officers must follow 
such orders, instructions or directions of the Board.  However, these 
directions can only be for the purpose of uniformity in the classification 
of excisable goods or with respect to levy of duties of excise on such 
goods.  It is thus clear that the Board has no power to issue 
instructions or orders contrary to the provisions of the Act or in 
derogation of the provisions of the Act.  The Board can only issue such 
direction as is necessary for the purpose of and in furtherance of the 
provisions of the Act.   The instructions issued by the Board have to be 
within the four corners of the Act.  If, therefore, the Act vests in the 
Central Excise Officers jurisdiction to issue show-cause-notices and to 
adjudicate, the Board has no power to cut down that jurisdiction.  
However, for the purposes of better administration of levy and 
collection of duty and for purpose of classification of goods the Board 
may issue directions allocating certain types of works to certain 
Officers or classes of Officers.  The Circulars relied upon are, therefore, 
nothing more than administrative directions allocating various types of 
works to various classes of Officers.  These administrative directions 
cannot take away jurisdiction vested in a Central Excise Officer under 
the Act.  At the highest all that can be said is Central Excise Officers, 
as a matter of propriety, must follow the directions and only deal with 
the work which has been allotted to them by virtue of these Circulars.  
But if an Officer still issues a notice or adjudicates contrary to the 
Circulars it would not be a ground for holding that he had no 
jurisdiction to issue the show cause notice or to set aside the 
adjudication.   
</p><p id="p_47">	The Tribunal has in its order dated 25th June, 2003, inter alia, 
held as follows:-
</p><p id="p_48">".....Further, at the relevant time as per the 
provisions of <a href="/doc/43567181/" id="a_16">Section 11A(1)</a> proper officer which 
includes Superintendent is competent to issue the 
show cause notice.  Board's Circular is only the 
administrative direction which does not cause any 
prejudice to the Appellants....."
</p>
<p id="p_49">In our view this is absolutely correct.  We, therefore, see no infirmity 
in the Judgment dated 25th June, 2003.  We hold that the 
Superintendent had jurisdiction to issue show-cause-notice and the 
Deputy Commissioner had jurisdiction to adjudicate.
	As we have held that the concerned Officers had jurisdiction, we 
see no infirmity in the Order dated 19th July, 2001 directing the 
Commissioner (Appeals) to dispose of the Appeal.
	In view of the above, we see no reason to interfere. The Appeals 
stand dismissed.  There will be no Order as to costs.
