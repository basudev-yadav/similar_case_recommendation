</pre><p id="p_1">			 O R D E R
Leave granted
Shri Prakash  Reddy, learned  counsel for the respondent has
raised an  interesting question	 of law	 in this  case.	 The
admitted facts	are that  the  Inspector  of  Police,  Urban
Police Station,	 Tenali, Guntur	 District of  Andhra Pradesh
had   in a  raid on December 23, 1986 seized 90 cassettes of
various cinematograph  films in	 Telugu,   Hindi and English
under a	 panchnama attested  by PW-2  from the video library
belonging to  the   respondent and laid the charge-sheet for
an offence  under Section  52-A read  with <a href="/doc/363642/" id="a_1">Section 63</a> of the
Copyright Act,	1957 [for  short, the  "Act] as	 amended  in
1984. The  trial Court	after adduction of evidence of PWs-1
to 3  and production  f Exs.  P-1  and	MO-1  convicted	 the
respondent under  <a href="/doc/363642/" id="a_2">Section 63</a> of the Act for minimum sentence
of six	months and  also imposed  a fine  of Rs. 3,000/-. In
default, he  was directed to undergo simple imprisonment for
a further  period of  one month.  On  appeal,  the  Sessions
Judge, Guntur  confirmed the  same. In Criminal Revision No.
665/69 and  CRC No.  666/89 the High Court of Andhra Pradesh
by  judgment   dated  September	  17,  1990   acquitted	 the
respondent of offence. Thus these
appeals by special leave.
</p><p id="p_2">The  facts  as	found  and  not	 in  dispute  are  that	 the
respondent had kept in his shop by name Video City,  various
cassettes  numbering   90  in	Telugu,	 English  and  Hindu
cinematograph films  exhibiting the  same either for hire or
sale to	 the customers.	 The question, therefore, is whether
the respondent has committed infringement of a copy right of
deemed infringement  thereof. The  Statement of	 Objects and
Reasons to <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_3">Amendment Act</a> 65 of 1984 reads as under :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	  "Piracy has  become  a  global
     problem due  to the  rapid advances
     in	 technology.   It  has	 assumed
     alarming proportions  all over  the
     world and	all the	  countries  are
     trying to	meet  the  challenge  by
     taking  stringent	Legislative  and
     enforcement measures.  The	 problem
     of piracy	and  the  necessity  for
     taking   sufficient   anti	  piracy
     measures  were   also   voiced   by
     Members of	 Parliament at	the time
     of the consideration of the Bill to
     amend the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_4">Copyright Act</a>, 1957, last
     year.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	  2. Mainly  there    are  three
     types of  piracy, namely, piracy of
     the printed  word, piracy	of sound
     recordings	   and	   piracy     of
     cinematograph films.  The object of
     the pirate	 in all such cases is to
     make quick	 money and avoid payment
     of legitimate  taxes and royalties.
     In	 respect   of	books,	 it   is
     estimated that four hundred to five
     hundred titles  are  pirated  every
     year in  India and	 on each  of the
     pirated titles,  the loses	 to  the
     Government	 in   the  form	 of  tax
     evasion  amounts  approximately  to
     Rs.  11,000/-   Apart  from  books,
     recorded music  and video cassettes
     of	  films	   TV	 programs    are
     reproduced, distributed and sold on
     a massive	scale in  many parts  of
     the world	without any remuneration
     to	   the	   authors,    artistes,
     publishers and producers concerned.
     The emergence  of new techniques of
     recordings,      fixation	     and
     reproduction  of	audio  programs,
     combined with  the	 advent of video
     technology	 have	greatly	 greatly
     helped the pirates. It is estimated
     that losses  to the  film producers
     and  other	  owners  of   copyright
     amount to several crores of rupees.
     The loss to Government in	terms of
     tax evasion  also amounts to crores
     of rupees.	 In addition  because of
     the  recent   video  boom	 in  the
     country,  there  are  reports  that
     uncertified video	films are  being
     exhibited on a large scale. A large
     number of	video parlors  have also
     sprung up	all over the country and
     they exhibit such films recorded on
     video tapes  by charging  admission
     fees from their clients. In view of
     these circumstances, it is proposed
     to amend  the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_5">Copyright  Act</a>, 1957,
     suitably to  combat affectively the
     piracy that  is  prevalent	 in  the
     country.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	  3. The  Bill	provides,  among
     other  things,  for  the  following
     amendments to the Act, namely :-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">     (i)  to  increase	 the  punishment
     provided for  the	infringement  of
     the copyright, namely, imprisonment
     of	 three	years,	with  a	 minimum
     punishment of  imprisonment of  six
     months, and  fine upto Rs. 2 lakhs,
     with a minimum of Rs. 50,000/-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">     (ii)    to	    provide	enhanced
     punishments in  the case  of second
     and subsequent convictions ;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">     (iii)   to	   provide    for    the
     declaration  of   the  offence   of
     infringement  of  copyright  as  an
     economic offence so that the period
     of limitation  provided for  in the
     Code of  Criminal	Procedure,  1973
     for offence  will not applicable to
     this offence.;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">     (iv)  to	specifically  make   the
     provisions of the Act applicable to
     video films and computer programs;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">     (v) to  require  the  producers  of
     records and  video films to display
     certain information in the records,
     video    films    and    containers
     thereof."</blockquote>
<p id="p_3">     <a href="/doc/797096/" id="a_6">Section 2</a>	[m] (ii) defined "infringing  copy" to mean,
in relation to cinematographic film, a copy of the film made
on any	medium by any means. <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_7">Section 3</a> defines "publication"
to mean	 making a  work available  to the public by issue of
copies or by communicating the work to the public. <a href="/doc/42009/" id="a_8">Section 4</a>
envisages when	work  is  not  deemed  to  be  published  or
performed in  public. It provides that except in relation to
infringement of	 copyright, a work shall not be deemed to be
published or performed in public, without the license of the
owner of  the copyright.  The permission  of the  owner	 for
publication is	mandatory when	it sought to be brought home
to the	person violating  the publication  or  performed  in
public. It  excludes the  application of  infringement of  a
copyright from the purview of Section 4 Chapter x deals with
registration of	 copyright. <a href="/doc/526211/" id="a_9">Section  44</a> envisages that there
shall be  kept at  the Copyright  Office a  register in	 the
prescribed form	 to be	called the Register of Copyrights in
which may  be entered  the names  or title of works and	 the
names and  addresses of	 authors, publishers  and owners  of
copyright and  such other  particulars as may be prescribed.
The entries  under <a href="/doc/263451/" id="a_10">Section  48</a> in the register of copyrights
shall be  prima facie	evidence  of the particulars entered
therein, or extracts therefrom certified by the Registrar of
Copyrights and	sealed with the seal of the Copyright Office
shall be  admissible  in  evidence  in	all  courts  without
further proof  or production  of the  original <a href="/doc/1038145/" id="a_11">Section 51</a> in
Chapter	 XI   deals  with  infringement	 of  copyrights.  It
provides, among	 other things,	that a	copyright in  a work
shall be  deemed to be infringed when any other person makes
for sale  or hire,  or sells  or lets for hire, or by way of
trade displays	or offers  for sale  or hire  any infringing
copies of  the work.  <a href="/doc/588136/" id="a_12">Section 52-A</a> deals with particulars to
be included in sound recordings and video films. Sub-section
thereof [2] provides thus
:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">     "[2]  No  person  shall  publish  a
     video film	 in respect  of any work

     for penalty thus :

     conferred by this Act. - Any person

     extend to three years and with fine
     which shall  not be less than fifty
     thousand  rupees	but  which   may
     extend to two lakh rupees :
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_15">     Provided	  that	   where     the
     infringement has  not been made for
     gain in  the  course  of  trade  or

     adequate and  special reasons to be
     mentioned in the judgment, impose a
     sentence of imprisonment for a term
     of less  than six	months or a fine
     of less than fifty thousand rupees.
     Explanation  -  Construction  of  a
     building or  other structure  which
     infringes or  which, if  completed,
     would  infringe  the  copyright  in
     some other	 work shall  not  be  an
     offence under this section."</blockquote>
<p id="p_4">     Further  amendment with regard to sentence of fine came
to be made by <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_17">Amendment Act</a> 38 of 1994 with which we are not
presently concerned.
</p><p id="p_5">     <a href="/doc/1577719/" id="a_18">Section 68-A</a>  provides for penalty for contravention of
<a href="/doc/588136/" id="a_19">Section 52-A</a>. It reads that any person who publishes a sound
recording or a video film in contravention of the provisions
of <a href="/doc/588136/" id="a_20">Section 52-A</a>, shall be punishable with imprisonment which
may extend to three years and  shall also be liable to fine.
</p><p id="p_6">     A	reading	 of  these  provisions	does  indicate	that
infringement of	 a copyright  or deemed	 infringement  of  a
copyright or publication of a work without the permission of
the owner  are offences	 under	the  Act.  The	question  is
whether identification	of the	owner of  the copyright is a
pre-condition for  violation of the provisions of <a href="/doc/363642/" id="a_21">Section 63</a>
or 68-A,  as the case may be ? The finding of the High Court
and ably   sought  to be  supported by Shri Prakash Reddy is
that unless  the owner is  identified and he comes and gives
evidence that  he had copyright of the video film  which was
sought to  be in  violation of <a href="/doc/588136/" id="a_22">Section 52-A</a> or <a href="/doc/1038145/" id="a_23">Section 51</a> of
the Act, there is no offence made out by the prosecution and
that,  therefore,   the	 conviction   and  sentence  of	 the
respondent is  not valid  in law. He contends that <a href="/doc/42009/" id="a_24">Section 4</a>
expressly excludes publication of the  work to be published.
The identification  of the owner being	an essential element
to prove  the offence  of  infringement	 of  copyright,	 the
prosecution  has   failed  to	establish   the	  same.	  In
construction of the penal statute strict construction should
be adopted  and in  that perspective  the benefit  of  doubt
given by  the High  Court is  well justified  and  does	 not
warrant interference.
</p><p id="p_7">     It	 is   true  that  in  the  interpretation  of  penal
provisions, strict  construction is  required to  be adopted
and if	any real  doubt arises,	 necessarily the  reasonable
benefit of  doubt would	 be extended to the accused. In this
case, the  question arises : whether such a doubt has arisen
? The  object of amending the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_25">Copyright Act</a> by Act amendment
65 of  1984, as	 note above,  was to  prevent  piracy  which
became a global problem due to rapid advances in technology.
The legislature	 intended to  prevent piracy  and punish the
pirates protecting  copyrights. The  law, therefore, came to
be amended  introducing <a href="/doc/588136/" id="a_26">Section 52-A</a>. Thereafter, the piracy
of cinematograph  films and of sound recording etc. could be
satisfactorily prevented.  Moreover the object of the pirate
is to  make quick  money and   avoid  payment of  legitimate
taxes  and   royalties.	 The  uncertified  films  are  being
exhibited in  a large  scale. Mushrooming  growth  of  video
parlours has  sprung up all over the country exhibiting such
films recorded on video tapes by charging admission fee from
the visitors.  Therefore, apart from increasing	 the penalty
of punishment  under law it also provides the declaration on
the offence  of infringement  and  video  films	 to  display
certain	 information   on  the	 recorded  video  films	 and
containers  thereof.  <a href="/doc/588136/" id="a_27">Section  52-A</a>  thus  has	incorporated
specifications of the prints in sub-section [2] thereof. The
construction of	 <a href="/doc/588136/" id="a_28">Sections 52-A</a>,	 <a href="/doc/1038145/" id="a_29">51</a>, <a href="/doc/363642/" id="a_30">63</a>	 and <a href="/doc/1577719/" id="a_31">68-A</a>  should be
approached  from   his	perspective.  It  would	 be  further
profitable  to	 read  the   relevant  provisions   of	 the
<a href="/doc/980182/" id="a_32">Cinematograph Act</a>,  1952 in  this behalf.    <a href="/doc/797096/" id="a_33">Section  2</a>	 [c]
defines "cinematograph"	 to include  any apparatus  for	 the
representation of  moving pictures  or series  of  pictures.
<a href="/doc/797096/" id="a_34">Section 2</a>  [d] (d)   defines "films" to mean a cinematograph
film. The  question, therefore	is :  whether video  film is
cinematograph ?	 It is	settled view  that video  tapes come
within	the   expression  "cinematograph"  in  view  of	 the
extended  definition   in  <a href="/doc/797096/" id="a_35">Section   2</a>	[c]  which  includes
apparatus for  the  representation  of	moving	pictures  or
series of  pictures as	copy of	 the video should be created
in respect  of a  cinematograph under  the <a href="/doc/980182/" id="a_36">Cinematograph Act</a>
which  gives   protection   to	 the   purchasers   of	 the
cinematograph if  they are registered under Chapter X of the
Act. <a href="/doc/526211/" id="a_37">Section 44</a> gives the right of registration and once the
entries have  been made	 by  operation	of  <a href="/doc/263451/" id="a_38">Section  48</a>	 the
entries in  the register  of copyrights shall be prima facie
evidence of  the  copyright  and  the  entries	therein	 are
conclusive without  proof of  the copyright  and the entries
therein are  conclusive	 without  proof	 of  the    original
copyright which	 must be  taken	 to  have  been	 created  in
respect of the video tape.
</p><p id="p_8">     In Balwinder  Singh v.  Delhi Administration  [AIR 1984
Delhi 379]  a Division	Bench of  Delhi High  Court had also
held that  both	 video	and  television	 are  cinematograph.
Licenses for  giving their  public exhibition  is  necessary
under  the  <a href="/doc/980182/" id="a_39">Cinematograph  Act</a>	in  spite  of  their  having
commercial licenses for them under the Telegraphs Act.
</p><p id="p_9">     It is  true that  there is	 no  specific  charge  under
<a href="/doc/588136/" id="a_40">Section 52-A</a>.  The charge  was under  <a href="/doc/1038145/" id="a_41">Section 51</a>  read	with
<a href="/doc/363642/" id="a_42">Section 63</a>  of the  Act. In view of the above finding and in
view  of  the	 findings  of  the  courts  below  that	 the
respondent was	exhibiting the	cinematograph films  in	 his
Video City  for hire  or for  sale of  the cassettes  to the
public which  do not contain the particulars envisaged under
<a href="/doc/588136/" id="a_43">Section 52-A</a>  of  the  Act,  the  infringement	falls  under
<a href="/doc/1038145/" id="a_44">Section 51</a>[2] (ii) or <a href="/doc/588136/" id="a_45">Section 52-A</a> of the Act. The former is
punishable under  <a href="/doc/363642/" id="a_46">Section 63</a>  and   the latter is punishable
under <a href="/doc/1577719/" id="a_47">Section 68-A</a> of the Act. In view of the above findings
of the	courts below the offence under which the case falls.
It would,  therefore, be  unnecessary for the prosecution to
track on  and trace  out the  owner of the copyright to come
and   adduce evidence  of  infringement	 of  copyright.	 The
absence	 thereof  does	not  constitute	 lack  of  essential
element of  infringement of copyright. If the particulars on
video films  etc. as mandated under <a href="/doc/588136/" id="a_48">Section 52-A</a> do not find
place, it would be infringement	 of copyright.
</p><p id="p_10">     In our  view, on  the facts  in this  case, the offence
would fall  under <a href="/doc/1577719/" id="a_49">Section  68-A</a> of the Act. Accordingly, the
conviction of the respondent is altered to one under <a href="/doc/1577719/" id="a_50">Section
68-A</a>. There would be no prejudice to the respondent. In view
of the	facts and circumstances, we are of the	opinion that
instead of imposing a sentence of imprisonment, sentence  of
fine of a sum of Rs 10,000/- would meet the ends of justice.
Therefore, the	conviction and sentence ordered by the trial
court as  confirmed by	the appellate  Court are modified to
one of	conviction under  <a href="/doc/1577719/" id="a_51">Section 68-A</a>.	 The  respondent  is
sentenced to  pay a  fine of  Rs. 10,000/-.  In default,  he
should undergo	rigorous imprisonment  for a period of three
months. Even  if he  does not pay the fine and undergoes the
sentence, the  State is	 at liberty to recover the fine from
the respondent.
</p><p id="p_11">The appeals are accordingly allowed.
