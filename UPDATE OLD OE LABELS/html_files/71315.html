S.B. SINHA, J :
</p>
<p id="p_2">	Leave granted.
</p>
<p id="p_3">	Appellant,  Respondent No.1 and  Respondent No.2 are brothers.  A 
suit for partition was filed by Respondent No.1.   A preliminary decree was 
passed on 16.03.1999.  An application purported to be a Special Darkhast 
was filed by him on 29.11.1999.  An Advocate Commissioner was 
appointed.  He was of the opinion that the property was impartible.  A 
proposal was mooted that the property be put on sale in between the co-
sharers.   Appellant accepted the Commissioner's report.  He however filed 
an application for putting the said suit property on auction sale and for equal 
distribution of the proceeds thereof amongst the co-sharers.  An objection to 
the report of the said Advocate Commissioner was filed by the appellant.  
The court allowed the appellant to appoint an architect at his own cost.  He, 
however, failed to comply with the said order.  A sale proclamation was 
issued.  The appellant expressed his intention to buy the said property at the 
valuation made by the Government Valuer.  A valuation report was filed by 
the appellant on 04.05.2005 against which  Respondent No.1 filed an 
objection.  The appellant was called upon to deposit 2/3rd of the amount 
stated in the valuation report.  He failed to do so.  On or about 21.11.2005, 
he filed an application expressing his willingness to deposit shares of 
Respondent Nos. 1 and 2.   He also sought for permission to deposit an 
amount of Rs.2.5 lakhs.  By an order dated 22.11.2005, the Trial Court held 
that since the property was put on auction sale, the highest bid would be 
treated to be the best price of the suit property and there was no need for 
appointment of any valuer to ascertain the market price  thereof.  Another 
objection was filed by the appellant stating that in view of the facts and 
circumstances of the case,  he  should be allowed to buy the shares of other 
so-sharers.  The said application was rejected by an order dated 14.12.2005.  
By an order dated 15.04.2006, the learned Trial Judge held that it was not 
necessary to initiate a final decree proceeding and the said purported Special 
Darkhast filed by Respondent No.1 was treated to be an application therefor.   
A writ petition filed by the appellant was dismissed by the High Court by 
reason of the impugned order.
</p>
<p id="p_4">	The short question which, inter alia, arises for consideration is as to 
whether the property in suit could be put on auction sale without initiating a 
formal final decree proceeding.                  
</p> 	
<p id="p_5">	"Decree" has been defined in Section 2(2) of the  Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908  to mean :
</p>
<p id="p_6">"Decree" means the formal expression of an adjudication 
which, so far as regards the Court expressing it, 
conclusively determines the rights of the parties with 
regard to all or any of the matters in controversy in the 
suit and may be either preliminary or final, it shall be 
deemed to include the rejection of a plaint and the 
determination of any question within section 144, but 
shall not include 

</p><p id="p_7">(a)	any adjudication from which an appeal lies as an 	
	appeal from an order, or

</p><p id="p_8">(b)	any order of dismissal for default.
</p>
<p id="p_9">Explanation.- A decree is preliminary when further 
proceedings have to be taken before the suit can be 
completely disposed of.  It is final when such 
adjudication completely disposes of the suit.  It may be 
partly preliminary and partly final;"
</p>

<p id="p_10">	We may also notice Section 54 of the Code of Civil Procedure which 
is in the following  terms :
</p>
<p id="p_11">"54. Partition of estate or separation of share.- 
Where the decree is for the partition of an undivided 
estate assessed to the payment of revenue to the 
Government, or for the separate possession of a share of 
such an estate the partition of the estate or the separation 
of the share shall be made by the Collector or any 
gazetted subordinate of the Collector deputed by him in 
this behalf, in accordance with the law (if any) for the 
time being in force relating to the partition, or the 
separate possession of shares, of such estates."
</p>

<p id="p_12">	Order XX of the Code of Civil Procedure provides as to when a 
judgment is said to be pronounced.  Rule 7 thereof provides that a decree 
although prepared at a later date shall relate back to the date of the judgment.  
A Civil Court, in a suit for partition, may pass a preliminary decree in terms 
of Order XX Rule 18 of the Civil Procedure Code, which reads as under :
</p>
<p id="p_13">"18.  Decree in suit for partition of property or separate 
possession of a share therein.-  Where the Court passes a 
decree for the partition of property or for the separate 
possession of a share therein, then, -
</p>
<p id="p_14">(1)	if in so far as the decree relates to an estate 
	assessed to the payment of revenue to the 
	Government, the decree shall declare the rights of 
	the several parties interested in the property, but 
	shall direct such partition or separation to be made 
	by the Collector, or any gazetted subordinate of the 
	Collector deputed by him in this behalf, in 
	accordance with such declaration and with the 
	provisions of section 54.
</p>
<p id="p_15">(2)	if and in so far as such decree relates to any other 
	immoveable property or to movable property, the 
	Court may, if the partition or separation cannot be 
	conveniently made without further inquiry, pass a 
	preliminary decree declaring the rights of the 
	several parties, interested in the property and 
	giving such further directions as may be required."
</p>

<p id="p_16">	Preliminary decree declares the rights and liabilities of the parties.  
However, in a given case a decree may be both preliminary and final.  
</p>
<p id="p_17">	There can be more than one final decrees.  A decree may be partly 
preliminary and partly final. [<a href="/doc/1853173/" id="a_1">See Rachakonda Venkat Rao and Others v. R. 
Satya Bai (Dead</a>) by L.Rs. and Another  (2003) 7 SCC 452] 

	A final decree proceeding may be initiated at any point of time.  No 
limitation is provided therefor.  However, what can be executed is a final 
decree, and not a preliminary decree, unless and until final decree is a part of 
the preliminary decree.  
</p>
<p id="p_18">	Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure, inter alia,  provides that a 
property can be put to sale only in execution of a decree.
</p>
<p id="p_19">	Rules 13 and 14 of Order XXVI, which are also relevant for the 
purpose, read as under :
</p>
<p id="p_20">"13.	Commission to make partition of immovable 
property.- Where a preliminary decree for partition has 
been passed, the Court may, in any case not provided for 
by section 54, issue a commission to such person as it 
thinks fit to make the partition or separation according to 
the rights as declared in such decree.
</p>
<p id="p_21">14.	Procedure of Commissioner.- (1) The  
Commissioner shall, after such inquiry as may be 
necessary, divide the property into as many shares as 
may be directed by the order under which the 
commission was issued, and shall allot such shares to the 
parties, and may, if authorized thereto by the said order, 
award sums to be p-aid for the purpose of equalizing the 
value of the shares.  
</p>
<p id="p_22">	(2) The Commissioner shall then prepare and sign 
a report or the Commissioners (where the commission 
was issued to more than one person and they cannot 
agree) shall prepare and sign separate reports appointing 
the share of each party and distinguishing each share (if 
so directed by the said order) by metes and bounds.  Such 
report or reports shall be annexed to the commission and 
transmitted to the Court; and the Court, after hearing any 
objections which the parties may make to the report or 
reports, shall confirm, vary or set aside the same.
</p>
<p id="p_23">	(3)	Where the Court confirms or varies the 
report it shall pass a decree in accordance with the same 
as confirmed or varied; but where the Court sets aside the 
report or reports it shall either issue a new commission or 
make such other order as it shall think it."   
</p>
<p id="p_24">	The question came up for consideration before this Court in <a href="/doc/68212/" id="a_2">Shankar 
Balwant Lokhande (Dead) v. Chandrakant Shankar Lokhande and Another</a> 
(1995) 3 SCC 413], wherein it was opined :
</p><p id="p_25">"Both the decrees are in the same suit. Final decree 
may be said to become final in two ways: (i) when the 
time for appeal has expired without any appeal being 
filed against the preliminary decree or the matter has 
been decided by the highest court; (ii) when, as regards 
the court passing the decree, the same stands completely 
disposed of. It is in the latter sense the word "decree" is 
used in Section 2(2) of CPC. The ap-pealability of the 
decree will, therefore, not affect its character as a final 
decree. The final decree merely carries into fulfilment the 
preliminary decree."
</p>
<p id="p_26">	Taking note of the fact that a final decree proceeding is required to be 
drawn upon a stamped paper, it was observed :
</p><p id="p_27">	"The crucial question for consideration is as to 
when the limitation begins to run for filing an application 
to pass final decree on stamped papers. There is no direct 
decision of this Court on this point. Therefore, after 
hearing counsel at length, we reserve the judgment in the 
appeal and independently made detailed examination. 
There is divergence of opinion in the High Courts on this 
question."
</p>
<p id="p_28">	We are not oblivious of the fact that a somewhat different view as 
regards period of limitation provided under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_3">Article 136</a> of the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_4">Limitation 
Act</a>, 1963 was taken in <a href="/doc/272195/" id="a_5">W.B. Essential Commodities Supply Corpn. v. 
Swadesh Agro Farming &amp; Storage Pvt. Ltd. and Another</a> [(1999) 8 SCC 
315], wherein, inter alia, it was held that the aforementioned observations do 
not apply to a money decree.
</p>
<p id="p_29">	<a href="/doc/1006829/" id="a_6">In Hameed Joharan (Dead) and Others v. Abdul Salam (Dead</a>) by Lrs. 
and Others [(2001) 7 SCC 573], Shankar Balwant Lokhande (supra)  was 
distinguished, inter alia, stating :              
</p><p id="p_30">"23. Significantly, the contextual facts itself in 
Lokhande's case (supra) has prompted this Court to pass 
the order as it has (noticed above) and as would appear 
from the recording in the order to wit: "Therefore, 
executing court cannot receive the preliminary decree 
unless final decree is passed as envisaged under Order 20 
Rule 18 (2)."
</p><p id="p_31">24. In that view of the matter, reliance on the decision of 
Lokhande's case (supra) by Mr. Mani appearing for the 
appellants herein cannot thus but be said to be totally 
misplaced more so by reason of the fact that the issue 
pertaining to furnishing of stamp paper and subsequent 
engrossment of the final decree thereon did not fall for 
consideration neither the observations contained in the 
judgment could be said to be germane to the issue 
involved therein. The factual score as noticed in 
paragraph 10 of the Report makes the situation clear 
enough to indicate that the Court was not called upon to 
adjudicate the issue as raised presently. The observations 
thus cannot, with due deference to the learned Judge, but 
be termed to be an obiter dictum."
</p>
<p id="p_32">	Yet again in <a href="/doc/748905/" id="a_7">Mool Chand and Others v. Dy. Director, Consolidation 
and Others</a> [(1995) 5 SCC 631], a distinction was drawn between a case 
where an appeal against a preliminary decree was filed and a case where a 
preliminary decree had not been appealed against.  
</p>
<p id="p_33">	Recently in Dr. Chiranji Lal (D) by LRs. v. Hari Das (D) by LRs. 
[(2005) 10 SCC 746], it was held that the period of limitation for execution 
of a partition decree would not be made contingent upon the engrossment of 
the decree on the stamp paper.  
</p>
<p id="p_34">	We have referred to the aforementioned decisions to clear the air in 
relation to one aspect of the matter, namely, although final decree may be 
required to be duly stamped,  or the same may not have anything to do for 
the purpose of computing the period of limitation, the preliminary decree as 
such cannot be  put to  execution.
</p>	   
<p id="p_35">	Although in regard to the period of limitation in execution of the final 
decree proceeding there are somewhat different views, but all decisions of 
this Court clearly state that it is the final decree proceeding which would be 
executable in nature.  Without drawing a final decree proceeding, the court 
could not have put the property on auction sale.  
</p>
<p id="p_36">	It is true that the house property was found  to be an impartible one; 
but a preliminary decree having been passed, the valuation thereof and final 
allotment of the property could have been done only in a final decree 
proceeding.  Only when final allotments were made or a determination is 
made that the property should be put on auction sale, a final decree in 
respect thereof should have been passed.  It is appealable.  Only a final 
decree could be put to execution.  
</p>
<p id="p_37">	A contention was raised that having regard to the conduct of the 
appellant, we should not interfere, but the appellant herein has raised a 
jurisdictional question.  However, the appellant can be put to terms. 
</p>
<p id="p_38">	 The core question is as to whether an order passed by a person 
lacking inherent jurisdiction would be a nullity.  It will be so.  The principles 
of estoppel, waiver and acquiescence or even res judicata which are 
procedural in nature would have no application in a case where an order has 
been passed by the Tribunal/Court which has no authority in that behalf.  
Any order passed by a court without jurisdiction would be coram non judice 
being a nullity, the same ordinarily should not be given effect to.  [<a href="/doc/192869/" id="a_8">See Chief 
Justice of Andhra Pradesh and Another v. L.V.A. Dikshitulu and Others</a> - 
AIR 1979 SC 193 &amp;  <a href="/doc/231673/" id="a_9">MD Army Welfare Housing Organisation v. Sumangal 
Services (P) Ltd</a>. (2004) 8 SCC 619].               
</p>
<p id="p_39">	This aspect of the matter has recently been considered by this Court in 
<a href="/doc/1916513/" id="a_10">Harshad Chiman Lal Modi v. DLF Universal Ltd. and Another</a> [(2005) 7 
SCC 791], in the following terms :
</p><p id="p_40">	"We are unable to uphold the contention. The 
jurisdiction of a court may be classified into several 
categories. The important categories are (i) Territorial or 
local jurisdiction; (ii) Pecuniary jurisdiction; and (iii) 
Jurisdiction over the subject matter. So far as territorial 
and pecuniary jurisdictions are concerned, objection to 
such jurisdiction has to be taken at the earliest possible 
opportunity and in any case at or before settlement of 
issues. The law is well settled on the point that if such 
objection is not taken at the earliest, it cannot be allowed 
to be taken at a subsequent stage. Jurisdiction as to 
subject matter, however, is totally distinct and stands on a 
different footing. Where a court has no jurisdiction over 
the subject matter of the suit by reason of any limitation 
imposed by statute, charter or commission, it cannot take 
up the cause or matter. An order passed by a court having 
no jurisdiction is nullity."
</p><p id="p_41">[See also <a href="/doc/682212/" id="a_11">Zila Sahakari Kendrya Bank Maryadit v. Shahjadi Begum &amp; Ors</a>.  
2006 (9) SCALE 675 and <a href="/doc/26336/" id="a_12">Shahbad Co-op. Sugar Mills Ltd. v. Special 
Secretary to Govt. of Haryana &amp; Ors</a>.  2006 (11) SCALE 674  para 29]

	We may, however hasten  to add that a distinction must be made 
between a decree passed by a court which has no territorial or pecuniary 
jurisdiction in the light of Section 21 of the Code of Civil Procedure; and a 
decree passed by a court having no jurisdiction in regard to the subject 
matter of the suit.  Whereas in the former case, the appellate court may not 
interfere with the decree unless prejudice is shown, ordinarily the second 
category of the cases would be interfered with.
</p>
<p id="p_42">	We are also not oblivious of some decisions of this Court where a 
property that had been put to auction and despite setting aside of the decree, 
the court  had not interfered with. [<a href="/doc/837072/" id="a_13">See  Bombay Dyeing and Mfg. Co. Ltd. 
Ltd. v. Bombay Environmental Action Group and Others</a>  (2006) 3 SCC 459 
 para 329].
</p>
<p id="p_43">	But in this case possession of the property has not been delivered to 
the auction purchaser.
</p>
<p id="p_44">	The suit property is a residential house.  The auction sale was wholly 
illegal.  The auction purchaser can otherwise be compensated on monetary 
terms.
</p>
<p id="p_45">	We, therefore, are of the opinion that in the peculiar facts and 
circumstances of the case,  and with a view to do complete justice to the 
parties, the appellant should be directed to deposit a sum of Rs.18 lakhs 
within four weeks from date before the learned Trial Judge, who shall 
immediately allow Respondent Nos.1 and 2 to withdraw a sum of  Rs.9 
lakhs each towards their shares in the property.  
</p>
<p id="p_46">	The appellant furthermore shall deposit such amount in the court 
within the aforementioned period towards payment of interest by way of 
compensation @ 9% p.a. from the date of deposit till the actual payment is 
made, which would be payable to the auction purchaser, which in our 
opinion is just and reasonable. 
</p>
<p id="p_47">	The principle that such direction can be issued by this Court in 
exercise of its jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_14">Article 142</a> of the Constitution of India 
would appear from a decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1535714/" id="a_15">Kishori Lal v. Sales Officer, 
District Land Development Bank and Ors</a>. [2006 (8) SCALE 521], wherein 
it was directed :
</p>
<p id="p_48">"However, with a view to do complete justice 
between the parties, in our considered opinion, the 
appellant should be directed to deposit the entire auction 
money with interest thereupon @6% per annum.  This 
order is being passed by us under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_16">Article 142</a> of the 
Constitution of India.  Such amount should be deposited 
within eight weeks from this date before respondent 
No.1, Sales Officer.  On such deposit being made, the 
auction shall stand set aside and the possession of the 
property shall be restored to the appellant herein.  
However, in the event the appellant fails and/or neglects 
to deposit the said amount within the aforementioned 
period, these appeals shall stand dismissed."
</p>

<p id="p_49">Following the said decision, herein also we would direct that in the 
event of compliance of the aforementioned directions, the auction shall stand  
set aside and the decree for partition shall stand satisfied.  The appeal is 
allowed subject to the aforementioned observations and directions.   However, 
in the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no order as to costs.
</p>
