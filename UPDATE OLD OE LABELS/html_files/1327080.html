</p><p id="p_5">2.    Appellant is a manufacturer of a product known as `Dabur Red Tooth

Powder' or `Dabur Lal Dant Manjan'. In the year 1993, it had allegedly

adopted a unique colour combination and arrangement of features which

was subsequently changed in December 1999.

</p><p id="p_7">3.    Respondent herein is also said to be manufacturer of a tooth powder

known as `Sujata'.    It is said to have infringed the copy right of the

appellant. A suit was filed by the appellant against the respondent in the

Delhi High Court. Paragraph 7 of the plaint reads thus :


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">            "7. In December 1999, the plaintiff adopted a
            new carton while retaining the conical shape and
            white cap for their product which is described
            hereinbelow :
</blockquote>
<p id="p_8">7 On one column has the words RED TOOTH POWDER
  within a yellow blurb.
</p>
<p id="p_9">7 Immediately below the blurb is an oval shaped picture of a
  family with a yellow background.
</p>
<p id="p_10">7 Above these two features there is a legend within a blurb
  mentioning the fact that this is a new pack.
</p>
<p id="p_11">7 The column immediately next to it contain the same features
  in the Devnagri script.
</p>
<p id="p_12">7 A third column sets out the details including Composition,
  Weight, MRP and Manufacturers Name etc.

7 The top half of the third column contains an oval shaped
  device containing a diagrammatic representation of the
  herbs that constitute the ingredients of Plaintiffs product."



</p><p id="p_13">4.    It was alleged that the said carton constituted an `artistic work' within

the meaning of <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_1">Section 25-C</a> of the Copyright Act, 1957 (the 1957 Act).

Respondent is said to have been using an identical colour scheme lay out,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                       3</span>

arrangement of features and get up as that of the plaintiffs, the essential

features whereof are :
</p>
<p id="p_14">
7    "One column has the words RED TOOTH POWDER within
     a yellow blurb.
</p>
<p id="p_15">7 A column which contains the representation of a family in
  an oval shape picture.
</p>
<p id="p_16">7 There is a similar representation in the Devnagri script in
  another column.
</p>
<p id="p_17">7 The details of the product are set out in another column.

7 Above the details of the product there is advice of a lotus,
  similar to the positioning of the plaintiff's herbs in the
  plaintiff's carton."

              reproducing any of the artistic features thereof in

</blockquote>


<p id="p_20">6.    Respondent filed an application in the suit purported to be under

Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred

to as `the Code') contending that as the defendant is resident of Andhra

Pradesh, the Delhi High Court had no jurisdiction.


</p><p id="p_21">7.    By reason of the impugned judgment and order dated 22.5.2006, a

learned Single Judge of the High Court accepted the said contention of the

respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_22">
</p><p id="p_23">8.    An intra court appeal preferred thereagainst has been dismissed by a

Division Bench of the said Court holding that the matter is covered by the

decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1001948/" id="a_2">Dhodha House v. S.K. Maingi</a>, [(2006) 9 SCC 41].

It was stated :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">              "The learned Single Judge has also held that so far
              as the aforesaid relief relating to passing off is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                    5</span>

             concerned, Delhi court does not have any
             territorial jurisdiction as the respondent/defendant
             is from Andhra Pradesh and there is no
             documentary evidence to show that the respondent
             was selling goods in Delhi. We agree with the
             aforesaid findings and conclusions recorded by the
             learned Single Judge. Accordingly, we find no
             merit in the submissions of the counsel appearing
             for the appellant that the composite suit of
             infringement of copyright and passing off would
             lie in the same forum. We also do not find any
             error in the judgment of the learned Single Judge
             as in our considered opinion so far the relief for
             passing off is concerned, the same is covered by
             the decision of the Supreme Court in Dhodha
             House case."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_24">9.    Mr. Fali S. Nariman, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of

the appellant, submits that the Division Bench of the High Court committed

a serious error in passing the impugned judgment in so far as it failed to take

into consideration the effect of a consolidated suit under the 1957 Act as

also the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_3">Trade Marks Act</a>, 1958 (for short `the 1958 Act'), as would be

evident from the following excerpts of Dhodha House (supra) :


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">             "22. We are not concerned in this case with the
             maintainability of a composite suit both under the
             1957 Act and the 1958 Act. Indisputably, if such a
             situation arises, the same would be permissible;</blockquote><p id="p_25">
</p><p id="p_26">             but the same may not be relevant for the purpose
             of determining the question of a forum where such
             suit can be instituted. Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/999236/" id="a_4">Section
             62</a> of the 1957 Act provides for a non obstante
             clause conferring jurisdiction upon the District
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                       6</span>

Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction,
at the time of the institution of the suit or other
proceeding, the persons instituting the suit or other
proceedings have been residing. In terms of sub-
section (1) of <a href="/doc/999236/" id="a_5">Section 62</a>, suit can be instituted and
the proceedings can be initiated in respect of
matters arising under the said chapter for
infringement of the copyright in any work or the
infringement of any other right conferred
thereunder. It does not confer jurisdiction upon a
District Court where the plaintiff resides, if a
cause of action arises under the 1958 Act.
</p>
<p id="p_27">   XXX                 XXX                 XXX

</p><p id="p_28">43. The short question which arises for
consideration is as to whether causes of action in
terms of both the 1957 Act and the 1958 Act
although may be different, would a suit be
maintainable in a court only because it has the
jurisdiction to entertain the same in terms of
<a href="/doc/762169/" id="a_6">Section 62(2)</a> of the 1957 Act?
</p>
<p id="p_29">44. A cause of action in a given case both under
the 1957 Act as also under the 1958 Act may be
overlapping to some extent. The territorial
jurisdiction conferred upon the court in terms of
the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure
indisputably shall apply to a suit or proceeding
under the 1957 Act as also the 1958 Act. Sub-
</p><p id="p_30">section (2) of <a href="/doc/999236/" id="a_7">Section 62</a> of the 1957 Act provides
for an additional forum. Such additional forum
was provided so as to enable the author to file a
suit who may not otherwise be in a position to file
a suit at different places where his copyright was
violated. Parliament while enacting the Trade and
<a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_8">Merchandise Marks Act</a> in the year 1958 was
aware of the provisions of the 1957 Act. It still did
not choose to make a similar provision therein.
Such an omission may be held to be a conscious
action on the part of Parliament. The intention of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                   7</span>

            Parliament in not providing for an additional
            forum in relation to the violation of the 1958 Act
            is, therefore, clear and explicit. Parliament while
            enacting the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_9">Trade Marks Act</a>, 1999 provided for
            such an additional forum by enacting sub-section
            (2) of <a href="/doc/969470/" id="a_10">Section 134</a> of the Trade Marks Act. The
            court shall not, it is well settled, readily presume
            the existence of jurisdiction of a court which was
            not conferred by the statute. For the purpose of
            attracting the jurisdiction of a court in terms of
            sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1987046/" id="a_11">Section 62</a> of the 1957 Act, the
            conditions precedent specified therein must be
            fulfilled, the requisites wherefor are that the
            plaintiff must actually and voluntarily reside to
            carry on business or personally work for gain."



</p><p id="p_31">10.   Learned counsel would contend that the jurisdiction of the court to

entertain a composite suit under the 1957 Act and the 1958 Act should be

determined having regard to the provisions of <a href="/doc/1974917/" id="a_12">Section 55</a> of the former.

Then term `Law' within the meaning of the said provision, it was submitted,

would not only include a statute law but also the common law and, thus,

viewed from that perspective a composite suit for infringement of a

copyright as also passing of shall be maintainable. Strong reliance in this

behalf has also been placed on <a href="/doc/474885/" id="a_13">Exphar Sa &amp; Anr. v. Eupharma Laboratories

Ltd. &amp; Anr</a>. [(2004) 3 SCC 688].
</p>
<p id="p_32">11.   Mr. Shailen Bhatia, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the

respondent, on the other hand, would submit that this Court in Dhondha
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                      8</span>

House (supra) categorically held that the cause of action for infringement of

the 1957 Act and that of the 1958 Act are distinct and separate.


</p><p id="p_33">12.   Order II Rule 3 of the Code, it was submitted, deals with pecuniary

jurisdiction and not the territorial jurisdiction of the Court.


</p><p id="p_34">      Drawing our attention to the provisions contained in <a href="/doc/969470/" id="a_14">Section 134</a> of

the Trade Marks Act, 1999, the learned counsel would contend that in

relation to a passing off the action, even the Parliament did not think it

expedient that any provision giving an option to the plaintiff to file a suit

where it resides and not the defendant.

            and the second under the Act of 1958 in a situation
            where this court has the jurisdiction in so far as
            cause of action under the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_28">Copyright Act</a> is
            concerned but has no territorial jurisdiction to
            entertain the cause of action relating to Act of
            1958."

<blockquote id="blockquote_23">16.   Noticing the provisions of Order II Rule 2 and 3 of the Code of Civil

it was opined that the said provisions relate to pecuniary jurisdiction. The

<p id="p_48">17.   The learned Single Judge noticed some precedents and opined :-


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_24">             "13. Normally, I would have felt myself bound
             by the aforesaid two judgments which are not only
             of this court but relate to same subject matter,
             namely, joining of two causes of action under
             trademark and copyright law. Even if I hold
             different opinion, the normal course of action
             would have been to refer the matter to the Division
             Bench. However, this is not necessary in the
             instant case in view of the fact that the controversy
             now stands settled by the Supreme Court in
             Dhodha House (supra)."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_49">18.   The Division Bench of the High Court on the other hand while

holding that the High Court has jurisdiction to adjudicate and decide upon

the relief of infringement of copyright observed that it would be open to the

appellant to file a fresh suit in the court of competent jurisdiction in respect

of its action for passing off and thus the plaint is required to be returned for

filing in the court of competent jurisdiction only in relation thereto.


</p><p id="p_50">19.   In Dhodha House (supra) this Court was concerned with the

correctness of judgments of the Allahabad High Court in <a href="/doc/429431/" id="a_29">Surendra Kumar
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                     14</span>

of the Delhi High Court in : <a href="/doc/1274722/" id="a_30">P.M. Diesels Ltd. v. M/s. Patel Field Marshal</a>,

[ AIR 1998 Delhi 225 ]


</p><p id="p_51">20.   It was clearly held that a judgment passed by a court having no

territorial jurisdiction is a nullity. As regards the cause of action under the

1957 Act and a cause of action under the 1958 Act and or a passing off

action, it was held that sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1987046/" id="a_31">Section 62</a> would confer

jurisdiction on a court where the plaintiff resides. The cause of action in

respect of others was stated to be where the defendant resides.


</p><p id="p_52">      It was also noticed that in a given case the petition under the 1957

Act or 1958 Act may be overlapping, holding :-


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_25">             "44. The territorial jurisdiction conferred upon
             the court in terms of the provisions of the Code of
             Civil Procedure indisputably shall apply to a suit
             or proceeding under the 1957 Act as also the 1958
             Act. Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1987046/" id="a_32">Section 62</a> of the 1957 Act
             provides for an additional forum. Such additional
             forum was provided so as to enable the author to
             file a suit who may not otherwise be in a position
             to file a suit at different places where his copyright
             was violated. Parliament while enacting the Trade
             and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_33">Merchandise Marks Act</a> in the year 1958 was
             aware of the provisions of the 1957 Act. It still did
             not choose to make a similar provision therein.
             Such an omission may be held to be a conscious
             action on the part of Parliament. The intention of
             Parliament in not providing for an additional
             forum in relation to the violation of the 1958 Act
             is, therefore, clear and explicit."
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                   15</span>

<p id="p_53">21.   Noticing that whereas in Dhoda House (supra) the infringement

complained of primarily was that of 1958 Act and not under the 1957 Act,

in Patel Field Marshal (supra) the thrust was on the sale of products and/or

advertisement by the appellant for registration of trade marks in the Trade

Marks Journal and other local papers.
</p>
<p id="p_54">
</p><p id="p_55">      The law was stated in the following terms :-

<p id="p_56">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_26">            "54. For the purpose of invoking the jurisdiction
            of a court only because two causes of action joined
            in terms of the provisions of the Code of Civil
            Procedure, the same would not mean that thereby
            the jurisdiction can be conferred upon a court
            which had jurisdiction to try only the suit in
            respect of one cause of action and not the other.
            Recourse to the additional forum, however, in a
            given case, may be taken if both the causes of
            action arise within the jurisdiction of the court
            which otherwise had the necessary jurisdiction to
            decide all the issues."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_57">22.   What would, however, be the nature of composite suit, was also be

taken note of. The Court observed :-
</p>
<p id="p_58">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_27">            "55. In this case we have not examined the
            question as to whether if a cause of action arises
            under the 1957 Act and the violation of the
            provisions of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_34">Trade Marks Act</a> is only
            incidental, a composite suit will lie or not, as such
            a question does not arise in this case."</blockquote><p id="p_59">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                   16</span>

</p><p id="p_60">      It is in the aforementioned context, submission of Mr. Nariman that a

composite suit would be maintainable having regard to sub-section (1) of

<a href="/doc/1974917/" id="a_35">Section 55</a> of the 1957 Act must be considered.


</p><p id="p_61">23.   Sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1974917/" id="a_36">Section 55</a> of 1957 Act provides for the remedies

in terms whereof the plaintiff shall be entitled to all reliefs by way of

injunction, damages, accounts and otherwise as are or may be conferred by

law for the infringement of a right. It must be read as `ejusdem generis'. It

must take its colour from the words, `any proceeding' namely the right to

obtain a decree by way of injunction, decree for damages, accounts or other

incidental reliefs which can be granted by a civil court. Such a provision

can be found in the Code of Civil Procedure also, namely Order VII Rule 7

thereof. It is, therefore, in our opinion, would not be correct to read the

word "as are or may be conferred by law" to mean, any other law, violation

whereof although would give rise to separate and distinct cause of action.

Under the Code claims arising under a statutes governing substantive or

procedural law, a number of remedies may be combined. The Court may

grant an order of injunction even in a passing off action. It is trite that

where the court has the jurisdiction/power to adjudicate, it will necessarily

have the incidental power therefor. It may, however, be different if the

Court may have exercised a power which is not provided for as a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                    17</span>

supplemental proceeding e.g. Section 94 of the Code. {[<a href="/doc/39828/" id="a_37">See State of Punjab

and Anr. v. Devans Modern Brewaries Ltd. and Anr</a> [(2004) 11 SCC 26]}.


</p><p id="p_62">24.   Thus, whereas an incidental power is inherent in the court, a

supplemental power may also be exercised, keeping in view the ultimate

relief which may be granted by it. We may notice that this Court in <a href="/doc/1836621/" id="a_38">Sakiri

Vasu v. State of U.P. and others</a>, [ (2008) 2 SCC 409 ] held that the

Magistrate will have power to grant interim maintenance, although no such

provision existed in <a href="/doc/1056396/" id="a_39">Section 125</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.

</p><p id="p_63">      Similarly in <a href="/doc/1353651/" id="a_40">Hindustan Lever Ltd. v. Ashok Vishnu Kate</a>, [ (1995) 6

SCC 326 ] this Court has held that the Labour Court will have the power to

grant injunction as an incidental power.
</p>
<p id="p_64">
</p><p id="p_65">25.   If a person is found to be guilty of violation of copyright he will be

bound to pay damages. For the purpose of quantification of damages,

taking of the accounts may be necessary and it is in this behalf the

Parliament thought it fit to use the word "otherwise". Thus the power

conferred by law within the meaning of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1974917/" id="a_41">Section 55</a> of

1957 Act qualifies the power of the court to grant remedies as envisaged

thereunder if any other cause of action arose under a different Act. An

action for passing off is common law right but the same does not determine
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                    18</span>

the jurisdiction of the court. For exercising such jurisdiction, the provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_42">

of the Code</a> would be applicable. 1957 Act being a special law would, thus,

prevail over the general law, viz.,<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_43"> the Code</a>.


</p><p id="p_66">26.   Exphar Sa (supra) cannot be said to have any application in the

instant case. The question which arose for consideration therein was as to

whether the jurisdiction of a court under sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1987046/" id="a_44">Section 62</a> of the

1957 Act is wider than that of the court specified under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_45"> the Code</a> of Civil

Procedure and thus a person instituting a suit having any claim on the

ownership of the copy right which has been infringed, would not be a

ground for holding that he would not come within the purview of sub-

section (2) <a href="/doc/1987046/" id="a_46">Section 62</a> of the 1957 Act, as he had been served with a `cease

and desist' notice, opining :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_28">             "13. It is, therefore, clear that the object and
             reason for the introduction of sub-section (2) of
             <a href="/doc/1987046/" id="a_47">Section 62</a> was not to restrict the owners of the
             copyright to exercise their rights but to remove
             any impediment from their doing so. <a href="/doc/1987046/" id="a_48">Section 62(2)</a>
             cannot be read as limiting the jurisdiction of the
             District Court only to cases where the person
             instituting the suit or other proceeding, or where
             there are more than one such persons, any of them
             actually and voluntarily resides or carries on
             business or presently works for gain. It prescribes
             an additional ground for attracting the jurisdiction
             of a court over and above the "normal" grounds as
             laid down in <a href="/doc/1670661/" id="a_49">Section 20</a> of the Code."

<p id="p_67">27.   There cannot be any doubt whatsoever that the Parliament having

inserted sub-section (2) in <a href="/doc/1987046/" id="a_50">Section 62</a> of the 1957 Act, the jurisdiction of the

Court thereunder would be wider than the one under <a href="/doc/1670661/" id="a_51">Section 20</a> of the Code.

The object and reasons for enactment of sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1987046/" id="a_52">Section 62</a> would

also appear from the report of the Committee, as has been noticed by this

Court being a provision which has been specially designed to confer an

extra benefit upon the authors who were not in a position to instate

copyright infringement proceeding before the Courts.            It is in the

aforementioned context the law laid down by this Court in paragraph 13 of

Dhonda House (Supra) must be understood.
</p>
<p id="p_68">

</p><p id="p_69">28.   If the impediment is sought to be removed by inserting an incidental

provision, there cannot be any doubt the court could be entitled to pass an

interim order, but the same by no stretch of imagination can be extended to

a cause of action which is founded on separate set of facts as also rights and

liabilities of a party under, a different Act. In Dhoda House (supra),

although Exphar Sa (supra) was not noticed, the distinction would be

apparent from the following :-

<p id="p_71">29.   What then would be meant by a composite suit? A composite suit

would not entitle a court to entertain a suit in respect whereof it has no

jurisdiction, territorial or otherwise.    Order II Rule 3<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_54"> of the Code</a>

specifically states so and, thus, there is no reason as to why the same should

be ignored. A composite suit within the provisions of the 1957 Act as

considered in Dhoda House (supra), therefore, would mean the suit which is

founded on infringement of a copy right and wherein the incidental power

of the Court is required to be invoked. A plaintiff may seek a remedy which

can otherwise be granted by the court. It was that aspect of the matter

which had not been considered in Dhoda House (supra) but it never meant

that two suits having different causes of actions can be clubbed together as a

composite suit.
