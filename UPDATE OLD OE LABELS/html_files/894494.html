<p id="p_2">	These appeals by the Revenue are directed against the common 
judgment passed by the Customs Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate 
Tribunal, West Regional Bench, Mumbai (in short the 'CEGAT').  By the 
impugned judgment the CEGAT  set aside the imposition of duty, 
redemption fine, interest and penalty levied under the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_1">Customs Act</a>, 
1967 (in short the 'Act') levied/imposed on respondent no.1 M/s Essar 
Oil Limited (hereinafter referred to as the 'assessee'), its officers 
(Respondents nos. 2 to 4) and officials of the Customs Department 
(Respondent nos. 5 to 7).  
</p>
<p id="p_3">	Backgrounds facts as projected by the appellant are as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_4">	Sometime during 1997 respondent no.1 imported plants and 
machineries worth Rupees 600 crores for its refinery project. These 
imported goods were stored in private bonded warehouses, one of which 
is closed. The licences for the warehouses were valid upto 24.11.1999.  
General bond of Rs.120 crores was executed by respondent no.1 under 
<a href="/doc/845682/" id="a_2">Section 59(2)</a> of the Act to secure payment of customs duty.  Between 18 
and 23.2.1999 respondent no.1 submitted 84 ex-bonds bills of entry 
which were assessed to customs duty at the prevalent rate and 
corresponding TR-6 Challans for payment of duty were handed over to the 
assessee. 
</p>
<p id="p_5">On 24.2.1999 assessee-respondent no.1 wrote to ICICI Ltd. stating 
that there was possibility of imposition of duty on refinery goods and 
requested them to immediately release funds to avoid project cost over-
run. On the same day inter office memo was issued by Shri S.R. Aggarwal 
(respondent no.2) to Shri P.R. Ashok (respondent no.3) stating that 
ICICI Ltd. had indicated their desire to disburse a sum of Rs.100 
crores so that the Countervailing Duty (in short 'CVD') amount to be 
paid before pronouncement of the Union Budget, 1999. The memo pointed 
out that the necessary documentation was in process and remittance of 
the funds by telegraphic transfer to the State Bank of India (SB) 
Jamnagar would be done immediately thereafter. Respondent no.3 was 
requested to complete the paperwork with customs authorities. 
</p>
<p id="p_6">On 25.2.1999 respondent no.3 wrote a letter to the Superintendent 
of Central Excise Bonded Warehouse, Jamnagar, requesting him to pass 
necessary order for "out of charge" for the goods concerned. This 
letter is of considerable importance in the present dispute.  This 
letter has to be considered along with letter of same date (i.e. 
25.2.1999) written by respondent no.3 to Assistant Chief Accounts 
Officer (Excise &amp; Customs) Rajkot. The controversy in the present 
matter basically revolved round this document. In the first letter 
reference was made to the challans issued for payment of duty on the 
bonded goods and the original acknowledgement of the Assistant Chief 
Accounts Officer towards payment of customs duty with applicable 
interest.  The details of goods with relevant challans were also 
enclosed.  The payment was made by cheque no.1175298 dated 25.2.1999 
for Rs.60,03,85,603 in favour of Assistant Chief Accounts Officer 
SBECNC in line with the trade notice no.73/85, copy of which was 
enclosed.  It was indicated that action was being taken as per 
direction of Assistant Commissioner (Technical) at Rajkot. It was 
further indicated that the payment had to be made at Rajkot office due 
to banks strike.  In the letter dated 25.2.1999 addressed to the Chief 
Accounts Officer, Excise and Customs, Rajkot, it was indicated that due 
to banks strike on that day they were depositing the customs duty on 
the goods at the regular bank. Therefore, they had enclosed cheque 
no.1175298 dated 25.2.1999.  A declaration was made that respondent 
no.1 had "sufficient bank balance" in its account in State Bank of 
Saurashtra, Jamnagar on whom the cheque was drawn and same shall be 
honored and cleared by the bankers "as and when presented by the 
concerned office". On 25.2.1999 the application was endorsed for 
acceptance by the Assistant Commissioner and were accepted and 
processed.  Consequently, the warehousing licence was cancelled on the 
strength of the cheque payment though the goods were not physically 
moved from the warehouse.  
</p>
<p id="p_7">	After the banks strike was over, the cheque was deposited for 
collection at the Rajkot, on 27.2.1999. On the same day at the close of 
office hour the rate of customs duty was enhanced from nil basic duty 
to 5% on the Union Budget.  
</p>
<p id="p_8">	On 1.3.1999 respondent no.1 wrote to his bank that they were 
arranging for transfer of funds from Mumbai by 2.3.1999. As the funds 
were not received in the revenue accounts, respondent no.1's banker at 
Saurathtra prepared an inter office memo advising appellant's bank at 
Rajkot that the cheque issued by respondent no.1 had been returned 
unpaid.  However, the memo was not sent to the bank, as  respondent 
no.1 wrote several letters to their banks at Jamnagar requesting that 
cheque be withheld till funds were arranged by them. On 16.3.1999 
finally respondent no.1 arranged funds to cover the cheque amount which 
was honored and credited to the Government's account on 17.3.1999.  
</p>
<p id="p_9">	Investigations were carried out by various governmental agencies 
and respondents 2 to 4 were arrested on 6.5.1999.  Their bail 
application was rejected by concerned magistrate.  On 17.5.1999 the 
Gujarat High Court granted bail to them on the unconditional 
undertaking by their counsel appearing before the High Court that the 
amount of enhanced customs duty will be paid in three instalments by 
31st July, 1999.  On 22.8.1999 a show-cause notice was issued to the 
respondent no.1-assessee proposing to levy duty on the imported goods 
under <a href="/doc/1586620/" id="a_3">Section 15(1)(c)</a> of the Act.  It was alleged that fraud was 
practised by respondent no.1 in connivance with the other respondents 
and an attempt was made to defraud revenue and evade duty. Reference 
was made to the background facts as highlighted above. It was also 
pointed out that Mr. J.K. Singh, Director of the respondent no.1-
company stated that there was no requisition for imported goods in 
February, 1999. Statement of respondent no.2 recorded on 5.5.1999 
showed that funds were expected to be arranged, respondent no.1 decided 
to make payment by cheque. Respondent no.2 admitted that discussions 
were held with ICICI Ltd. on 3.2.1999. Funds were not provided by the 
said financial institution and ultimately the funds were arranged from 
the Punjab National Bank. Statements of Nitin Bhatt and P.R. Ashok i.e. 
respondent nos. 4 and 3 respectively were recorded which, inter alia, 
indicated that respondent no.1 wanted to avoid any adverse impact of 
the budget.  Investigation further revealed that sufficient fund was 
not there in respondent no.1's account till evening of 24.2.1999. False 
declaration was made regarding sufficiency of funds on 25.2.1999.  
Investigation also revealed that one of the departmental officials i.e. 
respondent no.6 A.K. Thaker had manipulated dates and instead of the 
actual date of 26.2.1999, he had indicated that the action was taken on 
25.2.1999. Statement of Shri L. Ghosh, Chief Manager of State Bank of 
Saurashtra at Jamnagar indicated that the cheque as issued by 
respondent no.1 was intended to be returned to the clearing bank at 
Rajkot and telephonic information to this effect was given to the Chief 
Manager of the bank at Rajkot. A written notice was prepared.  The same 
was not sent at the request of respondent no.1 and contrary to the 
established practice and procedure of the bank and governing 
regulations cheque was not dishonored. The instructions of State Bank 
of Saurashtra Manual, inter alia, provides and requires that non-
payment of clean demand bill must be advised to the purchasing office 
and advice must be sent by telegram.  The advice is to be sent not 
later than the close of the day following the close of the day 
following the presentation of the Bill.  A departure was made in the 
present case.  The concerned Bank was requested not to dishonour the 
cheque.  As late as on 3rd March, 1999 oral information was given to 
Customs officials about non-availability of funds.  Thereafter on 
several dates the assessee requested the Banks to delay action at their 
ends.  The trade notice referring to which letter was written to accept 
cheque was not applicable to the Banks strike as the same was a pre-
notified strike and was for two days. 
</p><p id="p_10"> 	Statement of Mr. Rak Hashiya, of State Bank of Saurashtra, Rajkot 
was to the effect that normal procedure was to return the cheque on the 
day it is presented if the funds were not there. His further statement 
was to the effect that he had advised N.C. Goplani that the cheque may 
be retained for two to three days only after both the customs 
authorities and the respondent no.1 give consent letter, failing which 
the cheque was to be returned.  He was informed on 5.3.1999 that there 
was no written consent of the customs authorities. The show cause 
notice referred to the correspondences between respondent no.1 and the 
bankers. It was alleged that the undertaking in the letter of 
respondent no.1 dated 25.2.1994 clearly shows fraudulent attempt to 
misuse the bonafide facilities given in terms of trade notice as the 
respondent no.1 was fully aware that they had not received the funds at 
Jamnagar.  After referring to the various aspects the investigating 
authority came to conclude that the duty rate on February 1999 was 
effectively nil and hence any variation could only be upwards. Though 
no funds were transferred to the respondent's bank in the evening of 
24.2.1999, a letter was issued containing clear mention about 
availability of funds.  The accusations in essence were that there was 
deliberate mis-declaration to ensure evasion from rate changes. Since 
the rate of duty was enhanced prior to encashment of cheque, there was 
liability to pay enhanced rate of duty.  The clearance of goods was 
effected without payment of appropriate duty.  There was no requirement 
of the imported goods by respondent no.1 which created a fiction of 
deemed duty payment and deemed removal, with the full knowledge that 
there was non-availability of funds. There was no scope of clearance in 
terms of <a href="/doc/848370/" id="a_4">Section 68</a> in the absence of duty being paid. The cancellation 
of warehousing licence was obtained by fraud as duty had not been 
deposited. Hence duty payable is covered under <a href="/doc/382790/" id="a_5">Section 16(1)(c)</a> of the 
Act.  Action was taken against the customs officials i.e. respondent 
nos. 5 to 7 for their alleged abatement in the action and the act of 
collusion as established by manipulation of records. They had done or 
omitted to do acts which acts or omissions rendered the goods liable 
for confiscation. Accordingly, respondent no.1 was required to show 
cause as to why goods removed contrary to terms of the permission for 
such removal should not be confiscated under <a href="/doc/453010/" id="a_6">Section 111(j)</a>, and since 
goods were removed on cancellation of licence based on false 
declaration without payment of duty at the rate prevalent on 17.3.1999, 
duty shall not be demanded and it was proposed in addition, to levy 
penalty on respondents 2 to 7 and interest on respondent no.1.  
The Commissioner framed six issues.  They are as follows:
</p><p id="p_11">(i)	Whether duty could be treated to have been paid on the 
25th February, 1999 (the date of presentation of the 
cheques by M/s. EOL) in the facts and circumstances of 
the case;
</p><p id="p_12">(ii)	The date for determination of rate of duty, and whether 
the Warehouse License could be treated as cancelled as 
detailed in the impugned show cause notice;
</p><p id="p_13">(iii)	Whether the charge of evasion of duty by malafide intent 
of wilful misdeclaration, suppression of facts with an 
intent to evade the payment of duty, etc. as alleged in 
the show cause notice is established;
</p><p id="p_14">(iv)	Whether the goods are liable to confiscation under 
<a href="/doc/453010/" id="a_7">Section 111(j)</a> of the Customs Act, 1962;
</p><p id="p_15">(v)	To determine the appropriate penal clause invokable 
whether penalty against the noticee M/s. EOL is leviable 
under Section 114 A or <a href="/doc/423482/" id="a_8">Section 112(a)</a>/(b) of the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_9">Customs 
Act</a>, 1962;
</p><p id="p_16">(vi)	The extent of involvement of the individual persons vis-
`-vis evidence on record to sustain the charge of 
collusion on the part of the employees of notice viz. 
M/s. EOL and the officers of the department as detailed 
in the show cause notice.      
</p><p id="p_17">After considering show-cause reply filed by respondent no.1 the 
Commissioner Customs House, Kandla (in short 'Commissioner') confirmed 
the demand of duty and also directed confiscation of goods and 
imposition of penalty.  It is to be noted that respondent no.1, inter 
alia, contended that there was no certainty that the rate of duty will 
be enhanced and that they acted under a bona fide belief that the funds 
would be available on 25.2.1996. They also claimed bona fide error of 
judgment and lack of collusion with officers.  The stand was not 
accepted by the Commissioner. Appeals were filed before CEGAT by the 
present respondent.  
</p><p id="p_18">So far as Issue no.1 is concerned, the Commissioner held that the 
duty could not be treated as paid on 25.2.1999 in view of the mis-
declaration about availability of funds.  The fact that funds were not 
available was not disclosed till 3.3.1999, even though concerned 
respondents had definite and specific knowledge.  Commissioner relief 
upon Banks' specific instructions regarding return of cheques in case 
of non-availability of funds.  Reference was made to the cheque 
dishonour memo which was prepared but not issued due to request of the 
assessee.  It was concluded that had the assessee correctly disclosed 
the facts, the application dated 25.2.1999 would not have been 
accepted.
</p><p id="p_19">The CEGAT on the Issue no.1 observed that Commissioner failed to 
notice about non-applicability of Trade Notice.  It was held that there 
was finding recorded that facility of cheque payment was not available 
because of false declaration.  It was concluded that duty was paid on 
25.2.1999 since payment of cheque relates back to the presentation and 
the cheque was not dishonored.  
</p><p id="p_20">With regard to Issue no.2, it was observed by the Commissioner 
that cancellation of warehousing license was obtained by fraud.  
Reference was made to the undertaking given before the High Court 
accepting liability to pay duty.  Consequently it was held that there 
was no cancellation under <a href="/doc/848370/" id="a_10">Section 68</a>. Therefore, provisions of <a href="/doc/1586620/" id="a_11">Section 
15(1)(c)</a> were applicable. 
</p><p id="p_21">CEGAT held that as duty shall be treated to have been paid on 
25.2.1999, requirements of <a href="/doc/848370/" id="a_12">Section 68</a> were complied with and, 
therefore, <a href="/doc/887126/" id="a_13">Section 15(1)(b)</a> and not <a href="/doc/1586620/" id="a_14">Section 15(1)(c)</a> was applicable.
As regards Issue no.3, Commissioner held that charge of evasion 
of duty by mala fide intent, wilful mis-declaration, suppression of 
facts was clearly established.  
</p><p id="p_22">CEGAT held that there was no willful mis-declaration, no evasion 
or short levy.  The declaration was held to have been made under bona 
fide belief.
</p><p id="p_23">Answering Issue no.4, Commissioner held that goods were liable 
for confiscation under <a href="/doc/453010/" id="a_15">Section 111(j)</a> as deemed removal was contrary to 
the permission and fraudulent intention was clearly established.  
However, redemption fine of Rs.20 crores was imposed.
CEGAT held that there could not be any confiscation as goods had 
been cleared under a permission.
</p><p id="p_24">As regards applicability of <a href="/doc/78507072/" id="a_16">Section 114A</a>, under Issue no.5, it 
was held said provision was not invokable.  However, penalty of Rs.10 
crores was imposed under <a href="/doc/186203/" id="a_17">Section 112(b)</a>.
</p><p id="p_25">Commissioner held that respondents 2 to 7 were involved in the 
fraud, in answering Issue no.6.  They were held liable to penalty under 
<a href="/doc/423482/" id="a_18">Section 112(a)</a>.
</p><p id="p_26">CEGAT set aside the penalties holding that respondent nos.2 to 7 
had not committed any breach.                       
</p><p id="p_27">So far as Issue no.3 is concerned, in view of the operative 
portion of the order of the Commissioner was to the effect that the 
goods valued at Rs.599,26,00046 was to be confiscated under <a href="/doc/453010/" id="a_19">Section 
111(j)</a> of the Act as the imported goods except good worth Rs.73.93 
crores which were covered by corporate guarantee. Redemption fine of 
Rs.20 crores in view of confiscation was imposed. Total demand of 
Rs.96,26,91.711/- was confirmed under <a href="/doc/1512876/" id="a_20">Section 28(1)</a> proviso of the Act 
as also in terms of statement made on behalf of respondent no.1 before 
the Gujarat High Court on 17.5.1999.  The duty was worked out on the 
basis of computation in the show cause notice.  Penalty of rupees ten 
crores was imposed on respondent no.1 under <a href="/doc/186203/" id="a_21">Section 112(b)</a> of the Act.  
Penalty of rupees one crore was levied on respondent no.2 under <a href="/doc/423482/" id="a_22">Section 
112(a)</a>. Penalty of rupees 25 lakhs and rupees 10 lakhs was imposed on 
respondents 3 and 4 respectively under <a href="/doc/423482/" id="a_23">Section 112(a)</a> of the Act. 
Penalty of rupees 5 lakhs was imposed on Shri A.C. Sharma, Deputy 
Commissioner of Central Excise. Rupees 50,000/- and rupees 25,000/- 
were imposed as penalty respectively on customs officials i.e. S.P. 
Chaudhary and Shri K.N. Thakar under <a href="/doc/423482/" id="a_24">Section 112(a)</a> of the Act.  
Recovery of interest leviable under <a href="/doc/1494980/" id="a_25">Section 17(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/59975067/" id="a_26">Section 28AB</a> of 
the Act was directed. Direction was given that deposits made towards 
duty were to be adjusted against duty and interest liability as 
determined. As noted above appeals were filed before CEGAT by the 
present respondents.  Their basic stand was that <a href="/doc/1586620/" id="a_27">Section 15(1)(c)</a> had 
no application and it was <a href="/doc/887126/" id="a_28">Section 15(1)(b)</a> of the Act which applied.  
It was submitted that when the cheque has been cleared and honored 
payment had to be treated to have been made on the date on which the 
cheque was handed over to the authority. There was no fraudulent 
intention involved.  Respondent no.1 and its officials acted bona fide 
on the assurance given by ICICI Ltd. Negotiations for funds were going 
on since long. Therefore, the order of the Commissioner is not tenable.  
</p>
<p id="p_28">The revenue supported the order of the Commissioner.  As noted 
above CEGAT held that the Commissioner had not recorded any finding 
regarding non-applicability of the trade notice. There was no findings 
recorded by the Commissioner that the cheque payment facility was not 
available because of false declaration. The Commissioner only decided 
the issue as to what constitutes the date of payment. Since the cheque 
was honored it was to be held that date of payment was on 25.2.1999 
though, in fact, it was cleared on 17.3.1999. Requirements of <a href="/doc/549400/" id="a_29">Section 
58</a> were complied with and, therefore, <a href="/doc/887126/" id="a_30">Section 15(1)(b)</a> was applicable 
and not <a href="/doc/1586620/" id="a_31">Section 15(1)(c)</a> as held by the Commissioner. There was no 
willful declaration and the declaration about availability of funds was 
made under bona fide belief.  The direction regarding confiscation was 
set aside.  The penalties on respondent no.1 and its officials and the 
customs officials were set aside. It is to be noted that the Tribunal 
referred to Rules 79 and 80 of the Central Treasury Rules (in short 
'Treasury Rules') to conclude that when the cheque is honored is the 
date on which cheque was received by the concerned authorities is the 
date of payment.  
</p>
<p id="p_29">In support of the appeals learned Additional Solicitor General 
submitted that the Tribunal has lightly brushed aside the various 
points which had been taken note of by the Commissioner.  Whether the 
date to be reckoned is the date of receipt of cheque by the department 
though it is cleared subsequently is really of no consequence in view 
of the fact that fraudulent mis-declaration was made about availability 
of funds, with the clear knowledge that funds were not available. Any 
act based on fraud vitiates the entire action taken.  The CEGAT also 
failed to notice that the intention of respondent no.1 and its 
officials is clearly borne out from the fact that they managed to 
obtain declaration from respondent no.6 as if the documents were 
cleared on 25.2.1999, when the statements of the concerned witnesses 
clearly show that it was done on 26.2.1999.  The proved manipulation of 
records further strengthened the department's view. It was pointed out 
that relevant factual aspects placed by the department before the CEGAT 
had not been considered. On the other hand it recorded some findings 
which were based on conjectures and/or surmises. The effect of 
fraudulent action and the mis-declaration were not considered. On the 
contrary it was observed that there was no mis-declaration and a bona 
fide mistake had been committed because of the assurance given by the 
financial institutions for providing funds. The established position is 
of manipulation of records to show as if action was taken on 25.2.1999, 
when in reality the action was taken on 26.2.1999.  It not only kept 
out of consideration the fact that without sufficient funds cheque was 
given to the customs officials, but also gave a clean chit to the 
officials on purported ground of absence of practice prevailing in the 
division. It was, argued that the Tribunal's judgment suffers from non-
consideration of relevant materials, consideration of irrelevant 
materials and recording of findings contrary to the materials on record 
both on issue of fact and law.  
</p><p id="p_30">In response, Mr. Dushyant Dave, learned senior counsel appearing 
for respondent no.1 submitted that the declaration, if any, made about 
availability of funds was really not relevant in view of the Act, more 
particularly, <a href="/doc/354004/" id="a_32">Sections 17</a>, <a href="/doc/1982368/" id="a_33">46</a>, <a href="/doc/549400/" id="a_34">58</a> and <a href="/doc/819298/" id="a_35">55</a>. With reference to sub-section 
(2) of <a href="/doc/657135/" id="a_36">Section 47</a> it was submitted that consequences for non-payment 
under <a href="/doc/1982368/" id="a_37">Section 46</a> were laid down. <a href="/doc/276544/" id="a_38">Section 72</a> deals with the situation 
when the importer is unable to pay and consequentially interest becomes 
chargeable.  This made the position clear that only consequence of non-
payment of duty in time is levy of interest.         
</p><p id="p_31">The show cause notice itself indicated that the goods were 
removed on 25.2.1999. There was no wilful mis-declaration. There was a 
special procedure available when the banks were on strike. Rule 
79(1)(b) of the Treasury Rules clearly indicate the date which is to be 
reckoned for ascertaining the date on which amount is treated to be 
paid.  The mis-declaration aspect is relevant only for the purpose of 
<a href="/doc/440814/" id="a_39">Section 28</a> and for considering whether extended period of limitation 
applies.  That issue is not relevant in the present case and only issue 
is whether <a href="/doc/887126/" id="a_40">Section 15(1)(b)</a> or <a href="/doc/1586620/" id="a_41">Section 15(1)(c)</a> is applicable. A 
factual finding has been arrived at by CEGAT to hold that there was no 
wilful mis-declaration.
</p><p id="p_32">Residually it was submitted that for any unintentional breach 
penalty is not to be levied. The view of the Tribunal is a possible 
view and, therefore, no interference is called for. Similar arguments 
were advanced by respondent nos. 2 to 4 and the custom authorities 
(respondents 5 to 7). It was submitted that there was no question of 
any abetment and/or collusion.  
</p><p id="p_33">The submissions need careful consideration.  It is to be noted 
that the plea that in view of special statutory prescriptions reference 
to the trade notice was unnecessary does not appear to have been 
pleaded or considered by the CEGAT which proceeded only to determine 
the issue as to on which date the payment shall be reckoned to have 
been made.  The entire case of the revenue was built around the alleged 
fraudulent acts of respondent no.1 and its officials and the customs 
officials. According to the revenue it was clearly a case where the 
declaration was done with fraudulent intention, with planned design to 
evade duty.  Several aspects were highlighted to show that the 
respondent no.1 and its officials were acting with fraudulent 
intention.  The Tribunal did not even consider the effect of those 
acts.  
</p><p id="p_34">	By "fraud" is meant an intention to deceive; whether it is from 
any expectation of advantage to the party himself or from the ill will 
towards the other is immaterial.  The expression "fraud" involves two 
elements, deceit and injury to the person deceived.  Injury is 
something other than economic loss, that is, deprivation of property, 
whether movable or immovable or of money and it will include and any 
harm whatever caused to any person in body, mind, reputation or such 
others. In short, it is a non-economic or non-pecuniary loss.  A 
benefit or advantage to the deceiver, will almost always call loss or 
detriment to the deceived. Even in those rare cases where there is a 
benefit or advantage to the deceiver, but no corresponding loss to the 
deceived, the second condition is satisfied.  (<a href="/doc/1035719/" id="a_42">See Dr. Vimla v. Delhi 
Administration</a> (1963 Supp. 2 SCR 585) and <a href="/doc/89564/" id="a_43">Indian Bank v. Satyam Febres 
(India) Pvt. Ltd</a>. (1996 (5) SCC 550).  
</p><p id="p_35">	A "fraud" is an act of deliberate deception with the design of 
securing something by taking unfair advantage of another.  It is a 
deception in order to gain by another's loss. It is a cheating intended 
to get an advantage.  (<a href="/doc/113963352/" id="a_44">See S.P. Changalvaraya Naidu v. Jagannath</a> (1994 
(1) SCC 1).
</p><p id="p_36">	"Fraud" as is well known vitiates every solemn act.  Fraud and 
justice never dwell together.  Fraud is a conduct either by letter or 
words, which includes the other person or authority to take a definite 
determinative stand as a response to the conduct of the former either 
by words or letter.  It is also well settled that misrepresentation 
itself amounts to fraud. Indeed, innocent misrepresentation may also 
give reason to claim relief against fraud.  A fraudulent 
misrepresentation is called deceit and consists in leading a man into 
damage by willfully or recklessly causing him to believe and act on 
falsehood. It is a fraud in law if a party makes representations, which 
he knows to be false, and injury enures therefrom although the motive 
from which the representations proceeded may not have been bad.  An act 
of fraud on court is always viewed seriously.  A collusion or 
conspiracy with a view to deprive the rights of the others in relation 
to a property would render the transaction void ab initio. Fraud and 
deception are synonymous.  Although in a given case a deception may not 
amount to fraud, fraud is anathema to all equitable principles and any 
affair tainted with fraud cannot be perpetuated or saved by the 
application of any equitable doctrine including res judicata.  (<a href="/doc/371933/" id="a_45">See Ram 
Chandra Singh v. Savitri Devi and Ors</a>. (2003 (8) SCC 319).
"Fraud" and collusion vitiate even the most solemn proceedings in 
any civilized system of jurisprudence.  It is a concept descriptive of 
human conduct.  Michael Levi likens a fraudster to Milton's sorcerer, 
Comus, who exulted in his ability to, 'wing me into the easy hearted 
man and trap him into snares'. It has been defined as an act of 
trickery or deceit. In Webster's Third New International Dictionary 
"fraud" in equity has been defined as an act or omission to act or 
concealment by which one person obtains an advantage against conscience 
over another or which equity or public policy forbids as being 
prejudicial to another.  In Black's Legal Dictionary, "fraud" is 
defined as an intentional perversion of truth for the purpose of 
inducing another in reliance upon it to part with some valuable thing 
belonging to him or surrender a legal right; a false representation of 
a matter of fact whether by words or by conduct, by false or misleading 
allegations, or by concealment of that which should have been 
disclosed, which deceives and is intended to deceive another so that he 
shall act upon it to his legal injury.  In Concise Oxford Dictionary, 
it has been defined as criminal deception, use of false representation 
to gain unjust advantage; dishonest artifice or trick. According to 
Halsbury's Laws of England, a representation is deemed to have been 
false, and therefore a misrepresentation, if it was at the material 
date false in substance and in fact.  <a href="/doc/299780/" id="a_46">Section 17</a> of the Indian Contract 
Act, 1872 defines "fraud" as act committed by a party to a contract 
with intent to deceive another.  From dictionary meaning or even 
otherwise fraud arises out of deliberate active role of representator 
about a fact, which he knows to be untrue yet he succeeds in misleading 
the representee by making him believe it to be true.  The 
representation to become fraudulent must be of fact with knowledge that 
it was false. In a leading English case i.e. Derry and Ors. v. Peek 
(1886-90) All ER 1 what constitutes "fraud" was described thus: (All ER 
p. 22 B-C) "fraud" is proved when it is shown that a false 
representation has been made (i) knowingly, or (ii) without belief in 
its truth, or (iii) recklessly, careless whether it be true or false".  
But "fraud" in public law is not the same as "fraud" in private law.  
Nor can the ingredients, which establish "fraud" in commercial 
transaction, be of assistance in determining fraud in Administrative 
Law.  It has been aptly observed by Lord Bridge in Khawaja v. Secretary 
of State for Home Deptt. (1983) 1 All ER 765, that it is dangerous to 
introduce maxims of common law as to effect of fraud while determining 
fraud in relation of statutory law.  "Fraud" in relation to statute 
must be a colourable transaction to evade the provisions of a statute.  
"If a statute has been passed for some one particular purpose, a court 
of law will not countenance any attempt which may be made to extend the 
operation of the Act to something else which is quite foreign to its 
object and beyond its scope.  Present day concept of fraud on statute 
has veered round abuse of power or mala fide exercise of power. It may 
arise due to overstepping the limits of power or defeating the 
provision of statute by adopting subterfuge or the power may be 
exercised for extraneous or irrelevant considerations.  The colour of 
fraud in public law or administration law, as it is developing, is 
assuming different shades.  It arises from a deception committed by 
disclosure of incorrect facts knowingly and deliberately to invoke 
exercise of power and procure an order from an authority or tribunal.  
It must result in exercise of jurisdiction which otherwise would not 
have been exercised. The misrepresentation must be in relation to the 
conditions provided in a section on existence or non-existence of which 
the power can be exercised.  But non-disclosure of a fact not required 
by a statute to be disclosed may not amount to fraud.  Even in 
commercial transactions non-disclosure of every fact does not vitiate 
the agreement.  "In a contract every person must look for himself and 
ensures that he acquires the information necessary to avoid bad 
bargain. In public law the duty is not to deceive.  (<a href="/doc/1697217/" id="a_47">See Shrisht Dhawan 
(Smt.) v. M/s. Shaw Brothers</a>, (1992 (1) SCC 534).

<p id="p_39">	This aspect of the matter has been considered recently by this 
Court in <a href="/doc/623494/" id="a_49">Roshan Deen v. Preeti Lal</a> (2002 (1) SCC 100) <a href="/doc/943008/" id="a_50">Ram Preeti Yadav

	"Fraud" is a conduct either by letter or words, which induces the 
other person or authority to take a definite determinative stand as a 
response to the conduct of the former either by words or letter.  
Although negligence is not fraud but it can be evidence on fraud; as 
observed in   Ram Preeti Yadav's case (supra).
</p><p id="p_42">	In Lazarus Estate Ltd. v. Beasley (1956) 1 QB 702, Lord Denning 
observed at pages 712 &amp; 713, "No judgment of a Court, no order of a 
Minister can be allowed to stand if it has been obtained by fraud. 
Fraud unravels everything."  In the same judgment Lord Parker LJ 
observed that fraud vitiates all transactions known to the law of 
however high a degree of solemnity. (page 722)
It is not open to respondent no.1 to contend that trade notice is 
of no consequences when the permission to pay by cheque on out-station 
bank was given with reference to the trade notice.  The effect of the 
manipulation of records to show as if action was taken on 25.2.1999 and 
not on 26.2.1999 was also not considered by the CEGAT in the proper 
perspective.  
</p><p id="p_43">Rules 79 and 80 of the Treasury Rules were relied upon 
overlooking the effect of the Central Government Account (Receipt and 
Payment Rules, 1983) (in short 'Receipt Rules') which clearly 
stipulates as to the relevant date of receipt. Rule 20 is relevant in 
this regard.  Learned counsel for the respondent referred to Rule 8 of 
Central Excise Rules, 1944 (in short the 'Central Excise Rules'). It 
was submitted that a Full Bench of CEGAT considered effect of said Rule 
8 in <a href="/doc/1039999/" id="a_53">Commissioner of Central Excise, Jaipur -1 v. Genus Overseas 
Electronics Ltd</a>. (2003 (155) ELT 541) and held that due date was the 
date of payment by cheque even if the cheque is encashed later.  Rule 8 
really operates in different field together. It has nothing to do with 
date of receipt. It only provides the mode of payment.  It does not and 
cannot wipe out effect of Rule 20 of the Receipt rules. Otherwise Rule 
20 will become dead letter. We need not go into that question in detail 
because clearly the Rules 70 and 80 of the Treasury Rules are not 
applicable as they are applicable to situations indicated in Rule 1(a), 
and have no application to present case.   
</p><p id="p_44">Strong reliance was placed by learned counsel for respondent no.1 
on Derry's case (supra).  It was pleaded that respondent no.1 had acted 
with reasonable belief about availability of fund. Merely because funds 
were not actually released, it cannot be held to be a mis-declaration. 
It is to be noted that it has to be factually in each case concluded as 
to whether fraud is established.  It would depend on the facts of each 
case. In the present case even if respondent no.1's stand is accepted 
at the most there was an assurance to provide funds.  The same by no 
stretch of imagination, equated with funds already available. There is 
a gulf of difference between assurance to provide financial assistance 
and in reality providing finance assistance.  In the latter case only 
there is availability of funds. 
</p><p id="p_45">The word "reasonable" signifies "in accordance with reason". In 
the ultimate analysis it is a question of fact; whether a particular 
act is reasonable or not depends on the circumstances in a given 
situation.  It is often said that "an attempt to give a specific 
meaning to the word "reasonable" is trying to count what is not number 
and measure what is not space".  The author of "Words and Phrases" 
(Permanent Edition) has quoted from In re Nice &amp; Schreiber 123 F.987, 
988 to give a plausible meaning for the said word.  He says, "the 
expression "reasonable" is a relative term, and the facts of the 
particular controversy must be considered before the question as to 
what constitutes reasonable can be determined".
</p><p id="p_46">From the factual scenario described it is clear that respondent 
no.1 was aware that there was no fund available. In fact, from 3.3.1999 
it accepted the position that there was no fund available and was 
asking for time to arrange funds. This according to us clearly 
indicated a fraudulent motive and the declaration given was certainly 
mis-declaration. Therefore, the CEGAT was not right in its conclusions 
about inapplicability of <a href="/doc/582413/" id="a_54">Section 51(1)(c)</a> to the facts of the case.  
The demand of duty and order of confiscation by the Commissioner is 
clearly sustainable. 
</p><p id="p_47">So far the respondents 2 to 4 are concerned, the Commissioner's 
findings were as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_48">(1)	Respondent No.2- Sri S.R. Agarwal gave instructions from time to 
time for clearance of all imported goods before pronouncement of Union 
Budget 1999. There was no requisition from Essar Projects Ltd. (in 
short EPL) or the contractors for such goods. Incharge of finance 
portfolio was fully aware of the financial status of the assessee. In 
spite of his personal knowledge he instructed respondent No.3 (Sri P.R. 
Ashok) to complete the formalities. The intention to defraud is 
apparent from his fax message dated 24.2.1999 instructing to clear the 
goods at the current duty rate and not to expose to any change in the 
budget. His mala fide intents is apparent from the letters addressed by 
him to the Chief Commissioner and DRI authorities wherein he had 
significantly suppressed the fact that cheque had been tendered on the 
basis of a false declaration regarding availability of funds. All along 
he stuck to the plea that mere late realization was of no consequence 
and since cheque was not dishonored duty at post-budget rates cannot be 
levied.
</p>
<p id="p_49">(2)	Respondent No.3-Sri P.R. Ashok was fully aware of the fact about 
non-availability of funds. But he made a false declaration about 
sufficiency of funds. The cheque was not on a Bank at Jamnagar, but at 
Rajkot. This was a part of a well planned plan to perpetuate fraud.
</p>
<p id="p_50">(3)	Respondent No.4-Sri Nitin Bhat was in charge of Customs clearance 
related work. In his letters to the Customs authorities he clearly 
stated about availability of funds when moving for cancellation of 
warehouse licence. He also played active part in ensuring that the Bank 
does not return the cheque.
</p>
<p id="p_51">	In view of the aforesaid, it was concluded by the Commissioner 
that in respect of the imported goods the aforesaid three persons have 
done or omitted to do acts which acts or omissions have rendered such 
goods liable for confiscation and they had also abetted in acts which 
they knew or had reasons to believe that the goods are liable to 
confiscation under <a href="/doc/398879/" id="a_55">Section 112</a> (j) of the Act and rendered themselves 
liable to action under <a href="/doc/398879/" id="a_56">Section 112</a> (a) of the Act. Accordingly 
penalties as noted above were levied on the respondents 2, 3 and 4.   
</p>
<p id="p_52">	As regards the Departmental Officials (respondents 5 to 7) the 
Commissioner took note of several factors.
</p>
<p id="p_53">(1)	As regards Sri S.P. Chaudhuri it was noted that notwithstanding 
specific direction of Superintendent (Tech), Jamnagar to the effect 
that date of cancellation should be taken to be the date of "actual 
removal of goods from warehouse". It was concluded that Sri Chaudhuri 
failed to ensure "actual removal" for the purpose of cancellation of 
warehouse licence. All the three officers failed to take note that 
physical removal of approximately 20,000 Mts. Cargo covered under 84 
Bills of Entry from the bonded warehouse could not have been possible 
in a short span of one day. The officers acted in undue haste and 
resorted to backdating as accepted by them in their statements. It was 
noted that the three officers were located far apart from each other. 
Therefore, processing the files at various stages and/or places on the 
same day is not practicable. The sequence of processing files confirmed 
the backdating of documents which was admitted by the officers. The 
prime responsibility for scrutinizing the relevant documents was on Sri 
A.C. Sharma who failed to do that. The other officers committed acts of 
omission under the overall guidance and supervision of Sri Sharma. The 
plea for protection under <a href="/doc/1684332/" id="a_57">Section 155</a> of the Act was rejected. Penalty 
under <a href="/doc/423482/" id="a_58">Section 112(a)</a> in respect of each of the officers was levied.
</p>
<p id="p_54">	CEGAT did not consider the aberrations highlighted by the 
Commissioner and in a very cryptic manner dealt with the issues. No 
plausible reason has been indicated as to why the allegations which are 
quite serious in nature and the conclusions in relation thereto 
recorded by the Commissioner were not to be maintained. Only an abrupt 
conclusion was reached that Sri Thakur and Sri Chaudhuri had absolutely 
no connection with the acceptance of cheques. There was not even any 
reference to the allegations regarding accepted backdating or acting 
contrary to specific directions. Sri Sharma was given a clean chit in 
view of the finding recorded about the date on which receipt of payment 
has to be taken. Here again the allegations were not considered in the 
proper perspective. The findings regarding deemed removal are really 
inconsequential in the present dispute as the very foundation for 
removal was based on established fraud. Therefore, it is not necessary 
in the present dispute to go into the question regarding effect of 
deemed removal. 
</p><p id="p_55">The manipulative roles of respondents 2 to 7 have been clearly 
established.  They were clearly active participants in the well-planned 
deception and fraudulent acts leading to evasion of duty.  They had 
played major roles in the whole game of fraud and deception.  There was 
clearly willful disregard and deliberate defiance of statutory 
provisions. Levy of penalty is clearly warranted.  Impugned order of 
CEGAT is set aside and order of Commissioner is restored.   
The appeals are allowed with no order as to costs.
