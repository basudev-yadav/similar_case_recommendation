</p><p id="p_3">1.     The present writ petition has been preferred by the Registrar of

Companies, NCT of Delhi &amp; Haryana (ROC) and its CPIOs Sh. Raj Kumar

Shah and Sh. Atma Shah to assail two similar orders dated 14.07.2009

passed by the Central Information Commission (CIC) in complaint case

Nos. CIC/SG/C/2009/000702 and CIC/SG/C/2009/000753.             By these

similar orders, the appeals preferred by the same respondent- querist

were allowed, rejecting the defence of the petitioners founded upon

applications under the Right to <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_2">Information Act (RTI Act</a>) be provided to

him before 25.07.2009. The CIC has also directed issuance of show-

cause notice to the petitioner-PIOs under <a href="/doc/291269/" id="a_3">Section 20(1)</a> of the RTI Act

asking them to show-cause as to why penalty should not be imposed

<p id="p_7">3.     The PIO-Sh. Atma Shah responded to the said queries on

29.05.2009. In respect of queries No. 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 &amp; 8, the stand taken

by the PIO was as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">       "that in view of the provisions of <a href="/doc/226241/" id="a_5">Section 610</a> of the
       Companies Act, 1956 read with Companies (Central
       Government‟s) General Rules and Forms, 1956 framed in
       exercise of powers conferred by clauses (a) &amp; (b) of sub-
       section (1) of <a href="/doc/1154644/" id="a_6">Section 642</a> of the Companies Act, 1956, the
       documents filed by companies pursuant to various
       provisions of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_7">Companies Act</a>, 1956 with the ROCs are
       to be treated as „information in public domain‟ and such
       information is accessible by public pursuant to the
       provisions of <a href="/doc/226241/" id="a_8">Section 610</a> of the Companies Act, 1956.
       There is an in built mechanism under the provisions of the
       <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_9">Companies Act</a>, 1956 for accessing information relating to
       documents filed which are in the public domain on
       payment of fees prescribed under the provisions of the
       <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_10">Companies Act</a>, 1956 and the Rules made there under.
       Hence you can obtain the desired information by
       inspecting the documents filed by the company in this
       office before filing of documents online i.e. prior to
       8/03/2006 at O/o Registrar of Companies, NCT of Delhi &amp;
       Haryana, 131, Sector-5, IMT Manesar, Haryana and after
       18/3/06 on the Ministry‟s website www.mca.gov.in. Further
       certified copies of the desired documents can also be
       obtained on payment of fees prescribed thereof. In view of
       this, the information already available in the public domain
       would not be treated as „information held by or under the
       control of public authority‟ pursuant to <a href="/doc/13329432/" id="a_11">Section 2(j)</a> of the

        public."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_9">4.     The queries at serial Nos. 4 &amp; 5, as aforesaid, were also

responded to by the PIO.          However, I am not concerned with the

answers given in response to the said queries, as the legal issue raised

in the present petition by the petitioners relates to the interplay

between <a href="/doc/226241/" id="a_14">Section 610</a> of the Companies Act on the one hand, and the

provisions of the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_15">RTI Act</a> on the other hand.        Not satisfied with the

response given by the PIO Sh. Atma Shah, as aforesaid, the

respondent-querist, without preferring a first appeal, straightway

preferred an appeal before the CIC, which has been disposed of vide

impugned        order     dated   14.07.2009   in   complaint   case    No.

CIC/SG/C/2009/000702.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">5.     The respondent-querist raised further queries in respect of the

same company vide an RTI application dated 06.06.2009.                 This

application was also responded to by the PIO Sh. Atma Shah on

23.06.2009. In this reply as well, in respect of certain queries, the PIO

responded by placing reliance on <a href="/doc/226241/" id="a_16">Section 610</a> of the Companies Act

and gave more or less the same reply, as extracted above. Since the

respondent-querist was not satisfied with the said response, he

preferred a petition before the CIC, once again by-passing the

statutory first appeal provided under the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_17">RTI Act</a>.       This appeal was

registered as complaint case No. CIC/SG/C/2009/000753.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">W.P.(C.) No. 11271/2009                                          Page 4 of 38</span>
</p><p id="p_12"> 6.     Before the CIC, the petitioners contended that the information

which could be accessed by any person by resort to <a href="/doc/226241/" id="a_18">Section 610</a> of the

Companies Act is information which is already placed in the public

domain, and it cannot be said that the said information is ―held by‖ or

is ―under the control‖ of the public authority. It was contended that

such information, as has already been placed in the public domain,

does not fall within the scope of the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_19">RTI Act</a> and a citizen cannot by-

pass the procedure, and avoid paying the charges prescribed for

accessing the information placed in the public domain, by resort to

provisions of the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_20">RTI Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">7.     In support of their submissions, before the CIC the petitioners

placed reliance on a departmental circular No. 1/2006 issued by the

Ministry of Company Affairs, wherein the view taken by the Director,

Inspection &amp; Investigation was that in the light of the provisions of

<a href="/doc/226241/" id="a_21">Section 610</a> of the Companies Act read with Companies (Central

Government's) General Rules &amp; Forms, 1956 (Rules), framed in

exercise of powers conferred under clauses (a) &amp; (b) of sub-Section 1

of Section 642 of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_22">Companies Act</a>, the documents filed by the

Companies pursuant to various provisions of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_23">Companies Act</a> with

the ROC are to be treated as information in the public domain. It was

also his view that there being a complete mechanism provided under

the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_24">Companies Act</a> for accessing information relating

to documents filed, which are in public domain, on payment of fees

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">W.P.(C.) No. 11271/2009                                      Page 5 of 38</span>
 prescribed under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_25">Companies Act</a> and the Rules made thereunder,

such information could not be treated as information held by, or under

the control of, the public authority. His view was that the provisions of

<a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_26">RTI Act</a> could not be invoked for seeking copies of such information by

the public.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">8.      The petitioners also placed reliance on various earlier orders

passed by the different CICs, upholding the aforesaid stand of the ROC

and, in particular, reliance was placed on the decision of Sh. A.N.

Tiwari,       Central      Information       Commissioner          in        F.No.

CIC/80/A/2007/000112 decided on 12.04.2007.              Reference was also

made to various orders of Prof. M.M. Ansari, Central Information

Commissioner taking the same view.            The petitioner has placed all

these orders before this Court as well, as Annexure A-7(Colly.)


</p><p id="p_17">9.      The first submission of learned counsel for the petitioners is that,

while     passing    the   impugned      orders,   the   Central   Information

Commissioner Sh. Shailesh Gandhi has acted with impropriety.

Despite the earlier orders of two Central Information Commissioners -

taking the view that the information placed by the petitioner-ROC in

the public domain and accessible under <a href="/doc/226241/" id="a_27">Section 610</a> of the Companies

Act are out of the purview of the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_28">RTI Act</a>, being specifically brought to

his notice, he has simply brushed them aside after noticing them by

observing that he differs with these decisions.          It is submitted that



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">W.P.(C.) No. 11271/2009                                                 Page 6 of 38</span>
 even if Sh. Shailesh Gandhi, Central Information Commissioner, was of

the opinion that the earlier views taken by two other learned CICs were

not correct, the proper course of action for him to adopt would have

been to record his reasons for not agreeing with the earlier views of

the Central Information Commissioners, and to refer the said issue for

determination       by    a   larger   bench   of   the   Central   Information

Commission. Sitting singly, Sh. Shailesh Gandhi, Central Information

Commissioner, could not have taken a contrary view by merely

observing that he disagrees with the earlier views.


</p><p id="p_18">10.    The further submission of learned counsel for the petitioners is

that, even on merits, the view taken by the CIC in the impugned orders

is illegal and not correct. It is argued that Clause (a) of <a href="/doc/226241/" id="a_29">Section 610</a> (1)

of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_30">Companies Act</a>, inter alia, entitles ―any person‖ to inspect any

document kept by the Registrar, which may have been filed or

registered by him in pursuance of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_31">Companies Act</a>, or may inspect

any document, wherein the Registrar has made a record of any fact

required or authorized to be recorded to be registered in pursuance of

the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_32">Companies Act</a>, on payment for each inspection of such fee, as

may be prescribed.
</p>
<p id="p_19">
</p><p id="p_20">11.    Further, by virtue of Clause (b) of <a href="/doc/226241/" id="a_33">Section 610</a> (1) any person can

require the Registrar to provide certified copies of the Certificate of

Registration of any company, or a copy or extract of any other



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">W.P.(C.) No. 11271/2009                                               Page 7 of 38</span>
 document, or any part of any other document, on payment in advance

of such fee, as may be prescribed. It is submitted that the Registrar of

Companies has placed all its records pertaining to, and in relation to

the companies registered with it in the public domain.          They have

either been placed on the website of the ROC, or are available for

inspection at the facility of the ROC.       Any person can inspect such

records either on-line, or at the facility of the petitioner-ROC and if the

person so desires, can also obtain copies of all or any of such

documents on payment of charges, as prescribed under the Rules.


</p><p id="p_21">12.    Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the Companies

(Central Government's) General Rules &amp; Forms, 1956, which have been

framed in exercise        of the   power conferred upon       the   Central

Government by clauses (a) &amp; (b) of sub-Section (1) of <a href="/doc/1154644/" id="a_34">Section 642</a> of

the Companies Act, prescribe the fees for inspection of document and

<p id="p_23">13.    Learned counsel submits that there are two kinds of information

available with the ROC. The first is the information/ documents, which

the ROC is obliged to receive, record and maintain under the provisions

of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_43">Companies Act</a>, and the second kind of information relates to

the administration and functioning of the office of the ROC. The first

kind of information, i.e., the returns, forms, statements, etc. received,

recorded and maintained by the ROC in relation to the companies

registered with it, is all available for inspection, and the certified copies

thereof can be obtained by resort to <a href="/doc/226241/" id="a_44">Section 610</a> of the Companies Act

and the aforesaid Rules.        He submits that since this information is

already in the public domain, same cannot be said to be information

held by, or in the control of the public authority, i.e., ROC. He submits

that it is the second kind of information, as aforesaid, which a citizen

can seek by invoking provisions of the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_45">RTI Act</a> from the ROC, and not

the first kind of information which, in any event, is already available in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">W.P.(C.) No. 11271/2009                                           Page 9 of 38</span>
 the public domain, and accessible to one and all, including non-

citizens.
</p>
<p id="p_24">
</p><p id="p_25">14.    He submits that the right to information vested by <a href="/doc/1979161/" id="a_46">Section 3</a> of

the RTI Act is available only to citizens. However, the right vested by

virtue of <a href="/doc/226241/" id="a_47">Section 610</a> of the Companies Act can be exercised by any

person, whether, or not, he is a citizen of India. Therefore, the right

vested by <a href="/doc/226241/" id="a_48">Section 610</a> of the Companies Act is much wider in its scope

than the right vested by <a href="/doc/1979161/" id="a_49">Section 3</a> of the RTI Act. It is argued that the

object of the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_50">RTI Act</a> is to enable the citizens to access information so

as to bring about transparency in the functioning of public authorities,

which is considered vital to the functioning of democracy and is also

essential to contain corruption and to hold governments and their

instrumentalities accountable to those who are governed, i.e., the

citizens.    The information accessible under <a href="/doc/226241/" id="a_51">Section 610</a> is, in any

event, freely available and all that the person desirous of accessing

such information is required to do, is to make the application in terms

of the said provision and the Rules, to become entitled to receive the

information.
</p>
<p id="p_26">
</p><p id="p_27">15.    Learned counsel submits that the fees prescribed for provision of

information under the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_52">RTI Act</a> is nominal and much less compared to

the fees prescribed under Rule 21 A.         Learned counsel for the

petitioners submits that the petitioners have consciously prescribed



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">W.P.(C.) No. 11271/2009                                      Page 10 of 38</span>
 the fees under the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_53">RTI Act</a> as a nominal amount of Rs.10/- per

application since the petitioner-ROC does not wish to make it

inconvenient or difficult for the citizens to obtain information held by or

under the control of the ROC under the said Act. However, the said

provision cannot be exploited or misused by a citizen for the purpose

of seeking information, which is available in the public domain and is

accessible under <a href="/doc/226241/" id="a_54">Section 610</a> of the Companies Act by payment of

prescribed fee under Rule 21 A of the aforesaid Rules.


</p><p id="p_28">16.    On the other hand, the submission of learned counsel for the

respondent-querist is that the provisions of the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_55">RTI Act</a> have effect

notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in the

<a href="/doc/61492784/" id="a_56">Official Secrets Act</a>, 1923 and any other law for the time being in force

or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law other than the

<a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_57">RTI Act</a> itself. In this respect reference is made to <a href="/doc/1971086/" id="a_58">Section 22</a> of the RTI

Act.    It is, therefore, argued that a citizen has an option to seek

information from the ROC, either by resort to <a href="/doc/226241/" id="a_59">Section 610</a> of the

<p id="p_32">19.    The submission of learned counsel for the respondent that only

the person who has filed documents with the Registrar of Companies is

entitled to inspect the same is wholly fallacious and deserves to be

outrightly rejected. This interpretation is clearly not borne out either

from the plain language of <a href="/doc/226241/" id="a_70">section 610</a> or upon a scrutiny of the object

and purpose of the said provision. <a href="/doc/226241/" id="a_71">Section 610</a> enables ―any person‖

to inspect any documents kept by the registrar, being documents ―filed

or registered by him in pursuance of this Act‖. The obligation to file

and register the documents, which may be submitted by a company

registered, or seeking registration with the Registrar of Companies, is

that of the Registrar of Companies. It is the Registrar, who makes a

be accepted, it would mean that it is the applicant under <a href="/doc/226241/" id="a_73">section 610</a>,

who is obliged to make a record of any fact required, or authorized to

be recorded or registered in pursuance of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_74">Companies Act</a>, which is

not the case. It is also not the obligation of ―any person‖ either to file,

or to receive and put on record, or to register, the documents lodged

by him in the office of the ROC. That is the obligation of the Registrar

of Companies. The whole purpose of <a href="/doc/226241/" id="a_75">section 610</a> is to bring about full

and complete transparency in the matter of registration of companies

and in the matter of their accounts and directorship, so that any

person can obtain all the relevant information in relation to any

registered company.
</p>
<p id="p_34">
</p><p id="p_35">21.    Pertinently, the language used in clause (b) does not support the

submission of the respondent at all.       If the submission of learned

counsel for the respondent were to be accepted, it would mean that

while a person can inspect only those documents which he has lodged

in the office of the Registrar of Companies (by virtue of clause (a)), at

the same time, under clause (b) of <a href="/doc/1064912/" id="a_76">section 610(1)</a>, he can obtain the

</p><p id="p_37">22.    <a href="/doc/1362187/" id="a_77">Section 610(2)</a> puts a check on issuance of a process for

compelling the production of any document by the Registrar, by any

Court or Tribunal. It requires that such process would not be issued

except with the leave of the Court or the Tribunal. This check has been

placed, since any person can obtain information either through

inspection, or by obtaining certified copies of documents filed by any

company, by following the procedure prescribed, and a certified true

copies of any such documents or extracts is admissible in evidence in

all legal proceedings, and has the same efficacy and validity as the

original documents filed and registered by the Registrar of Companies

(see <a href="/doc/877883/" id="a_78">section 610(3)</a>).

<p id="p_38">
</p><p id="p_39">23.    There can be no doubt that the documents kept by the Registrar,

which are filed or registered by him, as well as the record of any fact

required or authorized to be recorded by the Registrar or registered in

pursuance of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_79">Companies Act</a> qualifies as ―information‖ within the

meaning of that expression as used in <a href="/doc/1516599/" id="a_80">Section 2(f)</a> of the RTI Act.

However, the question is -- whether the mere fact that the said

documents/record constitutes ―information‖, is sufficient to entitle a

citizen to invoke the provisions of the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_81">RTI Act</a> to access the same?


</p><p id="p_40">24.    The Parliament has defined the expression ―right to information‖

<p id="p_42">25.    The right to information is conferred by <a href="/doc/1979161/" id="a_83">section 3</a> of the RTI Act,

which reads as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_43">
</p><p id="p_44">       "3.   Right to information.--Subject to the provisions of
       this Act, all citizens shall have the right to information."


</p><p id="p_45">26.    Pertinently, the Parliament did not use the language in <a href="/doc/1330413/" id="a_84">Section 3</a>:

"Subject to the provisions of this Act, citizens shall have a right to

access all information", or the like. Therefore, the right conferred by

<a href="/doc/1979161/" id="a_85">Section 3</a> of the RTI Act, which is the substantive provision, means the

right to information ―accessible under the Act which is held by or under

the control of any public authority and includes ..... ..... .....".


</p><p id="p_46">27.    It is not without any purpose that the Parliament took the trouble

of defining ―right to information‖.     Parliament does not undertake a

casual or purposeless legislative exercise. The definition of ―right to

information‖ specifically qualifies the said right with the words:


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">W.P.(C.) No. 11271/2009                                          Page 16 of 38</span>
</p><p id="p_47">    (1) ―accessible under this Act‖, and;
</p>
<p id="p_48">
   (2) "which is held by or under the control of any public authority".


</p><p id="p_49">28.    The information should, firstly, be accessible under this Act. This

means that if there is information which is not accessible under this

Act,   there     is   no   ―right   to   information‖   in   respect   thereof.

Consequently, there is no right to information in respect of information,

which is exempted from disclosure under <a href="/doc/272099/" id="a_86">Section 8</a> or <a href="/doc/1053993/" id="a_87">Section 9</a> of the

RTI Act.
</p>
<p id="p_50">
</p><p id="p_51">29.    A particular information may not be held by, or may not be under

the control of the public authority concerned. There would be no right

in a citizen to seek such information from that particular public

authority, though he may have the right to seek the same information

from another public authority who holds or under whose control the

desired information resides. That is why <a href="/doc/1483642/" id="a_88">Section 6(3)</a> provides that an

application to seek information:
</p>
<p id="p_52">

provisions thereof, in my view, the said expression ―held by or under

the control of any public authority‖ used in <a href="/doc/13329432/" id="a_91">section 2(j)</a> of the RTI Act

deserves a wider and a more meaningful interpretation.                      The

expression ―Hold‖ is defined in the Black's Law dictionary, 6th Edition,

inter alia, in the same way as ―to keep‖ i.e. to retain, to maintain

possession of, or authority over.

<p id="p_59">
</p><p id="p_60">32.    The expression ―held‖ is also defined in the Shorter Oxford

Dictionary, inter alia, as ―prevent from getting away; keep fast, grasp,

have a grip on‖.          It is also defined, inter alia, as ―not let go; keep,

retain".
</p>
<p id="p_61">
</p><p id="p_62">33.    The expression ―control‖ is defined in the Advanced Law Lexicon

by P.N. Ramanatha Aiyar 3rd Edition Reprint 2009 and it reads as

follows:
</p>
<p id="p_63">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_30">       "(As a verb) To restrain; to check; to regulate; to govern;
       to keep under check; to hold in restraint; to dominate; to

       restraining or governing influence over; to govern with
       reference thereto; to subject to authority; to have under
       command, and authority over, to have authority over the
       particular matter. (Ame. Cyc)"
</blockquote>


<p id="p_64">34.    From the above, it appears that the expression ―held by‖ or

―under the control of any public authority‖, in relation to ―information‖,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">W.P.(C.) No. 11271/2009                                             Page 18 of 38</span>
 means that information which is held by the public authority under its

control to the exclusion of others.           It cannot mean that information

which the public authority has already ―let go‖, i.e. shared generally

with the citizens, and also that information, in respect of which there is

a statutory mechanism evolved, (independent of the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_92">RTI Act</a>) which

obliges the public authority to share the same with the citizenry by

following the prescribed procedure, and upon fulfillment of the

prescribed conditions.             This is so, because in respect of such

information, which the public authority is statutorily obliged to

disseminate, it cannot be said that the public authority ―holds‖ or

―controls‖ the same. There is no exclusivity in such holding or control.

In fact, the control vests in the seeker of the information who has only

to operate the statutorily prescribed mechanism to access the

information.     It is not this kind of information, which appears to fall

within the meaning of the expression ―right to information‖, as the

information in relation to which the ―right to information‖ is specifically

conferred by the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_93">RTI Act</a> is that information which "is held by or under

the control of any public authority".

mechanism (in this case <a href="/doc/226241/" id="a_94">Section 610</a> of the Companies Act), than that

prescribed     under      the   <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_95">RTI    Act</a>   does    not   make   any   difference

whatsoever.       The      right      available     to   any   person   to     seek

 Act is governed by the Companies (Central Government's) General

Rules &amp; Forms, 1956, which are statutory rules and prescribe the fees

for inspection of documents, etc. in Rule 21A.         The said rules being

statutory in nature and specific in their application, do not get

overridden by the rules framed under the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_96">RTI Act</a> with regard to

prescription of fee for supply of information, which is general in nature,

and apply to all kinds of applications made under the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_97">RTI Act</a> to seek

information. It would also be complete waste of public funds to require

the creation and maintenance of two parallel machineries by the ROC -

one under <a href="/doc/226241/" id="a_98">Section 610</a> of the Companies Act, and the other under the

<a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_99">RTI Act</a> to provide the same information to an applicant. It would lead

of its enactment in the year 1956 itself. On the other hand, the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_121">RTI Act</a>

is a much later enactment, enacted in the year 2005. <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_122">The RTI Act</a> is a

general law/enactment which deals with the right of a citizen to access

information available with a public authority, subject to the conditions

610</a> of the Companies Act is a piece of special legislation, which deals

specifically with the right of any person to inspect and obtain records

be read or understood to have abrogated the earlier special law.

reads as follows:

       under the control of any public authority.......". The use of
       the words "accessible under this Act"; "held by" and
       "under the control of" are crucial in this regard. The
       inference from the text of this sub-section and, especially
       the three expressions quoted above, is that an information
       to which a citizen will have a right should be shown to be

       information cannot be said to be an information accessible
       under the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_134">RTI Act</a>. Inferentially it would mean that once a
       certain information is placed in the public domain
       accessible to the citizens either freely, or on payment of a
       pre-determined price, that information cannot be said to be
       „held‟ or „under the control of‟ the public authority and,
       thus would cease to be an information accessible under the

       intervals through various means of communication

       sub-<a href="/doc/277989/" id="a_141">section 2</a>). This Section further elaborates the position.
       It states that "All materials shall be disseminated taking
       into consideration the cost effectiveness, local language
       and the most effective method of communication in that
       local area and the information should be easily accessible,
       to the extent possible in electronic format with the Central
       Public Information Officer or State Public Information
       Officer, as the case may be, available free or at such cost
       of the medium or the print cost price as may be
       prescribed." The explanation to the sub<a href="/doc/13503/" id="a_142">section 4</a> <a href="/doc/13503/" id="a_143">section 4</a>
       goes on to further clarify that the word "disseminated"
       used in this Section would mean the medium of
       communicating the information to the public which include,
       among others, the internet or any other means including
       inspection of office of any public authority.

<blockquote id="blockquote_48">       10. It is significant that the direction regarding
       dissemination of information through free or priced
       documents, or free or priced access to information stored
       on internet, electronic means, or held manually; free or on
       payment of predetermined cost for inspection of such
       documents or records held by public authorities, appear in
       a chapter on „obligations of public authorities‟. The
       inference from these sections is a) it is the obligation of the
       public authorities to voluntarily disseminate information so
       that "the public have minimum resort to the use of this Act
       to obtain information", b) once an information is voluntarily
       disseminated it is excluded from the purview of the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_144">RTI Act</a>
       and, to that extant, contributes to minimizing the resort to
       the use of this Act, c) there is no obligation cast on the
       public authority to disseminate all such information free of
       cost. <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_145">The Act</a> authorizes the public authorities to disclose

       the <a href="/doc/13329432/" id="a_147">Section 2(j)</a> which clearly demarcates the boundary

       Act</a> and, not the latter. This latter category of information
       forms the burden of sub-section 2, 3 and 4 of Section 4 of
       this Act.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_50">       12. <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_149">The RTI Act</a> very clearly sets the course for the
       evolution of the RTI regime, which is that less and less
       information should be progressively held by public
       authorities, which would be accessed under the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_150">RTI Act</a> and
       more and more of such held information should be brought
       into the public domain suo-motu by such public authority.
       Once the information is brought into the public domain it is
       excluded from the purview of the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_151">RTI Act</a> and, the right to
       access this category of information shall be on the basis of
       whether the public authority discloses it free, or at such
       cost of the medium or the print cost price "as may be
       prescribed". <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_152">The Act</a> therefore vests in the public authority
       the power and the right to prescribe the mode of access to
       voluntarily disclosed information, i.e. either free or at a
       prescribed cost / price.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_51">       13. The respondents are right therefore in arguing that
       since they had placed in the public domain a large part of
       the information requested by the appellant and prescribed
       the price of accessing that information either on the
       internet or through inspection of documents, the ground
       rules of accessing this information shall be determined by
       the decision of the public authority and not the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_153">RTI Act</a> and
       the Rules. That is to say, such information shall not be
       covered by the provisions about fee and cost of supply of
       information as laid down in <a href="/doc/1831074/" id="a_154">Section 7</a> of the RTI Act and the
       Rules thereof.

<blockquote id="blockquote_52">       14. It is, therefore, my view that it should not only be the
       endeavour of every public authority, but its sacred duty, to
       suo-motu bring into public domain information held in its
       control. The public authority will have the power and the
       right to decide the price at which all such voluntarily
       disclosed information shall be allowed to be accessed.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_53">       15. There is one additional point which also needs to be
       considered in this matter. The appellant had brought up
       the issue of the overarching power of the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_155">RTI Act</a> under
       <a href="/doc/1971086/" id="a_156">Section 22</a>. <a href="/doc/463150/" id="a_157">This Section of the Act</a> states that the
       provisions of the Act shall have effect notwithstanding

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">W.P.(C.) No. 11271/2009                                       Page 29 of 38</span>
        anything inconsistent therewith contained in the <a href="/doc/61492784/" id="a_158">Official
       Secrets Act</a>, 1923, and any other law for the time being in
       force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any
       law other than this Act. In his view, the pricing of the
       access to the records and information by the public
       authority at a scale different from the rates / fees for
       accessing the information prescribed under the Act
       amounts to inconsistency. A closer look at the provision
       shows that this is not so. As has been explained in the
       preceding paragraphs, the fees prescribed for access to
       information under the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_159">RTI Act</a> applies only to information
       „held‟ or „under the control of‟ the public authority. It does
       not apply inferentially to the information not held or not
       under the control of the public authority having been
       brought into the public domain suo-motu in terms of sub-
       section 3 of Section 4. The price and the cost of access of
       information determined by the public authority applies to
       the latter category. As such, there is no inconsistency
       between the two provisions which are actually parallel and
       independent of each other. I therefore hold that no ground
       to annul the provision of pricing the information which the
       public authority in this case has done, exists.

       by the CPIO, by paying the price / cost as determined by

<p id="p_90">52.    This decision has subsequently been followed in State Bank of

India Vs. Mohd. Shahjahan, W.P.(C.) No. 9810/2009, wherein the

Court held as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_91">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_56">       "12. This Court is unable to accept the above submission.
       There is no question of making the CIC, whose order is
       under challenge in this writ petition, a party to this petition.
       Like any other quasi-judicial authority, the CIC is not
       expected to defend its own orders. Likewise, the CIC
       cannot be called upon to explain why it did not follow any
       of its earlier orders. That the CIC should not be made a
       party in such proceedings is settled by the judgment of the
       Division Bench in this Court in <a href="/doc/1781729/" id="a_162">Union Public Service
       Commission v. Shiv Shambu</a> 2008 IX (Del) 289."

<p id="p_92">53.    It is, therefore, a well-recognised position that the CIC discharges

quasi-judicial functions while deciding complaints/appeals preferred by

one or the other party before it.
</p>
<p id="p_93">
</p><p id="p_94">54.    It is a well-settled canon of judicial discipline that a bench

dealing with a matter respects an earlier decision rendered by a

coordinate bench (i.e., a bench of same strength), and is bound by the

decision of a larger bench.      If this discipline is breached, the same

would lead to complete chaos and confusion in the minds of the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">W.P.(C.) No. 11271/2009                                           Page 32 of 38</span>
 litigating public, as well as in the minds of others such as lawyers,

other members/judges of quasi-judicial/judicial bodies, and the like.

Breach of such discipline would result in discrimination and would

shake the confidence of the consumers of justice.      There can be no

greater source of discomfiture to a litigant and his counsel, than to

have to deal with diametrically opposite views of coordinate benches

of the same judicial /quasi-judicial body.         If the emergence of

contradictory views is innocent i.e. due to ignorance of an earlier view,

it is pardonable, but when such a situation is created consciously, with

open eyes, and after having been put to notice, the judge/authority

responsible for the later view should take the blame for creating

confusion and for breaching judicial discipline.


</p><p id="p_95">55.    The Supreme Court in Dr. Vijay Laxmi Sadho Vs. Jagdish,

(2001) 2 SCC 247, deprecated such lack of judicial discipline by

observing as follows:

<p id="p_96">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_57">       "33. As the learned Single Judge was not in agreement
       with the view expressed in Devilal's case, Election Petition
       No. 9 of 1980, it would have been proper, to maintain
       judicial discipline, to refer the matter to a larger Bench
       rather than to take a different view. We note it with regret
       and distress that the said course was not followed. It is
       well-settled that if a Bench of coordinate jurisdiction
       disagrees with another Bench of coordinate
       jurisdiction whether on the basis of "different
       arguments" or otherwise, on a question of law, it is
       appropriate that the matter be referred to a larger
       Bench for resolution of the issue rather than to
       leave two conflicting judgments to operate, creating
       confusion. It is not proper to sacrifice certainty of

        law. Judicial decorum, no less than legal propriety
       forms the basis of judicial procedure and it must be
       respected at all costs." (emphasis supplied)


</blockquote><p id="p_97">56.    In the present case, the Central Information Commissioner

Mr.Shailesh Gandhi has also demonstrated complete lack of judicial

discipline while rendering the impugned decisions.     By no stretch of

imagination, it cannot be said that the earlier decisions were not on the

point. Particularly, the decision rendered by Sh. A.N. Tiwari in F.

CIC/T/A/2007/0012 dated 12.04.2007 directly deals with the very same

issue, and is an exhaustive, and detailed and considered decision. If

the Central Information Commissioner Sh. Shailesh Gandhi had a

different view in the matter - which he was entitled to hold, judicial

discipline demanded that he should have recorded his disagreement

with the view of Sh. A.N. Tiwari, Central Information Commissioner,

and, for reasons to be recorded by him, required the constitution of a

larger bench to re-examine the issue. He could not have ridden rough

shot over the earlier decisions of Sh. A.N. Tiwari and Prof. M.M. Ansari,

particularly when he was sitting singly to consider the same issue of

law.
</p>
<p id="p_98">
</p><p id="p_99">57.    The consequence of the improper conduct          of Sh. Shailesh

Gandhi, Central Information Commissioner, is that there are now two

sets of conflicting orders- taking diametrically opposite views, on the

issue aforesaid. Therefore, unless the said legal issue is settled one


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">W.P.(C.) No. 11271/2009                                       Page 34 of 38</span>
 way or the other by a higher judicial forum, it would be open to any

other Information Commissioner to choose to follow one or the other

view. This would certainly lead to confusion and chaos. It would also

lead to discrimination between the querists/public authority, who are

either seeking information or are defending the action under the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_163">RTI

Act</a>. One such instance, cited by learned counsel for the petitioner is in

the case of Smt. Dayawati Vs. Office of Registrar of Companies,

in CIC/SS/C/2011/000607 decided on 23.03.2012.        In this case, once

again the same issue had been raised.          The Central Information

Commissioner Smt. Sushma Singh has preferred to follow the view of

Sh. A.N. Tiwari in the case of K. Lall Vs. Ministry of Company

Affairs, Appeal No. CIC/AT/A/2007/00112 dated 14.04.2007.


</p><p id="p_100">58.      On this short ground alone, the impugned orders of the learned

Central Information Commissioner deserve to be quashed and set

aside.

Central Information Commissioner for taking a view contrary to that

taken by Sh. A.N. Tiwari in his order dated 12.04.2007 (which has been

extracted hereinabove), does not appeal to me.       The view taken by

Sh.A.N. Tiwari, Central Information Commissioner appeals to this Court

in preference to the view taken by Sh. Shailesh Gandhi, Central

Information Commissioner in the impugned orders.         The impugned

 orders do not discuss, analyse     or interpret the expression ―right to

information‖ as defined in <a href="/doc/13329432/" id="a_164">Section 2(j)</a> of the RTI Act. They do not even

address the aspect of <a href="/doc/226241/" id="a_165">Section 610</a> of the Companies Act being a

special law as opposed to the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_166">RTI Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_103">
</p><p id="p_104">60.    I may also observe that the approach of the Central Information

Commission in seeking to invoke <a href="/doc/1369783/" id="a_167">Section 20</a> of the RTI Act in the facts

of the present case is wholly unjustified. By no stretch of imagination

could it have been said that PIOs of the ROC had acted ―without any

reasonable cause‖ or ―malafidely denied the request for information or

knowingly gave incorrect, incomplete or misleading information, or

destroyed information, which was the subject of the request, or

obstructed in any manner the furnishing of information‖.        The PIOs

were guided          by the departmental circular No. 1/2006 dated

24.01.2006 in the view that they communicate to the respondent-

querist.     This view was taken by none other than the Director

Inspection &amp; Investigation in the Ministry of Company Affairs,

Government of India and circulated to all Regional Directors of

Registrar of Companies and all Official Liquidators. There was nothing

before the PIOs to suggest that the said view had been disproved by

any judicial or quasi-judicial authority. Clearly, the PIOs acted bonafide

and without any malice.

<p id="p_105">


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">W.P.(C.) No. 11271/2009                                        Page 36 of 38</span>
</p><p id="p_106"> 61.    Even if it were to be assumed for the sake of argument, that the

view taken by the learned Central Information Commissioner in the

impugned order was correct, and that the PIOs were obliged to provide

the information, which was otherwise retrievable by the querist by

resort to <a href="/doc/226241/" id="a_168">Section 610</a> of the Companies Act, it could not be said that

the information had been withheld malafide or deliberately without any

reasonable cause.         It can happen that the PIO may genuinely and

bonafidely entertain the belief and hold the view that the information

sought by the querist cannot be provided for one or the other reasons.

Merely because the CIC eventually finds that the view taken by the PIO

was not correct, it cannot automatically lead to issuance of a show-

cause notice under <a href="/doc/1369783/" id="a_169">Section 20</a> of the RTI Act and the imposition of

penalty. The legislature has cautiously provided that only in cases of

malafides or unreasonable conduct, i.e., where the PIO, without

reasonable cause refuses to receive the application, or provide the

information, or knowingly gives incorrect, incomplete or misleading

information or destroys the information, that the personal penalty on

the PIO can be imposed. This was certainly not one such case. If the

CIC starts imposing penalty on the PIOs in every other case, without

any justification, it would instill a sense of constant apprehension in

those functioning as PIOs in the public authorities, and would put

undue pressure on them.          They would not be able to fulfill their

statutory duties under the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_170">RTI Act</a> with an independent mind and with

 objectivity.     Such consequences would not auger well for the future

development and growth of the regime that the <a href="/doc/671631/" id="a_171">RTI Act</a> seeks to bring

in, and may lead to skewed and imbalanced decisions by the PIOs

Appellate Authorities and the CIC. It may even lead to unreasonable
