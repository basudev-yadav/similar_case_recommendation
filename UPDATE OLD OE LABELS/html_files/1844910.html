JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">S.C. AGRAWAL, J.:
</p><p id="p_2">1.   Leave granted.
</p><p id="p_3">2.   The   appellants  were  employed  as   Deputy   Central
Intelligence  Officers	in the Intelligence  Bureau  in	 the
Ministry  of  Home Affairs of the Government of	 India.	  On
July  23,  1979, the employees of  the	Intelligence  Bureau
formed	an  Association	 called	 "the  Intelligence   Bureau
employees Association" (IBEA) for the purpose of ventilating
their grievances.  Appellants, A.K.Kaul and Verghese Joseph,
were  elected  as  the	General	 Secretaries  of  IBEA	 and
appellant, B.B. Raval, was elected as the President.  On May
3,  1980,  the	Joint Director of  the	Intelligence  Bureau
issued,	 a Circular Memorandum declaring that the  formation
of the IBEA was in violation of the Civil Services (Conduct)
Rules and that those who take part in the activities of	 the
IBEA  will  attract  disciplinary  action.   Writ  petitions
(Civil) Nos.  1117-1119 were filed in this Court challenging
the said circular.  This Court, on July 21, 1980, issued  an
order for issue of rule nisi on the said writ petitions	 and
also  passed  an  interim order directing  that	 during	 the
pendency of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">7</span>
writ petitions in this Court no disciplinary action shall be
taken  against any member of the IBEA for reasons  mentioned
in  the circular.  On December 26, 1980, orders were  passed
dismissing  the	 appellants from service.   One	 such  order
regarding  the dismissal of appellant, A.K. Kaul, is in	 the
following terms :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	      "Shri A.K. Kaul,
	       Deputy	 Central    Intelligence    Officer,
	      Intelligence Bureau,
	      New Delhi.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	       Whereas	the  President	is  satisfied  under
	      sub-clause (c) of the proviso to clause(2)   of
	      <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_1">Article  311</a> of the Constitution that  in	 the
	      interest	of the security of the State  it  is
	      not  expedient to hold an inquiry in the	case
	      of Shri A. K. Kaul.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	      And whereas the President is satisfied that on
	      the  basis of the information  available,	 the
	      activities  of Shri A.K. Kaul are such  as  to
	      warrant his dismissal from service.
	      Accordingly,  the President  hereby  dismisses
	      Shri  A.K.  Kaul from service  with  immediate
	      effect.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">	      (By order and in the name of President
				   Sd/-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">			 (R. Mahadevan)
			 Under Secretary to the Govt. of
			 India Ministry of Home Affairs."
</blockquote><p id="p_4">3.  The orders for dismissal of appellants, Verghese  Joseph
and B.B. Raval are in the same terms.  The appellants  filed
separate  writ petitions (Nos. 205-207/81 1) in	 this  Court
under  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_2">Article 32</a> of the Constitution to challenge the	said
orders of dismissal.  After the constitution of the  Central
Administrative	Tribunal under the <a href="/doc/195735/" id="a_3">Administrative  Tribunals
Act</a>,  1985, (hereinafter referred to as 'the Tribunal')	 the
said  writ  petitions were transferred to the  Tribunal	 for
adjudication and they were registered as T.A. Nos. 1,2 and 3
of 1992.
</p><p id="p_5">4.   Before  the  Tribunal  the case  put  for-ward  by	 the
appellants  was	 that they have been picked and	 chosen	 for
punitive  action for dismissal from service for	 the  reason
that  they were important members of the IBEA, being  office
bearers	 as General Secretaries and the President, and	that
the  real  motive  to pass the orders of  dismissal  was  to
penalise  them	for  the  active  part	they  had  taken  in
ventilating  the  grievances of the  employees	through	 the
IBEA.	The  appellants	 also  pleaded	that  they  had	  an
excellent record of service and that they had not  conducted
themselves in such manner as to warrant their dismissal from
service.   It  was submitted that they	were  recipients  of
commendation  certificates,  appreciation letters  and	cash
awards	from  time  to	time.  It was  also  stated  in	 the
applications  that  they  had  not  acted  contrary  to	 the
interest  of  national	security  at  any  time.   The	said
applications  were contested by the respondents who  pleaded
that  the  orders  of  dismissal  had  been  passed  by	 the
President  on being satisfied on the basis of  the  material
available that the activities of the appellants were such as
to  warrant their dismissal from service by dispensing	with
the  requirements of <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_4">Article 311(2)</a> of the  Constitution  in
the interest of security of the State.	It was also  pleaded
on  behalf  of	the  respondents that  the  details  of	 the
material  on  the basis of which the satisfaction  had	been
reached	 cannot	 be disclosed without  detriment  to  public
interest.   It	was  denied  that  the	authorities  of	 the
Intelligence Bureau have a hostile attitude towards IBEA and
it was stated that punitive action was taken on merits of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">8</span>
each  case  and	 not because of	 the  participation  of	 the
appellants  in	the  activities of  the	 IBEA.	 During	 the
pendency  of the applications before the.  Tribunal the	 ap-
pellants  moved Misc.  Petitions Nos. 1897/ 92 in T.A.	Nos.
1  and 2/92 and Miscellaneous Petition No. 732/92  in  T.A.-
No.   3/92  whereby  they  prayed  for	directions  to	 the
respondents  to	 produce the records specified in  the	said
applications  for inspection of the Tribunal and/or  by	 the
appellants  and their counsel.	The said  applications	were
opposed	 by the respondents who claimed	 privilege  invoking
<a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_5">Article	 74(2)</a> of the Constitution and <a href="/doc/208203/" id="a_6">Sections 123</a> and	 <a href="/doc/1958937/" id="a_7">124</a>
of  the Evidence Act and for that purpose affidavit  of	 Mr.
Madhav	Godbole, Secretary to the Government of India,	Min-
istry	of  Home  Affairs,  New	 Delhi	(the  Head  of	 the
Department)   was  filed  before  the	Tribunal.    Without
prejudice  to the said claim of privilege,  the	 respondents
had,  however, stated that they had no objection  whatsoever
to  the	 said  documents relating to the  dismissal  of	 the
appellants  and those portions of documents that  relate  to
the said dismissal orders being produced for perusal of	 the
Tribunal in order to satisfy it that the claim of  privilege
against disclosure of the said official records is bona fide
and genuine.
</p><p id="p_6">5.   By judgment dated December 18, 1993 the Tribunal, after
perusing  the  records that were placed for perusal  of	 the
Tribunal,  upheld the claim of privilege and dismissed	,the
applications  filed  by the appellants	for  inspection	 and
production  of	the  documents.	 On the basis  of  the	said
records	 the  Tribunal has further found that  the  material
considered by the President relate to the activities of	 the
appellants which would prejudicially affect the security  of
the  State  and	 that  the  materials  relied  upon  or	 the
satisfaction  of the President have nothing to do  with	 the
appellants'  activities	 in  relation  to  the	IBEA.	 The
Tribunal has held that there is no substance in the case  of
the  appellants	 that the orders of the dismissal  were	 not
bona  fide  and	 they  have been  passed  to  victimise	 the
appellants for promoting and participating in the activities
of  the	 IBEA.	 The  Tribunal was  of	the  view  that	 the
satisfaction  had been arrived at after application of	mind
to the relevant materials without taking into  consideration
irrelevant factors and that the impugned orders of dismissal
from  service  dated December 26, 1980 arc  not	 liable	 for
interference.	 The  Tribunal,	 therefore,  dismissed	 the
applications of the appellants.	 Hence these appeals.
</p><p id="p_7">6.On  behalf  of the appellants it has been urged  that	 the
exercise of power under clause (c) of the second proviso  to
<a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_8">Article	 3 11(2)</a> of the Constitution is subject to  judicial
review and that an order passed under the said provisions is
open  to challenge before the courts on the ground that	 the
satisfaction of the President or the Governor is vitiated by
malafides  or  is  based on  considerations  which  have  no
relevance to the interest of the security of the State.	  In
this connection, Shri Sorabjee has submitted that in a	case
where  the  employee assails the action	 taken	against	 him
under <a href="/doc/282836/" id="a_9">Article 311(2)(c)</a> it is obligatory on the part of	 the
concerned Government to place before the court the  relevant
material on the basis of which the action was taken and such
material can only be withheld from the court in cases  where
the  claim of privilege is found to be justified  under	 the
provisions  of	<a href="/doc/208203/" id="a_10">Sections 123</a> and <a href="/doc/1958937/" id="a_11">124</a> of	 the  Evidence	Act.
Shri  Sorabjee	has urged that the said claim  of  privilege
does not extend to the disclosure of the nature of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">9</span>
the   activities   on  the  basis  of  which   the   alleged
satisfaction has been arrived at and the privilege can	only
relate to the material which has been relied upon in support
of the said activities.
</p><p id="p_8">7.   The learned Additional Solicitor General, appearing for
the respondents, has, however, submitted that an order under
clause	(c)  of	 second proviso to  <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_12">Article  311(2)</a>  of	 the
Constitution  is  to  be  passed by  the  President  or	 the
Governor  on the basis of his subjective satisfaction.	 The
material  which	 forms the basis for arriving  at  the	said
satisfaction is not required to be disclosed both in view of
<a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_13">Article	 74(2)</a> as well as under <a href="/doc/208203/" id="a_14">Sections 123</a> and <a href="/doc/1958937/" id="a_15">124</a> of	 the
Evidence Act.  The learned Additional Solicitor General has,
in this context, pointed out that while under clause (b)  of
the second proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_16">Article 311(2)</a> the competent authority
is  required to record in writing the reason for its  satis-
faction	 that  it is not reasonably practicable to  hold  an
inquiry,  there	 is no such requirement	 for  recording	 the
reason in clause (c) and, therefore, there is no requirement
to disclose the reasons for arriving at the satisfaction for
taking action under clause (c) of second proviso to  <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_17">Article
311(2).</a>
</p><p id="p_9">8.   <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_18">Article   311(2</a>),	as  amended  by	  the	Constitution
(Fifteenth Amendment) Act, 1963, provides as follows :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">	      "(2)  No	such  persons  aforesaid  shall	  be
	      dismissed or removed or reduced in rank except
	      after an inquiry in which he has been informed
	      of  the  charges	against	 him  and  given   a
	      reasonable  opportunity  of  being  heard	  in
	      respect of those charges :
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">	      Provided that where it is proposed after	such
	      inquiry  to impose upon him any such  penalty,
	      such  penalty may be imposed on the  basis  of
	      the  evidence adduced during such inquiry	 and
	      it shall not be necessary to give such  person
	      any  opportunity of making  representation  on
	      the penalty proposed

	      apply -

	      or  reduced in rank on the ground	 of  conduct
	      which has led to his conviction on a  criminal
	      charge; or
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">	      (b)   when the authority empowered to  dismiss
	      or remove a person or to reduce him in rank is
	      satisfied that for some reason, to be recorded
	      by that authority in writing it is not practi-
	      cable to hold such inquiry; or
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">	      (c)   where the President or Governor, as	 the
	      case may be, is satisfied that in the interest
	      of  the  security	 of  the  State	 it  is	 not
	      expedient to hold such inquiry.  "
</blockquote><p id="p_10">9.   The  provision  of	 the  second  proviso  came  up	 for
consideration before the Constitution Bench of this Court in
<a href="/doc/1134697/" id="a_19">Union  of India &amp; Anr. v. Tulsiram Patel &amp; Ors</a>., 1985  Supp.
(2)  SCR  13 1, Madon, J., speaking for	 the  majority,	 has
observed  that clause (2) of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_20">Article 311</a> gives	a  constitu-
tional mandate to the principles of natural justice and audi
alteram pattern rule by providing that a person employed  in
a  civil  capacity under the Union or a State shall  not  be
dismissed  or removed from service or reduced in rank  until
after  an  inquiry  in which he has  been  informed  of	 the
charges	 against  him  and  has	 been  given  a	  reasonable
opportunity  of being heard in respect of those charges	 and
that this safeguard provided for a government, servant by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">10</span>
clause	(2) of <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_21">Article 311(2)</a> is, however, taken  away	when
the second proviso to that clause becomes applicable.  (Page
</p><p id="p_11">202).	The  Court has also pointed out that  the  paramount
thing to bear in mind is that the second proviso will  apply
only where the conduct of a government servant is such as he
deserves  the punishment of dismissal, removal or  reduction
in  rank  and that before denying a government	servant	 his
constitutional right to an inquiry, the first  consideration
would  be  whether the conduct of the  concerned  government
servant	 is  such  as justifies the  penalty  of  dismissal,
removal	 or  reduction in rank and once that  conclusion  is
reached	 and the condition specified in the relevant  clause
of  the	 second proviso is satisfied, that  proviso  becomes
applicable and the government servant is not entitled to  an
inquiry. (Pages 204-205).  While dealing with clause (c)  of
the second proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_22">Article 311(2)</a> it has been stated :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">	      "The  question under clause (c),	however,  is
	      not whether the security of the State has been
	      affected	or not, for the expression  used  in
	      clause (c) is "in the interest of the security
	      of  the State".  The interest of the  security
	      of the state may be affected by actual acts or
	      even the likelihood of such acts taking place.
	      Further, what is required under clause (c)  is
	      not  the satisfaction of the President or	 the
	      Governor,	 as  the  case	may  be,  that	 the
	      interest	of the security of the State  is  or
	      will be affected but his satisfaction that  in
	      the interest of the security of the State,  it
	      is  not  expedient  to  hold  an	inquiry	  as
	      contemplated  by	<a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_23">Article	 311(2).</a>   The	sat-
	      isfaction	 of the President or Governor  must,
	      therefore,  be with respect to the  expediency
	      or  inexpediency of holding an inquiry in	 the
	      interest of the security of the State.  "	 (p.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">	      277)
	      "The satisfaction so reached by the  President
	      or   the	Governor  must	necessarily   be   a
	      subjective satisfaction.	Expediency  involves
	      matters	of  policy.   Satisfaction  may	  be
	      arrived  at as a result of secret	 information
	      received	by the Government about the  brewing
	      danger to the interest or the security of	 the
	      State  and like matters.	There may  be  other
	      factors	which	may  be	  required   to	  be
	      considered,  weighed and balanced in order  to
	      reach   the  requisite  satisfaction   whether
	      holding an inquiry would be expedient or	not.
			    If the requisite satisfaction has been reached
	      as a result of secret information received  by
	      the Government, making, known such information
	      may  very	 often result in disclosure  of	 the
	      source  of such information.  Once known,	 the
	      particular  source from which the	 information
	      was received would no more be available to the
	      Government.  The reasons for the	satisfaction
	      reached by the President or the Governor under
	      clause  (c) cannot, therefore, be required  to
	      be recorded in the order of dismissal, removal
	      or  reduction  in rank nor can  they  be	made
	      public." (p. 278)
</blockquote><p id="p_12">10.The	learned Judge did not consider it necessary to	deal
with the contention that the power of judicial review is not
excluded  where	 the satisfaction of the  President  or	 the
Governor  has been reached mala fide or is based  on  wholly
extraneous or irrelevant grounds and that in such a case, in
law  there would be no satisfaction of the President or	 the
Governor  at  all for the reason that in the  matters  under
consideration before this court all the materials, including
the  advice tendered by the Council of Ministers,  had	been
produced  and they clearly showed that the  satisfaction  of
the  Governor was neither reached malafide nor was it  based
on any extraneous or irrelevant ground. (Page 279).  In	 the
light  of  the	provisions contained in	 <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_24">Article  74(2)</a>	 and
<a href="/doc/60543/" id="a_25">Article 163(3)</a> it was submitted before
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">11</span>
the  Court  that  leaving  aside the  advice  given  by	 the
Ministers  to the President or the Governor, the  Government
is  bound to disclose at least the materials upon which	 the
advice	of Council of Ministers was based so that the  court
can examine whether the satisfaction of the President or the
Governor, as the case may be, was arrived at mala fide or is
based  on  wholly extraneous or irrelevant grounds  so	that
such satisfaction would in law amount to no satisfaction  at
all and that if the Government does not voluntarily disclose
such  materials it can be compelled by the Court to  do	 so.
Dealing with the said submission it was observed :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">	      "Whether	this  should be done  or  not  would
	      depend upon whether the documents in  question
	      fall within the class of privileged  documents
	      and  whether in respect of them privilege	 has
	      been   properly	claimed	 or  not.    It	  is
	      unnecessary  to  examine	this  question	 any
	      further because in the cases under clause	 (c)
	      before  us  though  at  first  privilege	 was
	      claimed,	at the hearing privilege was  waived
	      and the materials as also the advice given  by
	      the  Ministers  to  the  Governor	 of   Madhya
	      Pradesh who has passed the impugned orders  in
	      those cases were disclosed." (p. 280)
</blockquote><p id="p_13">11.It  would  thus  appear that in  Tulsiram  Patel  (supra)
though	 the  question	whether	 the  satisfaction  of	 the
President  or the Governor under <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_26">Article 311(2)</a> is  amenable
to  judicial  review and the Government can be	required  to
disclose the materials upon which the advice of the  Council
of Ministers was based so as to enable the court to exercise
the power of judicial review has been left open, the  Court,
after considering the said material, has recorded the  find-
ing  that  the	satisfaction of	 the  Governor	was  neither
recorded  malafide  nor was it based on	 any  extraneous  or
irrelevant ground.
</p><p id="p_14">12.It is, therefore, necessary to deal with this question in
the instant case., We may, in this context, point out that a
distinction  has  to  be made between  judicial	 review	 and
justiciability	of  a  particular  action.   In	 a   written
constitution  the  powers  of  the  various  organs  of	 the
State,are  limited  by the provisions of  the  Constitution.
The  extent  of those limitations on the powers	 has  to  be
determined  on an interpretation of the relevant  provisions
of  the	 Constitution.	Since the task of  interpreting	 the
provisions   of	 the  Constitution  is	entrusted   to	 the
Judiciary, it is vested with the power to test the  validity
of  an	action	of every  authority  functioning  under	 the
Constitution on the touch stone of the constitution in order
to ensure that the authority exercising the power  conferred
by  the	 constitution does not	transgress  the	 limitations
placed by the Constitutions on exercise of that power.	This
power  of  judicial  review is,	 therefore,  implicit  in  a
written	 constitution  and unless expressly  excluded  by  a
provision of the Constitution, the power of judicial  review
is  available in respect of exercise of powers under any  of
the provisions of the Constitution.  Justiciability  relates
to  a  particular field falling within the  purview  of	 the
power of judicial review.  On account of want of  judicially
manageable  standards,	there may be matters which  are	 not
susceptible to the judicial process.  In other words, during
the  course of exercise of the power of judicial  review  it
may be found that there are certain aspects of the  exercise
of that power which are not susceptible to judicial  process
on  account of want of judicially manageable  standards	 and
are, therefore, not justiciable.
</p><p id="p_15">13.  In the Slate of Rajasthan &amp; Ors. v.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">12</span>
<p id="p_16">Union  of  India  Etc.	Etc., (1978) 1 SCR  1,	one  of	 the
questions failing for consideration was whether satisfaction
of  the President in the matter of exercise of the power  to
make  a Proclamation conferred under <a href="/doc/1807986/" id="a_27">Article 356(1)</a>  of	 the
Constitution  is  amenable  to	judicial  review.   At	 the
relevant  time	when the impugned  Proclamations  were	made
there was an express provision in clause (5) of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_28">Article	 356</a>
which  prescribed  that "the satisfaction of  the  President
mentioned  in clause (1) shall be final and  conclusive	 and
shall  not  be questioned in any Court on  any	ground."  In
spite of such an express provision P.N. Bhagwati J. (as	 the
learned	 Chief	Justice then was) speaking for	himself	 and
A.C.  Gupta J., has held that "if the satisfaction  is	mala
fides  or  is  based  on  wholly  extraneous  or  irrelevant
grounds,  the Court would have the jurisdiction	 to  examine
it,  because in that case there would be no satisfaction  of
the  President in regard to the matter which he is  required
to  be satisfied." (p.82). Other learned Judges,  with	some
variance, have adopted a similar approach.  Beg CJ. has held
that  if it is revealed "that a constitutionally or  legally
prohibited or extraneous or collateral purpose is sought  to
be  achieved  by  a proclamation under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_29">Article	356</a>  of	 the
Constitution,  this Court will not shirk its duty to act  in
the  manner  in which the law may then oblige  it  to  act."
(p.46).	 Chandrachud J. (as the learned Chief  Justice	then
was) has observed that if reasons given are wholly  extrane-
ous  to the formation of the satisfaction, the	Proclamation
would  be  open to the attack that it is vitiated  by  legal
mala  fides."  (p.60). Goswami J. has held  that  the  Court

said  that the Court is not powerless to interfere  with  an
order  that  is ultra vires, wholly illegal or	passed	mala
fide.  (p. 95).	 Fazal Ali J. has held that "on the  reasons
given by the President in his order if the Courts find	that
they  are absolutely extraneous and irrelevant and based  on
personal  and  illegal	considerations the  Courts  are	 not
powerless  to  strike down the order on the ground  of	mala
fide if proved." (p. 120).

of judicial review developed in the field of  administrative
law are not antithetical to the field of constitutional	 law
and  they  can equally apply to the domain  covered  by	 the

the  tests laid down by this Court in <a href="/doc/1748256/" id="a_36">Barium Chemicals	Ltd.

</p><p id="p_21">17.  Jeevan  Reddy  J., speaking for himself and one  of  us

Chemicals  (supra)  is	a  decision  concerning	  subjective
satisfaction  of  an  authority created by  a  statute,	 the
learned Judge has held that the principles enshrined in that
case  "cannot  ipso  facto be extended to  the	exercise  of
constitutional	power under <a href="/doc/448465/" id="a_38">Article 35</a> of  the	Constitution
and  that  "having regard to the fact that this	 is  a	high
Constitutional	functionary  in the Nation, it	may  not  be
appropriate  to	 adopt the tests applicable in the  case  of
action taken by statutory or administrative authorities nor,
at  any rate, in their entirety." (p.267). He  preferred  to
adopt the formulation that "if a Proclamation is found to be
mala  fide or is found to be based wholly on  extraneous  or
irrelevant  grounds,  it  is  liable  to  be  struck  down."
(p.268).  The  teamed  Judge has  observed:  "The  truth  or
correctness  of	 the material cannot be	 questioned  by	 the
court nor will it go into the adequacy of the material.	  It
will  also  not	 substitute  its opinion  for  that  of	 the
President.  Even if some of the material on which the action
is  taken is found to be irrelevant, the court	would  still
not  interfere	so long as there is some  relevant  material
sustaining  the action.	 The ground of mala fides  takes  in
inter alia situations-where the Proclamation is found to  be
a clear case of abuse of power, or what is sometimes  called
fraud  on  power   cases where this  power  is	invoked	 for
achieving  oblique ends." (p. 268).  The learned  Judge	 has
further stated: "The court will not lightly presume abuse or
misuse.	  The  court  would, as it  should,  tread  wearily,
making	allowance  for the fact that the President  and	 the
Union  Council	of  Ministers are the  best  judges  of	 the
situation, that they alone are in possession of	 information
and  material  sensitive in nature sometimes  and  that	 the
Constitution has trusted their judgment in the matter.	 But
all this does not mean that the President and Union  Council
of  Ministers are the final arbiters in the matter  or	that

the  matter  of justiciability of the  satisfaction  of	 the

We  may, in this context, refer to clause (b) of the  second

the  said provision attaching finality to the decision	this
Court, in Tulsiram Patel (supra), has held :

opinion,  does	not  mean  that	 the  satisfaction  of	 the
President or the Governor under clause (c) is immune from

distinction between the expressions 'security of the State',
'public	 order'	 and  'law and order' and  has	stated	that
situations  which affect public order are graver than  those
which  affect  law  and order and  situations  which  affect

consideration only those circumstances which have a  bearing

situations  having  a  bearing on law and  order  or  public
order.	 The satisfaction of the President or  the  Governor
would be vitiated if it is based on circumstances having  no
bearing	 on the security of the State.	If an  order  passed
under  <a href="/doc/282836/" id="a_73">Article 311(2) (c)</a> is assailed before a court of	 law
on the ground that the satisfaction of the President or	 the

on the security of the State the Court can examine the	cir-
cumstances on which the satisfaction of the President or the
Governor   is	based  and  if	it  finds  that	  the	said
circumstances  have no bearing on the security of the  State
the court can hold that the satisfaction of the President or

</p><p id="p_33">26.  It	 would be useful, in this context, to take  note  of
the  decision  of  the House of Lords in  Council  of  Civil
Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Services, 1985	 (1)
AC 374, which related to the Government Communications	Head
Quarters (GCHQ).  The main functions of GCHQ were to  ensure
the security of military and official communications and  to
provide	 the government with signals intelligence which	 in-
volved	the  handling  of secret information  vital  to	 the
national  security.  Since 1947 staff employed at  GCHQ	 had
been  permitted to belong to national trade unions and	most
had  done  so.	 There was a  well-established	practice  of
consultation  between  the official and	 trade	union  sides
about  important alterations in the terms and conditions  of
service of the staff.  On December 22, 1983 the Minister for
the  Civil  Service gave an instruction	 for  the  immediate
variation  of  the terms and conditions of  service  of	 the
staff with the effect that they would no longer be permitted
to  belong  to	national trade unions.	There  had  been  no
consultation with the trade unions or with the staff at GCHQ
prior  to  the issuing of that instruction.   The  said	 in-
struction   was	 challenged  by	 a  trade  union   and	 six
individuals   who  sought  judicial  review  of	  the	said
instruction.   Immunity from judicial review was claimed  on
the  ground  that the said instruction had  been  issued  in
exercise  of the prerogative power of the Crown.  The  House
of  Lords  held that executive action was  not	immune	from
judicial  review  merely  because  it  was  carried  out  in
pursuance  of  the  power  derived  from  a  common  law  or
prerogative, rather than a statutory source, and a  minister
acting	under a prerogative power might, depending upon	 its
subject	 matter, be under the same duty to act fairly as  in
the  case of action under a statutory power.  On  behalf  of
the Minister it was submitted that prior consultation  would
involve a real risk that it would occasion the very kind  of
disruption that was threat to national security and which it
was intended to avoid.	While recognising that the  decision
on  whether the requirements of national  security  outweigh
the  duty  of fairness in any particular case,	is  for	 the
Government  and	 not for the courts, Lord  Fraser  of  Tully
belton said
	      "But  if	the decision is	 successfully  chal-
	      lenged on the ground that it has been  reached
	      by   a  process  which  is  unfair  then	 the
	      Government  is under an obligation to  produce
	      evidence that the decision was, in fact, based
	      on grounds of national security," (p. 402)
According to Lord Scarman
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">18</span>
	      "The point of principle in the appeal is as to
	      the  duty	 of the court  when  in	 proceedings
	      properly	brought before it a question  arises
	      as  to  what is required in  the	interest  of
	      national security.  The question may arise  in
	      ordinary litigation between private persons as
	      to  their private rights and obligations:	 and
	      it  can arise as in this case  in	 proceedings
	      for judicial review of a decision by a  public
	      authority."
</p><p id="p_34">	      "But, however it arises, it is a matter to  be

	      discretionary  power, evidence is also  needed
	      so  that	the court may determine	 whether  it
	      should intervene to correct excess or abuse of
	      the power," [p. 404]
</p><p id="p_35">27.	 Similarly Lord Roskill has said:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_23">	      "The   courts  have  long	  shown	  themselves
	      sensitive	 to the assertion by  the  executive
	      that considerations of national security	must
	      preclude	  judicial   investigation   of	   a
	      particular individual grievance.	But even  in
	      that  field the courts will not act on a	mere
	      assertion that questions of national  security
	      were involved.  Evidence is required that	 the
	      decision	under challenge was in fact  founded
	      on those grounds.	 'Mat that principle  exists
	      is 1 beyond doubt.?' [p. 420]
</blockquote><p id="p_36">28.On  the  basis of the evidence that was adduced  in	that
case  it  was held that the evidence  established  that	 the
minister  had  considered, with reason, that  prior  consul-
tation	about her instruction would have involved a risk  of
precipitating  disruption at GCHQ and  revealing  vulnerable
areas of operation, and, accordingly, she had shown that her
decision  had  in  fact	 been  based  on  considerations  of
national   security   that  out	 weighed   the	 applicants'
legitimate expectation of prior consultation.

Union of India &amp; Anr</a>., 1987 (4)	   SCC	114, in a  challenge
to  orders  of	dismissal passed under	clause	(c)  of	 the
second.	 proviso  to  <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_75">Article 311 (2)</a> it  was  contended  on
behalf	of the appellants that the High Court was  wrong  in
holding	 that the sufficiency of satisfaction of the  Presi-
dent  was  not	justiciable.  While dealing  with  the	said
contention,  the court, after referring to the	decision  in
Tulsiram Patel (supra), has observed :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_24">	      "The  record  of the case produced  before  us
	      clearly  indicates  that the reason  has	been
	      recorded though not communicated.	 That  would
	      satisfy,	the  requirements  of  the  law	  as
	      indicated in Tulsiram Patel Case . The plea of
	      mala  fides as had been contended	 before	 the
	      High  Court and causally reiterated before  us
	      arises out of the fact that typed orders dated
	      June  3, 1971, were already on record  in	 the
	      file  when the papers were placed	 before	 the
	      President;  such a contention is	without	 any
	      substance." [p. 121]
</blockquote><p id="p_38">30.This	 would show that the court did go into the  question
whether	 the impugned orders were vitiated by  mala,  fides.
As noticed earlier in Tulsiram Patel (supra) also the Court,
while dealing with the Madhya Pradesh Police Forces matters,
did  examine  the question whether the	impugned  orders  of
dismissal  passed under <a href="/doc/282836/" id="a_76">Article 311(2)(c)</a> were	vitiated  by
mala fides or were based on irrelevant consid-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">19</span>
<p id="p_39">erations  and after considering all the materials that	were
produced before the Court by the State Government, the Court
recorded the finding that the facts leave no doubt that	 the
situation  was	such  that  prompt  and	 urgent	 action	 was
necessary  and	the holding of inquiry into the	 conduct  of
each of the petitioners would not have been expedient in the
interests of the security of the State.
</p><p id="p_40">31.We  are, therefore, of the opinion that an  order  passed
under clause (c) of the second proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_77">Article 311 (2)</a> is
subject to judicial review and its validity can be  examined
by  the	 court on the ground that the  satisfaction  of	 the
President  or the Governor is vitiated by mala fides  or  is
based on wholly extraneous or irrelevant grounds within	 the
limits laid down in S.R Bommai (supra).
</p><p id="p_41">32.In order that the Court is able to exercise this power of
judicial  review  effectively  it must	have  the  necessary
material before it to determine whether the satisfaction  of
the  President or the Governor as the case may be, has	been
arrived at in accordance with the law and is not vitiated by
mala fides or extraneous or irrelevant factors.	 This brings
us  to the question whether the Government is  obligated  to
place  such material before the Court.	It is no doubt	true
that unlike clause (b) of the second proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_78">Article	 311
(2)</a>  which requires the authority to record in	writing	 the
reason	for  its  satisfaction that  it	 is  not  reasonably
practicable  to hold such inquiry clause (c) of	 the  second
proviso does not prescribe for the recording of reasons	 for
the satisfaction.  But the absence of such a requirement  to
record	reason for the satisfaction does not  dispense	with
the  obligation on the part of the concerned  Government  to
satisfy	 the court or the Tribunal if an order passed  under
clause (c) of the second proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_79">Article 311 (2)</a> is chal-
lenged	before such court or tribunal that the	satisfaction
was arrived at after taking into account relevant facts	 and
circumstances and was not vitiated by mala fides and was not
based  on extraneous or irrelevant considerations.   In	 the
absence	 of the said circumstances being placed	 before	 the
court  or the Tribunal it may be possible for the  concerned
employee  to  establish his case that the  satisfaction	 was
vitiated  by  mala  fides  or was  based  on  extraneous  or
irrelevant considerations.  While exercising the power under
<a href="/doc/282836/" id="a_80">Article	 311 (2) (c)</a> the President or the Governor  acts  in
accordance  with  the  advice tendered	by  the	 Council  of
Ministers. (See : <a href="/doc/1382698/" id="a_81">Samsher Singh v. State of Punjab</a>, 1975 (1)
SCR 814).  <a href="/doc/635602/" id="a_82">Article 74(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/60543/" id="a_83">Article 163 (3)</a> which  preclude
the court from inquiring into the question whether any,	 and
if  so,	 what advice was tendered by the  Ministers  to	 the
President or the Governor enable the concerned Government to
withhold from the court the advice that was tendered by	 the
Ministers  to the President or the Governor.  But,  as	laid
down  in  S.R. Bommai (supra), the said	 provisions  do	 not
permit the Government to withhold production in the Court of
the material on which the advice of the Ministers was based.
This  is, however, subject to the claim of  privilege  under
<a href="/doc/208203/" id="a_84">Sections  123</a>  and <a href="/doc/1958937/" id="a_85">124</a> of the Evidence Act in respect  of  a
particular document or record.	The said claim of  privilege
will  have to be considered by the court or tribunal on	 its
own  merit.  But the upholding of such claim  for  privilege
would not stand in the way of the concerned Government being
required  to  disclose the nature of the activities  of	 the
employee on the basis of which
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">20</span>
the  satisfaction  of  the President  or  the  Governor	 was
arrived at for the purpose of passing an order under  clause
</p><p id="p_42">(c)  of	 the second proviso to <a href="/doc/1674593/" id="a_86">Article 311 (2)</a> so  that	 the
court or tribunal may be able to determine whether the	said
activities  could be regarded as having a  reasonable  nexus
with  the  interest of the security of the  State.   In	 the
absence of any indication about the nature of the activities
it  would  not	be possible for the  court  or	tribunal  to
determine  whether  the satisfaction was arrived at  on	 the
basis of relevant considerations.  The nature of  activities
in  which  employee  is said to have  indulged	in  must  be
distinguished  from the material which supports	 his  having
indulged  in  such activities.	The non-disclosure  of	such
material  would be permissible if the claim of privilege  is
upheld.	 The said claim of privilege would not extend to the
disclosure  of	the nature of the  activities  because	such
disclosure  would not involve disclosure of any	 information
connecting  the employee with such activities or the  source
of such information.
</p><p id="p_43">33.In  our opinion, therefore, in a case where the  validity
of an order passed under clause (c) of the second proviso to
<a href="/doc/158646/" id="a_87">Article	 111(2)</a> is assailed before a court or a Tribunal  it
is open to the court or the Tribunal to examine whether	 the
satisfaction of the President or the Governor is vitiated by
mala  fides or is based on wholly extraneous  or  irrelevant
grounds	 and for that purpose the Government is	 obliged  to
place before the court or tribunal the relevant material  on
the  basis of which the satisfaction was arrived at  subject
to  a claim of privilege under <a href="/doc/208203/" id="a_88">Sections 123</a> and <a href="/doc/1958937/" id="a_89">124</a>  of	 the
Evidence Act to withhold production of a particular document
or record.  Even in cases where such a privilege is  claimed
the  Government concerned must disclose before the Court  or
tribunal  the  nature of the activities in  which  the	Gov-
ernment employee is said to have indulged in.

the Evidence Act.  The Tribunal after referring the decision
of  this Court in S.P. Gupta &amp; Ors., etc. etc. v.  Union  of
India &amp; Ors. etc. etc., 1982 (2) SCR 365, has observed	that
the  following	classes	 of  documents	are  protected	from

</blockquote><p id="p_48">36.The Tribunal, after examining the records produced before
it,  has observed that the records contain cabinet  minutes,
papers	brought into existence for the purpose of  preparing
submission  to	the cabinet, notes made	 by  the  respective
officers,  information	expressed and the gist	of  official
decisions.   Having regard to the fact that  the  appellants
were  working in a highly sensitive  Organisation  entrusted
with the delicate job of gathering, collecting and analysing
intelligence necessary to maintain the unity, integrity	 and
sovereignty  of the country and that secrecy is the  essence
of  the organisation and exposure may tend to  demolish	 the
organisation and aggravate the hazards in gathering informa-
tion  and  dry	up the sources that  provide  essential	 and
sensitive information needed to protect public interest, the
Tribunal has held that it will not be in public interest  to
permit	disclosure  of such documents.	 The  Tribunal	has,
therefore,  upheld the claim of privilege.  We do  not	find
any ground to take a different view in the matter.
</p><p id="p_49">37.After looking into the records the Tribunal has  recorded
the  finding that the materials considered by the  President
relate	to  the	 activities of the  appellants	which  would
prejudicially affect the security of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">22</span>
the  State  and	 that  the materials  relied  upon  for	 the
satisfaction  of the President have nothing to do  with	 the
activities  of the appellants in relation to IBEA  and	that
the impugned orders have not been passed in violation of the
interim	 order passed by this Court in W.P. O Nos.  1119  of
1980 and that there is no substance in the appellants'	case
that the orders of dismissal are not bona fide and had	been
passed	to  victimise  the  appellants	for  promoting	 and
participating  in  the	activities  of	IBEA.	The  learned
Additional Solicitor General has submitted that the Tribunal
has not committed any error in adopting this course and	 has
placed	reliance on the decision of this Court in  <a href="/doc/356651/" id="a_96">Jamaat-e-
Islamdi Hind v. Union of India</a>, 1995 (1) SCC 428.
</p><p id="p_50">38.In Jamaat-e-Islamdi Hind (supra) a notification had	been
issued	by  the Government of India under <a href="/doc/1633290/" id="a_97">Section 3</a>  of	 the
Unlawful  Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967  declaring	that
the  Jamaat-e-Islami Hind was an unlawful Association.	 The
said  notification  was	 referred for  adjudication  to	 the
Tribunal  constituted  under  the  said	 Act.	Before	 the
Tribunal   the	only  material	produced  by   the   Central
Government  was	 a  resume prepared on	the  basis  of	some
intelligence reports and the affidavits of two officers	 who
spoke only on the basis of the records and not from personal
knowledge.   The  Tribunal held that  there  was  sufficient
cause  for  declaring  the Association to  be  unlawful	 and
confirmed  the notification.  On behalf of the appellant  it
was  urged  that the only material produced at	the  inquiry
does  not  constitute legal evidence for the purpose  in  as
much  as  it  was, at best, hearsay  and  that	too  without
disclosing  the	 source from which it emanates	to  give  an
opportunity to the appellant to effectively rebut the  same.
On  the	 other	hand, on behalf of  the	 respondent  it	 was
submitted that the requirement of natural justice in such  a
situation  was satisfied by mere disclosure  of	 information
without	 disclosing  the source of  the	 information.	This
Court, while holding that the minimum requirement of natural
justice	 must  be satisfied to make the	 adjudication  mean-
ingful,	 observed  that	 the  said  requirement	 of  natural
justice	 in  a	case  of this kind had	to  be	tailored  to
safeguard public interest which must always out-weigh  every
lesser interest.  It was said:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_37">	      "It is obvious that the unlawful activities of
	      an association may quite often be	 clandestine
	      in  nature  and,	therefore,  the	 source	  of
	      evidence	 of  the  unlawful  activities	 may
	      require  continued confidentiality  in  public
	      interest.	 In such a situation, disclosure  of
	      the  source of such information, and, may	 be,
	      also full particulars thereof, is likely to be
	      against the public interest. .......  However,
	      the nondisclosure of sensitive information and
	      evidence	to the association and	its  office-
	      bearers, whenever justified in pubic interest.
	      does not necessarily imply its  non-disclosure
	      to the Tribunal as well." [p.447]
</blockquote><p id="p_51">39.These observations in Jamaat-e-Islamdi Hind (supra)	lend
support to the view that in a case where the material is  of
such a nature that it requires continued confidentiality  in
public	interest  it would be permissible for the  court  or
tribunal  to  look into the same while permitting  the	non-
disclosure  to	the  other party to  the  adjudication.	  It
cannot, therefore, be said that the Tribunal, in the present
case,  was  in	error in looking into  the  record  for	 the
purpose	 of  determining whether the satisfaction  has	been
vitiated for any of the reasons mentioned by the appellants.
</p><p id="p_52">40.  The learned counsel for the appellants
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">23</span>
have  invited  our attention to the averments  contained  in
C.M.  No. 8494 of 1980 filed on behalf of the respondent  in
W.P.  No. 1117-19 of 1980 in this Court in support of  their
submission  that the impugned orders of dismissal have	been
passed on the basis of the activities referred to in para  6
of  the	 said  application.   This  submission	has  to	 be,
rejected  in  view of the finding recorded by  the  Tribunal
that the materials considered by the President relate to the
activities  of	the  appellants	 which	would  prejudicially
affect the security of the State and that the said materials
have  nothing to do with the activities of the appellant  in
relation to IBEA.
</p><p id="p_53">41.  Having  regard  to the facts and circumstances  of	 the
case we are unable to hold that the impugned orders for	 the
dismissal of the appellants are vitiated by malafides or are
based  on wholly extraneous or irrelevant grounds and we  do
not  find any ground to interfere with the decision  of	 the
Tribunal.   The appeals are, therefore, dismissed.   But  in
the circumstances without any order as to costs.
