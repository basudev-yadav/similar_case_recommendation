                        CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION


                     CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.  1577   OF 2012
                 (Arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 446 of 2007)



Manharibhai Muljibhai Kakadia &amp; Anr.               …. Appellants

                                   Versus

Shaileshbhai Mohanbhai Patel &amp; Ors.                    ….Respondents








                                  JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">R.M. Lodha, J.
</p>

<p id="p_2">            Leave granted.
</p><p id="p_3">2.          The sole  question for consideration is, whether  a  suspect  is
entitled to hearing by the revisional court in a revision preferred  by  the
complainant  challenging  an  order  of   the  Magistrate   dismissing   the
complaint under <a href="/doc/443138/" id="a_1">Section 203</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (for  short
‘Code’).
</p><p id="p_4">3.          It is not necessary to set out the facts in detail.  Suffice  it
to say  that  Shaileshbhai  Mohanbhai  Patel,  respondent  no.  1,  filed  a
criminal complaint on 15.5.2004 in the Court of Chief  Judicial  Magistrate,
Surat (for short ‘CJM’) against Manharibhai  Muljibhai  Kakadia  and  Paresh
Lavjibhai  Patel,  appellants,   alleging  that  they  had   pre-planned   a
conspiracy; created forged documents bearing signatures of the  complainant,
his father and uncle, two sons of his uncle and his elder brother  and  have
used the said documents as true and genuine by  producing  the  same  before
the District Registrar, Cooperative Society, Nanpura, and  by  making  false
representation obtained  registration  of  Indoregency  Cooperative  Housing
Society Limited and  by  doing  so  the  accused  (appellants)  have  caused
financial loss and physical and mental agony  to  the  complainant  and  his
family members and have deceived the complainant and his family  members  by
obtaining  huge  financial   advantage   by   taking   possession   of   the
complainant’s property. It was,  thus,  alleged  that  the  appellants  have
committed offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1099980/" id="a_2">Sections 420</a>, <a href="/doc/286506/" id="a_3">467</a>, <a href="/doc/1599077/" id="a_4">468</a>, <a href="/doc/1590825/" id="a_5">471</a>  and  <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_6">120-B</a>,
<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_7">IPC</a>.
</p><p id="p_5">4.          The CJM in exercise of his power under <a href="/doc/1149595/" id="a_8">Section 202</a> of  the  Code
by his order dated 18.6.2004 directed the enquiry to be made by  the  Police
Inspector, Umra Police Station, into the  allegations made in the  complaint
and submit his report within thirty days therefrom.
</p><p id="p_6">5.          The Investigating  Officer  investigated  into  the  matter  and
submitted ‘C’ Summary Report. In the opinion of the  Investigating  Officer,
the disputes between the parties were of civil nature  and  no  offence  was
made out.
</p><p id="p_7">6.          The CJM on 16.4.2005 accepted the ‘C’ Summary  Report  submitted
by the  Investigating  Officer.  That  order  has  been  challenged  by  the
Complainant in a criminal revision application filed under <a href="/doc/1457888/" id="a_9">Section 397</a>  read
with <a href="/doc/1571667/" id="a_10">Section 401</a> of the Code in the Gujarat High Court.
</p><p id="p_8">7.          The appellants  having  come  to  know  of  the  above  criminal
revision  application  made  an  application  for  joining  them  as   party
respondents so that they can be heard in the matter.
</p><p id="p_9">8.          On  5.8.2005,  the  Single  Judge  of  the  Gujarat  High  Court
dismissed the application made by the appellants.   It is  from  this  order
that present appeal has arisen.
</p><p id="p_10">9.          We have heard Mr. Shyam Divan, learned senior  counsel  for  the
appellants  and Ms. Meenakshi Arora, learned counsel for respondent no. 1.
</p><p id="p_11">10.         Mr. Shyam Divan,  learned  senior  counsel  for  the  appellants
argued that the plain language of <a href="/doc/949039/" id="a_11">Section 401(2)</a> of the  Code  entitles  the
appellants to be heard in the criminal revision  application  filed  by  the
respondent no. 1 challenging the order of  the  CJM.  According  to  learned
senior counsel, appellants  have  a  right  to  be  heard  in  the  revision
application filed by the complainant as no  order  could   be  made  to  the
prejudice of  the  accused  or  the  other  person  unless  he  has  had  an
opportunity of being heard under  <a href="/doc/949039/" id="a_12">Section  401(2)</a>  of  the  Code.    It  was
argued on behalf of the appellants that the  result  of  acceptance  of  the
‘C’ Summary Report is that criminal proceedings launched by the  complainant
have come to an end  and  if  the  revision  application  preferred  by  the
complainant is accepted, that would  have  the  effect  of  revival  of  the
complaint and setting the criminal process back in  motion  which  would  be
definitely prejudicial to the appellants and  before  any  such  prejudicial
order is passed, the appellants ought to be heard.  In support of the  above
contentions, learned senior counsel relied upon decisions of this  Court  in
P. Sundarrajan and others v. R. Vidhya Sekar[1], <a href="/doc/214907/" id="a_13">Raghu Raj Singh  Rousha  v.
Shivam  Sundaram  Promoters  Private  Limited</a>  and  another[2]  and  A.   N.
Santhanam v. K. Elangovan[3].
</p><p id="p_12">11.         Mr. Shyam Divan, learned senior counsel would  also  argue  that
expression, “in his own defence” in  <a href="/doc/1571667/" id="a_14">Section  401</a>  (2)  is  a  comprehensive
expression which also means ‘in defence of the  order’  under  challenge  in
revisional jurisdiction. Learned senior counsel submitted  that  “prejudice”
may cover wide range of situations and must be considered  in  wider  sense.
<a href="/doc/1571667/" id="a_15">Section 401</a> does not make any  distinction  between  pre-process  stage  and
post-process stage. Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1571667/" id="a_16">Section 401</a> is applicable  regardless
and whether or not process has been issued under <a href="/doc/1827798/" id="a_17">Section 204</a> of the Code.
</p><p id="p_13">12.          It  was  also  submitted  on  behalf  of  the  appellants  that
cognizance had been taken by the  CJM.   Cognizance  is  not  equivalent  to
issuance of process; it is taken prior to issuance  of  process.  Cognizance
is taken at the initial stage when the Magistrate applies his judicial  mind
to the facts mentioned in the complaint or to  the  police  report  or  upon
information received  from  any  other  person  that  an  offence  has  been
committed. In this regard, reliance was placed on <a href="/doc/1915325/" id="a_18">Jamuna  Singh  and  others
v. Bhadai Sah</a>[4] , <a href="/doc/1383725/" id="a_19">Kishun Singh and others v. State of  Bihar</a>[5]  and  <a href="/doc/41295/" id="a_20">State
of Karnataka and another v. Pastor P. Raju</a>[6].
</p><p id="p_14">13.         Ms. Meenakshi Arora, learned counsel for the respondent  no.  1,
on the other hand, stoutly defended the order of the High Court.  She  would
argue that since  CJM   had  not  taken  cognizance  of  the  offence,   the
appellants have no role to play at any stage prior to issuance  of  process.
She referred to certain provisions,  including Chapters  XIV,  XV  and  XVI,
and also <a href="/doc/1291024/" id="a_21">Sections 156</a>, <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_22">173</a>, <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_23">190</a> and <a href="/doc/1149595/" id="a_24">202</a> of the  Code.  Learned  counsel  for
the respondent no. 1 argued that since the  subject  revision  petition  had
been filed by the respondent no. 1 against the dismissal  of  the  complaint
at a pre-cognizance stage,  the appellants do not have any right of  hearing
under the provisions of <a href="/doc/949039/" id="a_25">Section 401(2)</a> of the  Code.  In  this  regard,  the
learned counsel placed reliance on <a href="/doc/1758785/" id="a_26">Chandra  Deo  Singh  v.  Prokash  Chandra
Bose</a> and another[7], <a href="/doc/56823/" id="a_27">Smt. Nagawwa v.  Veeranna  Shivalingappa  Konjalgi</a>  and
others[8], <a href="/doc/549946/" id="a_28">Adalat Prasad v. Rooplal Jindal</a> and others[9]  and  <a href="/doc/1938541/" id="a_29">Mohd.  Yousuf
v. Afaq Jahan (Smt.) and another</a>[10].
</p><p id="p_15">14.         Learned  counsel  for  the  respondent  no.1  also  relied  upon
decisions of Punjab and Haryana High Court, Madhya Pradesh  High  Court  and
Gujarat High Court in support of her submission that accused  has  no  right
of hearing under <a href="/doc/949039/" id="a_30">Section 401(2)</a> in a revision against an order  by  which  a
complaint has been dismissed by the Magistrate  under  <a href="/doc/443138/" id="a_31">Section  203</a>  of  the
Code. She relied  upon  <a href="/doc/46757720/" id="a_32">Gurdeep  Singh  v.  State  of  Haryana</a>[11],  <a href="/doc/1147382/" id="a_33">Panatar
Arvindbhai Ratilal v. State of Gujarat</a>  and  others[12],  <a href="/doc/276078/" id="a_34">Ratanlal  Soni  v.
Kailash Narayan Arjariya</a>[13]. She also relied upon a decision of Delhi  High
Court in Tata Motors  Limited  v.  State  (Criminal  Revision  Petition  No.
16/2008 and Criminal LPA 4301/2008) decided on  12.2.2009  wherein  decision
of this Court in Raghu Raj Singh Rousha2  has been distinguished.
</p><p id="p_16">15.         Learned counsel for the  respondent  no.  1  would  submit  that
decision of this Court in P. Sundarrajan1  was not applicable  to  the  fact
situation of the present case inasmuch as in that  case,  the  accused  were
party  in  the  revision  petition  whereas  in  the  subject  revision  the
appellants have not been allowed to be impleaded as  party  respondents  and
the impugned order has been  passed  on  the  application  for  impleadment.
While referring to A. N. Santhanam3, learned counsel for the respondent  no.
1 submitted that this case too was  not  applicable  to  the  facts  of  the
present case as in that case the complainants were  examined  under  <a href="/doc/444619/" id="a_35">Section
200</a> of the Code whereas in the present case the CJM  has  accepted  the  ‘C’
Summary Report under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_36">Section 173</a> after the investigation  was  done  by  the
police.
</p><p id="p_17">16.         In order to  appreciate  the  rival  submissions,  some  of  the
provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_37"> of the Code</a> need to  be  referred  to.  <a href="/doc/1291024/" id="a_38">Section  156</a>  deals  with
Police Officer’s power to investigate cognizable case. It reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">           “S. 156.  Police Officer’s power to investigate cognizable case.
           – (1) Any officer in charge of a police station may, without the
           order of a Magistrate, investigate any cognizable case  which  a
           Court having jurisdiction over the local area within the  limits
           of such station would have power to inquire into  or  try  under
           the provisions of Chapter XIII.

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">            (2) No proceeding of a police officer in any such case shall at

</blockquote><p id="p_18">17.         <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_40">Section 190</a> falls in Chapter XIV  and reads as under:

</blockquote><p id="p_19">18.          Chapter  XV  of  the  Code  deals  with   the   complaints   to

</p><p id="p_24">23.         <a href="/doc/1149595/" id="a_62">Section 202</a> of the Code has twin objects; one,   to  enable  the
Magistrate to scrutinize carefully the allegations  made  in  the  complaint
with a view to prevent a person named therein as accused from  being  called
upon to face an  unnecessary,  frivolous  or  meritless  complaint  and  the
other,  to  find  out  whether  there  is  some  material  to  support   the
allegations made in the complaint. The Magistrate has a duty to  elicit  all
facts having regard to the interest of an absent accused person and also  to
bring to book a person or persons against whom the   allegations  have  been
made. To find out the above, the Magistrate  himself  may  hold  an  inquiry
under <a href="/doc/1149595/" id="a_63">Section 202</a> of the Code or  direct an investigation to be  made  by  a
police officer. The dismissal of the complaint under <a href="/doc/443138/" id="a_64">Section 203</a> is  without
doubt a pre-issuance of process stage. The Code does not permit  an  accused
person to intervene in  the  course  of  inquiry  by  the  Magistrate  under
<a href="/doc/1149595/" id="a_65">Section 202</a>. The legal position is no more  res   integra  in  this  regard.

ascertaining  the  truth  or  falsehood  of   the   complaint,   i.e.,   for
ascertaining whether there was evidence in support of the  complaint  so  as
to justify the issuance of process and commencement of  proceedings  against
the person concerned.

occasion to consider <a href="/doc/1149595/" id="a_70">Section 202</a> of the old  Code.  The  Court  referred  to
the earlier decision of this Court in Vadilal Panchal14  and   few  previous

present <a href="/doc/1149595/" id="a_76">Section 202</a> of the Code) was to enable the  Magistrate  to  form  an
opinion as to whether process should be issued or not  and  to  remove  from
his mind any hesitation that he may have felt upon the mere perusal  of  the
complaint and the consideration of the complainant’s evidence on oath.    It
was further held that an accused person does not come into  the  picture  at
all till process is issued.

           Criminal Procedure is extremely limited — limited  only  to  the
           ascertainment of the truth or falsehood of the allegations  made
           in the complaint— (i) on the materials placed by the complainant
           before the court; (ii) for the limited purpose  of  finding  out

           out; and (iii) for deciding the question purely from  the  point
           of view of the complainant  without  at  all  adverting  to  any
           defence that the accused may have. In fact it  is  well  settled
           that in proceedings  under  <a href="/doc/1149595/" id="a_79">Section  202</a>  the  accused  has  got
           absolutely no locus standi and is not entitled to  be  heard  on

the above provisions was explained in the following manner:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_34">            “12. <a href="/doc/444619/" id="a_83">Section 200</a> contemplates a Magistrate taking cognizance of
            an offence on complaint to examine the  complaint  and  examine
            upon oath the complainant and the witnesses present, if any. If
            on such examination of the complaint and the witnesses, if any,
            the Magistrate if he does not want to postpone the issuance  of
            process has to dismiss the complaint under <a href="/doc/443138/" id="a_84">Section  203</a>  if  he
            comes to the conclusion that the complaint,  the  statement  of
            the complainant and the witnesses have not made out  sufficient
            ground for proceeding. Per contra,  if  he  is  satisfied  that
            there is no need for further inquiry  and  the  complaint,  the
            evidence adduced at that stage have materials  to  proceed,  he
            can proceed to issue process under <a href="/doc/1827798/" id="a_85">Section 204</a> of the Code.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_35">            13.  <a href="/doc/1149595/" id="a_86">Section  202</a>  contemplates  “postponement  of   issue   of
            process”. It provides that if the Magistrate on  receipt  of  a
            complaint, if he  thinks  fit,  to  postpone  the  issuance  of
            process against the accused and desires  further  inquiry  into
            the case either by himself or directs an  investigation  to  be
            made by a police officer or by such other person as  he  thinks
            fit for the  purpose  of  deciding  whether  or  not  there  is
            sufficient ground for proceeding, he may do so. In that process
            if he thinks it fit he may even take evidence of  witnesses  on
            oath, and after such investigation, inquiry and the  report  of
            the police if sought for by the Magistrate and if he  finds  no
            sufficient ground for proceeding he can dismiss  the  complaint
            by recording briefly the reasons for doing so  as  contemplated
            under <a href="/doc/443138/" id="a_87">Section 203</a> of the Code.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_36">            14. But after taking cognizance of the complaint and  examining
            the complainant and the witnesses if he is satisfied that there
            is sufficient ground to proceed with the complaint he can issue
            process by way of  summons  under  <a href="/doc/1827798/" id="a_88">Section  204</a>  of  the  Code.
            Therefore, what is  necessary  or  a  condition  precedent  for
            issuing process under <a href="/doc/1827798/" id="a_89">Section 204</a> is the  satisfaction  of  the
            Magistrate either by examination of  the  complainant  and  the
            witnesses or by the inquiry contemplated under <a href="/doc/1149595/" id="a_90">Section 202</a> that
            there is sufficient ground for proceeding  with  the  complaint
            hence issue the process under <a href="/doc/1827798/" id="a_91">Section 204</a> of the Code. In  none
            of these stages<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_92"> the Code</a> has provided for hearing the  summoned
            accused, for obvious reasons because this is only a preliminary
            stage and the stage of hearing of the accused would only  arise
            at a subsequent stage provided for in the latter  provision  in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_93">
            the Code</a>. It is true as held  by  this  Court  in  Mathew  case
            [(1992)  1  SCC  217]  that  before  issuance  of  summons  the
            Magistrate should be satisfied that there is sufficient  ground
            for proceeding with the complaint but that satisfaction  is  to
            be arrived at by the inquiry conducted by him  as  contemplated
            under <a href="/doc/444619/" id="a_94">Sections 200</a> and <a href="/doc/1149595/" id="a_95">202</a>, and the only stage of dismissal  of
            the complaint arises under <a href="/doc/443138/" id="a_96">Section 203</a> of  the  Code  at  which
            stage the accused has no role to play, therefore, the  question
            of the accused on receipt of summons approaching the court  and
            making an application for  dismissal  of  the  complaint  under
            <a href="/doc/443138/" id="a_97">Section 203</a> of the Code on a reconsideration  of  the  material
            available on record is impermissible because  by  then  <a href="/doc/443138/" id="a_98">Section
            203</a> is already over and the Magistrate has proceeded further to
            <a href="/doc/1827798/" id="a_99">Section 204</a> stage.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_37">            15. It is true that if a  Magistrate  takes  cognizance  of  an
            offence, issues process  without  there  being  any  allegation
            against the accused or any material implicating the accused  or
            in contravention of provisions of <a href="/doc/444619/" id="a_100">Sections  200</a>  and  <a href="/doc/1149595/" id="a_101">202</a>,  the
            order of the Magistrate may be vitiated, but then the relief an
            aggrieved accused can obtain at that stage is not  by  invoking
            <a href="/doc/443138/" id="a_102">Section 203</a> of the Code because<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_103">  the  Criminal  Procedure  Code</a>
            does not contemplate a review of an order. Hence in the absence
            of any review power or  inherent  power  with  the  subordinate
            criminal courts, the remedy lies in invoking <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_104">Section 482</a> of the
            Code.”



</blockquote><p id="p_28">27.         The procedural scheme in  respect  of  the  complaints  made  to
Magistrates is provided in Chapter XV of the  Code.  On  a  complaint  being
made to a Magistrate taking cognizance of an offence, he  is  required    to
examine the complainant on oath and the  witnesses,  if  any,  and  then  on
considering the complaint and the statements on oath,  if   he   is  of  the
opinion that there is no sufficient ground  for  proceeding,  the  complaint
shall be dismissed after recording brief reasons. The  Magistrate  may  also
on receipt of a complaint of which  he  is  authorised  to  take  cognizance
proceed with further inquiry into the  allegations  made  in  the  complaint
either himself or direct  an  investigation  into  the  allegations  in  the
complaint to be made by a police officer or  by  such  other  person  as  he
thinks fit for the purpose of deciding whether or not  there  is  sufficient
ground for proceeding. In that event, the Magistrate in fact  postpones  the
issue of process.  On conclusion of the inquiry by himself or on receipt  of
report from the police officer or  from  such  other  person  who  has  been
directed to  investigate  into  the  allegations,  if,  in  the  opinion  of
Magistrate taking cognizance of an offence there  is  no  sufficient  ground
for proceeding, complaint is  dismissed  under  <a href="/doc/443138/" id="a_105">Section  203</a>  or  where  the
Magistrate  is  of  the  opinion  that  there  is  sufficient   ground   for
proceeding, then a process is issued. In a summons  case,  summons  for  the
attendance of the accused is issued and in a  warrant  case  the  Magistrate
may either issue a warrant or a  summons  for  causing  the  accused  to  be
brought or to appear before him.

of an offence” at various places.  Although the expression  is  not  defined
in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_106"> the Code</a>, but it has acquired definite meaning for the purposes<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_107">  of   the
Code</a>.
</p><p id="p_30">29.         <a href="/doc/779575/" id="a_108">In R.R. Chari v. The State of Uttar  Pradesh</a>  [20],  this  Court

action of any kind but it takes place no sooner  a  Magistrate  applies  his
mind to the suspected commission of an offence.

            impossible to  attempt  to  define  what  is  meant  by  taking
            cognizance. Issuing of a search warrant for the purpose  of  an
            investigation or of a warrant of arrest for that purpose cannot
            by themselves be regarded as acts by which cognizance was taken
            of an offence. Obviously, it is only when a Magistrate  applies

Court reiterated what was stated in R.R. Chari20.  It was further  explained
that cognizance takes place  at  a  point  when  a  Magistrate  first  takes
judicial notice of an offence on a complaint, or  a police report,  or  upon
information of a person other than a police officer.
</p><p id="p_33">32.         In Kishun Singh5, while  dealing  with  the  expression  “taking

taken by a Magistrate when he takes notice of the  accusations  and  applies
his mind to the allegations made  in  the  complaint  or  police  report  or
information and on being satisfied that the allegations,  if  proved,  would
constitute an offence, decides to initiate judicial proceedings against  the

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_39">           “43. Similarly, when Section  20-A(2)  of  TADA  makes  sanction
           necessary for taking cognizance — it is only to prevent abuse of
           power by authorities concerned. It requires  to  be  noted  that
           this provision of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_116">Section 20-A</a> came to be inserted by Act 43  of
           1993. Then,  the  question  is  as  to  the  meaning  of  taking
           cognizance. <a href="/doc/686759/" id="a_117">Section 190</a> of  the  Code  talks  of  cognizance  of
           offences by Magistrates. This expression has not been defined in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_118">
           the Code</a>. In its broad and literal sense, it means taking notice
           of an offence. This would include the  intention  of  initiating
           judicial proceedings against the offender  in  respect  of  that
           offence or taking steps to see whether there is  any  basis  for
           initiating judicial proceedings or for other purposes. The  word
           ‘cognizance’ indicates the point when a Magistrate  or  a  Judge
           first takes judicial notice of an  offence.  It  is  entirely  a
           different thing from initiation of proceedings; rather it is the
           condition precedent to the  initiation  of  proceedings  by  the

</blockquote><p id="p_36">35.         On  behalf  of  the  appellants,   it  was  submitted  that  the
direction by  the  CJM  to  the  Police  Officer  to  investigate  into  the
allegations made in  the  complaint  amounts  to  taking  cognizance  of  an
offence and the  dismissal of the complaint by the  CJM  under  <a href="/doc/443138/" id="a_120">Section  203</a>
of the Code was after he had taken cognizance of the offence. On  the  other
hand,  on behalf of the respondent no. 1,  it was vehemently contended  that
dismissal of complaint by the CJM under <a href="/doc/443138/" id="a_121">Section 203</a> of the  Code  was  at  a
pre-cognizance stage. The submission on behalf of the respondent  no.  1  is
that no cognizance has been taken by the  CJM  while  directing  the  Police
Officer to investigate into the allegations of the complaint.
</p><p id="p_37">36.         We shall immediately advert to the aspect  whether  or  not  CJM
had taken cognizance of  the  offence  and  whether  the  dismissal  of  the
complaint under <a href="/doc/443138/" id="a_122">Section 203</a> in the matter was post-taking cognizance.
</p><p id="p_38">37.         The word, “cognizance” occurring  in  various  Sections  in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_123">  the
Code</a> is a word of wide import. It embraces  within  itself  all  powers  and
authority in exercise of jurisdiction and taking of authoritative notice  of
the allegations made in the complaint or a police report or any  information
received that offence has been committed. In the context  of  <a href="/doc/444619/" id="a_124">Sections  200</a>,
<a href="/doc/1149595/" id="a_125">202</a> and <a href="/doc/443138/" id="a_126">203</a>, the expression `taking cognizance’ has been used in  the  sense
of  taking notice of the complaint or the first information  report  or  the
information that offence has  been  committed  on  application  of  judicial
mind. It does not necessarily mean issuance of process.
</p><p id="p_39">38.         Having regard to the above legal position,  if the order of  the
CJM passed on 18.6.2004 is seen, it becomes apparent  that  he  had  applied
judicial mind on the complaint that day.  The order  records,  “on  perusing
the complaint and the accompanying documents,  in  the  said  matter  it  is
necessary to take into custody the documents mentioned in the complaint.  It
is necessary to find out the persons who  have  forged  signatures  on  such
documents, and record their statements, and to compare the  said  signatures
with the signatures of the family members of the complainant,  and  in  this
regard obtain the opinion from the Handwriting  Expert, in view of all  this
such investigations cannot be done by the Court, in view of this fact  below
<a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_127">Section 156(3)</a> of  Cr.P.C. in the matter of the said  complaint  for  police
investigations it is hereby ordered to send the said inquiry  to  the  P.I.,
Umra, Police Station. And,  he is ordered to investigate thoroughly in  this
matter and within 30 days present the report before this Court”.
</p><p id="p_40">39.         From the above order passed by the CJM,  there remains no  doubt
that on 18.06.2004, he had taken cognizance although he  postponed issue  of
process by directing an investigation to be made  by  Police  Officer.   The
submission of the learned counsel for the respondent no.1 that the  CJM  had
not taken cognizance in the matter and the  complaint  was  dismissed  under
<a href="/doc/443138/" id="a_128">Section 203</a> at the pre-cognizance stage has no substance and is rejected.
</p><p id="p_41">40.         The question now is, in a matter of this nature where  complaint
has been dismissed by  the  Magistrate  under  <a href="/doc/443138/" id="a_129">Section  203</a>  post-cognizance
stage and pre-issuance of process, whether  on challenge to the legality  of
the order of dismissal of complaint being  laid  by  the  complainant  in  a
revision application before the High Court, the persons  who  are  arraigned
as accused in the complaint have a right to be heard.
</p><p id="p_42">41.         Before we deal with the above question  further,   some  of  the
decisions of the High Courts upon which heavy reliance was  placed   by  the
counsel for the respondent no. 1  may  be  noticed.  In  Panatar  Arvindbhai
Ratilal12, a Single Judge of the Gujarat  High  Court  had  an  occasion  to
consider  locus standi of  the  suspects  at  the  stage  of  grant  of  ‘C’
Summary.  That  was  a  case  where  the  police  did   not   initiate   any
investigation for quite some time in respect of an offence  registered  with
the police station. The complainant approached  the  CJM  wherein  direction
for  investigation by the police was made. The  police  after  investigation
submitted report and sought ‘C’ Summary. The  complainant  objected  to  the
report submitted by the police as to ‘C’  Summary.  The  Magistrate  allowed
the suspects to be heard against which the complainant  filed  the  criminal
revision before the Sessions Judge.  The  Sessions  Judge  agreed  with  the
complainant and overruled the order  of the Magistrate allowing the  accused
to make submission. There were seven accused in the  complaint  and  two  of
them approached  the High Court against the order  of  the  Sessions  Judge.
The Single Judge of the High Court confirmed the order  of  Sessions  Judge.
The Magistrate thereafter heard the complainant and  granted   ‘C’  Summary.
Against that order, the complainant filed a  revision  before  the  Sessions
Judge. Two accused who had earlier challenged  the  order  of  the  Sessions
Judge before the High Court applied to the Sessions Judge for permission  to
make submission in support of the order of  the   Magistrate.  The  Sessions
Judge allowed the application made by the accused against  which  order  the
complainant filed criminal revision before the High Court.  The  High  Court
noted the provisions contained in <a href="/doc/1846048/" id="a_130">Sections 397(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/803870/" id="a_131">403</a> of  the  Code  and
then held that allowing the suspects to be heard at this stage would  amount
to permitting them to have their say at the stage which is not  contemplated
by<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_132"> the Code</a> and it would be giving a premature hearing to the accused.   The
High Court was persuaded by  the  submission  of  the  complainant  that  an
accused cannot be given  pre-trial  hearing.  The  High  Court  observed  as
follows :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_41">           “6. The views consistently expressed by this Court as well as by
           the Supreme Court about the hearing of the suspects at the stage
           of granting of 'C’ summary or not is clearly to the effect  that
           they have no locus standi.

<blockquote id="blockquote_42">           7. In this background we  turn  to  the  submission  made  under
           <a href="/doc/803870/" id="a_133">Section 403</a> of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure,  by  learned
           Advocate Shri J.R. Nanavati. There again at first sight it might
           appear that party referred to in the said  section  could  be  a
           party other than one arrayed before the Court  on  either  side,
           but when we realise that the  matter  to  be  dealt  with  under
           Chapter 30<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_134"> of the Code</a>  of  Criminal  Procedure  wherein  occurs
           <a href="/doc/803870/" id="a_135">Section 403</a> power is that of a Revision and it being  the  power
           exercised by the Court, a party may or may not be heard  as  the
           Court may decide and this alone would explain the  inclusion  of
           <a href="/doc/803870/" id="a_136">Section 403</a> in that Chapter.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_43">           8. Otherwise all the procedural laws have as its foundation  the
           maxim Audi Alterem Partem and at all stages wherever the need be
           there are provision for issuance of notice and making sure  that
           the party against whom the orders are  being  sought  is  heard.
           Therefore, there was no need of inclusion of <a href="/doc/803870/" id="a_137">Section 403</a> at  the
           place where we find it and we can appreciate it only and only if
           bearing in mind the fact that it being a  chapter  dealing  with
           revisional jurisdiction which  is  expressly  privilege  of  the
           Court realising the order of subordinate Court that there  might
           be an occasion, the party need not be or may not be  heard,  and
           therefore, there is a specific provision in that behalf.

<blockquote id="blockquote_44">           9. Once we appreciate the aforesaid section  in  this  light  of
           submissions made by learned Advocate Shri Nanavati pertaining to
           the aforesaid decision of the Gujarat High Court as well as that
           of the Supreme Court on hearing of the suspects at the stage  of
           granting of 'C' summary, can also be understood because the same
           principle will apply whether the accused are  being  dealt  with
           under Chapter 13 or 17<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_138"> of the  Code</a>  of  Criminal  Procedure  or

</blockquote><p id="p_43">42.         The Madhya Pradesh High Court in Ratanlal Soni13  was  concerned
with the legality of an order passed by Additional  Sessions  Judge  without
notice to the accused persons who were arrayed  as  non-applicants  therein.
The Single Judge of that Court referred to two decisions of  this  Court  in
Chandra Deo Singh7  and Smt. Nagawwa8 and couple of decisions  of  the  High
Court and stated in paragraph 6 of the Report as under :
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_45">           “6. In view of the aforesaid enunciation of law it is luminously
           clear that  the  accused-has  no  locus  standi  to  appear  and
           participate  before  the  process  is  issued.  This  being  the
           accepted position of law it can safely be concluded that when  a
           revision  is  filed  challenging  the  order  refusing  to  take
           cognizance the accused has no locus standi to contest. He is not
           a necessary party. The determination is to be made by the  Court
           to find out the approach of the Court below  and  to  scrutinise
           the justifiability of the order  refusing  to  take  cognizance.
           This being the position of  law  disposal  of  revision  by  the
           revisional Court without issuing notice to the non-applicant  is
           not infirm or pregnable. Once it has been held that the  accused
           persons have no role  to  play  before  process  is  issued  the
           revision  at  their  instance  challenging  the  order  of   the
           revisional Court directing  the  Magistrate  to  reconsider  the
           matter is not tenable as they cannot raise grievance  in  regard
           to the same as  yet  there  is  no  direction  for  issuance  of

</blockquote><p id="p_44">43.         A Single Judge of Punjab  and  Haryana  High  Court  in  Gurdeep
Singh11 was concerned with a petition under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_141">Section 482</a> of  the  Code  filed
by the accused seeking quashment of the order passed by the  Sessions  Judge
setting aside the order of the CJM whereby the complaint was  dismissed  for
want of prosecution. The dismissal of complaint  by  the  CJM  for  want  of
prosecution was at the initial stage. The challenge  to  the  order  of  the
Sessions Judge by the accused was on the  ground  that  the  Sessions  Judge
while allowing the revision application  had  infringed  the  provisions  of
<a href="/doc/949039/" id="a_142">Section 401(2)</a> of the Code inasmuch as no opportunity  of  being  heard  was
given to the accused although  the  complaint  was  dismissed  for  want  of
prosecution. The Single Judge of that Court took the view as follows :
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_46">            “14. …….By no  stretch  of  imagination,  in  my  opinion,  the
            accused can seek the setting aside of the order passed  by  the
            Sessions Judge on the ground that the said order was passed  by
            the Sessions Judge without issuing notice to  the  accused.  As
            referred to above, the accused petitioner cannot  take  benefit
            of provisions of <a href="/doc/949039/" id="a_143">Section 401(2)</a> Cr.P.C. as it could not be said
            that any order to the prejudice or against the  petitioner  had
            been passed by the learned Sessions Judge. On the  other  hand,
            the order, - vide which the complaint was dismissed for want of
            prosecution was set aside by the learned Sessions Judge. If the
            case of the accused petitioner was not  covered  under  <a href="/doc/949039/" id="a_144">Section
            401(2)</a> Cr.P.C., it was not at all  necessary  for  the  learned
            Sessions Judge to  have  heard  the  accused  petitioner  while
            setting aside the order of the learned Magistrate  in  view  of
            the provisions of <a href="/doc/803870/" id="a_145">Section 403</a> Cr.P.C. Even otherwise in view of
            the proviso to <a href="/doc/534676/" id="a_146">Section 398</a> Cr.P.C.  only  the  person  who  was
            discharged had  a  right  to  be  heard  before  the  order  of
            discharge could be set  aside  in  revision  by  the  Court  of
            Sessions in exercise of its revisional  jurisdiction.  In  this
            view of the matter,  in  my  opinion,  the  contention  of  the
            learned counsel for  the  accused  petitioner  that  the  order
            passed by the learned Sessions Judge was liable to be set aside
            only on the ground that the accused petitioner was  not  heard,
            could not be sustained.”


</blockquote><p id="p_45">44.         In Tata Motors Limited, Single  Judge  of  the  High  Court  was
concerned with controversy arising out of complaint which was  dismissed  by
the Metropolitan Magistrate under <a href="/doc/443138/" id="a_147">Section 203</a> of the Code in limine. In  the
revision petition  filed  under  <a href="/doc/1457888/" id="a_148">Section  397</a>  read  with  <a href="/doc/1571667/" id="a_149">Section  401</a>  and
<a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_150">Section 482</a> of the Code, it was contended on behalf of the complainant  that
the Metropolitan Magistrate erred  in  taking  into  consideration  possible
defence of the accused instead of ascertaining whether  on  a  consideration
of the complaint and the pre-summoning evidence,  a  prima  facie  case  had
been made out for summoning the accused for the  offence  mentioned  in  the
complaint.  It was also argued on behalf of the complainant before the  High
Court that  the  accused  persons  have  not  yet  been  summoned  and  even
cognizance of the case has not been taken  by  the  Metropolitan  Magistrate
and, therefore, there was no occasion at all for the accused persons  to  be
heard. It was also argued on behalf of the  complainant  that  at  the  pre-
cognizance stage, there was no  question  of  the  accused  being  given  an
opportunity even in a revision petition filed  by  the  complainant  against
the order of dismissal of complaint. On  the  contrary,  on  behalf  of  the
accused persons it was argued that under <a href="/doc/949039/" id="a_151">Section 401(2)</a>  of  the  Code,   if
adverse order is going  to  be  passed  in  revision  petition  which  might
prejudice either the accused or any other person then such a person  has  to
be mandatorily given an opportunity of being heard either personally  or  by
pleader in defence.  The Single Judge of that Court on consideration of  the
submissions of the parties and the decisions cited  before  him  culled  out
the legal position as follows :
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_47">           “20.  xxx   xxx  xxx


</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_48">              1) There is a distinction to be  drawn  between  the  criminal
                 complaint cases which are at the pre-cognizance  stage  and
                 those at the post-cognizance  stage.  There  is  a  further
                 distinction to be drawn between  the  cases  at  the  post-
                 cognizance but pre-summoning stage and those at  the  post-
                 summoning stage.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_49">           (2)    It  is  only  at  the  post-summoning  stage   that   the
           respondents in a criminal complaint would answer the description
           of an ‘accused’. Till then they are like any other member of the
           public. Therefore at the pre-summoning  stage  the  question  of
           their  right  to  be  heard  in  a  revision  petition  by   the
           complainant in their capacity as “accused” in terms  of  <a href="/doc/949039/" id="a_152">Section
           401(2)</a> CrPC does not arise.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_50">           3)     At the post-cognizance but pre-summoning stage, a  person
              against whom the complaint is filed might have a right to  be
              heard under the rubric of ‘other person’ under <a href="/doc/949039/" id="a_153">Section 401(2)</a>
              CrPC. If the learned MM has not taken the cognizance  of  the
              offence then no  right  whatsoever  accrues  to  such  “other
              person” to be heard in a revision petition.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_51">           (4)   Further, it is not that in every revision  petition  filed
           by the complainant under <a href="/doc/949039/" id="a_154">Section 401(2)</a> CrPC, a right of hearing
           has to be given to such “other person” or  the  accused  against
           whom the criminal complaint has been filed.  The  right  accrues
           only if the order to be  passed  in  the  revision  petition  is
           prejudicial to such person or the accused.  An  order  giving  a
           specific direction to the learned MM to either proceed with  the
           case either at the post-cognizance or post-summoning stage or  a
           direction to register an FIR with a direction to the learned  MM
           to  proceed  thereafter  might  be  orders  prejudicial  to  the
           respondents  in  a  criminal  complaint  which  would  therefore
           require them to be heard prior, to the passing of  such  order.”








</blockquote><p id="p_46">45.         On facts obtaining in the case, the Single Judge  observed  that
the Metropolitan Magistrate had not even taken cognizance  of  the  offences
and, therefore, there was no question of the applicants being heard  at  the
stage of revision application.
</p>

<p id="p_47">46.         The above decision of  the  Delhi  High  Court  in  Tata  Motors
Limited came up for consideration of that Court in Prakash Devi  and  others
v. State of Delhi and another [Criminal  Miscellaneous  Case  No.  2626/2009
decided on February 5, 2010]. The Single Judge, on facts of the  case  which
were under consideration  before  him,  observed  that  the  Magistrate  had
dismissed  the  complaint  filed  by  the  complainant  after  taking   into
consideration the status report filed by the police. The Magistrate had  not
examined the complainant and other witnesses under <a href="/doc/1149595/" id="a_155">Section 202</a> of  the  Code
and in the revision filed  by  the  complainant  the  revisional  court  had
remanded the matter to the Magistrate to grant another  opportunity  to  the
complainant  to lead pre-summoning evidence and to proceed in the matter  in
accordance with law and, therefore, there was no occasion for  the  Sessions
Judge to accord hearing to the accused persons.   The  High  Court  held  as
under:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_52">             “16. …….As already  discussed  above,  the  character  of  the
            petitioner was still not that of an accused  as  the  complaint
            filed by the respondent was dismissed under <a href="/doc/443138/" id="a_156">Section 203</a> Cr.P.C.
            and since the matter was remanded back  to  the  Magistrate  to
            grant opportunity to  the  complainant  to  lead  pre-summoning
            evidence,  therefore,  the  said  order  does  not  cause   any
            prejudice to the rights of the petitioner. Even after the  said
            remand,  the  fate  of  the  complaint  case  could  either  be
            dismissal under <a href="/doc/443138/" id="a_157">Section 203</a> or under 204 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_158">Cr.P.C</a>., if the  Court
            with the fresh material before it, comes to the  conclusion  to
            proceed against the respondent. Since in the present  case  the
            process was not yet  issued  against  the  petitioner  and  the
            complaint was dismissed under<a href="/doc/443138/" id="a_159"> S.  203</a>  of  Cr.P.C.,  therefore,
            preceding the said stage, the petitioner had no right  to  seek
            opportunity of hearing before the Revisional Court in the light
            of the legal position discussed above.”






</blockquote><p id="p_48">47.         It may not be out of place to refer to an  earlier  decision  of
the Delhi High Court in <a href="/doc/1939643/" id="a_160">A.S. Puri v. K.L. Ahuja</a>[24].  In  that  case,  inter
alia, the question before the High Court  was  whether  Additional  Sessions
Judge had committed an error in  hearing  the  arguments  of  the  accused’s
counsel to whom he had not ordered notice of  the  revision  petition  filed
before him by the complainant. The Single Judge of  that  Court  dealt  with
the question as under :

           to address arguments, when he was present in Court at  the  time
           of the hearing of the revision petition. It appears that  notice
           of the revision petition did go to Mr. Puri but  as  it  appears
           from the docket the learned Additional Sessions Judge  had  only
           ordered notice to the respondent, which was the State.  If  even
           by any error committed by the Officer of the learned Magistrate,
           notice had also gone to Mr. Puri nothing prevented  the  learned
           Additional Sessions Judge from hearing Mr. Puri for it  was  his
           discretion to hear him. A Full Bench of the Calcutta High Court,
           consisting of eight Judges, pointed out in <a href="/doc/741093/" id="a_161">Hari Dass  Sanyal  v.
           Saritulla</a>, (1888) ILR 15 Cal 608 (FB), that while no  notice  to
           an  accused  person  was  necessary   in  point  of  law  before
           disposing of a revision petition directed against the  order  of
           dismissal  under  <a href="/doc/443138/" id="a_162">Section  203</a>,<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_163">  Criminal  Procedure  Code</a>   and
           ordering a further enquiry as a  matter  of  discretion  it  was
           proper that such a notice  was  given.  In  spite  of  that  the
           learned Additional Sessions Judge had set  aside  the  order  of
           dismissal. In this situation the  complainant  cannot  make  any
           further grievance of this.”






</blockquote><p id="p_49">48.          The  legal  position  is  fairly  well-settled  that   in   the
proceedings under <a href="/doc/1149595/" id="a_164">Section  202</a>  of  the  Code  the  accused/suspect  is  not
entitled to be heard on the question whether the process  should  be  issued
against him or not.  As a matter of law,  upto  the  stage  of  issuance  of
process, the accused  cannot  claim  any  right  of  hearing.   <a href="/doc/1149595/" id="a_165">Section  202</a>
contemplates postponement of issue of process where the Magistrate is of  an
opinion that further  inquiry  into  the  complaint  either  by  himself  is
required  and  he  proceeds  with  the  further  inquiry   or   directs   an
investigation to be made by a Police Officer or by such other person  as  he
thinks fit for the purpose of deciding whether or not  there  is  sufficient
ground for proceeding. If the Magistrate finds that there is  no  sufficient
ground for proceeding with  the  complaint   and  dismisses  the   complaint
under <a href="/doc/443138/" id="a_166">Section 203</a> of the Code,  the question is whether a person accused  of
crime in the complaint can claim right of hearing in a revision  application
preferred by the complainant against the  order  of  the  dismissal  of  the
complaint. The Parliament  being  alive  to  the  legal  position  that  the
accused/suspects  are  not  entitled  to  be  heard  at  any  stage  of  the
proceedings until issuance of process under <a href="/doc/1827798/" id="a_167">Section  204</a>,  yet   in  <a href="/doc/949039/" id="a_168">Section
401(2)</a> of the Code provided that no order in exercise of the  power  of  the
revision shall be made by the Sessions Judge or the High Court, as the  case
may be,  to the prejudice of the accused or  the other person unless he  had
an opportunity of being heard either personally or by  pleader  in  his  own
defence. Three expressions, “prejudice”, “other  person”  and  “in  his  own
defence” in <a href="/doc/949039/" id="a_169">Section 401(2)</a> are  significant  for  understanding  their  true
scope, ambit and width. Black’s Law  Dictionary  [Eighth  Edition]  explains
“prejudice” to mean damage or detriment to one’s  legal  rights  or  claims.
Concise  Oxford  English  Dictionary  [Tenth   Edition,   Revised]   defines
“prejudice” as under :
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_54">           “1. Preconceived opinion that is not based on reason  or  actual
           experience. &gt; unjust behaviour formed on such a basis. 2.   harm
           or injury that  results  or  may  result  from  some  action  or
           judgment.  v.1   give  rise  to  prejudice  in  (someone);  make
           biased. 2. cause harm to (a state of affairs)”.
</blockquote>





<p id="p_50">49.          Webster  Comprehensive   Dictionary   [International   Edition]
explains “prejudice” to mean  (i)  a  judgment  or  opinion,  favourable  or
unfavourable, formed beforehand or without due examination  …….;   detriment
arising from a hasty and unfair judgment; injury; harm.
</p>

<p id="p_51">50.         P. Ramanatha Aiyar;  the  Law  Lexicon  [The  Encyclopaedic  Law
Dictionary] explains “prejudice” to mean  injurious  effect,  injury  to  or
impairment of a right, claim, statement etc.


</p><p id="p_52">51.         “Prejudice”  is generally defined as meaning “to  the  harm,  to
the injury, to the disadvantage of someone”. It also means injury or loss.
</p>

<p id="p_53">52.         The expression “other person” in the context of  <a href="/doc/949039/" id="a_170">Section  401(2)</a>
means a person other than accused.  It  includes  suspects  or  the  persons
alleged in the complaint to have been involved in an offence  although  they
may not be termed as accused at a stage before  issuance of process.
</p>

<p id="p_54">53.         The expression “in his own  defence”  comprehends,  inter  alia,
for the purposes of <a href="/doc/949039/" id="a_171">Section 401(2)</a>, in defence of the order which  is  under
challenge in revision before the Sessions Judge or the High Court.
</p>

<p id="p_55">54.         In a  case  where  the  complaint  has  been  dismissed  by  the
Magistrate under <a href="/doc/443138/" id="a_172">Section 203</a> of the Code either at the stage of <a href="/doc/444619/" id="a_173">Section  200</a>
itself or on completion of inquiry by the Magistrate under  <a href="/doc/1149595/" id="a_174">Section  202</a>  or
on receipt of the report from the police or from any   person  to  whom  the
direction was issued by the Magistrate to investigate into  the  allegations
in the complaint, the effect of such dismissal is termination  of  complaint
proceedings.  On a  plain reading of sub-section (2)  of  <a href="/doc/1571667/" id="a_175">Section  401</a>,   it
cannot be said that the person   against  whom  the  allegations  of  having
committed offence have been made in the  complaint  and  the  complaint  has
been dismissed by the Magistrate under <a href="/doc/443138/" id="a_176">Section 203</a>,   has  no  right  to  be
heard because no process has been issued. The dismissal of complaint by  the
Magistrate under <a href="/doc/443138/" id="a_177">Section 203</a> –  although  it  is   at  preliminary  stage  –
nevertheless results in termination of proceedings in  a  complaint  against
the persons who are alleged to have committed crime.  Once  a  challenge  is
laid to such order  at  the  instance  of  the  complainant  in  a  revision
petition before the High Court or  Sessions  Judge,  by  virtue  of  <a href="/doc/949039/" id="a_178">Section
401(2)</a> of the Code, the suspects get  right  of  hearing  before  revisional
court although such order  was  passed  without  their  participation.   The
right given to “accused” or “the  other  person”  under  <a href="/doc/949039/" id="a_179">Section  401(2)</a>  of
being heard before the revisional court to defend an  order  which  operates
in his  favour  should  not  be  confused  with  the  proceedings  before  a
Magistrate  under  <a href="/doc/444619/" id="a_180">Sections  200</a>,  <a href="/doc/1149595/" id="a_181">202</a>,  <a href="/doc/443138/" id="a_182">203</a>   and  <a href="/doc/1827798/" id="a_183">204</a>.  In   the  revision
petition before  the High Court or the Sessions Judge  at  the  instance  of
complainant challenging the order of dismissal  of  complaint,  one  of  the
things that could happen is reversal of the  order  of  the  Magistrate  and
revival of the complaint. It is in this view of the matter that the  accused
or other person cannot be  deprived  of  hearing  on  the  face  of  express
provision contained in <a href="/doc/949039/" id="a_184">Section  401(2)</a>  of  the  Code.   The  stage  is  not
important whether it is pre-process stage or post process stage.
</p>

<p id="p_56">55.         In  P.  Sundarrajan1,  a  two-Judge  Bench  of  this  Court  was
concerned with a case where a complaint under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_185">Section 420</a>  IPC  came  to  be
dismissed by the Judicial Magistrate. Against the order of dismissal of  the
complaint, the complainant  preferred  revision  petition  before  the  High
Court. The High Court was of the view that no notice was  necessary  to  the
suspects for disposal of the  revision  and  set  aside  the  order  of  the
Magistrate and directed the Magistrate to proceed with the complaint  afresh
in accordance with law. Against the order of the High  Court,  the  suspects
approached this Court under  <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_186">Article  136.</a>  The  Court   granted  leave  and
allowed the appeal, set aside the order of  the  High  Court  and  sent  the
matter back to the High Court with a direction to  issue  proper  notice  to
the persons accused of the crime in  the  complaint  and  proceed  with  the
revision petition after affording them a reasonable opportunity of  hearing.
This Court in paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Report (Pg. 472  and  473)  held  as
under:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_55">           “5. In our opinion, this order of the High  Court  is  ex  facie
           unsustainable in  law  by  not  giving  an  opportunity  to  the
           appellant herein to defend  his  case  that  the  learned  Judge
           violated  all  principles  of  natural  justice  as   also   the
           requirement of law of hearing a party before passing an  adverse
           order.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_56">           6. We have, therefore, no hesitation in  allowing  this  appeal,
           setting aside the impugned judgment and remanding the matter  to
           the High Court to issue proper notice to  the  appellant  herein
           who is the respondent in the criminal revision  petition  before
           it and afford him a reasonable opportunity  of  hearing  and  to
           pass appropriate orders. The appeal is allowed.”






</blockquote><p id="p_57">56.         In Raghu Raj Singh Rousha2, a two-Judge Bench of this Court  was
faced with a question whether, in the facts and circumstances of  the  case,
the High Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1457888/" id="a_187">Sections  397</a>  and  <a href="/doc/1571667/" id="a_188">401</a>
of the Code was justified in  passing   an  order  in  the  absence  of  the
accused persons.  That was a case where a complaint was filed under  <a href="/doc/444619/" id="a_189">Section
200</a> of the Code in respect of  offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_190">Sections 323</a>,  <a href="/doc/556739/" id="a_191">382</a>,
<a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_192">420</a>, <a href="/doc/1317063/" id="a_193">465</a>, <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_194">468</a>, <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_195">471</a>, <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_196">120-B</a>, <a href="/doc/180217/" id="a_197">506</a> and <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_198">34</a> of IPC.  Along with the complaint,  an
application  under  <a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_199">Section  156(3)</a>  was  also   made.    The   Metropolitan
Magistrate passed an order refusing to direct  investigation  under  <a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_200">Section
156(3)</a> and the complainant was asked to  lead  pre-summoning  evidence.  The
complainant aggrieved by the order of the Metropolitan  Magistrate  filed  a
revision petition before the High Court. The High Court with the consent  of
the APP appearing for the State set aside  the  order  of  the  Metropolitan
Magistrate with a direction to  him  to  examine  the  matter  afresh  after
calling for a report from the police authorities.  It  is  from  this  order
that the matter reached this Court at the instance of  the  suspect/accused.
The Court observed that if the Metropolitan Magistrate had taken  cognizance
of the offence and  issuance of summons upon the accused  persons  had  been
merely postponed, in a criminal revision filed  on  behalf  of  complainant,
the accused was entitled to be heard before the High Court.   <a href="/doc/1457888/" id="a_201">Sections  397</a>,
<a href="/doc/181589/" id="a_202">399</a> and <a href="/doc/1571667/" id="a_203">401</a> were noticed by this Court and so  also  few  earlier  decisions
including Chandra Deo Singh7, Vadilal Panchal14, P. Sundarrajan1   and  then
in paragraphs 22 and 23 (Pg. 369) of the Report, the Court  held as under :
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_57">            “22.  Here,  however,  the   learned   Magistrate   had   taken
            cognizance. He had applied his mind. He refused to exercise his
            jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/99487/" id="a_204">Section 156(3)</a> of the Code. He arrived at  a
            conclusion that the dispute is a private dispute in relation to
            an immovable property and, thus, police  investigation  is  not
            necessary. It was only with that intent in  view,  he  directed
            examination of the complainant  and  his  witnesses  so  as  to
            initiate and complete the procedure laid down under Chapter  XV
            of the Code.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_58">            23. We,  therefore,  are  of  the  opinion  that  the  impugned
            judgment cannot be sustained and is set aside accordingly.  The
            High Court shall implead  the  appellant  as  a  party  in  the
            criminal revision application, hear the matter afresh and  pass
            an appropriate order.”






</blockquote><p id="p_58">57.         In a comparatively recent order in  A.  N.  Santhanam3,  a  two-
Judge Bench of this Court was concerned with a question,  whether  the  High
Court committed an error in disposing  of  the  criminal  revision  petition
filed by the complainant without any notice to the accused.   On  behalf  of
the accused/suspect, it was argued that the High Court committed  the  error
in disposing of the criminal revision without any  notice  to  him.  On  the
other hand, on behalf of the complainant it was argued  that  no  notice  as
such was required to be issued to the accused as it  was  at  the  stage  of
taking cognizance. The Court  considered  <a href="/doc/1571667/" id="a_205">Section  401</a>,  particularly,  sub-
section (2) thereof and held as under :
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_59">            “A plain reading of Clause (2) of the said provision  makes  it
            abundantly clear  that  the  High  Court  in  exercise  of  its
            revisional  power  cannot  pass  any  order  which  may   cause
            prejudice to the accused or other  persons  unless  he  has  an
            opportunity of being heard either personally or by  pleader  in
            his own defence.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_60">            In the instant case it cannot be said that the  rights  of  the
            appellant have not been affected by the order of revision.  The
            complaint filed  by  the  respondent  which  was  rejected  for
            whatsoever reasons has been resurrected with a direction to the
            Magistrate to proceed with the complaint.  Undoubtedly, whether
            the appellant herein was an accused or not but  his  right  has
            been affected and the impugned order has  resulted  in  causing
            prejudice to him.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_61">            In the circumstances, we are of  the  view  that  the  decision
            cited  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the  respondent  has  no
            application whatsoever to the  facts  situation.  In  fact  the
            decision of this Court was in a case where  the  complaint  was
            taken cognizance  and  not  a  case  where  the  compliant  was
            rejected. In the circumstances, we hold  that  the  High  Court
            committed an error  in  allowing  the  revision  filed  by  the
            respondent herein without any notice to the appellant.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_62">            For the aforesaid reasons, the impugned order  is set aside and
            the Criminal  Revision  Case  No.  1045  of  2003  shall  stand
            restored to its file for hearing and disposal on  merits  after
            notice to the appellant herein.”


</blockquote><p id="p_59">58.         We are in complete agreement with the  view  expressed  by  this
Court in P. Sundarrajan1 , Raghu Raj Singh Rousha2 and A.  N.  Santhanam3  .
We hold,  as  it  must  be,   that  in  a  revision  petition  preferred  by
complainant before the High Court or  the   Sessions  Judge  challenging  an
order of the Magistrate dismissing the complaint under <a href="/doc/443138/" id="a_206">Section  203</a>  of  the
Code at  the  stage  under  <a href="/doc/444619/" id="a_207">Section  200</a>  or  after  following  the  process
contemplated under <a href="/doc/1149595/" id="a_208">Section 202</a> of the Code, the accused or a person  who  is
suspected to have committed crime is entitled to hearing by  the  revisional
court. In other words, where complaint has been dismissed by the  Magistrate
under <a href="/doc/443138/" id="a_209">Section 203</a> of the Code, upon challenge to the legality  of  the  said
order being laid by the complainant in a revision petition  before the  High
Court or the Sessions Judge, the persons who are arraigned   as  accused  in
the complaint have a right to be heard in such revision petition.   This  is
a plain requirement of <a href="/doc/949039/" id="a_210">Section 401(2)</a>  of  the  Code.    If  the  revisional
court overturns the order of the Magistrate  dismissing  the  complaint  and
the complaint is restored  to the file of the  Magistrate  and  it  is  sent
back for fresh consideration, the persons who are alleged in  the  complaint
to have committed crime have,  however,  no  right  to  participate  in  the
proceedings nor they are entitled to any hearing of any sort  whatsoever  by
the Magistrate until the consideration of the matter by the  Magistrate  for
issuance of process. We answer the question accordingly.  The  judgments  of
the High Courts to the contrary are overruled.
</p>

<p id="p_60">59.         In  view  of  the  above  position,  the  impugned  order  dated
5.8.2005 cannot be sustained and is liable to  be  set  aside  and,  is  set
aside. The  appellants’  application  for  impleadment   in    the  criminal
revision petition stands allowed.  High Court shall  now   hear  the  matter
and dispose of the criminal revision petition  in accordance with  law.  The
appeal is allowed as above.
