S.B. SINHA, J :
</p>
<p id="p_2">Leave granted in special leave petitions.
</p>
<p id="p_3">This batch of appeals arising out of common Judgment and Order of the
Gujarat High Court at Ahmedabad in SCA Nos. 10108/94, 4427/92, 4733/92,
4847/92, 3537/95, 8882/99, 8888/99, 6461/96 and 6519/98	  involving the question
as regard to interpretation of Sections 20 and 21 of the Gujarat Town Planning and
Urban Development Act, 1976 (for brevity, hereinafter referred to as the 'Said Act'),
were taken up for hearing together and are being disposed of by this common
judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_4">The basic fact of the matter is not in dispute.
</p>
<p id="p_5">The State of Gujarat in exercise of its power conferred upon it under Section
20 of the said Act reserved certain areas of which the respondents herein amongst
others are the owners

On or about 3.3.1986 a development plan was finally published in terms of
the provisions of the said Act, and the period of 10 years therefrom lapsed on
2.3.1996.   A revised Development plan however came into being on 20th February,
1996.	It is not in dispute that respondents who claim ownership of the lands in
question issued	 notices in terms of sub-section 2 of Section 20 of the said Act,
asking the State Government to acquire the properties in terms thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_6">The short question which arises for consideration in these matters is as to
whether by reason of inaction on the part of the State and its authorities under the
Town Planning Act to acquire the lands	for a  period of more than 10 years,  in
terms of the provisions of Lan
ection 20 of the Act and on their failure to do so the reservation/designation in
respect of land in question would lapse.
</p>
<p id="p_7">Per contra the contention of the Appellant was that the provisions of Section
20(2) of the Act although enables service of notice by land owners for acquisition
within six moths from the expiry of 10 years from the date of final development plan
but the same would not come into operation when the final development plan is in
the process of revision under Section 21 of the said Act read with sub-section 1 of
Section 20 thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_8">The High Court upon taking into consideration the provisions of the said Act
and upon consideration of the rival contentions raised therein came to the conclusion
that issuance of a draft revised plan by itself does not put an embargo on the
application of sub-Section (2) of Section 20 of the Said Act.
</p>
<p id="p_9">The appellants were represented by Mr. Kirit N. Rawal, Solicitor General and
Mr. T.R. Adhyarujina, learned senior counsel appearing for the Gujarat University
and Mr. Tanna for the South Gujarat University.	 The contention of the learned
counsel for the appellant was that having regard to the scope and purport of the said
Act, the High Court must be held to have erred in so far as it failed to take into
consideration that the objects of an integrated, incorporated and interdependent
development plan, cannot be fully achieved within a period of 10 years and in that
view of the matter when steps are taken for revision of the final development plan,
the period specified in sub-section (2) of Section 20 would get automatically
extended.   Strong reliance in this behalf  has been placed on <a href="/doc/473037/" id="a_1">K.L. Gupta &amp; Ors. v.
The Bombay Municipal Corporation and Ors</a>,  [(1968) 1 SCR 274],	<a href="/doc/1784729/" id="a_2">Ahmedabad
Urban Development Authority v. Manilal Gordhandas &amp; Ors</a>. [(1996) 11 SCC 482];
<a href="/doc/1809461/" id="a_3">Murari &amp; Ors. v. Union of India &amp; Ors</a>. [(1997) 1 SCC 15].
</p>
<p id="p_10">On the other hand, the	submissions of learned counsel for the respondents
led by Mr. Asok Desai the learned senior counsel is that in the event the
interpretation of the provisions of Sections 20 and 21 as suggested by the learned
counsel for the appellant is accepted, the same would render sub-section 2 of Section
20 otiose and redundant.   According to learned counsel the right of an owner of the
land cannot be kept under suspension for a long time and the period of 10 years
specified by the legislature must be held to be a reasonable one, and thus by no
stretch of imagination only by taking recourse to the provisions of Section 21 of the
said Act, the period specified therein can  be extended.  Strong reliance in support of
the said contention has been placed on <a href="/doc/1686005/" id="a_4">Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay v.
Dr. Hakimwadi Tenants' Association &amp; Ors</a>.  [(1988) Supp. SCC 55].
</p>
<p id="p_11">Mr. Desai would urge that the expression 'so far as may be' occurring in
Section 21 of the Act must be given a proper meaning and thus in the event the
interpretation of the provisions put-forth by the learned counsel for the appellant is
accepted, the same will lead to an anomalous and absurd situation; which was not
contemplated by the Legislature.
</p>
<p id="p_12">  Reliance in this connection has been placed in <a href="/doc/17408/" id="a_5">The Land Acquisition
Officer, City Improvement Trust Board v. H. Narayanaiah &amp; Ors</a>.	[(1976) 4 SCC 9].
</p>
<p id="p_13">Before we advert to the rival contentions, as noticed hereinbefore, we may
look to the relevant provision of the said Act.
</p>
<p id="p_14">The preamble suggests that the said Act was enacted to consolidate and
amend the law relating to making and execution of development plans and town
planning schemes in the State of Gujarat.  It is not in dispute that the said Act came
into force with effect from 1.2.1978 in terms of an appropriate notification issued in
this behalf under sub-section (3) of Section 1 thereof .
</p>
<p id="p_15"> Section 2 of the said Act contains definition clause.	'Development Plan' has
been defined in Section 2(x) to mean a plan for development or redevelopment or
improvement of a development area.
</p>
<p id="p_16">Section 3, postulates issuance of a notification by the State Government
specifying a development area.
</p>
<p id="p_17">In term of Section 4 of the said Act, the State Government by issuing a
notification is empowered to exclude the whole or part of a development area from
the operation thereof.	  Section 5 provides for constitution of Area Development
Authorities consisting of two Nominees of the Government and Local Authorities as
specified therein.  The State Government in terms of Section 6 of the Act is
empowered to designate any Local Authority functioning in the development area as
an Area Development Authority in State.	  The State Government has been conferred
with the powers, which amongst others, include preparation of Development Plan,
Town Planning Schemes and to control the development activities in terms of
Section 7 of the Act.  Section 9 provides that not later than three years after the
declaration of such area as a development area or within such time as the State
Government, may from time to time, extend, the authority shall prepare and submit
to the State Government a draft development plan for the whole or any part of the
development area".  The State Government on the failure of development authority
to prepare such a plan is required to do so within a period of three years thereafter.
A draft development plan has to be kept open for public inspection in terms of
Section 10.   Section 12 provides for the contents of draft development plan, the
relevant portions whereof read as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_18">"Contents of draft development plan :
</p><p id="p_19">(1)   A draft development plan shall generally indicate the
manner in which the use of land in the area covered by it shall
be regulated and also indicate the manner in which the
development therein shall be carried out.
</p>
<p id="p_20">(2)	 In particular, it shall provide, so far as may be
necessary, for	all  or any of	the following  matters,
namely :-
</p>
<p id="p_21">(a)	xxxx

</p><p id="p_22">(b)	proposals for the reservation of land for public
purposes, such as schools, colleges and other
educational institutions, medical and public health
institutions, markets, social welfare and cultural
institutions, theatres and places for public
entertainment, public assembly, museums, art
galleries, religious buildings, playgrounds, stadium,
open spaces, dairies and for such other purposes as
may, from time to time, be specified by the State
Government;
</p>
<p id="p_23">(c)	xxxx

</p><p id="p_24">(d)	transport and communications, such as roads,
highways, parkways, railways, waterways, canals and
airport, including their extension and development.
</p>
<p id="p_25">(e)	xxxx

</p><p id="p_26">(f)	reservation of land for community facilities and
services;
</p>
<p id="p_27">(g)	xxxx

</p><p id="p_28">(h)	xxxx

</p><p id="p_29">(i)	xxxx

</p><p id="p_30">(j)	xxxx

</p><p id="p_31">(k)	proposals for the reservation of land for the purpose of
Union, any State, local authority or any other authority
or body established by or under any law for the time
being in force;
</p>
<p id="p_32">(l)	 xxxx

</p><p id="p_33">(m)	  xxxx


</p><p id="p_34">(n)	provision for preventing or removing pollution of
water or air caused by the discharge of waste or other
means as a result of the use of land;
</p>
<p id="p_35">(o)	such other proposals for public or other purposes as
may from time to time be approved by the area
development authority or as may be directed by the
State Government in this behalf."
</p>

<p id="p_36">Section 13 specifies publication of draft development plan for the purpose of inviting
suggestions and objections from public and affected parties, which are required to be
considered in terms of Section 14 thereof.  Necessary modifications may be made
therein as provided under Section 15.	A modified draft plan prepared in terms of
Section 15 is required to be submitted to the State Government for sanction, which
in exercise of it power under Section 17 of the Act may grant the same with further
notifications as deemed necessary, after publishing the same again inviting
suggestions and shall be notified in the official gazette.
</p>
<p id="p_37">	In terms of sub clause (d) of sub-section (1) of Section 17, the sanction
accorded to the draft development plan by the State Government shall be notified
in the Official Gazette, and on such sanction, it shall be called "the final
development plan" which shall come into force from a date to be notified, but the
same shall be not earlier than one month from the date of publication of such
sanction.   Sub-section (2) of Section 17 requires the State Government to take
certain precautions with regard to the reservation of land for specific purposes
mentioned in Section 12, but only on the satisfaction that the land, so reserved, is
likely to be acquired within ten years from the publication of final development
plan.
</p>
<p id="p_38">Sub-section (2) of Section 17 reads as under :-
</p>
<p id="p_39">"17(2) Where the draft development plan submitted by an
area development authority or, as the case may be, the
authorized officer contains any proposals for the reservation
of any land for a purpose specified in clause (b) or clause (n)
or clause (o) of sub-section (2) of Section 12 and such land
does not vest in the area development authority, the State
Government shall not include the said reservation in the
development plan, unless it is satisfied that such authority
would acquire the land, whether by agreement or compulsory
acquisition, within ten years from the date on which the final
development plan comes into force."
</p>

<p id="p_40">	Under Section 18, the State Government has been empowered even to amend
the final development plan, by extending or reducing its area.	Under Section 19, the
State Government is empowered to vary the final development plan, but,	only after
inviting suggestions and objections in the manner laid down therein.  Section 20
provides for acquisition of land designated or reserved for specified purposes
mentioned in Section 12.  As the said provision is material for this case,  the same is
reproduced hereunder :-
</p>
<p id="p_41">"<a href="/doc/308838/" id="a_6">Section 20</a> Acquisition of land :
</p><p id="p_42">(1)	The area development authority or any other authority for
whose purpose land is designated in the final development
plan for any purpose specified in clause (b), clause (d),
clause (f), clause (k), clause (n) or clause (o) of sub-section
(2) of <a href="/doc/948147/" id="a_7">Section 12</a>, may acquire the land either by agreement
or under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_8">Land Acquisition Act</a>, 1894.
</p>
<p id="p_43">(2)	If the land referred to in sub-section (1) is not acquired by
agreement within a period of ten years from the date of the
coming into force of the final development plan or if
proceedings under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_9">Land Acquisition Act</a>, 1894,  are not
commenced within such period, the owner or any person
interested in the land may serve a notice on the authority
concerned requiring it to acquire the land and if within six
months from the date of service of such notice the land is
not acquired or no steps are commenced for its acquisition,
the designation of land as aforesaid shall be deemed to have
lapsed."
</p>

<p id="p_44">	<a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_10">Section 21</a> of the Act provides for the revision of development plan and reads
as under :-
</p>
<p id="p_45">"<a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_11">Section 21</a>. Revision of development plan :
</p><p id="p_46">At least once in ten years from the date on which a final
development plan comes into force, the area development
authority shall revise the development plan after carrying out,
if necessary, a fresh survey and the provisions of <a href="/doc/1990166/" id="a_12">Sections 9</a>
to <a href="/doc/308838/" id="a_13">20</a>, shall, so far as may be, apply to such revision."
</p>
<p id="p_47">	It is the basic principle of construction of statute that the same should be read
as a whole, then chapter by chapter, section by section and words by words.
Recourse to construction or interpretation of statute is necessary when there is
ambiguity, obscurity, or inconsistency therein and not otherwise.  An effort must be
made to give effect to all parts of statute and unless absolutely necessary, no part
thereof	 shall be rendered surplusage or redundant.
</p>
<p id="p_48">True meaning of a provision of law has to be determined on the basis of what
provides by its clear language, with due regard to the scheme of law.
</p>
<p id="p_49">	Scope of the legislation on the intention of the legislature cannot be enlarged
when the language of the provision is plain and unambiguous. In other words
statutory enactments must ordinarily be construed according to its plain meaning and
no words shall be added, altered or modified unless it is plainly necessary to do so to
prevent a provision from being unintelligible, absurd, unreasonable, unworkable or
totally irreconcilable with the rest of the statute.
</p>
<p id="p_50">	It is also well settled that a beneficient provision of legislation must be
liberally construed so as to fulfill the statutory purpose and not to frustrate it.
</p>
<p id="p_51">	An owner of a property, subject to reasonable restrictions which may be
imposed by the Legislature, is entitled to enjoy the property in any manner he likes.
A right to use a property in a particular manner or in other words a restriction
imposed on user thereof except in the mode and manner laid down under statute
would not be presumed.
</p>
<p id="p_52">In Legislation and Interpretation by Jagdish Swarup, at page 479, it is stated :
</p>

<p id="p_53">"We ought not to assume without the clearest
language that the legislature intends to destroy
common law rights.  The presumption is that the
legislature intends not to interfere with any legal
rights or any legitimate expectations of any person
whatsoever.  Rights, whether private or public,
cannot be taken away or hampered by implication
from the language employed in a statute, unless the
legislature clearly and distinctly authorises the
doing of a thing which is physically inconsistent
with the continuance of an existing right.  In order
to take away the right it is not sufficient to show
that the thing sanctioned in the Act, it done, will of
a sheer physical necessity, put an end to that right; it
must also be shown that the legislature has
authorised the thing to be done at all events, and
irrespective of its possible interference with existing
rights.	 <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_14">An Act</a> should be so interpreted as in no
respect to interfere with or prejudice	a clear private
right or title unless that, private right or title is taken
away per directum"
</p>

<p id="p_54">By reason of the provision of the said Act, a reasonable restriction, has been
imposed upon the owner on the user of his  property.  In terms of <a href="/doc/948147/" id="a_15">Section 12</a> of the
said Act, town planning is contemplated through preparation of draft development
plan which contains not only proposals for designating certain area for residential,
industrial, commercial, agricultural or recreational purposes but also for the purposes
for maintaining environment and ecological balance by setting up zoological
gardens, green belts, natural reserves and sanctuaries .  In terms of such development
plan reservation of certain land for public use is also	 provided. From the relevant
provisions of the said Act, as noticed hereinbefore, it is absolutely clear that in terms
thereof the State Government is made the ultimate authority to publish a
development plan, inter alia, providing for designation or reservation of the land.
The State Government while arriving at its conclusion as regards public interest
involved in the matter is required to arrive at its satisfaction on objective basis as
provided in terms of sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_16">Section 17</a> to the effect that the lands in
respect whereof reservation is proposed to be made  can be acquired for the
fulfillment of the object therefor either by agreement or  compulsory acquisition
within the period specified therein.  It has not been disputed before us nor is it
necessary to consider in the facts and circumstances of this case as to whether
establishment of the educational institutions or universities would be covered by the
provisions of sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/948147/" id="a_17">Section 12</a> thereof?
</p>
<p id="p_55">  <a href="/doc/308838/" id="a_18">Sections 20</a> and <a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_19">21</a> of the said Act are required to be read conjunctively with
<a href="/doc/948147/" id="a_20">Sections 12</a> and <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_21">17</a>.  We may notice that clause (k) of sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/948147/" id="a_22">Section 12</a>
does not find mention in sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_23">Section 17</a> as regards proposed
reservation for the State and other statutory authorities but clauses (n) and (b) of
sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/948147/" id="a_24">Section 12</a> are specifically mentioned in <a href="/doc/308838/" id="a_25">Section 20</a>.	 In <a href="/doc/308838/" id="a_26">Section
20</a>, provisions	of clauses (b), (d), (f), (k) and (o) of sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/948147/" id="a_27">Section 12</a>
have specifically been mentioned.  The High Court has proceeded on the basis that
the words 'designation' or 'reservation' are interchangeable for the purpose of the
Act.  The said finding of the High Court is not in question.
</p>
<p id="p_56">Whereas in terms of <a href="/doc/948147/" id="a_28">Sections 12</a> and <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_29">17</a> of the said Act, the reservation and
designation have been provided, sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/308838/" id="a_30">Section 20</a> thereof only enables
the authorities to acquire the land designated or reserved for the purpose specifically
mentioned in clauses (b) and (n) of sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/948147/" id="a_31">Section 12</a> as also other clauses
specified therefor either by acquisition or agreement or in terms of the provisions of
the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_32">Land Acquisition Act</a>.  Sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/308838/" id="a_33">Section 20</a> is merely  an enabling
provision.
</p>
<p id="p_57">Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/308838/" id="a_34">Section 20</a>, however, carves out an exception to the
exercise of powers by the State as regards acquisition of the land for the purpose of
carrying out the development of the area in the manner provided for therein;  a bare
reading	 whereof  leaves no manner of doubt that in the event the land referred to
under sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/308838/" id="a_35">Section 20</a> thereof is not acquired or	proceedings under the
<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_36">Land Acquisition Act</a> are not commenced and further in the event an owner or a
person interested in the land serves a notice in the manner specified therein, certain
consequences ensue, namely,  the designation of the land shall be deemed to have
lapsed.	 A legal fiction, therefore, has been created in the said provision.
</p>
<p id="p_58">The purpose and object of creating a legal fiction in the statute is well-
known.	When a legal fiction is created, it must be given its full effect.  In East End
Dwelling Co. Ltd. v. Finsbury Borough Council, [(1951) 2 All.E.R 587], Lord
Asquith, J. stated the law in the following terms:-
</p>
<p id="p_59">"If you are bidden to treat an imaginary state of
affairs as real, you must surely, unless prohibited from
doing so, also imagine as real the consequences and
incidents which, if the putative state of affairs had in
fact existed, must inevitably have flowed from or
accompanied it.	 One of these in this case is
emancipation from the 1939 level of rents.  The statute
says that you must imagine a certain state of affairs; it
does not say that having done so, you must cause or
permit your imagination to boggle when it comes to
the inevitable corollaries of that state of affairs."
</p>

<p id="p_60">The said principle has been reiterated by this Court in M. Venugopal v. Divisional
Manager, Life Insurance Corporation of India, Machilipatnam, A.P. &amp;  Anr. [(1994)
2 SCC 323]. See also <a href="/doc/1420594/" id="a_37">Indian Oil Corporation Limited  v.
Chief Inspector of Factories &amp; Ors</a>.etc., [(1998) 5 SCC 738], <a href="/doc/602979/" id="a_38">Voltas Limited,
Bombay v. Union of India &amp; Ors</a>.,[(1995) Supp. 2 SCC 498], <a href="/doc/890110/" id="a_39">Harish Tandon v.
Addl</a>. District Magistrate, Allahabad, U.P. &amp; Ors. [(1995) 1 SCC	 537] and   G.
Viswanathan etc. v. Hon'ble Speaker, Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly, Madras &amp;
Anr.  [(1996) 2 SCC 353].
</p>
<p id="p_61">The relevant provisions of the Act are absolutely clear, unambiguous and
implicit.  A plain meaning of the said provisions, in our considered view, would lead
to only one conclusion, namely, that in the event a notice is issued by the owner of
the land or other person interested therein asking the authority to acquire the land
upon expiry of the period specified therein viz. ten years from the date of issuance of
final development plan and in the event pursuant to or in furtherance thereof no
action for acquisition thereof is taken, the designation shall lapse.
</p>
<p id="p_62">This Court in Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay's case (supra), in no
uncertain terms while construing the provisions of Section 127 of the Maharashtra
Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966  held  the	 period of  ten years as reasonable
in the following words :-
</p>
<p id="p_63">	"While the contention of learned counsel appearing
for the appellant that the words 'six months from
the date of service of such notice' in <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_40">Section 127</a> of
the Act were not susceptible of a literal
construction, must be accepted, it must be borne in
mind that the period of six months provided by
<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_41">Section 127</a> upon the expiry of which the
reservation of the land under a Development Plan
lapses, is a valuable safeguard to the citizen against
arbitrary and irrational executive action.  <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_42">Section
127</a> of the Act is a fetter upon the power of eminent
domain.	 By enacting <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_43">Section 127</a> the legislature has
struck a balance between the competing claims of
the interests of the general public as regards the
rights of an individual."
</p>

<p id="p_64">It was observed that :
</p>
<p id="p_65">"<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_44">The Act</a> lays down the principles of fixation by
providing first, by the proviso to <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_45">Section 126(2)</a> that
no such declaration under sub-section (2) shall be
made after the expiry of three years from the date of
publication of the draft regional plan, development
plan or any other plan, secondly, by enacting sub-
section (4) of <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_46">Section 126</a> that if a declaration is not
made within the period referred to in sub-section
(2), the State Government may make a fresh
declaration but, in that event, the market value of
the land shall be the market value at the date of the
declaration under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_47">Section 6</a> and not the market
value at the date of the notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_48">Section 4</a>,
and thirdly, by <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_49">Section 127</a> that if any land reserved,
allotted or designated for any purpose in any
development plan is not acquired by agreement
within 10 years from the date on which a final
regional plan or development plan comes into force
or if proceedings for the acquisition of such land
under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_50">Land Acquisition Act</a> are not commenced
within such period,  such land shall be deemed to be
released from such reservation, allotment or
designation and become available to the owner for
the purpose of development on the failure of the
Appropriate Authority to initiate any steps for its
acquisition within a period  of six months from the
date of service of a notice by the owner or any
person interested in the land.	It cannot be doubted
that a period of 10 years is long enough.,  The
Development or the Planning Authority must take
recourse to acquisition with some amount of
promptitude in order that the compensation paid to
the expropriated owner bears a just relation to the
real value of the land as otherwise, the
compensation paid for the acquisition  would be
wholly illusory.  Such fetter on statutory powers is
in the interest of the general public and the
conditions  subject to which they can be exercised
must be strictly followed."
</p>

<p id="p_66">It is true that <a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_51">Section 21</a> of the Act imposes a statutory obligation on the part of the
State and the appropriate authorities to revise the development plan and for the said
purpose <a href="/doc/1990166/" id="a_52">Sections 9</a> to <a href="/doc/308838/" id="a_53">20</a>  'so far as may be' would be applicable thereto, but thereby
the rights of the owners in terms of sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/308838/" id="a_54">Section 20</a> are not taken away.
</p>
<p id="p_67">The question, however, is as to whether only because the provision of
<a href="/doc/308838/" id="a_55">Section 20</a> has been referred to therein; would it mean that thereby the Legislature
contemplated that the time of  ten years specified by the Legislature for the purpose
of acquisition of the land would get automatically extended?  The answer to the said
question must be rendered in the negative.  Following the  principle of interpretation
that all words must be given its full effect, we must also give full effect to the words
"so far as may be" applied to such revision.
</p>
<p id="p_68">The said words indicate the intention of the Legislature to the effect that by
providing revision of  final development plan from time to time and at least once in
ten years, only the procedure or preparation thereof as provided  therein, is required
to be followed.	  Such procedural requirements must be followed so far as it is
reasonably possible.   <a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_56">Section 21</a> of the Act, in our opinion, does not and cannot
mean that the substantial right conferred upon the owner of the land or the person
interested therein shall be taken away.	 It is not and cannot be the intention of the
Legislature that what is given by one hand should be taken away by the other.
</p>
<p id="p_69"><a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_57">Section 21</a> does not envisage that despite the fact that in terms of sub-section
(2)  of <a href="/doc/308838/" id="a_58">Section 20</a>, the designation of land shall lapse, the same, only because a draft
revised plan is made, would automatically give rise to revival thereof.	 <a href="/doc/308838/" id="a_59">Section 20</a>
does not manifest a legislative intent to curtail or take away the right acquired by a
land-owner under <a href="/doc/663245/" id="a_60">Section 22</a> of getting the land defreezed. In the event the
submission of the learned Solicitor General is accepted the same would completely
render the provisions of <a href="/doc/308838/" id="a_61">Section 20(2)</a> otiose and redundant.
</p>
<p id="p_70">  Sub-section  (1) of <a href="/doc/308838/" id="a_62">Section 20</a>, as noticed hereinbefore, provides for an
enabling provision in terms whereof the State become entitled to acquire the land
either by agreement or taking  recourse to the provisions of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_63">Land Acquisition
Act</a>.  If  by reason of a revised plan, any other area is sought to be brought within the
purview of the development plan,  evidently in relation thereto the State will be
entitled to exercise its jurisdiction under sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/308838/" id="a_64">Section 20</a> but it will bear
repetition to state that the same would not confer any other or further power upon the
State to get the duration of designation of land, which has been lapsed, extended.
What is contemplated under <a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_65">Section 21</a> is to meet the changed situation and
contingencies which might not have been contemplated while preparing the first final
development plan.  The power of the State enumerated under sub-section (1) of
<a href="/doc/308838/" id="a_66">Section 20</a> does not become ipso facto applicable in the event of issuance of a
revised plan as the said provision has been specifically mentioned therein so that the
State may use the same power in a changed situation.
</p>
<p id="p_71">	The statutory interdict of use and enjoyment of the property must be strictly
construed.  It is well-settled that when a statutory authority is required to do a thing
in a particular manner, the same must be done in that manner or not at all.  The State
and other authorities while acting under the said Act are only creature of statute.
They must act within the four-corners thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_72">There is another aspect of the matter which cannot be lost sight of.  Despite
statutory lapse of designation of the land, the State is not denuded of its power of
eminent domain under the general law, namely,  <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_67">Land Acquisition Act</a> in the event
an  exigency arises therefor.
</p>
<p id="p_73">	We are not oblivious of the law that when a public functionary is required to
do a certain thing within a specified time, the same is ordinarily directory but it is
equally well settled that when consequence for inaction on the part of the Statutory
authorities within such specified  time is expressly provided, it must be held to be
imperative.
</p>
<p id="p_74">In  Sutherland, Statutory Construction, 3rd edition, Vol.3 at p.102  the law is
stated as follows :-
</p>
<p id="p_75">	".unless the nature of the act to be performed, or
the phraseology of the statute is such that the
designation  of time must be considered a limitation
of the power of the Officer."
</p>
<p id="p_76">At  p.107 it is pointed out that a statutory direction
to private individuals should generally be
considered as mandatory and that the rule is  just the
opposite to that which obtains with respect to public
officers.  Again, at p. 109, it is pointed out that often
the question as to whether a mandatory or directory
construction should be given to a statutory provision
may be determined by an expression in the statute
itself of the result that shall follow non-compliance
with the provision.  At p.111 it is stated as follows :
</p>
<p id="p_77">"As a corollary of the rule outlined above,
the fact that no consequences of non-compliance are
stated in the statute, has been considered as a factor
tending towards a directory construction.  But this is
only an element to be considered, and is by no
means conclusive."
</p>
<p id="p_78">[See also Crawford on Statutory Construction , <a href="/doc/1135479/" id="a_68">Article 269</a> at p.535].
</p>
<p id="p_79">In Dattatrays v. State of Bombay [AIR 1952 SC 181], it was held as under :-
</p>

<p id="p_80">"Generally speaking the provisions of a
statute creating public duties are directory and those
conferring private rights are imperative.  When the
provisions of statute relate to the performance of a
public duty and the case is such that to hold null and
void acts done in neglect of this duty would work
serious general inconvenience or injustice to
persons who have no control over those entrusted
with the duty and at the same time would not
promote the main object of the Legislature, it has
been the practice of the courts to hold such
provisions to be directory only, the neglect of them
not affecting the validity of the acts done."
</p>

<p id="p_81">In Craies on Statute Law VIII Edn. at page 262, it is stated thus :-
</p>

<p id="p_82">"It is the duty of courts of justice to try to
get at the real intention of the Legislature by
carefully attending to the whole scope of the statute
to be construedThat is each case you must look
to the subject-matter, consider the importance of the
provision and the relation of that provision to the
general object intended to be secured by the Act,
and upon a review of the case in that aspect decide
whether the enactment is what is called imperative
or only directory."
</p>

<p id="p_83">In the aforementioned backdrop, we may usefully refer to the decision of this
Court in The  Land Acquisition Officer, City Improvement Trust Board, Bangalore's
case  (supra) wherein it has been stated :-
</p>
<p id="p_84">"There was some argument on the meaning of the
words "so far as they are applicable", used in
<a href="/doc/1479956/" id="a_69">Section 27</a> of the Bangalore Act.  These words
cannot be changed into "in so far as they are
specifically mentioned" with regard to the
procedure in the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_70">Acquisition Act</a>.  On the other
hand, the obvious intention, in using these words,
was to exclude only those provisions of the
<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_71">Acquisition Act</a> which become inapplicable because
of any special procedure prescribed by the
<a href="/doc/1479956/" id="a_72">Bangalore Act</a> (e.g. <a href="/doc/562722/" id="a_73">Section 16</a>) corresponding with
that found in the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_74">Acquisition Act</a> (e.g. <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_75">Section 4(1)</a>).
These words bring in or make applicable, so far as
this is reasonably possible, general provisions such
as <a href="/doc/825501/" id="a_76">Section 23(1)</a> of the Acquisition Act.  They
cannot be reasonably construed to exclude the
application of any general provisions of the
<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_77">Acquisition Act</a>.  They amount to laying down the
principle that what is not either expressly, or , by a
necessary implication, excluded must be applied.  It
is surprising to find misconstruction of what did not
appear to us to be reasonably open to more than one
interpretation."
</p>
<p id="p_85">We  may at  this juncture usefully quote the  words of	Oliver Wendell
Holmes : "It is sometimes more important to emphasize the obvious  than to
elucidate the obscure".	 (See the Interpretation and Application of Statutes by Reed
Dickerson at  page 7).
</p>
<p id="p_86">The decision of this Court in K.L. Gupta's case (supra), whereupon the
learned counsel for the Appellant strongly relied upon, may in the aforementioned
backdrop, be considered.  In that case, the vires of the provisions of Sections 9, 10,
11, 12 and 13 of the Bombay Town Planning  Act, 1954 were in question.	Although
the constitutionality of  <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_78">Section 17</a> of	 the Act was also questioned before this Court,
at the hearing the same was given up.  The Court specifically noticed so stating :-
</p>
<p id="p_87">"Towards the end of the hearing counsel for the
petitioners submitted that s.17 of the Act might be
left out of  consideration for the purpose of these
petitions and learned counsel for the respondents
were agreeable to this course.	We, therefore, do
not express our views about the validity or
otherwise of this section."
</p>
<p id="p_88">	In that case the rights of the owners accrued to them having regard to the
inaction on the part of the State and other authorities despite rights to the owners of
land as envisaged under sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/308838/" id="a_79">Section 20</a> of the Act were not in
question.  <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_80">Section 17</a> of the Act was in pari materia with <a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_81">Section 21</a> of the said Act.
The scheme of the provisions of the Bombay Act as regards designation or
reservation of land for	 ten years and further right of	 revision after every ten years
was considered having regard to the challenges made therein that thereby the State
was conferred with a power which was unreasonable and thus violative of Articles
14 and 19(1) of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_89">The observations made by this Court should be  understood in that context.
In that case the rival contention as regards interpretation of the statute was not the
subject-matter of the consideration of the Constitution Bench.
</p>
<p id="p_90">  The scheme of the Act was noticed thus :-
</p>
<p id="p_91">	"The idea behind this sub-section is that if
any land is to be set apart for public purposes such
as parks etc. mentioned in  cl.(b) of<a href="/doc/1789527/" id="a_82"> s. 7</a> or any other
public purpose which might be approved by a local
authority or directed  by the State Government in
terms of cl. (e) of<a href="/doc/1789527/" id="a_83"> s. 7</a>, the State Government must
examine whether it would be possible for the local
authority to be able to acquire such land by private
agreement or compulsory purchase within a period
of ten years.  This acts as a check on the local
authority making too ambitious proposals for
designating lands for public purposes which they
may never have the means to fulfil.  It is obvious
that the local authority must be given a reasonable
time for the purpose and the legislature thought that
a period of ten years was a sufficient one.  S.11(1)
empowers  the local authority to acquire any land
designated in the development plan for a purpose
specified  in cls. (b), (c),(d) or (e) of<a href="/doc/1789527/" id="a_84"> s. 7</a> either by
agreement or under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_85">Land Acquisition Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_92">Under sub-s. (2) of<a href="/doc/291273/" id="a_86"> s. 11</a> the provisions of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_87">Land
Acquisition Act</a> of 1894 as amended by the
Schedule to the Act are to apply to all such
acquisitions.  The Schedule to the Act shows that<a href="/doc/31609/" id="a_88"> s.
23</a> of the Land Acquisition Act is to stand amended
for the acquisition under this Act with regard to the
compensation to be awarded.  In fact it is for the
benefit of the person whose land is acquired, as he
can get the market value of the land at the date of
the publication of the declaration under<a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_89"> s. 6</a> of  the
Land Acquisition Act in place of s.4.  Sub-s.(3)
provides that if the designated land is not acquired
by agreement within ten years from the date
specified   under sub-s. (3) of<a href="/doc/742973/" id="a_90"> s. 10</a> or if proceedings
under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_91">Land Acquisition Act</a> are not commenced
within such period, the owner or any person
interested in the land may serve notice to the local
authority and if within six months from the date of
such notice the land is not acquired or no steps as
aforesaid are commenced for its acquisition, the
designation shall be deemed to have lapsed.  This
provision again is for the benefit of the owner of the
land for unless the land is acquired  or steps taken in
that behalf within the fixed limits of time, he ceases
to be bound by the designation of his land as given
in the development plan."
</p><p id="p_93">					(Emphasis Supplied)


What was emphasised in that case is unreasonableness of <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_92">Section 17</a> of the
Act which, as indicated hereinbefore, was not pressed at a later stage. This  Court
had no occasion to consider the conflicting rights of the parties under sub-section (3)
of <a href="/doc/742973/" id="a_93">Section 10</a> vis--vis Section 17 of the Bombay Act.  What was considered and
upheld by the Court was the contention that by taking the recourse to  <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_94">Section 17</a>
more than once acquisition might be held up indefinitely from generation to
generation.
</p>
<p id="p_94">As the facts of the present case stand absolutely on a different footing and
this Court in K.L. Gupta's case (supra) was not called upon to answer the same,	 the
same cannot be said to be an authority for the proposition that by reason of <a href="/doc/1992048/" id="a_95">Section
21</a> of the Act, the designation of the land although lapsed in terms of <a href="/doc/308838/" id="a_96">Section 20</a>, the
same would get automatically extended or revised once a revised plan is made.  This
Court  in K.L. Gupta's case  merely held  that the land which is reserved for ten
years can be subjected to further reservation for any period till it is actually required
for its town planning activities leading to revision of development plans from time to
time.  Therein, this Court did not negate the right of owners.	Such a right of the
land-owners, as noticed hereinbefore,  has been specifically acknowledged.
Nowhere it was stated that valuable right conferred on a land-owner  of getting his
land reserved by serving notice would be defeated or taken away merely because a
revised development plan was in the offing.
</p>
<p id="p_95">	The question raised in the said case, thus, was absolutely different.  It is
interesting to note that the law of the land was considered therein, as it then stood by
observing :-
</p>
<p id="p_96">"No one can be heard to say that the local
authority after making up its mind to acquire land
for a public purpose must do so within as short a
period of time as possible.  It would not be
reasonable to place such a restriction on the power
of the local authority which is out to create better
living conditions for millions of people in a vast
area."
</p>
<p id="p_97">	However, we may notice that the Parliament amended the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_97">Land Acquisition
Act</a>, 1984 in terms whereof, inter alia, <a href="/doc/43426109/" id="a_98">Section 11A</a> was inserted.  In the Objects and
Reasons of the said Act, it was stated :-
</p>
<p id="p_98">	"With the enormous expansion of the State's
role in promoting public welfare and economic
development since independence, acquisition of
land for public purposes, industrialization, building
of institutions, etc., has become far more numerous
than ever before.  While this is inevitable,
promotion of public purpose has to be balanced
with the rights of the individual whose land is
acquired, thereby often depriving him of his means
of livelihood.	Again, acquisition of land for private
enterprises ought not to be placed on the same
footing as acquisition for the State or for an
enterprise under it.  The individual and institutions
who are unavoidably to be deprived of their
property rights in land need to be adequately
compensated for the loss keeping in view the
sacrifice they have to make for the larger interests
of the community.  The pendency of acquisition
proceedings for long period often causes hardship to
the affected parties and renders unrealistic the scale
of compensation offered to them."
</p>

<p id="p_99">	The decision in Ahmedabad  Urban Development Authority's case (supra), in
our opinion, has again no application to the fact of the present case. The fact of the
matter therein was completely different.  The Gujarat Planning and Urban
Development Act, 1976, which is now in operation in the State of Gujarat, came into
force from 30th November,  1978, prior to which	 the Bombay Town Planning Act,
1954 was applicable to the State of Gujarat.  Prior to coming into force of  the
Gujarat Act,  the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation submitted the development
plan on 15th January, 1976 which came to be sanctioned by the State Government on
12th August, 1983.  It was held by this	 Court that the draft development plan
submitted by the Corporation on 15th January, 1976, could not have been sanctioned
under the provisions of the Gujarat Act on 12th August, 1983 ignoring the fact that
meanwhile a comprehensive draft development plan  had been prepared and
submitted by the  Corporation on 23rd July, 1981  which	 also came to be sanctioned
on 2nd November, 1986 and which included the areas covered by the earlier illegally
sanctioned plan on 12th August, 1983.	In the aforementioned peculiar facts, the
question arose as to from which date the period of ten years had to be reckoned for
application of <a href="/doc/308838/" id="a_99">Section 20(2)</a> of the Act.   This Court answered the aforementioned
question in the following terms :-
</p>
<p id="p_100">"As in the present case the only question
which is to be answered is as to with effect from
which date 10 years period shall be counted, it has
to be decided as to which date shall be deemed to be
the date of coming into force of the final
development plan, so far the area within the
Corporation is concerned.  The notification dated
2.11.1987, had been issued by the State
Government covering the area notified on
12.8.1983, several years before, the issuance of
notices by the writ petitioners.  The notification
dated 2.11.1987, was neither questioned by the writ
petitioners-respondents	 nor could have been
questioned, according to us.  When power  has been
vested in the appellant to prepare a draft
development plan and there being no bar to include
in the said draft development plan even area, for
which an earlier draft development plan had already
been sanctioned, then the draft development plan
which was sanctioned and notified on 2.11.1987,
shall be deemed to be the final development plan
within the meaning of Section 20 of the Gujarat
Town Planning Act.  As such the period of 10 years
has to be calculated and counted with reference to
3.12.1987, the date when such final development
was to come into force."
</p>

<p id="p_101">Yet again the decision of this Court in Murari's case (supra) has no
application to the fact of this matter.	 The question which arose for consideration
therein was as to whether in terms of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_100">Land Acquisition Act</a> any
actual physical possession is required to be obtained or merely taking the possession
specified therein would serve the purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_102">Having regard to the provision of  the said  Act, we are of the opinion that the
decisions cited	  by   the learned Solicitor General  have no application in the  instant
case.
</p>
<p id="p_103">A decision, as is well-known, is  an authority for which it is decided and not
what can logically be deduced therefrom.  It is also well-settled that a little difference
in facts  or additional facts may make a lot of difference in the precedential	value of
a decision.  [<a href="/doc/1481685/" id="a_101">See Smt. Ram Rakhi v. Union of India &amp; Ors</a>. [AIR 2002 Delhi 458],
Delhi Administration (NCT of Delhi) v. Manoharlal  [AIR 2002 SC 3088], <a href="/doc/747596/" id="a_102">Haryana
Financial Corporation and Anr. v. M/s Jagdamba Oil Mills &amp; Anr. [JT</a> 2002 (1) SC
482] and Dr. Nalini Mahajan etc. v. Director of Income Tax (Investigation) &amp; Ors.
[(2002)	 257  ITR 123].
</p><p id="p_104">  For the aforementioned reasons, we are in agreement with the findings of
the High Court.
</p>
<p id="p_105">Before parting with the case, we may notice that Mr. Tanna
appearing on behalf of the South Gujarat University in C.A. No.1540 of 2002
submitted that various other contentions had also been raised before the High Court.
We are not prepared to go into the said contentions inasmuch assuming the same to
be correct, the remedy of the appellants would lie in filing appropriate application for
review before the High Court.  Incidentally, we may notice that even in the special
leave petition	no substantial question of law in this behalf has been raised nor any
affidavit has been affirmed by the learned advocate who had appeared before the
High Court or by any officer of the appellant who was present in court that certain
other submissions were made before the High Court which were not taken into
consideration.	<a href="/doc/1563902/" id="a_103">In  State of Maharashtra v. Ramdas Shrinivas Nayak &amp; Anr</a>. [AIR
1982 SC 1249], this Court observed :-
</p>
<p id="p_106">"When we drew the attention of the learned
Attorney General to the concession made before the
High Court, Shri A.K. Sen, who appeared for the
State of Maharashtra before the High Court and led
the arguments for the respondents there and who
appeared for Shri Antulay before us intervened and
protested that he never made any such concession
and invited us to peruse the written submission
made by him in the High Court.	We are afraid that
we cannot launch into an inquiry as to what
transpired in the High Court.  It is simply not done.
Public Policy bars us.	Judicial decorum restrains
us.  Matters of judicial record are unquestionable.
They are not open to doubt.  Judges cannot be
dragged into the arena.	 "Judgments cannot be
treated as mere counters in the game of litigation".
(Per Lord Atkinson in Somasundaran v.
</p><p id="p_107">Subramanian, AIR 1926 PC 136).	We are bound to
accept the statement of the Judges recorded in their
judgment, as to what transpired in court.  We cannot
allow the statement of the Judges to be contradicted
by statements at the Bar or by affidavit and other
evidence.  If the Judges say in their judgment that
something was done, said or admitted before them,
that has to be the last word on the subject.  The
principle is well-settled that statements of fact as to
what transpired at the hearing, recorded in the
judgment of the court, are conclusive of the facts so
stated and no one can contradict such statements by
affidavit or other evidence.  If a party thinks that the
happenings in court have been wrongly recorded in
a judgment, it is incumbent upon the party, while
the matter is still fresh in the minds of the Judges, to
call the attention of the very Judges, who have made
the record to the fact that the statement made with
regard to his conduct was a statement that had been
made in error (Per Lord Buckmaster  in
Madhusudan v. Chandrabati, AIR 1917 PC 30).
</p><p id="p_108">That is the only way to have the record corrected.  If
no such step is taken, the matter must necessarily
end there.  Of course a party may resile and an
Appellate Court may permit him in rare and
appropriate cases to resile from a concession on the
ground that the concession was made on a wrong
appreciation of the law and had led to gross
injustice; but, he may not call in question the very
fact of making the concession as recorded in the
judgment."
</p>
<p id="p_109">	For the aforementioned reasons , there is no merit in these appeals which are
dismissed.  However, in the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no
order as to costs.
