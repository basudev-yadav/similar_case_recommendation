</p><p id="p_3">     This appeal has been filed against the judgment

and order of the High Court of Delhi passed in LPA (C)

No. 1069 of 2004 affirming the judgment of the

learned Single Judge in CWP No. 2338 of 1991.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                        2</span>


</p><p id="p_4">2.    Brief facts needed for disposal of this appeal are

as under:
</p>
<p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">3.    The appellant Ms. K.A. Nagamani was appointed

as a Programmer with the Indian Airlines in the year

1984. The designation of the post of Programmer was

changed to that of System Officer in the year 1985.

The appellant was promoted to the next higher post of

Assistant Manager (Systems) in the Department of

Electronic Data Processing (for short `EDP') sometime

in the year 1986 and confirmed in the said post on

15.9.1987. The EDP consisted of four divisions viz.

Software,    Hardware,     Data   Communications       and

Computer     Operations.      Indian    Airlines   Officers'

Association vide its representations dated 19.9.1990

and    28.9.1990    suggested     and     requested     the

Management to merge the hardware and software

cadres and to prepare a common seniority list.              A
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                    3</span>


common seniority list dated 24.9.1990 had been drawn

for the purpose of promotions.
</p>
<p id="p_7">4.   Thereafter interviews were held on 15.10.1990 for

the post of Deputy Manager (Maintenance/Systems).

The said post was to be filled from the merged

seniority list of hardware and software cadres.     The

Management vide its letter dated 23.11.1990 informed

the appellant and others that their candidatures were

being considered for filling up the post of Deputy

Manager       (Maintenance/Systems).        Thereafter,

respondent nos. 2, 3 and 4 were selected for the post

of   Deputy    Manager   (Maintenance/Systems).     The

appellant unsuccessfully challenged the promotion of

respondent nos. 2 to 4 as the writ petition filed by her

was dismissed and confirmed in Letters Patent Appeal

by the Division Bench of the High Court.




</p><p id="p_8">5.   The High Court inter alia held that promotion to

the post of Deputy Manager (Maintenance/Systems) is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                             4</span>


to be on the basis of merit and, therefore, found no

merit in the submission of the appellant that her

juniors (respondent nos. 3 &amp; 4) could not have been

promoted to the said post.                That so far as the

promotion of the second respondent is concerned the

Division Bench while confirming the order of the

learned Single Judge found that his promotion had

been upheld by the court in Civil Writ Petition No.

3647/93 titled as Jaidev Chakraborthy &amp; Ors. Vs.

Indian Airlines &amp; Ors.        in which the appellant herein

was also arrayed as a party respondent.



</p><p id="p_9">6.   The main thrust of the submission made by the

appellant in-person was that the promotion to the post

of Deputy Manager (Maintenance/Systems) could not

have been made based on the terms of the settlement

between     the      Indian    Airlines    and   its    Officers'

Association.       That all along there has been separate

seniority   list    of   Assistant   Managers     and    Senior
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                        5</span>


Computer    Officers   in    EDP   Department      of   the

Corporation. The respondent no. 2 was on seniority list

of Systems Officers who was promoted as Assistant

Manager (Systems) in 1985 and continued to be borne

on the seniority list of Assistant Manager (Systems) till

1988. Though, he was on the cadre of Systems called

for interview for the post of Senior Computer Officer

(Technical) in 1988 and was illegally shown at sl. no. 1

in the seniority list of Senior Computer Officer. He was

not eligible to be considered for the higher post. That

Rule 4 (d) of the Recruitment and Promotion Rules

provides that within a department, employees will be

divided into kindred occupational groups called cadres

as shown in the annexed schedule to the Rules and

seniority shall be on the basis of such cadres. That the

cadres of Systems and Maintenance being new cadres

have not been shown in the annexed schedule but have

been   shown    separately    on   seniority   lists.   The

submission was: two separate cadres could not have
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                            6</span>


been merged into one based on agreement arrived at

between the Corporation and the Officers' Association.

It was submitted that settlement arrived at between

the   Management      and   the   Officers'   Association       is

contrary to the Recruitment and Promotion Rules which

govern the promotions of the officers from the lower

post to the higher post. It was submitted that the

Recruitment and Promotion Rules are statutory in

nature and binding upon the Management.                   The

agreement/settlement is contrary to the Recruitment

and Promotion Rules.

appearing on behalf of the first respondent ably

supported the judgment under appeal and submitted

that the impugned judgment does not suffer from any

errors requiring interference of this court.

</p><p id="p_12">8.    Be it noted, the appellant did not make any

challenge in the writ petition as regards the validity of

the merger of two cadres.       She, however, appears to

have raised the dispute for the first time in her

rejoinder affidavit filed in the High Court. There is no

prayer to set aside the settlement arrived at between

the Management and the Officers' Association of which

she is also a member. It is not as if the appellant was

not aware of the merger of two streams in the EDP

Department and consequent preparation of a combined

seniority list. The appellant was a party- respondent in

writ petition No. 3647/93 in which the same issue as

the   one   raised   by   the   appellant   had   fallen   for

consideration and the High Court after an elaborate

consideration found nothing wrong with the settlement

and merger of the cadres. The Letters Patent Appeal

no. 75/94 preferred against the said judgment of the

learned Single Judge came to be dismissed because of

conferred under the Regulations referred to herein

above. Be it noted, there is no power vested in the

Corporation to make any rules since <a href="/doc/200054/" id="a_10">Section 44</a> of the

Act confers power to make rules only in the Central

Government       and   not    in   the   Corporation.      The

and Promotion Rules are not even notified in the

Gazette as it is not required whereas the service

Regulations    referred   to   herein   above   have   been

gazetted.     The Indian Airlines Corporation Employees

Service Regulations, 1955 which are made in exercise

of the powers conferred upon the Corporation by the

Act are undoubtedly statutory in nature but the

Recruitment and Promotion Rules are not statutory in

their nature. These Rules are not framed in exercise of

any Rule Making Power. Mere administrative rules are

not legislation of any kind. They are in the nature of

statements of policy and the practice of government

departments, statutory authorities, whether published

or otherwise. Statutory rules, which are made under

the provisions of any enactment and regulations,

subject to Parliamentary approval stand on entirely

different footing.   The administrative rules are always

considered and have repeatedly been held to be rules

of administrative practice merely, not rules of law and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                                       15</span>


not delegated legislation and they have no statutory

force. Mere description of such rules of administrative

practice as "rules" does not make them to be statutory

rules.   Such administrative rules can be modified,

amended or consolidated by the authorities without

following any particular procedure. There are no legal

restrictions to do so as long as they do not offend the

provisions of the Constitution or statutes or statutory

rules as the case may be.
</p>
<p id="p_22">13. In the present case the agreement/settlement

arrived at between the Management and its Officers'

Association has the effect of protanto amending the

Recruitment and Promotion Rules. The Rules and the

agreement/settlement are complimentary to each other

and have to be read together.

Gupta Vs. State of Jammu &amp; Kashmir &amp; Ors.

[(2004) 6 SCC 786],    in no manner assist the point

urged by the appellant.      The High Court having

analysed those decisions came to the right conclusion

that they are not applicable in deciding the issue

whether the Recruitment and Promotion Rules are

statutory in nature?   We are in agreement with the

view taken by the High Court.    It is unnecessary to

burden this short order of ours with the various

authorities upon which the appellant sought to place

reliance as we have no doubt in our mind whatsoever

that the Recruitment and Promotion Rules are not

statutory in nature.
</p>
<p id="p_25">

</p><p id="p_26">15. For the aforesaid reasons, we are in complete

agreement with the view taken by the Division Bench

of the High Court and as well as the learned Single

judge in coming to the conclusion that the Recruitment
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                                            17</span>


and Promotions Rules do not draw any statutory

flavour from the service Regulations.



</p><p id="p_27">16. The next question that requires consideration is

whether the merger of the two cadres is valid?



</p><p id="p_28">       The Indian Airlines Officers' Association of which

the appellant is also a member had requested the

Corporation for merger of seniority of the cadres. The

Corporation having considered the representations so

made decided that the software and hardware divisions

of EDP Department should be merged and a common

seniority list should be maintained. It was also decided

that      the      vacancies    of     Deputy         Manager

(Maintenance/Systems) may be filled up through the

merged     cadre    of   software    and    hardware     where

technically qualified personnel are available. Later,

pursuant    to   a further request         by   the    Officers'
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                                      18</span>


Association, it was decided that the seniority of

software and maintenance cadre be merged.



</p><p id="p_29">17. We find it difficult to agree with the contention of

the appellant that the respondents could not have

entered into agreement/settlement with the Indian

Airlines Officers Association and decided to make

promotions/appointments as per the said agreement

contrary to Recruitment and Promotion Rules. It is not

unusual   for   the   Managements     to   consider   the

representation of its Officers' Association and arrive at

a mutually agreed settlement after negotiations as long

as such settlement does not run counter or contrary to

any statutory instrument. Once it is to be held that the

Recruitment and Promotions Rules are not statutory in

nature but are in the nature of guidelines, there are no

impediments to uphold the merger of software and

hardware cadres into one cadre.        Be it noted, the

appellant did not question the merger of cadres in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                                           19</span>


writ petition filed by her except contending the decision

of the authorities of merger of two cadres into one was

in violation of the Recruitment and Promotion Rules. No

doubt an attempt was made by the appellant to

contend before us that the merger of the two cadres

into one is violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the

Constitution of India. This belated attempt on the part

of the appellant cannot be countenanced and we

cannot entertain any such plea at this stage without

there being any pleadings in that regard in the writ

petition filed in the High Court.
</p>
<p id="p_30">

</p><p id="p_31">18. The    appellant   herself      relied   on   number    of

recruitments and promotion guidelines issued from

time to time without questioning and challenging the

same. The agreement between the Corporation and its

Officers' Association including the promotion of 2nd

respondent as noted herein above was subject matter

of the writ petition filed by Joydev Chakraborthy in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                                       20</span>


which the appellant was arrayed as respondent.         The

High Court upheld the promotion of the 2nd respondent

as Deputy Manager (Maintenance/Systems) based on

the agreement between Indian Airlines and its Officers'

Association. The High Court upheld the merger of the

two cadres/streams.      The judgment of the High Court

attained its finality.
</p>
<p id="p_32">

</p><p id="p_33">19. Now we proceed to consider the case on merits as

to whether the promotion of the respondent nos. 2, 3

and 4 is not in accordance with law?
</p>
<p id="p_34">

</p><p id="p_35">      The appellant nowhere disputed the fact that

respondent no. 2 - Mr. M.M. Narula is senior to her in

terms of "length of service".    It is apparent from the

record that when seniority of two cadres was merged,

the   Senior   Computer     Officers   (Technical/Assistant

Manager (Systems), who had completed two years in

any capacity in any of the divisions were taken into
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                                          21</span>


consideration.    Respondent      No.    2    was    initially

appointed as an Assistant Manager (Systems) in the

erstwhile grade 13/14 w.e.f. August, 1985 and later

appointed as Senior Computer Officer (Tech.) which

was also in the same department. The appellant herein

was appointed to the post of Assistant Manager

(Systems) much later to the respondent no. 2 and only

on 5.9.1986. The attack is mounted only on the ground

that the respondent no. 2 belonged to different cadre,

namely hardware cadre and therefore, he was not

eligible to be considered for promotion.      It is by virtue

of the agreement/settlement, Senior Computer Officers

(Technical/Assistant   Manager    (Systems)        who   had

completed two years in any division - be it hardware or

software, were     considered for the post of Deputy

Manager    (Maintenance/Systems)        and    a    common

seniority list was prepared.     It is on that basis the

Corporation has rightly considered the case of the 2nd

respondent and selected him to the post of Deputy
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                                          22</span>


Manager       (Systems/Maintenance).        There    is   no

substantial challenge to the decision of merger of

software and hardware cadres into one cadre having

the common seniority list as arbitrary or on the ground

of mala fide on the part of the Corporation.              The

challenge is based on violation of the Recruitment and

Promotion Rules about which we have already dealt

with in preceding paragraphs. It needs no restatement

that the authorities are entitled to determine all

conditions of service, alteration thereof by amending

rules, constitution, classification, abolition of posts,

cadres or categories of service, amalgamation or

bifurcation       of     departments,        reconstitution,

restructuring of the pattern etc. as the same pertain to

the field of policy within the exclusive jurisdiction of the

employer,      subject   to   limitations   or   restrictions

envisaged in the Constitution. "There is no right in any

employee      to claim that rules governing conditions of

his service should be forever the same as the one when
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                                     23</span>


he entered service for all purposes and except for

ensuring rights or benefits already earned, acquired or

accrued at a particular point of time, a government

servant has no right to challenge the authority of the

State to amend, alter   and bring into force new rules

relating to   existing service." (See: P.U. Joshi Vs.

Accountant General [(2003) 2 SCC 632].          The High

Court came to the right conclusion that the promotion

of   the   respondent   no.   2   as   Deputy   Manager

(Maintenance/Systems) is not vitiated for any reason

whatsoever requiring interference.
</p>
<p id="p_36">

</p><p id="p_37">20. Now we shall consider the question whether

promotion of respondent no. 3 and 4 was valid?

</p><p id="p_38">     The selection of respondent no. 3 and 4 by a duly

constituted Selection Committee was made on the

basis of assessment of comparative merit, as per Rules

19 to 22 of the Recruitment and Promotion Rules.

Rules 19 to 22 of the Recruitment and Promotion Rules

are as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">     "19. The recommendations of the Promotion
     Committees will be passed on to the
     Competent Authority in the matter of
     appointments as defined in the `Instrument
     of Delegation of certain powers and
     Functions I.A.'

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">     20. Promotions will be considered on the
     basis of suitability-cum-seniority in the
     grades or inter-linked grade below the grade
     for which promotions are being considered
     subject to fitness of the employee being
     certified by the Sectional/Departmental Head
     for the employee in the following form:

          is       fit   to    be          considered       for
          promotion/selection to scale or pay.........
          ....'

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">     21. No employee can claim promotion as a
     matter of right. The advancement of an
     employee will depend as much on his
     suitability as on his relative standing with the
     others eligible for promotion.

<blockquote id="blockquote_8">     22. Promotions to Selection Grade will be
     on the basis of rigorous selection on merit

     according to the sanctioned strength from
     time to time."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_39">21. The appointments to the post of Deputy Manager

(Maintenance/Systems)      in   the    present      case   were

obviously not made on the basis of direct recruitment

but the selection and appointment were made on the

basis of promotion. The list of candidates called for

selection was only of serving employees and no claim

of any outsider was considered. It is evident from a

bare reading of Rule 21, that no employee can claim

promotion as a matter of right. It will depend on one's

own suitability as on his relative standing with the

others eligible for promotion.        Rule 20, provides that

promotions   will   be   considered      on   the    basis    of

`suitability-cum-seniority' in the grades or inter-linked

grade below the grade for which the promotions are

being considered subject to fitness of the employee

being certified by the Head of the Department.                    A

combined reading of Rules 20, 21 and 22 makes it
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                                        26</span>


abundantly clear that suitability of a candidate for

promotion has to be compared with others eligible for

promotion. Promotion to selection grade is to         be on

the   basis of `selection on merit' from amongst the

employees in grades or inter-linked grades below the

grade concerned and shall be limited to the number of

posts declared as such on the cadre according to the

sanctioned strength from time to time.         Rule 22 is

specific in its terms. It says, in case of `selection grade

posts', the selection is a `rigorous selection on merit'.



</p><p id="p_40">22.       It is not the case of the appellant that her

case was not at all considered for promotion to the

post of Deputy Manager (Maintenance/Systems). It is

clear from the record that the claim of the appellant for

promotion    was   duly   considered   along   with   other

eligible candidates including respondent nos. 3 and 4

who were ultimately found eligible and suitable for

promotion.   The Selection Board having assessed the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                                                  27</span>


ratings of each of the previous three years' annual

performance      appraisals       and      performance       of   the

appellant in the interview found her not suitable for

promotion.       The    respondent         nos.    3   and    4   had

outstanding     ratings     in    their     annual     performance

appraisals and were found suitable by the Selection

Board.    We cannot sit in appeal over the assessment

made by the Selection Board and substitute our own

opinion for that of the Board. In the result, we find the

decision to select and appoint respondent nos. 3 and 4

is not vitiated for any reason whatsoever.



</p><p id="p_41">23. The          post            of        Deputy            Manager

(Maintenance/Systems) is a an upper managerial post,

which    in   terms    of   the       existing    Recruitment     and

Promotion Rules, could be filled either by direct

recruitment or by promotion. If the vacancy was to be

filled up by way of promotion, promotion in such cases

obviously means promotion on the basis of suitability-
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                                      28</span>


cum-seniority. The process of selection on the basis of

suitability-cum-seniority is in accordance with the

package of Rules referred to herein above. It is not

necessary in this case to restate and reiterate the

difference between promotion based on seniority-cum-

merit    and   merit-cum-seniority.   The   concept    is

different. In case of the former, greater emphasis is

laid on seniority, though it is not the determinative

factor, while in the latter, merit is the determinative

factor. (See: K. Samantaray Vs. National Insurance

Co. Ltd. [ (2004) 9 SCC 286].
</p>
<p id="p_42">

</p><p id="p_43">24.     For the aforesaid reasons, we concur with the

view taken by the High Court that seniority alone was

not the determinative criteria for promotion, merit or

comparative merit was also taken into consideration by

the Selection Board and the same is not contrary to law

and guidelines.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                                                     29</span><p id="p_44">


</p><p id="p_45">25. Yet another aspect remains to be dealt with. The

appellant made an attempt to challenge the selection

procedure in which 50% marks were reserved for

interview and balance 50% marks on the evaluation of

the annual confidential reports. The High Court in this

regard rightly relied upon the decision in R.S. Parti Vs.

Indian Airlines Corporation &amp; Ors. in W.P. (c) No.

3364/90 dated 31.8.1995 in which the Court took the

view that post of Deputy Manager belongs to upper

managerial cadre and allocation of 50% marks for the

interview and 50% marks       on the evaluation of the

ACRs is not arbitrary.   In R.S. Parti (supra) reliance

was placed upon the decision of this Court in Indian

Airlines Corporation Vs. Capt. K.C. Shukla &amp; Ors.

[(1993) 1 SCC 17],       in which the post of Deputy

Operations Manager was in question and the method of

evaluation was the same as in the present case. In the

said case, this Court held as under:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                                              30</span><p id="p_46">


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">      "Law on the proportion between written test and
      interview or evaluation on confidential entries and
      personality test have been laid down in a series of
      decisions by this Court commencing from <a href="/doc/1186368/" id="a_11">Ajay
      Hasia v. Khalid Mujib Sehravardi</a>; <a href="/doc/962160/" id="a_12">Lila Dhar v. State
      of Rajasthan</a>; <a href="/doc/634160/" id="a_13">Ashok Kumar Yadav v. State of
      Haryana</a> and <a href="/doc/42575583/" id="a_14">State of U.P. v. Rafiquddin</a>. Distinction
      appears to have been drawn in interview held for
      competitive     examinations   or    admission     in
      educational institutions and selection for higher
      posts. Effort has been made to eliminate scope of
      arbitrariness in the former by narrowing down the
      proportion as various factors are likely to creep in.
      But same standard cannot be applied for higher
      selections. Lila Dhar case brings it out fully. In
      respondent's case the personality of the respondent
      was being judged by a Committee constituted
      under the rules for purposes of higher promotional
      posts and, therefore, it was governed by the ratio
      laid down in Lila Dhar case and it would be unsafe
      to strike down the rules as arbitrary when the
      evaluation was job oriented. Marks to be allotted by
      the Committee were on professional ability and
      management capacity."
</blockquote>



<p id="p_47">This authoritative pronouncement of this Court, in our

considered    opinion,    should    put    an    end     to   the

controversy   raised     by   the   appellant.      It   is   not

necessary to dilate any further on the subject.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                                                    31</span>


</p><p id="p_48">26. Yet another aspect of the matter: That the

appellant admittedly had participated in the similar

selection process for erstwhile grade 15 and 16,

Manager (Maintenance/Systems) and Senior Manager

(Maintenance/Systems) respectively.   The Corporation

had given adequate opportunity to the appellant to

compete with all other eligible candidates at the

selection for consideration of the case of all eligible

candidates to the post in question. The Corporation did

not violate the right to equality guaranteed under

Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.   The appellant

having participated in the selection process along with

the contesting respondents without any demur or

protest cannot be allowed to turn round and question

the very same process having failed to qualify for the

promotion. In Madan Lal &amp; Ors. Vs. State of J &amp; K

&amp; Ors.[ (1995) 3 SCC 486], this Court observed: "It

is now well settled that if a candidate        takes a

calculated chance and appears at the interview, then,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                                     32</span>


only because the result of the interview is not palatable

to him, he cannot turn round and subsequently contend

that the process of interview was unfair: Therefore, the

result of the interview test on merits cannot be

successfully challenged by a candidate who takes a

chance to get selected at the said interview and who

ultimately finds himself to be unsuccessful." Reference

may also be made to the decision of this Court in

Chandra Prakash Tiwari Vs. Shakuntala Shukla

[(2002) 6 SCC 127].

</p><p id="p_51">     However, before parting with the case, we must

make it clear that the appellant in her anxiety to
