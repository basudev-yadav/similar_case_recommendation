HEADNOTE:



JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
B.P.  JEEVAN  REDDY,  J.- Till the  wind  of  liberalisation
started	 blowing across the Indian economic  landscape	over
the  last  year or two, the Indian economy was	a  sheltered
one.   At  the time of Independence, India did not  have  an
industrial base worth the name.	 A firm industrial base	 had
to  be laid.  Heavy industry was the crying need.  All	this
required  foreign exchange.  The sterling balances built  up
during World War 11 were fast dissipating.  Foreign exchange
had  to be conserved, which meant prohibition of  import  of
several	 unessential  items and close  regulation  of  other
imports.   It was also found necessary to  raise  protective
walls  to  nurture  and encourage  the	nascent	 industries.
These controls had, however, an unfortunate fall-out.	They
gave  rise  to	a class of smugglers  and  foreign  exchange
manipulators  who were out to frustrate the regulations	 and
restrictions  profit being their sole motive, and success in
life the sole earthly judge of right and wrong.	 As early as
1947,  the Central Legislature found it necessary  to  enact
the  <a href="/doc/27905/" id="a_1">Foreign Exchange Regulation Act</a>, 1947 and	Imports	 and
Exports (Control) Act, 1947.  Then came the Import (Control)
Order, 1955 to place the policy regarding imports on a surer
footing.   In the year 1962, a new <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_2">Customs Act</a> replaced	 the
antiquated  Sea Customs Act, 1878.  The menace of  smuggling
and foreign exchange violations, however, continued to	rise
unabated.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> 63</span>
<p id="p_2">Parliament  then  came	forward	 with  the  Conservation  of
Foreign Exchange and <a href="/doc/135830564/" id="a_3">Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act</a>,
1974  (COFEPOSA).  It provided for preventive  detention  of
these antisocial elements.
</p><p id="p_3">2.  On	25-6-1975,  the President  of  India  proclaimed  an
emergency under <a href="/doc/1758457/" id="a_4">Article 352(1)</a> of the Constitution of  India
on  the ground that "the security of India is threatened  by
internal disturbance".	A proclamation of emergency dated 3-
12-1971 issued under <a href="/doc/1758457/" id="a_5">Article 352(1)</a> on the ground that	"the
security of India is threatened by external aggression"	 was
already	 in  force.  These declarations had  the  effect  of
'suspending'  to use a popular though not strictly  accurate
expression   <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_6">Article  19</a> as provided by <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_7">Article 358</a>  of	 the
Constitution.	On 27-6-1975 the President of India made  an
order under <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_8">Article 359(1)</a> of the Constitution declaring
	      "[T]hat  the right of any person (including  a
	      foreigner)   to	move  any  court   for	 the
	      enforcement of the rights conferred by <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_9">Article
	      14</a>,   <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_10">Article  21</a>	 and  <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_11">Article  22</a>   of	 the
	      Constitution  and all proceedings	 pending  in
	      any  court  for the enforcement of  the  above
	      mentioned	 rights shall remain  suspended	 for
	      the  period during which the  proclamation  of
	      emergency made under clause (1) of <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_12">Article 352</a>
			    of the Constitution on 3-12-1971 and on  25-6-
	      1975 are both in force."
</p><p id="p_4">3.   With  effect  from 1-7-1975, COFEPOSA  was	 amended  in
certain	 respects.  Inter alia, it introduced  <a href="/doc/27905/" id="a_13">Section	12-A</a>
containing  special provisions for dealing  with  emergency.
By  virtue  of <a href="/doc/27905/" id="a_14">Section 12-A</a>, the requirements of  supply  of
grounds [<a href="/doc/1054303/" id="a_15">Section 3(3)</a>] and consultation with Advisory  Board
(<a href="/doc/616745/" id="a_16">Section 8</a>) were practically done away with.
</p><p id="p_5">4.   In	 the year 1976, no doubt, during the continuance  of
emergency,  Parliament	enacted the  Smugglers	and  Foreign
Exchange  Manipulators	(Forfeiture of Property)  Act,	1976
(SAFEMA).   It replaced an Ordinance to the same effect	 and
was brought into force from the date of the Ordinance, viz.,
5-11-1975.  <a href="/doc/27905/" id="a_17">This Act</a> applies to persons convicted under	 the
Sea  Customs  Act, 1878/<a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_18">Customs Act</a>,  1962/FERA,  1947/FERA,
1973  and  to  those  detained	under  the  COFEPOSA,  whose
detention  order  was neither set aside nor revoked  in	 the
circumstances  mentioned  therein.  Besides the	 persons  so
convicted/detained,  the Act applies to their relatives	 and
associates  as	well.	The main purpose of the	 Act  is  to
forfeit the illegally acquired properties of such  smugglers
and  foreign exchange manipulators in whosoever's name	they
may have been kept.
</p><p id="p_6">5.   During the period the emergency proclaimed on 25-6-1975
was  in force, several orders of detention were	 made  under
<a href="/doc/146959060/" id="a_19">Section 3</a> of COFEPOSA.	In view of the provisions of <a href="/doc/66673733/" id="a_20">Section
12-A</a>,  the  said  detenus were	neither	 supplied  with	 the
grounds	 of detention nor were their cases refer-red to	 the
Advisory  Board.   The	detenus,  however,  had	 no  remedy.
Because of the order under <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_21">Article 359(1)</a> and the  operation
of  <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_22">Article  358</a>  as interpreted by this  Court	 in  A.D.M.,
Jabalpur  v. Shivakant Shuklal they could not  approach	 the
High Court or this Court for relief.  The
1  (1976) 2 SCC 521
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">64</span>
emergency was revoked on 21-3-1977 and the detenus released.
Subsequently  notices  were issued under Section  6  of	 the
SAFEMA	to the said detenus, their relatives and  associates
calling upon them to show cause why the properties mentioned
in  the	 notices  be  not  declared  as	 illegally  acquired
properties and forfeited.  SAFEMA was being invoked  against
them  because  of the orders of detention made	against	 the
detenus under COFEPOSA during the period of emergency.	 The
said  orders  of  detention were the  connecting  link,	 the
foundation  for the action being taken against the  detenus,
their  friends and relatives under SAFEMA. .[The  orders  of
detention,  it	is not in dispute, were not revoked  or	 set
aside  as contemplated by clause (b) of sub-section  (2)  of
Section	 2  of SAFEMA].	 It is then that  the  said  persons
approached the High Courts under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_23">Article 226</a> and this  Court
under  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_24">Article 32</a> for quashing the said notices.   In  these
writ petitions, the constitutional validity of the COFEPOSA,
SAFEMA	and  of the 39th, 40th and 42nd	 Amendments  to	 the
Constitution  of India were questioned. (In a few cases,  it
appears, final orders were also passed but that circumstance
does  not  make	 any difference to  the	 principle  involved
herein).   In  most of the cases  further  proceedings	were
stayed.
</p><p id="p_7">6.   The  Attorney General of India applied for transfer  of
the  writ petitions pending in various High Courts  to	this
Court  to  be  heard  along  with  the	petitions  preferred
directly   in	this  Court  in	 view	of   the   important
constitutional	questions  raised therein.  The	 prayer	 for
transfer  is granted in all the transfer  petitions.   Leave
granted in the SLP.
</p><p id="p_8">7.   It	 may  be mentioned that COFEPOSA was placed  in	 the
Ninth  Schedule	 at SI.	 No. 104 by the	 Constitution  (39th
<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_25">Amendment)  Act</a>,  1975	while the SAFEMA  and  the  <a href="/doc/1573179/" id="a_26">COFEPOSA
(Amendment)  Act</a>s,  1976  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_27">(Central Act</a>s 13 and	20  of	1976
respectively)  were placed in the Ninth Schedule  at  Serial
Nos.  127 and 129 by the Constitution (40th <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_28">Amendment)	Act</a>,
1976.
</p><p id="p_9">8.   The counsel appearing for the petitioners urged several
contentions  all of which have been contested by Shri  Altaf
Ahmed,	learned	 Additional Solicitor General.	 The  issues
arising	 from the rival contentions urged at the bar may  be
formulated  in	the  shape of questions.  They	are  to	 the
following effect:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	      (1)  Whether Parliament was not  competent  to
	      enact COFEPOSA and SAFEMA?</blockquote>
<p id="p_10">	      (2)   Whether  an	 order	of  detention  under
	      <a href="/doc/146959060/" id="a_29">Section  3</a> read with <a href="/doc/66673733/" id="a_30">Section 12-A</a> of  COFEPOSA
	      made during the period of emergency proclaimed
	      under  <a href="/doc/1758457/" id="a_31">Article 352(1)</a> of the  Constitution  of
	      India,   with the consequent  ,suspension'  of

	      to  move	the  court  to	enforce	 the  rights
	      conferred	 by  Articles  14,  21	and  22	 was
	      suspended	 can form the foundation for  taking
	      action  under Section 6 of SAFEMA against	 the
	      detenu, his relatives and associates?  And  if
	      it  does	can the validity of  such  order  of
	      detention	 be challenged by the detenu  and/or
	      his relatives and associates, when proceedings
	      are taken against him/them under SAFEMA,	even
	      though the said order of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">	       65</span>
	      detention	 has ceased to be operative and	 was
	      not  either  challenged  or  not	successfully
	      challenged   during its operation? (3) If	 the
	      answer  to Question 1 is in  the	affirmative,
	      should the validity of the order of  detention
	      be  tested with reference to the	position  of
	      law  obtaining at the time of making the	said
			    order  and	during its period of  operation	 o
r
	      with   reference	to  the	 position   of	 law
	      obtaining on the date of issuance of the show-
	      cause notice under Section 6 of SAFEMA?
</p><p id="p_11">	      (4)   Whether  the  definition  of  "illegally
	      acquired property" in clause (c)	  of Section
	      3(1) of SAFEMA is violative of the fundamental
	      in  rights  of the petitioners  guaranteed  by
	      Articles	14,  19	 and  21  and  whether	 the
	      inclusion	 of SAFEMA in the Ninth Schedule  to
	      the Constitution cures such violation, if any?
	      (5)   Whether the application of SAFEMA to the
	      relatives	  and  associates  of	detenus	  is
	      violative of Articles 14, 19 and 21?   Whether
	      the  inclusion  of the said Act in  the  Ninth
	      Schedule cures such violation, if any?

</p><p id="p_13">For a proper appreciation of the aforesaid questions, it  is
necessary  to  briefly refer to the relevant  provisions  of
both the enactments.

</p><p id="p_44">20.  Before  entering upon discussion of the issues  arising
herein,	 it  is	 necessary  to	make  a	 few   clarificatory
observations.	Though	a challenge  to	 the  constitutional
validity   of  39th,  40th  and	 42nd  Amendments   to	 the
Constitution  was  levelled  in the writ  petitions  on	 the
ground that the said Amendments	 effected after the decision
in  <a href="/doc/257876/" id="a_86">Kesavananda	 Bharati v. State of Kerala2</a>   infringe	 the
basic structure of the Constitution, no serious attempt	 was
made during the course of arguments to substantiate it.	  It
was  generally	argued that <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_87">Article 14</a> is one of  the  basic
features  of the Constitution and hence	 any  constitutional
amendment  violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_88">Article 14</a> is equally  violative  of
the basic structure.  This simplistic argument overlooks the
raison d'etre of <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_89">Article 31-B</a>  at any rate, its	 continuance
and  relevance	after  Bharati2	 and of the  39th  and	40th
Amendments   placing  the  said	 enactments  in	 the   Ninth
Schedule.   Acceptance	of the petitioners'  argument  would
mean that in case of post-Bharati2 constitutional amendments
placing	 Acts  in  the Ninth  Schedule,	 the  protection  of
<a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_90">Article	 31-B</a>  would not be available  against	<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_91">Article	 14.</a>
Indeed,	 it  was  suggested that Articles  21  and  19	also
represent the basic features of the Constitution.  If so, it
would mean a further enervation of <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_92">Article 31-B.</a>  Be that as
it  may,  in the absence of any effort to  substantiate	 the
said challenge, we do not wish to express any opinion on the
constitutional	validity  of the said Amendments.   We	take
them as they are, i.e., we assume them to be good and valid.
We  must also say that no effort has also been made  by	 the
counsel to establish in what manner the said <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_93">Amendment	Act</a>s
violate <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_94">Article 14.</a>
</p><p id="p_45">21.  COFEPOSA is a law relating to preventive detention.  It
has, therefore, to conform to the provisions in clauses	 (4)
to  (7) of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_95">Article 22.</a>	Insofar as SAFEMA is  concerned,  it
is,  of course, not a law relating to  preventive  detention
though it is designed to achieve tile very same objective
2  (1973) 4 SCC 225 : 1973 Supp 1 SCR 1
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">72</span>
by different means.  While one seeks to deter them by  means
of  preventive detention, the other seeks to punish them  by
depriving them of their ill-gotten gains.  SAFEMA is thus  a
measure	 designed to protect the economy of the	 country  as
also  a measure to discourage law-breaking   in	 particular,
economic violations.  The principles relevant in judging the
validity  and  relevant in the matter  of  interpreting	 the
provisions  of	such  economic	measures  are  fairly	well
settled.   It  is held that in case of such  enactments	 the
legislature must be permitted a greater play in the  joints.
As  pointed  out by Bhagwati, J. in <a href="/doc/314044/" id="a_96">R. K. Garg v.  Union  of
India3</a>: (SCR p. 970: SCC- p. 69 1, para 8)
	      "The   court   must   always   remember	that
	      'legislation   is	  directed   to	   practical
	      problems,	 that  the  economic  mechanism	  is
	      highly   sensitive  and  complex,	 that	many
	      problems	are  singular and  contingent,	that
	      laws are not abstract propositions and do	 not
	      relate  to  abstract units and are not  to  be
	      measured	by abstract symmetry';	'that  exact
	      wisdom  and nice adaptation of remedy are	 not
	      always possible' and that judgment is  largely
	      a	 prophecy based on meagre and  uninterpreted
	      experience'.   Every legislation	particularly
	      in economic matters is essentially empiric and
	      it is based on experimentation or what one may
	      call  trial and error method and therefore  it
	      cannot provide for all possible situations  or
	      anticipate all possible abuses.  There may  be
	      crudities	  and  inequities   in	 complicated
	      experimental economic legislation but on	that
	      account  alone  it cannot be  struck  down  as
	      invalid.	The courts cannot, as pointed out by
	      the  United States Supreme Court in  Secretary
	      of  Agriculture v. Central Roig Refining	Co.4
	      be  converted into tribunals for	relief	from
	      such crudities and inequities.  There may even
	      be possibilities of abuse, but that too cannot
	      of  itself  be a ground for  invalidating	 the
	      legislation,  because it is not  possible	 for
	      any  legislature to anticipate as if  by	some
	      divine  prescience, distortions and abuses  of
	      its  legislation	which may be made  by  those
	      subject  to  its	provisions  and	 to  provide
	      against such distortions and abuses.   Indeed,
	      howsoever	 great may be the care	bestowed  on
	      its framing, it is difficult to conceive of  a
	      legislation  which  is not  capable  of  being
	      abused  by  perverted  human  ingenuity.	 The
	      Court	must	therefore    adjudge	 the
	      constitutionality	 of such legislation by	 the
	      generality  of its provisions and not  by	 its
	      crudities	   or	inequities   or	   by	 the
	      possibilities   of   abuse  of  any   of	 its
			    provisions.	  If any crudities,  inequities	 o
r
	      possibilities  of	 abuse come  to	 light,	 the
	      legislature  can	always	step  in  and  enact
	      suitable amendatory legislation.	That is	 the
	      essence of pragmatic approach which must guide
	      and  inspire the legislature in  dealing	with
	      complex		economic	    issues."

To  the same effect are the observations (SCC at p. 663)  in

of India</a> 5, a decision of the Constitution Bench.
</p><p id="p_47">22.   It  is  not necessary  to	 multiply  the	authorities.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">Question No. 1</span>
<p id="p_48">23.   It is argued for the petitioners that COFEPOSA is	 not
relatable  to Entry 9 of List I of the Seventh	Schedule  to
the  Constitution  inasmuch  as	 the  preventive   detention
provided  therefore  is	 not  for  reasons  connected	with
defence, foreign affairs or security of India.	Even Entry 3
of  List  III, it is submitted, does not  warrant  the	said
enactment.  So far as SAFEMA is concerned, it is argued,  it
is not relatable to any of the Entries 1 to 96 in List I  or
to  any of the Entries in List III.  We are not prepared  to
agree.	COFEPOSA is clearly relatable to Entry 3 of List III
inasmuch as it provides	 for   preventive   detention	 for
reasons connected with the security of the State as well  as
the  maintenance of supplies and services essential  to	 the
community  besides Entry 9 of List I. While Entry 3 of	List
III  speaks  of	 "security of a State", Entry 9	 of  List  I
speaks	of  "security of India".  Evidently,  they  are	 two
distinct  and different expressions.  "Security of a  State"
is  a  much  wider  expression.	 A State  with	a  weak	 and
vulnerable economy cannot guard its security well.  It	will
be  an	easy  prey  to	economic  colonisers.	We  know  of
countries  where the economic policies are not	dictated  by
the   interest	of  that  State	 but  by  the  interest	  of
multinationals	and/or other powerful countries.  A  country
with  a	 weak economy is very often obliged to	borrow	from
International  Financial  Institutions who in turn  seek  to
dictate	 the economic priorities of the borrowing State	  it
is immaterial whether they do so in the interest of powerful
countries  who contribute substantially to their fund or  in
the  interest  of  their loan.	In  the	 modern	 world,	 the
security of a State is ensured not so much by physical might
but by economic strength  at any rate, by economic  strength
as  much  as  by armed might.  It  is,	therefore,  idle  to
contend	 that COFEPOSA is unrelated to the security  of	 the
State.	 Indeed in the very preamble to the Act,  Parliament
states	that the violations of foreign exchange	 regulations
and   smuggling	 activities  are  having   an	increasingly
deleterious  effect on the national economy thereby  casting
serious	 adverse  effect on the security of the	 State.	  Be
that  as it may, it is not necessary to pursue this line  of
reasoning since we are in total agreement with the  approach
evolved in <a href="/doc/1235907/" id="a_98">Union of India v. H.S. Dhillon6</a>  a decision by  a
Constitution Bench of seven Judges.  The test evolved in the
said  decision	is  this in  short:  Where  the	 legislative
competence  of Parliament to enact a particular	 statute  is
questioned, one must look at the several entries in List  II
to  find  out (applying the well-known	principles  in	this
behalf)	 whether  the said statute is relatable	 to  any  of
those entries.	If the statute does not relate to any of the
entries	 in  List II, no further inquiry is  necessary.	  It
must be held that
5 (1989) 3 SCC 634
6    (1971) 2 SCC 779 :(1972) 2 SCR 33
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">74</span>
Parliament  is	competent to enact that statute	 whether  by
virtue of the entries in List I and List III or by virtue of
<a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_99">Article	 248</a> read with Entry 97 of List I. In this case,  it
is  not even suggested that either of the two enactments  in
question are relatable to any of the entries in List II.  If
so,  we	 need not go further and enquire to which  entry  or
entries	 do  these  Acts relate.  It  should  be  held	that
Parliament did have the competence to enact them.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">Question Nos. 2 and 3</span>
<p id="p_49">24.  These   questions	arise  this  way.   The	 orders	  of
detention concerned herein were made on or after the date of
the  proclamation  of emergency to which  <a href="/doc/66673733/" id="a_100">Section  12-A</a>	 was
applicable.  None of them are, what may be called,  ,normal'
orders	of  detention.	For that reason,  the  detenus	were
neither	 supplied  with the grounds of detention,  nor	were
they  given an opportunity to make a representation  against
their  detention  nor does it appear that their	 cases	were
referred  to the Advisory Board	 not at any rate within	 the
period prescribed by <a href="/doc/185581247/" id="a_101">Section 8</a>, or for that matter,  Section
</p><p id="p_50">9. They were released on or within a day or two of the	date
on which the emergency was lifted.  In this sense, the order
of  detention  has  worked itself out.	But  that  order  of
detention  is now being made the foundation, the  basis	 for
taking	action	under  SAFEMA  against	the  detenus,  their
relatives  and their associates.  SAFEMA is made  applicable
to them by virtue of <a href="/doc/104819381/" id="a_102">Section 2(2)(b)</a> read with clauses	(c),
</p><p id="p_51">(d)  and (e) of sub-section (2).  The petitioners  say	that
since  the  order of detention under COFEPOSA  is  made	 the
basis  for  action  under  SAFEMA  against  them,  they	 are
entitled   to  challenge  the  validity	 of  the  order	  of
detention.   They  may not have been able  to  question	 the
validity  of detention during their detention by  virtue  of
<a href="/doc/66673733/" id="a_103">Section	 12-A</a>  of COFEPOSA (non-supply of grounds  and	non-
reference to Advisory Board) and also because their right to
move  the court for enforcement of the rights guaranteed  to
them  by  Articles 14, 21 and 22 was  suspended	 during	 the
period	of  emergency by an order made by the  President  of
India  under  <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_104">Article  359.</a>(1)	of  the	 Constitution	even
<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_105">Article 19</a> did not avail them by virtue of <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_106">Article 358</a>	 but
when the said orders of detention are sought to be made	 the
basis	of  action  under  SAFEMA,  after  the	lifting	  of
emergency,  they  are now entitled to question	them.	They
point  out  that by virtue of the order made  under  <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_107">Article
359(1</a>),	 the  fundamental  rights  guaranteed  to  them	  by
Articles  14,  21 and 22 were not suspended,  but  only	 the
right  to move for their enforcement was suspended.  If	 so,
they say, the detention orders made against them are invalid
and illegal for violation of clauses (4) and (5) of  Article
</p><p id="p_52">22.   They may have been barred from enforcing their  rights
under  Articles 22, 21 and 19 because of the said  order  of
the  President,	 but  that  did not  render  the  orders  of
detention  valid.   Such invalid, indeed void  orders,	they
say,  cannot  serve  as the basis or as	 the  foundation  of
action under SAFEMA.  They also stress the drastic nature of
the  provisions of SAFEMA.  On the other hand, the.  learned
Additional  Solicitor General relies upon the provisions  of
clause (1-A) of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_108">Article 359</a> and submits that the validity of
the said detention orders has to be judged with reference to
the  law  then obtaining and not with reference to  the	 law
obtaining on the date of issuance
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15"> 75</span>
of  notice  under  Section 6 of SAFEMA.	  At  any  rate,  he
submits, clause (1-A) of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_109">Article 359</a> saves all such  orders.
Suspension  of remedy, he says, is tantamount to  suspension
of  the	 right itself since one cannot conceive of  a  right
without a remedy.  There is no distinction, he says, between
<a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_110">Article	 358</a>  and  an order under  <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_111">Article  359(1)</a>  in	this
regard.	  He  places strong reliance upon  the	observations

</p><p id="p_60">	      "<a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_133">Article	359</a>,  on the other  hand,  does	 not
	      purport  expressly  to  suspend  any  of	 the
	      fundamental   rights.    It   authorises	 the
	      President to issue an order declaring that the
	      right  to	 move any court for  enforcement  of
	      such  of	the  rights in Part III	 as  may  be
	      mentioned	 in  the order and  all	 proceedings

	      is in force or for such shorter period as	 may
	      be   specified   in  the	order.	  What	 the

	      the  power  conferred  on	 the  President	  by
	      <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_134">Article  359(1)</a>  is to bar the remedy  of	 the

	      expressly	  suspended,  but  the	citizen	  is
	      deprived	of his right to move any  court	 for
	      their  enforcement.   That  is  one  important
	      distinction between the provisions of  <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_135">Article
	      358</a> and <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_136">Article 359(1)."</a>
</p><p id="p_61">	      28.   It	was  urged by the  learned  Attorney
	      General that suspension of the citizens' right
	      to  move	any court for the enforcement  of  a
	      particular fundamental right amounts in law to
	      suspension  of the said right itself  for	 the
	      said period.  The Bench, however, declined  to
	      go into the said question and proceeded on the
	      assumption "that the said rights are in theory
	      alive"   even   during  the  period   of	 the
	      Presidential Order.  The Special Bench pointed
	      out further:
</p><p id="p_62">	      "	 It would be noticed that  the	Presidential
	      Order  cannot  widen  the	 authority  of	 the
	      legislatures  or	the  executive;	 it   merely
	      suspends	the  rights  to move  any  court  to
	      obtain a relief on the ground that the  rights
	      conferred by Part III have been contravened if
	      the  said rights are specified in	 the  Order.
	      The inevitable consequence of this position is
	      that  as	soon  as  the  Order  ceases  to  be
	      operative, the infringement of the rights made
	      either  by  the legislative  enactment  or  by
	      executive action can perhaps be challenged  by
	      a citizen in a court of law and the same may
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">	       77</span>
	      have  to be tried on the merits on  the  basis
	      that the rights alleged to have been infringed
			    were  in operation even during the pendency	 o
f
	      the Presidential Order.  If at the  expiration
	      of  the Presidential Order, Parliament  passes
	      any  legislation to protect  executive  action
	      taken during the pendency of the	Presidential
	      Order and afford indemnity to the executive in
	      that  behalf, the validity and the  effect  of
	      such   legislative  action  may  have  to	  be
	      carefully scrutinised.
</p><p id="p_63">	       Since  the  object  of <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_137">Article 359(1)</a>  is  to
	      suspend the rights of the citizens to move any
	      court,  the  consequence of  the	Presidential
	      Order may be that any proceeding which may  be
	      pending  at  the	date of	 the  Order  remains
	      suspended during the time that the Order is in
	      operation	 and  may be revived when  the	said
	      Order  ceases  to	 be  operative;	 and   fresh
	      proceedings cannot be taken by a citizen after
	      the  Order has been issued, because the  Order
	      takes  away  the right to move any  court	 and
	      during  the operation of the Order,  the	said
	      right  cannot  be exercised by  instituting  a
	      fresh proceeding contrary to the Order.  If  a
	      fresh  proceeding falling within the  mischief
	      of  <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_138">Article 359(1)</a> and the Presidential  Order
	      issued under it is instituted after the  Order
	      has been issued, it will have to be  dismissed
	      as being incompetent.  In other words, <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_139">Article
	      359(1)</a> and the Presidential Order issued under
	      it  may constitute a sort of moratorium  or  a
	      blanket	ban  against  the   institution	  or
	      continuance of any legal action subject to two
	      important	 conditions.   The  first  condition
	      relates  to the character of the legal  action
	      and requires that the said action must seek to
	      obtain  a	 relief	 on  the  ground  that	 the
	      claimant's fundamental rights specified in the
	      Presidential Order have been contravened,	 and
	      the  second  condition relates to	 the  period
	      during which this ban is to operate.  The	 ban
	      operates	 either	 for  the  period   of	 the
	      Proclamation or for such shorter period as may
	      be specified in the Order."

Yet  another distinction is that while <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_162">Article	358</a>  enables
the  State to make any law or to take any  executive  action
inconsistent with <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_163">Article 19</a> during the period of emergency,
clauses	 (1) and (1-A) of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_164">Article 359</a> read together  provide
for  suspension	 (by means of a Presidential Order)  of	 the
enforcement of the fundamental rights specified in the order
and  simultaneously enable the State to make any law  or  to
take any executive action inconsistent with such fundamental
rights.	  It is evident that what is said in  Makhan  Singh7
with respect to <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_165">Article 358 (competence of the State to make
a law or to take executive action inconsistent with  Article</a>
</p><p id="p_73">19)  does  apply  equally to <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_166">Article 359</a> by  virtue  of	 the
introduction of clause (1-A) with retrospective effect.	  In
other words, during the period the Presidential Order  under
<a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_167">Article	 359(1)</a> is in force, the State is competent to	make
any law or take any executive action which it could not have
taken	but  for  the  suspension  of  enforcement  of	 the
fundamental rights specified in the Presidential Order.	  In
our opinion, the position under <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_168">Article 358</a> is this: <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_169">Article
358</a>  enables the State	it empowers the State  to  make	 any
law  or	 to  take any  executive  action  inconsistent	with
<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_170">Article 19.</a>  This exceptional power is, however, confined to
the  period of emergency and is intended to  facilitate	 the
effective  implementation  of the objectives  of  emergency.
The  justification of this extraordinary provision  is	that
individual  liberties  may  have  to  be  kept	in  abeyance
temporarily  if	 found necessary to meet the threat  to	 the
security of India or any part thereof within the meaning  of
<a href="/doc/1758457/" id="a_171">Article	 352(1).</a>   As soon as emergency ceases, the  law  so
made  shall to the extent of inconsistency with	 <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_172">Article  19</a>
cease to have effect, except with respect to things done  or
omitted to be done before the law so ceases to have  effect.
What  it means is that the validity of the law made  or	 the
things	done  or omitted to be done by virtue  of  the	said
article during the period of emergency cannot be  questioned
either	during	or  after the emergency	 on  the  ground  of
inconsistency  with  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_173">Article  19.</a> Neither the  law  nor	 the
executive  action (to the extent of its	 inconsistency	with
<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_174">Article 19</a>) can continue even for a day beyond the cessation
of  emergency.	Their validity and/or the competence of	 the
State  to make or take them during the period  of  emergency
is, however, placed beyond question.  By way of illustration
a  law	may have been made or an executive action  may	have
been taken unduly restricting the freedom of speech and	 the
freedom	 of press. during the emergency.   Such	 restriction
insofar	 as it is not warranted by <a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_175">Article 19(2)</a>  ceases  to
operate	 or to have effect with the cessation of  emergency.
But the citizen whose right has been unreasonably  curtailed
cannot sue the State for damages or other relief nor can  he
take  any  other proceeding against the State  for  imposing
such   unreasonable   restriction  during  the	 period	  of
emergency.   This is because of the protection	provided  to
the  State  by <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_176">Article 358.</a>  It should	be  remembered	that
<a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_177">Article	 358</a>  sanctions such a course because  the  Founding
Fathers	 thought  and not without justification	  that	when
the  security of India or any part thereof is threatened  as
contemplated  by <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_178">Article 352</a>, the State should be left	free
to make such law or to take such executive action as is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">80</span>
necessary   to	safeguard  the	security  of   the   country
unfettered   by	  the  provisions  in  <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_179">Article	 19.</a>	This
subordination of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_180">Article 19</a>, however, is only for the period
the  proclamation  of  emergency under	<a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_181">Article	 352</a>  is  in
operation.
</p><p id="p_74">32.  Now coming to clauses (1) and (1-A) of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_182">Article 359</a>	 the
position is this:While clause (1) empowers the President  to
suspend	 the enforcement of the fundamental rights named  in
such  notification  (and  any and all  proceedings  in	that
behalf	in any court), it does not empower the President  to
suspend	 the  fundamental rights.  Evidently,  the  Founding
Fathers	 did not think it necessary to clothe the  President
with  such a power.  The words in clause (1) are  clear	 and
unambiguous.  They only speak of suspending the	 enforcement
of  the	 rights in Part III and not  suspending	 the  rights
themselves.   We  see no warrant, no  justification  and  no
basis for holding that the suspension of enforcement of	 the
rights	means  in  effect  the	suspension  of	the   rights
themselves.   If  that were the intention  of  the  Founding
Fathers,  they would have said so expressly.   Indeed,	they
have  stated what they meant in explicit language.  In	view
of  the	 fact that the fundamental rights in  Part  III	 are
allowed to be affected by a Presidential Order, we think, we
ought  not  to	read  anything more  than  what	 the  clause
expressly  says	  and its language leaves no  room  for	 any
doubt.	This is the view taken in Makhan Singh7 [as well  as
by  Bhagwati, J. in A.D.M., Jabalpur v.	 Shivakant  Shuklal]
and  we agree with them respectfully.  Then came clause	 (1-
A), introduced by the 38th <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_183">Amendment Act</a> with  retrospective
effect	from  the date of the Constitution.   It  says	that
while a Presidential Order suspending particular fundamental
rights is in operation, the State shall be entitled to	make
any  law or to take any executive action which it would	 not
have been entitled to make or to take but for the suspension
of  the enforcement of the said rights.	 At the	 same  time,
the clause says that any law so made shall, to the extent of
incompetency,	cease  to  have	 effect	 as  soon   as	 the
Presidential  Order  ceases to operate "except	as  respects
things	done or omitted to be done before the law so  ceases
to  have  effect".  The effect of these	 words	("except  as
respects  "...	effect")  is  evidently	 the  same  as	that
obtaining  under  <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_184">Article 358 (which too  employs  identical
words)</a> which we have explained hereinbefore at some  length.
It  is true that clause (1) of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_185">Article 359</a> does not  provide
for the suspension of any of the fundamental rights but only
their  enforcement  and	 it  is	 equally  true	that   those
fundamental rights (whose enforcement is suspended) continue
in  theory  to	be alive, yet we must also  give  effect  to
clause (1-A), which is equally a part of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_186">Article 359</a> now and
must  be  deemed  to be such a part at all  points  of	time
commencing  from 26-1-1950.  The conclusion  is,  therefore,
inescapable  that during the period the	 Presidential  Order
under  <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_187">Article	359(1)</a>	suspending  enforcement	 of  certain
rights	conferred by Part III is in operation, the State  is
empowered  to make any law or to take any  executive  action
inconsistent  with such rights.	 All this is so because	 the
emergency  proclaimed to meet the threat to the security  of
India  has to be effectively implemented.  The	requirements
of  emergency constitute both the foundation as well  as  an
implied limitation upon the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21"> 81</span>
power.	What is warranted is what is necessary for effective
implementation of emergency.
</p><p id="p_75">33. It may be appropriate at this juncture to refer to a few
decisions of this Court relevant in this behalf. <a href="/doc/610740/" id="a_188">In Jaichand
Lall  Sethia v. State of W.B</a>.8 it is held by a	Constitution
Bench:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_25">	      "But the appellant can challenge the  validity
	      of the order on a	   ground  other than  those
	      covered  by <a href="/doc/147929/" id="a_189">Article 358</a>, or  the	Presidential
	      Order  issued  under <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_190">Article  359(1).</a>  Such  a
	      challenge is outside the purview of      the
	      Presidential  Order. For instance,  a  citizen
	      will  not be deprived of the right to move  an
	      appropriate court for a writ of habeas  corpus
	      on  the  ground that his	detention  has	been
	      ordered mala fide. Similarly, it will be	open
	      to  the  citizen	to challenge  the  order  of
	      detention	 on  the  ground  that	any  of	 the
	      grounds  given  in the order of  detention  is
	      irrelevant and there is no real and  proximate
	      connection  between the ground given  and	 the
	      object  which the legislature has in view.  It
	      may be stated in this context that a mala fide
	      exercise	of power does not necessarily  imply
	      any  moral  turpitude as a matter of  law.  It
	      only   means  that  the  statutory  power	  is
	      exercised	 for purposes foreign to  those	 for
	      which  it is in law intended. In other  words,
	      the  power conferred by the statute  has	been
	      utilised	 for  some  indirect   purpose	 not
			    connected with the object of the statute or th
e
	      mischief it seeks to remedy."
</blockquote><p id="p_76">34.  To	  the  same  effect  is	 the  decision	of   another
Constitution Bench in <a href="/doc/1740805/" id="a_191">K. Anandan Nambiar v. Chief Secretary,
Govt.	of  Madras9</a>.   The  majority  opinion	in   A.D.M.,
Jabalpur1,  however, appears to take a view contrary to	 the
one expressed in Jaichand Lall8 and Anandan Nambiar9 but for
the  purposes of this case, it is not necessary to  go	into
the correctness of the reasoning in A.D.M., Jabalpur1, since
it  has not been debated before us.  Indeed,  a	 three-Judge
Bench  in  <a href="/doc/909486/" id="a_192">Union of India v. Bhanudas  Krishna	Gawde10</a>	 has
taken  the  extreme  view,  purporting	to  follow   A.D.M.,
Jabalpur1, that even the restrictions placed and  facilities
denied cannot be questioned in a court during the period the
order under <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_193">Article 359(1)</a> is in operation!
</p><p id="p_77">35. The next issue that arises is whether it can be said  in
the caseof  detention orders passed during  the	 emergency
(i.e. orders of detentionto   which  <a href="/doc/66673733/" id="a_194">Section  12-A</a>   of
COFEPOSA applies) that they are void or non est,so    that
they  cannot  be treated as orders of detention	 within	 the
meaningof Section 2(2)(b) of SAFEMA?  It is submitted  by
the  learned  Additional  Solicitor General  that  the	said
orders cannot be said to be void ab initio or non est.	 The
orders were good and valid when they were made under <a href="/doc/146959060/" id="a_195">Section
3</a>  of COFEPOSA.	 May be, he says, the said orders ceased  to
be  operative with the cessation of the	 Presidential  Order

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">82</span>
and  effective	when they were made and continued to  be  so
until  the cessation of the Presidential Order.	  They	can,
therefore, certainly be treated as orders of detention under
COFEPOSA  for  the  purpose of and  within  the	 meaning  of
Section 2(2)(b) of SAFEMA.
</p><p id="p_78">36.  On	 the  other  hand,  the	 learned  counsel  for	 the
petitioners  contend that the order of detention made  under
<a href="/doc/1063385/" id="a_196">Section	 3</a>  read with <a href="/doc/66673733/" id="a_197">Section 12-A</a> of COFEPOSA is  void	 for
being  inconsistent with the provisions in <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_198">Article 22</a>  which
were  not suspended.  The mere suspension of enforcement  of
the said article does not amount to suspension of the right.
The  orders  of	 detention were, therefore,  void  and	they
remained  in operation only because the detenus were  barred
from questioning the validity of the said orders on  account
of  the ban imposed by the Presidential Order under  <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_199">Article
359(1).</a>	  They submit that the detention orders governed  by
<a href="/doc/66673733/" id="a_200">Section	 12-A</a>  of  COFEPOSA  are  inherently  arbitrary	 and
unjust.	  An order of preventive detention is  made  without
even telling the detenu of the grounds of his detention	 and
without giving him an opportunity to make a  representation.
Even  the  protection  of consideration of his	case  by  an
independent body (Advisory Board) is taken away.  The detenu
is  rendered totally helpless.	He is left with	 no  remedy.
He  cannot prove his innocence.	 Such an order of  detention
is  opposed to all concepts of fairness,  civilised  conduct
and  democratic norms.	They submit that such orders  cannot
form  the  foundation or the basis for	applying  SAFEMA  to
them.	Their argument is evocative of what Justice  Cardozo
once said:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_26">	      "We must always take care to safeguard the law
	      against  the  assaults  of  opportunism,	 the
	      expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of
	      the  small  encroachments, and the  scorn	 and
	      derision	of those who have no  patience	with
	      general principles."
</blockquote><p id="p_79">37.  The  contending viewpoints aforesaid give rise  to	 two
strands	 of  thought.	One line of thought  runs  thus:  By
virtue	of  clause  (1-A) of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_201">Article 359</a>,  inserted  by	 the
Constitution 38th <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_202">(Amendment) Act</a> with retrospective effect,
<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_203">Section	 12-A</a>  must  be	 deemed	 to  have  been	 competently
enacted,  no  doubt for the duration of and limited  to	 the
period	of  the Presidential Order.  If	 so,  the  detention
thereunder cannot be said to be invalid.  While the order of
detention  cannot certainly subsist beyond the cessation  of
the  Presidential Order because <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_204">Section 12-A</a>  cannot  itself
subsist beyond each cessation, neither <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_205">Section 12-A</a> nor	 the
order  of detention governed by it can be  characterised  as
illegal or invalid during the period the Presidential  Order
was in force.  Once this is so, such order of detention does
undoubtedly  represent	an  order of  detention	 within	 the
meaning	 and  contemplation of Section	2(2)(b)	 of  SAFEMA.
That  it was not open to challenge during the period of	 the
Presidential  Order,  or  that it was  not  subject  to	 the
constitutional	safeguards provided by <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_206">Article 22</a>  does	 not
affect	its validity or legality.  It was a valid  order  of
detention when made.  It is not being enforced or acted upon
beyond	the  period of Presidential Order.  Since it  is  an
existing fact, it is merely being taken notice of  and	that
is  enough to attract SAFEMA to such detenu,  his  relatives
and associates.	 <a href="/doc/1360825/" id="a_207">Section 2(1)</a> of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23"> 83</span>
SAFEMA says, "the provisions of this Act shall apply only to
the  persons specified in sub-section (2)"  and	 sub-section
(2)  speaks  inter alia of a person "in respect of  whom  an
order  of  detention has been made under the  <a href="/doc/135830564/" id="a_208">COFEPOSA	Act</a>,
1974".	 Indeed, provisos (i), (ii) and (iii) to clause	 (b)
of sub-section (2) of Section 2 of SAFEMA expressly refer to
the order of detention made under <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_209">Section 12-A</a> and expressly
affirm	that  such  an order of detention  is  an  order  of
detention  for	the purposes of the said clause.   The	fact
remains that provisions of SAFEMA were enacted in the  first
instance  as an Ordinance issued on 5-11-1975, i.e.,  during
the  period of emergency and later enacted into an  Act	 and
given  effect from the date of the Ordinance.  An  order  of
detention  governed  by	 <a href="/doc/66673733/" id="a_210">Section  12-A</a>	of  COFEPOSA   must,
therefore,  be	held  to be an order of	 detention  for	 the
purpose	 of  and within the meaning of	Section	 2(2)(b)  of
SAFEMA.	  The  other  line  of	reasoning  goes	 along	 the
following  lines: An order of detention governed by  <a href="/doc/66673733/" id="a_211">Section
12-A</a> is a special type of order made for the limited purpose
of  dealing  effectively  with the  emergency.	 It  has  no
existence,  relevance or effect except for the said  limited
purpose.  Outside such purpose, it is non est.	It does	 not
exist.	If so, such an order of detention cannot furnish the
foundation,  the connecting link, or the basis for  applying
SAFEMA.	 A normal order of preventive detention is itself an
uncivilised  action.   An  order of  detention	governed  by
<a href="/doc/66673733/" id="a_212">Section	 12-A</a>  of  COFEPOSA  denying as	 it  does  even	 the
minimum	 safeguards  provided  by clauses  (4)	and  (5)  of
<a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_213">Article 22</a>  is an abhorrent action.  It may be tolerated  as
a  cruel  necessity  when the very life	 of  the  Nation  is
threatened  but it cannot certainly be recognised  or  taken
note  of for any other purpose	much less made the basis  of
applying   an  extremely  drastic  enactment  like   SAFEMA.
Treating  such order of detention as an order  of  detention
for the purpose of and within the meaning of Section 2(2)(b)
of SAFEMA amounts to enforcing or giving effect to the	said
order  of  detention  beyond  and  outside  the	 period	  of
emergency  and for purposes foreign to emergency.   This  is
totally impermissible.	<a href="/doc/66673733/" id="a_214">Section 12-A</a> does not sanction	this
though it sanctions a lot many things.
</p><p id="p_80">38.  While  we	are attracted by the logic as  well  as	 the
emotional  appeal  of the second line of thought   it  would
appeal	 to  any  lover	 of  liberty   we   find   ourselves
constrained  to	 reject it in the light of the	language  of
Section 2(2)(b) of SAFEMA coupled with the fact that  SAFEMA
is  armed with the protective umbrella of <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_215">Article 31-B</a>	read
with  Ninth  Schedule.	We proceed  to	elaborate.   Section
2(2)(b)	 of SAFEMA expressly includes an order of  detention
to  which  the provisions of <a href="/doc/66673733/" id="a_216">Section 12-A</a> apply	 within	 the

order of detention for the purpose of and within the meaning
of  clause  (b) of Section 2(2) of SAFEMA.  In view  of	 the
fact  that  SAFEMA as well as COFEPOSA are included  in	 the
Ninth Schedule by the 39th and 40th <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_231">(Amendment) Act</a>s to	 the
Constitution,	clause	(b)  of	 Section  2(2)	 of   SAFEMA
[including   proviso  (iii)  appended  to  it]	are   beyond
constitutional	 reproach.   One  has  to  take	  the	said
provisions as they stand  and they stand solidly against the
petitioners'  contentions.  On this single ground, we  hold,
as we must, that an order of detention made under  COFEPOSA,
to which the provisions in <a href="/doc/66673733/" id="a_232">Section 12-A</a> applied, is an order
of  detention within the meaning of and for the purposes  of
Section 2(2)(b) of SAFEMA and can, therefore, constitute the
basis for applying SAFEMA to such person.
</p><p id="p_86">40.  At this juncture, it would be appropriate to deal	with
two  decisions	of this Court brought to  our  notice.	 The
first  one  is	in <a href="/doc/834753/" id="a_233">Union of India  v.  Haji  Mastan  Mirza11</a>
rendered by a Bench of three Judges.  The respondent therein
was  first detained under Maintenance of  Internal  Security
Act  (MISA) under an order dated 17-9-1974.   On  19-12-1974
the  said order was revoked but simultaneously an  order  of
detention  was	made under <a href="/doc/69411723/" id="a_234">Section 3(1)</a>	 of  COFEPOSA.	 The
grounds of detention were served on him on 23-12-1974.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25"> 85</span>
On 25-6-1975, emergency was proclaimed under <a href="/doc/1758457/" id="a_235">Article  352(1)</a>
on the ground of internal disturbance, which continued to be
in  force up to 21-3-1977.  The respondent was	released  on
23-3-1977.   Notice under Section 6(1) of SAFEMA was  issued
to  him, his relatives and associates whereupon he  filed  a
writ  petition	in  the Bombay High  Court  challenging	 the
validity  of the order of detention dated 19-12-1974 on	 the
ground	inter  alia  that  he  was  not	 supplied  with	 the
documents clearly and unmistakably relied upon for  arriving
at the requisite satisfaction and which documents were	also
referred  to  in the grounds of detention served  upon	him.
The  Bombay  High Court allowed the writ  petition,  against
which	the   Union  of	 India	appealed  to   this   Court.
Varadarajan,  J.  speaking  for the Bench  referred  to	 the
provisions  of	Sections 2, 6 and 7 of SAFEMA  and  observed
thus: (SCC p. 432, para 10)
	      "Therefore,  a valid order of detention  under
	      COFEPOSA	 is   a	  condition   precedent	  to
	      proceedings being taken under Sections 6 and 7
	      of SAFEMA.  If the impugned order of detention
	      dated 19-12-1974 is set aside for any  reason,
	      the  proceedings taken under Sections 6 and  7
	      of SAFEMA cannot stand.  Therefore, we have to
	      consider	 whether  the  impugned	  order	  of
	      detention	 dated 19-12-1974 under COFEPOSA  is
	      void and has to be quashed."
</p><p id="p_87">41.  From the facts stated above, it is clear that the order
of  detention  was made long prior to  the  proclamation  of
emergency  on 25-6-1975.  He was served with the grounds  of
detention  but	not the documents relied upon  therein.	  It
does  not  appear from the judgment  whether  a	 declaration
under <a href="/doc/66673733/" id="a_236">Section 12-A</a> of COFEPOSA was made with respect to	 the
said respondent, though it can be so presumed from the	fact
that  his detention was continued up to 23-3-1977.   In	 the
above circumstances, this Court said that it was open to the
respondent-detenu  to question the validity of the order  of
detention  when	 proceedings  are taken	 against  him  under
Sections  6  and 7 of SAFEMA.  It is not possible  to  agree
with  the reasoning of the decision.  There are two ways  of
looking at the issue.  If it is a normal order of  detention
[not  governed	by <a href="/doc/66673733/" id="a_237">Section 12-A</a> nor protected  by  an  order
under  <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_238">Article 359(1)</a> suspending the enforcement of  <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_239">Article
22]</a>  and  if the detenu does not challenge it  when  he	 was
deprived  of his liberty, or challenges	 it  unsuccessfully,
there is no reason why he should be allowed to challenge  it
when  action under SAFEMA is taken against him	 for  action
under SAFEMA is not automatic upon the fact of detention but
only  the  starting point.  On the other hand, if it  is  an
order  of  detention  governed	by <a href="/doc/66673733/" id="a_240">Section  12-A</a>  [or  by  a
Presidential  Order under <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_241">Article 359(1)</a> suspending  <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_242">Article
22</a>],  it perhaps could still be challenged even	 during	 the
period	of  emergency  on grounds not  barred  by  the	said
provisions.   Secondly, even if such an order is allowed  to
be  challenged	when  action  under  SAFEMA  is	 taken,	 the
challenge  must	 be confined to grounds which were  open  or
available  during the period of emergency;  otherwise  there
would  be no meaning behind the concluding words in  <a href="/doc/1900124/" id="a_243">Article
358(1)</a>	and <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_244">Article 359(1 A).</a>  Hence, we say that  a  person
who  did not choose to challenge such an order of  detention
during the emergency when he was detained, or challenged  it
unsuccessfully, cannot
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">86</span>
be allowed to challenge it when it is sought to be made	 the
basis  for  applying SAFEMA to him.  In either	of  the	 two
situations  mentioned above, i.e., whether the challenge  is
made   during  the  period  of	detention  or	later	when
proceedings under SAFEMA are taken against him, the  grounds
of  challenge  and scope of judicial scrutiny would  be	 the
same.	Failure to challenge the detention directly when  he
was  detained, precludes him from challenging it  after	 the
cessation  of  detention,  where it is made  the  basis	 for
initiating action under SAFEMA.
</p><p id="p_88">42.  The  other	 case brought to our notice is in  <a href="/doc/966137/" id="a_245">Union  of
India v. Manoharlal Narang12</a>, a decision rendered by a Bench
comprising  Khalid and Oza, JJ.	 The facts of this case	 are
rather involved.  Respondent, Manohar Lal Narang and one Ram
Lal  Narang  were  brothers.  An order	of  detention  under
<a href="/doc/69411723/" id="a_246">Section 3(1)</a> of COFEPOSA was made against Ram Lat Narang  on
19-12-1974.   He challenged the same before the	 Delhi	High
Court  in Writ Petition No. 10 of 1975 which was allowed  on
30-4-1975 and the order of detention quashed.  The Union  of
India preferred an appeal against the said order of the High
Court to this Court along with an application for stay.	  On
1-5-1975,  this	 Court	declined stay  but  imposed  certain
conditions  on	the movement of Ram Lal Narang	(later,	 the
said  appeal was dismissed for non-prosecution).  After	 the
proclamation   of  emergency  on  the  ground  of   internal
disturbance  on	 25-6-1975, a fresh order of  detention	 was
made on 1-7-1975 against Ram Lal on the very same facts	 and
grounds on which he was detained earlier.  The said order of
detention was challenged in Delhi Court in Writ Petition No.
115 of 1975 filed by a relative of Ram Lal but was dismissed
on  25-11-1975.	  An appeal was preferred against  the	said
order  to this Court being Appeal No. 399 of 1977.  At	this
stage,	notice under Sections 6 and 7 of SAFEMA	 was  issued
against	 Ram Lal which he questioned in Delhi High Court  in
Writ  Petition	No.  720  of 1975.   While  the	  said	writ
petition was pending in Delhi High Court, Appeal No. 399  of
1975  pending  in  this Court came up for  hearing  and	 was
disposed of saying that it would be open to Ram Lal to raise
all  such  contentions	as  are available  to  him  in	Writ
Petition  No.  720 of 1975, notwithstanding  the  fact	that
those  grounds were raised in Writ Petition No. 115 of	1975
(from  which the said appeal No. 399 of 1975  arose).	Writ
Petition  No.  720 of 1975 was heard and  dismissed  by	 the
Delhi High Court against which Ram Lal filed SLP No. 9361 of
1982  wherein leave was granted and the appeal was  numbered
as  CA No. 2790 of 1985 which was said to be pending on	 the
date  of  the said judgment.  An order	of  detention  under
<a href="/doc/146959060/" id="a_247">Section	 3</a>  of	COFEPOSA was made  against  the	 respondent,
Manohar	 Lal Narang, as well on 31-1-1975.  He was  then  in
England.   He  was  brought  to	 India	and  detained.	  He
challenged  the	 same by way of WP No. 2752 of 1975  in	 the
Bombay	High  Court  which was	allowed	 and  the  detention
quashed	 on  8-7-1980.	An appeal preferred  to	 this  Court
against	 the said order was also dismissed.   Thereafter,  a
show-cause  notice was issued to Manohar Lal Narang  on	 the
ground that he is the brother
12 (1987) 2 SCC 241  1987 SCC (Cri) 311
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27"> 87</span>
relative) of Ram Lal Narang, who was detained under  <a href="/doc/69411723/" id="a_248">Section
3(1)</a> of COFEPOSA.  It may be remembered that a writ petition
questioning  Ram Lal's detention under the order dated	1-7-
1975 [evidently, an order of detention to which <a href="/doc/66673733/" id="a_249">Section 12-A</a>
of  COFEPOSA applied] was dismissed by the Delhi High  Court
(WP No. 115 of 1975) and even Writ Petition No. 720 of	1975
(in which he was allowed to raise all the available  grounds
against	 his detention) was also dismissed.  From the  facts
stated	above,	it is clear that the basis of  action  under
SAFEMA against Manohar Lal Narang was his brother Ram  Lal's
detention  during the period of emergency,  which  detention
was governed by <a href="/doc/66673733/" id="a_250">Section 12-A</a> of COFEPOSA.  According to	 our
opinion indicated hereinbefore, such an order can constitute
a  basis  for  taking action under SAFEMA.  So	far  as	 the
reasoning  of the said decision is concerned, it is  to	 the
effect	that the validity of such an order of detention	 can
be  questioned	by the detenu or his relative, as  and	when
such an order is sought to be made the foundation for taking
action against them under SAFEMA.  On that basis, the  Court
proceeded to examine the validity of the order of  detention
of  Ram	 Lal and found that the said order is bad  for	non-
application of mind to certain highly relevant and  material
circumstances.	 We must, however, say that the validity  of
an  order  of detention to which <a href="/doc/66673733/" id="a_251">Section  12-A</a>	of  COFEPOSA
applied, could yet be examined even during the emergency  on
the  touchstone	 of  the  law  as  it  obtained	 during	 the
operation  of  the Presidential Order under  <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_252">Article  359(1)</a>
say  on the ground that the provisions of <a href="/doc/66673733/" id="a_253">Section 12-A</a>	were
not  complied  with, or on other grounds, as  may  not	have
barred during the said period.	But a person who could	have
so  challenged the order of detention and yet chose  not  to
do,  cannot  be	 allowed  to do so when	 such  an  order  of
detention is made the basis for applying SAFEMA to him	this
is  for the reason that even if he is allowed  to  challenge
the  said  order  when he is served with  the  notice  under
Section	 6 of SAFEMA, the challenge has to be examined	with
reference  to  the position of law as was obtaining  at	 the
time the said order was made and the law in force during the
period	the said order of detention was in operation.	Same
would be the position in the case of a person who challenged
the order but failed in his challenge.	Even in the case  of
a  normal  order of detention under COFEPOSA,  the  position
would  be the same, A person who did not challenge,  (either
by  himself  or	 through  his  next  friend)  the  order  of
detention or challenged it but failed, cannot be allowed  to
challenge  the	order  of detention  when  action  is  taken
against him under SAFEMA.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">Question No. 4</span>
<p id="p_89">43.  The  definition of "illegally acquired  properties"  in
clause	(c) of Section 3(1) of SAFEMA is  undoubtedly  quite
wide.	It means and includes any property acquired by	such
person,	 whether  before or after the commencement  of	this
Act,  wholly  or partly out of or by means  of	any  income,
earnings or assets derived or obtained from or	attributable
to any activity prohibited by or under any law for the	time
being  in force relating to any matter in respect  of  which
Parliament has power to make laws" [vide
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">88</span>
sub-clause (i)].  Sub-clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) of clause
</p><p id="p_90">(c)  further widen and elaborate its ambit.  The  definition
thus  takes in not only the property acquired after the	 Act
but also the property acquired before the Act, whatever.  be
the  length of time.  Secondly, it takes in  property  which
may  have been acquired partly from out of illegal  activity
in  which case, of course, the provision in <a href="/doc/114461823/" id="a_254">Section 9</a>  would
be attracted.  Illegal activity is not confined to violation
of  the	 laws  mentioned in <a href="/doc/104819381/" id="a_255">Section 2</a>  but  all	 laws  which
Parliament has power to make.  To give an illustration, if a
smuggler has acquired some properties by evading tax laws or
by  committing theft, robbery, dacoity, misappropriation  or
any  other illegal activity prohibited by<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_256"> the  Indian  Penal
Code</a>  or  any other law in force (which Parliament  has	 the
power to make) all that would be liable to be forfeited.  It
is  submitted  by  the petitioners that this is	 a  case  of
excessive and disproportionate response by Parliament.	 The
argument  is that the Act is penal in nature  and  spreading
its  net as wide as is done by the definition of  "illegally
acquired properties" brings it in conflict with Articles 14,
19 and 21.  Alternatively, it is submitted that if the	said
definition  is unassailable on account of its  inclusion  in
the Ninth Schedule, the definition may be read down so as to
confine it only to the properties acquired by violating	 the
prohibitions contained in the Acts mentioned in Section 2(a)
of  SAFEMA.   We do not find it possible to give  effect  to
either	of  these submissions.	Both  the  enactments  being
placed	in  the	 Ninth Schedule,  they	enjoy  the  immunity
conferred  by <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_257">Article 31-B.</a>  We have  observed	hereinbefore
that  the  petitioners have not been  able  to	substantiate
their  submission  that the 39th <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_258">(Amendment)  Act</a>  and	40th
<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_259">(Amendment)  Act</a>, placing the said enactments in  the  Ninth
Schedule  are  unconstitutional.   It is  not  necessary  to
repeat the reasons for the said opinion here over again.  In
this view of the matter, the attack upon the validity of the
said	definition   on	  grounds    of	   unreasonableness,
arbitrariness  or  for	that matter on any  of	the  grounds
relatable  to Part III is of no avail.	Even apart from	 the
protection  of	<a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_260">Article	 31-B</a>, we see no  substance  in	 the
submission    that   the   definition	is   arbitrary	  or
discriminatory nor do we see any reason for reading down the
said  definition to confine it to the violation of the	acts
referred to in Section 2(2)(a) of SAFEMA.  We can take	note
of  the fact that persons engaged in smuggling	and  foreign
exchange  manipulations	 do  not  keep	regular	 and  proper
accounts  with respect to such activity or its income or  of
the  assets acquired therefrom.	 If such person indulges  in
other illegal activity, the position would be no  different.
The violation of foreign exchange laws and laws relating  to
export	and  import necessarily involves  violation  of	 tax
laws.	Indeed, it is a well-known fact that over  the	last
few  decades,  smuggling, foreign exchange  violations,	 tax
evasion, drugs and crime have all got mixed-up.	 Evasion  of
taxes  is integral to such activity.  It would be  difficult
for any authority to say, in the absence of any accounts  or
other  relevant material that among the properties  acquired
by  a smuggler, which of them or which portions of them	 are
attributable  to smuggling and foreign	exchange  violations
and   which  properties	 or  which  portions   thereof	 are
attributable  to violation of other laws  (which  Parliament
has the power to make).	 It is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30"> 89</span>
probably for this reason that the burden of proving that the
properties  specified  in  the	show-cause  notice  are	 not
illegally  acquired  properties is placed  upon	 the  person
concerned.  May be this is a case where a dangerous  disease
requires  a radical treatment.	Bitter medicine is  not	 bad
medicine.   In	law  it	 is not possible  to  say  that	 the
definition  is arbitrary or is couched in unreasonably	wide
terms.	 Further, in view of clear and unambiguous  language
employed  in clause (c) of <a href="/doc/146959060/" id="a_261">Section 3</a>, it is not possible  or
permissible  to resort to the device of reading	 down.	 The
said  device  is usually resorted to save a  provision	from
being declared unconstitutional, competent and ultra  vires.
We   are,  therefore,  of  the	opinion	 that  neither	 the
constitutional	validity  of  the  said	 definition  can  be
questioned  nor	 is there my warrant for  reading  down	 the
clear  and  unambiguous	 words in the  clause.	 So  far  as
justification  of  such a provision is concerned,  there  is
enough	and more.  After all, all these	 illegally  acquired
properties  are	 earned	 and acquired in  ways	illegal	 and
corrupt	 at the cost of the people and the State.  The State
is deprived of its legitimate revenue to that extent.  These
properties  must  justly go back where they belong   to	 the
State.	 What  we are saying is nothing	 new  or  heretical.
Witness	 the  facts and ratio of a recent  decision  of	 the
Privy Council in Attomey General for Hong Kong v. Reid13 The
respondent,  Reid, was a Crown-prosecutor in Hong Kong.	  He
took  bribes as an inducement to suppress  certain  criminal
prosecutions  and with those monies, acquired properties  in
New  Zealand, two of which were held in the name of  himself
and his wife and the third in the name of his solicitor.  He
was  found  guilty  of	the  offence  of  bribe-taking	 and
sentenced  by a criminal court.	 The Administration of	Hong
Kong  claimed that the said properties in New  Zealand	were
held by the owners thereof as constructive trustees for	 the
Crown and must be made over to the Crown.  The Privy Council
upheld	this  claim  overruling the  New  Zealand  Court  of
Appeals.   Lord	 Templeman, delivering the  opinion  of	 the
Judicial  Committee,  based  his conclusion  on	 the  simple
ground	that any benefit obtained by a fiduciary  through  a
breach of duty belongs in equity to the beneficiary.  It  is
held  that  a  gift  accepted by a  person  in	a  fiduciary
position as an incentive for his breach of duty	 constituted
a  bribe and, although in law it belonged to the  fiduciary,
in equity he not only became a debtor for the amount of	 the
bribe  to the person to whom the duty was owed but  he	also
held  the  bribe  and any  property  acquired  therewith  on
constructive trust for that person.  It is held further that
if  the	 value	of  the	 property  representing	 the   bribe
depreciated  the fiduciary had to pay to the injured  person
the difference between that value and the initial amount  of
the  bribe,  and  if the property  increased  in  value	 the
fiduciary was not entitled to retain the excess since equity
would  not allow him to make any profit from his  breach  of
duty.  Accordingly, it is held that to the extent that	they
represented bribes received by the first respondent, the New
Zealand properties were held in trust for the Crown, and the
Crown  had an equitable interest therein.  The	learned	 Law
Lord  observed	further that if the theory  of	constructive
trust is not applied and properties interdicted when
13 (1993) 3 WLR 1 143: (1994) 1 All ER 1
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">90</span>
available,  the	 properties "can be sold  and  the  proceeds
whisked	 away  to, some Shangri La which  hides	 bribes	 and
other corrupt moneys in numbered bank accounts"	 to which we
are tempted to add  one can understand the immorality of the
Bankers who maintained numbered accounts but it is difficult
to  understand	the amorality of the Governments  and  their
laws  which sanction such practices  in	 effect	 encouraging
them.	The ratio of this decision applies equally  where  a
person	acquires properties by violating the law and at	 the
expense	 of  and  to  the detriment of	the  State  and	 its
revenues where an enactment provides for such a course, even
if  the fiduciary relationship referred to in Reid13 is	 not
present.  It may be seen that the concept employed in  Reid"
was  a	common	law concept, whereas here is a	case  of  an
express	 statutory provision providing for such	 forfeiture.
May we say in conclusion that "the interests of society	 are
paramount  to  individual  interests and  the  two  must  be
brought into just and harmonious relation.  A mere  property
career	is not the final destiny of mankind, if progress  is
to  be	the law of the future as it has been of	 the  past".
(Lewis Henry Morgan: Ancient Society).
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">Question No. 5</span>
<p id="p_91">44.  It is contended by the counsel for the petitioners that
extending  the	provisions  of	SAFEMA	to  the	  relatives,
associates   and  other	 'holders'  is	again  a   case	  of
overreaching or of over-breadth, as it may be called  a case
of excessive regulation.  It is submitted that the relatives
or associates of a person falling under clause (a) or clause
</p><p id="p_92">(b)  of Section 2(2) of SAFEMA may have acquired  properties
of their own, may be by illegal means but there is no reason
why those properties be forfeited under SAFEMA just  because
they  are  related  to or are associates of  the  detenu  or
convict,  as  the case may be. It is pointed  out  that	 the
definition   of	 'relative'  in	 Explanation  (2)   and	  of
,associates' in Explanation (3) are so wide as to bring in a
person	even  distantly	 related  or  associated  with	 the
convict/detenu, within the net of SAFEMA, and once he  comes
within the net, all his illegally acquired properties can be
forfeited   under  the	Act.   In  our	opinion,  the	said
contention  is	based  upon  a	misconception.	 SAFEMA	  is
directed   towards   forfeiture	  of   "illegally   acquired
properties"  of a person falling under clause (a) or  clause
</p><p id="p_93">(b)  of	 <a href="/doc/104819381/" id="a_262">Section  2(2)</a>.	 The relatives	and  associates	 are
brought	 in  only  for	the purpose  of	 ensuring  that	 the
illegally  acquired  properties of the	convict	 or  detenu,
acquired  or kept in their names, do not escape the  net  of
the Act.  It is a well-known fact that persons indulging  in
illegal activities screen the properties acquired from	such
illegal	 activity  in  the  names  of  their  relatives	 and
associates.   Sometimes	 they transfer	such  properties  to
them,  may be, with an intent to transfer the ownership	 and
title.	 In  fact,  it is immaterial how  such	relative  or
associate holds the properties of convict/detenu  whether as
a  benami  or  as  a mere name-lender  or  as  a  bona	fide
transferee  for	 value or in any other	manner.	  He  cannot
claim those properties and must surrender them to the  State
under  the  Act.  Since he is a relative  or  associate,  as
defined	 by the Act, he cannot put forward any defence	once
it  is proved that that property was acquired by the  detenu
whether in his own name or in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33"> 91</span>
name  of his relatives and associates.	It is to  counteract
the  several devices that are or may be adopted	 by  persons
mentioned in clauses (a) and (b) of <a href="/doc/104819381/" id="a_263">Section 2(2)</a> that  their
relatives and associates mentioned in clauses (c) and (d) of
the said sub-section are also brought within the purview  of
the  Act.   The	 fact of their	holding	 or  possessing	 the
properties of convict/detenu furnishes the link between	 the
convict/detenu	and his relatives and associates.  Only	 the
properties of the convict/detenu are sought to be forfeited,
wherever  they are.  The idea is to reach his properties  in
whosoever's  name  they are kept or by	whosoever  they	 are
held.  The independent properties of relatives and  friends,
which  are  not	 traceable to the  convict/detenu,  are	 not
sought	to be forfeited nor are they within the	 purview  of
SAFEMA**.   We may proceed to explain what we  say.   Clause
</p><p id="p_94">(c)  speaks of a relative of a person referred to in  clause
</p><p id="p_95">(a)  or clause (b) (which speak of a convict or	 a  detenu).
Similarly,  clause (d) speaks of associates of such  convict
or  detenu.  If we look to Explanation (3)  which  specifies
who  the  associates  referred to in clause  (d)  are,,	 the
matter	 becomes  clearer.   'Associates'  means   (i)	 any
individual  who had been or is residing in  the	 residential
premises (including outhouses) of such person [ such person'
refers	to  the	 convict  or detenu, as	 the  case  may	 be,
referred  to  in  clause  (a)  or  clause  (b)];  (ii)	 any
individual  who	 had  been or is  managing  the	 affairs  or
keeping	 the  accounts	of such	 convict/detenu;  (iii)	 any
association  of	 persons, body of  individuals,	 partnership
firm  or  private company of which such	 convict/detenu	 had
been  or  is  a	 member,  partner  or  director;  (iv)	 any
individual who had been or is a member, partner or  director
of   an	 association  of  persons,  body   of	individuals,
partnership  firm or private company referred to  in  clause
</p><p id="p_96">(iii) at any time when such person had been or is a  member,
partner or director of such association of persons, body  of
individuals,  partnership firm or private company;. (v)	 any
person	who had been or is managing the affairs	 or  keeping
the  accounts  of  any	association  of	 persons,  body	  of
individuals, partnership firm or private company referred to
in clause (iii); (vi) the trustee of any trust where (a) the
trust  has been created by such convict/detenu; or  (b)	 the
value  of the assets contributed by such  convict/detenu  to
the trust amounts, on the date of contribution not less than
20%  of the value of the assets of the trust on	 that  date;
and  (vii) where the competent authority, for reasons to  be
recorded  in writing, considers that any properties of	such
convict/detenu	are held on his behalf by any other  person,
such  other  person.   It  would  thus	be  clear  that	 the
connecting  link or the nexus, as it may be called,  is	 the
holding	 of  property  or assets of  the  convict/detenu  or
traceable  to  such detenu/convict.  <a href="/doc/132698022/" id="a_264">Section  4</a>	 is  equally
relevant  in  this context.  It declares that "as  from	 the
commencement  of  this Act, it shall not be lawful  for	 any
person to whom this Act applies to hold
That  this was the object of the Act is evident from para  4
of the preamble which states: "And whereas such persons have
in  many cases been holding the properties acquired by	them
through	 such  gains  in  the  names  of  their	  relatives,
associates  and	 confidants."  We are not  saying  that	 the
preamble  can be utilised for restricting the scope  of	 the
Act, we are only referring to it to ascertain the object  of
the   enactment	  and  to  reassure   ourselves	  that	 the
construction placed by us accords with the said object.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">92</span>
<p id="p_97">any illegally acquired property either by himself or through
any  other  person  on his behalf".  All  such	property  is
liable	to  be forfeited.  The language of this	 section  is
indicative of the ambit of the Act.  Clauses (c) and (d)  in
<a href="/doc/104819381/" id="a_265">Section	 2(2)</a>  and the Explanations (2)	 and  (3)  occurring
therein	 shall	have to be construed and understood  in	 the
light  of the overall scheme and purpose of  the  enactment.
The idea is to forfeit the illegally acquired properties  of
the  convict/detenu  irrespective  of  the  fact  that	such
properties are held by or kept in the name of or screened in
the name of any relative or associate as defined in the said
two   Explanations.   The  idea	 is  not  to   forfeit	 the
independent properties of such relatives or associates which
they  may  have	 acquired illegally but only  to  reach	 the
properties of the convict/detenu or properties traceable  to
him,  wherever they are, ignoring all the transactions	with
respect to those properties.  By way of illustration, take a
case where a convict/detenu purchases a property in the name
of his relative or associate  it does not matter whether  he
intends such a person to be a mere name lender or whether he
really	intends	 that such person shall be  the	 real  owner
and/or	possessor  thereof   or	 gifts	away  or   otherwise
transfers  his properties in favour of any of his  relatives
or  associates,	 or  purports to sell them  to	any  of	 his
relatives  or  associates  in all such cases, all  the	said
transactions  will be ignored and the  properties  forfeited
unless the convict/detenu or his relative/associate, as	 the
case  may be, establishes that such property  or  properties
are  not "illegally acquired properties" within the  meaning
of  <a href="/doc/146959060/" id="a_266">Section 3(c)</a>.  In this view of the matter, there  is  no
basis  for the apprehension that the independently  acquired
properties  of	such relatives and associates will  also  be
forfeited  even	 if they are in no way	connected  with	 the
convict/detenu.	 So far as the holders (not being  relatives
and associates) mentioned in <a href="/doc/104819381/" id="a_267">Section 2(2)(e)</a> are  concerned,
they  are dealt with on a separate footing.  If such  person
proves	 that  he  is  a  transferee  in  good	 faith	 for
consideration,	his property  even though purchased  from  a
convict/detenu	 is  not  liable to  be	 forfeited.   It  is
equally	  necessary   to  reiterate  that  the	 burden	  of
establishing that the properties mentioned in the show-cause
notice	issued under <a href="/doc/45460116/" id="a_268">Section 6</a>, and which are held  on	that
date  by a relative or an associate of	the  convict/detenu,
are   not   the	 illegally  acquired   properties   of	 the
convict/detenu, lies upon such relative/associate.  He	must
establish that the said property has not been acquired	with
the monies or assets provided by the detenu/convict or	that
they   in   fact  did  not  or	do  not	  belong   to	such
detenu/convict.	  We  do  not  think  that  Parliament	ever
intended to say that the properties of all the relatives and
associates,  may  be illegally acquired, will  be  forfeited
just  because they happen to be the relatives or  associates
of  the	 convict/detenu.  There ought to be  the  connecting
link  between those properties and the	convict/detenu,	 the
burden of disproving which, as mentioned above, is upon	 the
relative/associate.   In  this	view  of  the  matter,	 the
apprehension  and  contention  of the  petitioners  in	this
behalf	must  be held to be based upon a  mistaken  premise.
The  bringing in of the relatives and associates or  of	 the
persons mentioned in clause (e) of <a href="/doc/104819381/" id="a_269">Section 2(2)</a> is thus
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35"> 93</span>
neither	 discriminatory	 nor  incompetent  apart  from	 the
protection of <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_270">Article 31-B.</a>
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">     Question No. 6</span>
<p id="p_98">45.  Petitioners  challenged the validity of <a href="/doc/73512617/" id="a_271">Section 5-A</a>  of
COFEPOSA  on  the ground of it being violative of  the	twin
safeguards  provided  by clause (5) of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_272">Article	22.</a>   It  is
submitted  that	 the  said clause gives two  rights  to	 the
detenu, viz., (i) to have the grounds on which the order  of
detention  is based communicated to him as soon as  possible
and  (ii) to be afforded the earliest opportunity of  making
representation against the order of detention  (see <a href="/doc/1382411/" id="a_273">State of
Bombay	v.  Atma  Ram Sridhar  Vaidya14</a>).   If	the  grounds
included   irrelevant	or  non-existent  grounds,   it	  is
submitted,  the first right is violated and if	the  grounds
included  vague	 grounds,  the	second	right  is  violated.
According   to	the  teamed  counsel,  <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_274">Article	 22(5</a>),	  as
interpretated  by  this Court over the last more  than	four
decades,  means	 this: An order of preventive  detention  is
based upon the subjective satisfaction of the authority	 and
where such satisfaction has been arrived at on grounds	some
of  which  are	relevant  and  definite	 grounds  and	some
irrelevant,  vague  and nonexistent, it is not	possible  or
permissible  for the court to predicate which  grounds	have
influenced  the formation of his satisfaction	which  means
that the order of detention must fall to the ground; if this
is  what  <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_275">Article 22(5)</a> means and says, it is  not  open  to
Parliament to make a law saying that where the grounds	upon
which the requisite satisfaction has been formed are  partly
good  and partly bad, yet the order must be held to be	good
with  reference	 to  and  on  the  basis  of  good  grounds,
eschewing  the	bad grounds.  Such a law, it  is  submitted,
would  be  in direct conflict with <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_276">Article  22(5).</a>   Let  us
examine this submission rather closely.
</p><p id="p_99">46.  <a href="/doc/73512617/" id="a_277">Section  5-A</a>  of COFEPOSA may be  reproduced  here	 for
ready reference.  It reads:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_29">	      "5-A.  Grounds of detention severable.-  Where
	      a person has been detained in pursuance of  an
	      order  of detention under sub-section  (1)  of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">	      373</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">	      94</span>
	      (1)   of	<a href="/doc/146959060/" id="a_279">Section	 3</a>  with  reference  to	 the
	      remaining ground or grounds and made the order

	      sub-section (1) after   being   satisfied	  as
	      provided in that sub-section with reference to
	      the   remaining ground or grounds."
</blockquote><p id="p_100">47.  The section is in two parts.  The first part says	that
where an order of detention is made on two or more  grounds,
"such  order of detention shall be deemed to have been	made
separately  on each of such grounds", while the second	part
says  that such order shall not be deemed to be	 invalid  or
inoperative  merely for the reason that one or some  of	 the
grounds	 are  either  vague,  non-existent,  irrelevant	  or
unconnected.  That the second part is merely a	continuation
of  and consequential to the first part is evident from	 the
connecting  words "and accordingly".  The second  part	goes
further and says that the order of detention must be  deemed
to have been made on being satisfied with the remaining good
ground	or grounds, as the case may be.	 Both the parts	 are
joined by the word "and".
</p><p id="p_101">48.  Now,  it is beyond dispute that an order  of  detention
can  be based upon one single ground.  Several decisions  of
this  Court have held that even one prejudicial act  can  be
treated as sufficient for forming the requisite satisfaction
for detaining the person.  <a href="/doc/353578/" id="a_280">In Debu Mahato v. State of W.B</a>.15
it  was observed that while ordinarily-speaking one act	 may
not be sufficient to form the requisite satisfaction,  there
is no such invariable rule and that in a given case one	 act
may  suffice.  That was a case of wagon-breaking and  having
regard to the nature of the Act, it was held that one act is
sufficient.   The same principle was reiterated in Anil	 Dey
v.  State  of  W. B. 16 It was a case of  theft	 of  railway
signal	 material.   Here  too	one  act  was  held  to	  be
sufficient.  Similarly, in <a href="/doc/733192/" id="a_281">Israil SK v. District  Magistrate
of West Dinajpur17</a> and <a href="/doc/96706/" id="a_282">Dharua Kanu v. State of W.B</a>.18 single
act of theft of telegraph copper wires in huge quantity	 and
removal	  of  railway  fish-plates  respectively  was	held
sufficient to sustain the order of detention.  <a href="/doc/310087/" id="a_283">In Saraswathi
Seshagiri  v.  State  of  Kerala19</a>,  a	case  arising  under
COFEPOSA,  a  single  act, viz., attempt to  export  a	huge
amount	of Indian currency was held sufficient.	  In  short,
the principle appears to be this: Though ordinarily one	 act
may not be held sufficient to sustain an order of detention,
one  act may sustain an order of detention if the act is  of
such a nature as to indicate that it is an organised act  or
a  manifestation  of organised activity.   The	gravity	 and
nature of the act is also relevant.  The test is whether the
act  is	 such that it gives rise to an	inference  that	 the
person would continue to indulge in similar prejudicial
     15 (1974) 4 SCC 1351974 SCC (Cri) 274
     16 (1974) 4 SCC 5141974 SCC (Cri) 550
     17 (1975) 3 SCC 292:1974 SCC (Cri) 900

     19 (1982)2SCC310:1982 SCC (Cri) 423
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39"> 95</span>
activity.   That  is the reason why single  acts  of  wagon-
breaking,  theft  of  signal material,	theft  of  telegraph
copper	wires in huge quantity and removal of railway  fish-
plates	were held sufficient.  Similarly, where	 the  person
tried to export huge amount of Indian currency to a  foreign
country	 in a planned and premeditated manner, it  was	held
that  such  single act warrants an inference  that  he	will
repeat his activity in future and, therefore, his  detention
is   necessary	to  prevent  him  from	indulging  in	such
prejudicial activity.  If one looks at the acts the COFEPOSA
is  designed  to  prevent,  they  are  all  either  acts  of
smuggling  or of foreign exchange manipulation.	 These	acts
are  indulged in by persons, who act in concert	 with  other
persons	 and  quite often such	activity  has  international
ramifications.	These acts are preceded by a good amount  of
planning  and Organisation.  They are not like ordinary	 law
and  order crimes.  If, however, in any given case a  single
act  is found to be not sufficient to sustain the  order  of
detention  that may well be quashed but it cannot be  stated
as  a  principle that one single act cannot  constitute	 the
basis  for detention.  On the contrary, it does.   In  other
words, it is not necessary that there should be multiplicity
of grounds for making or sustaining an order of detention.
</p><p id="p_102">49.  Now,  take a case, where three orders of detention	 are
made  against the same person under COFEPOSA.  Each  of	 the
orders	is based upon only one ground which is	supplied  to
the  detenu.   It is found that the ground of  detention  in
support of two of such orders is either vague or irrelevant.
But  the ground in support of the third order  is  relevant,
definite and proximate.	 In such a case, while the first two
orders would be quashed, the third order would stand.	This
is precisely what the first part (the main part) of  <a href="/doc/73512617/" id="a_284">Section
5-A</a>  seeks to do.  Where the order of detention is based  on
more  than one ground, the section creates a legal  fiction,
viz.,  it  must be deemed that there are as many  orders  of
detention as there are grounds which means that each of such
orders	is an independent order.  The result is the same  as
the  one in the illustration given by us  hereinabove.	 The
second	part of it is merely clarificatory and	explanatory,
which is evident from the fact that it begins with the	word
"accordingly"  apart from the fact that it is joined to	 the
first  part by the word "and".	In such a situation, we	 are
unable	to  see	 how can the  section  be  characterised  as
inconsistent  with <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_285">Article 22(5).</a>  Had there been  no  first
part, and had the section consisted only of the second part,
one can understand the contention that the section is in the
teeth  of <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_286">Article 22(5)</a> as interpreted by this	Court	this
was   indeed   the  situation  in  <a href="/doc/58616/" id="a_287">K.  Yadigiri	  Reddy	  v.
Commissioner of Police20</a> as we shall presently indicate.  It
is  difficult  to  conceive any	 inconsistency	or  conflict
between	 <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_288">Article  22(5)</a>	 and the first	the  main   part  of
<a href="/doc/73512617/" id="a_289">Section	 5-A</a>.	Parliament is competent to  create  a  legal
fiction and it did so in this case.  <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_290">Article 22(5)</a> does	 not
in terms or otherwise prohibit making of more than one order
simultaneously	 against  the  same  person,  on   different
grounds.  No decision saying so has been
20 ILR 1972 AP 1025
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">96</span>
brought to our notice.	Be that as it may, we do not see why
Parliament  is	not competent to say, by  creating  a  legal
fiction,  that where an order of detention is made  on	more
than  one ground, it must be deemed that there are  as	many
orders of detention as there are grounds.  If this  creation
of  a  legal fiction is competent, then no question  of	 any
inconsistency  between	the section and	 <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_291">Article  22(5)</a>	 can
arise.
</p><p id="p_103">50.  It	 is  true that validity of <a href="/doc/73512617/" id="a_292">Section 5-A</a> or  for	that
matter, of <a href="/doc/97675260/" id="a_293">Section 5-A</a> of National Security Act, 1980, which
is  in	identical  terms   does	 not  appear  to  have	been
questioned in this Court so far, though it has been  applied
in  several decisions.	Three of the reported decisions	 are
brought to our notice, viz., <a href="/doc/1348769/" id="a_294">State of Gujarat v. Chaman	 Lal
Manjibhai Soni21</a>, <a href="/doc/208589/" id="a_295">Prakash Chandra Mehta v. Commissioner	 and
Secretary</a>,  <a href="/doc/328748/" id="a_296">Govt. of Kerala22 and N. Meera Rani v. Govt.  of
T.N</a>.23	Actually, in the last-mentioned decision, there	 are
observations affirming its validity, though no final opinion
has  been  expressed  on the question  because	it  was	 not
canvassed in that case.	 It is also brought  to	 our  notice
that a Bench of Gujarat High Court has affirmed and  applied
the said provision in a case arising under COFEPOSA.
</p><p id="p_104">51.  Now, coming to the decision of the Andhra Pradesh	High
Court  in  K.  Yadigiri Reddy20 Section	 6(a)  of  the	A.P.
Detention Act, 1970 read as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_37">	      "No  detention  order  shall  be	invalid	  or

	      ground  or grounds does not or do	 not  suffer
	      from any such infirmity."
</blockquote><p id="p_105">52.  The Andhra Pradesh provision thus contained a provision
approximating to the second part of <a href="/doc/73512617/" id="a_297">Section 5-A</a> but did	 not
contain	 any provision corresponding to or approximating  to
the  first (the main) part of <a href="/doc/73512617/" id="a_298">Section 5-A</a>.  It is the  first
part  of <a href="/doc/73512617/" id="a_299">Section 5-A</a> that creates the deeming  fiction;	 the
second part merely elaborates the effect and consequence  of
the  legal fiction in the first part.  The second part,	 had
it  stood  alone, could perhaps have been  characterised  as
being  in  the	teeth of <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_300">Article 22(5</a>),	 as  understood	 and
construed by this Court	 and that is what the Andhra Pradesh
High  Court  says  but that is not the situation  herein  as
explained  hereinabove.	 The said decision, therefore,	does
not  advance  the  case of the	petitioners  in	 any  manner
herein.	 Having said this, we must reiterate the  admonition
of Gajendragadkar, J. regarding the exercise of the power of
detention  under  the  various	detention  laws	 in   force.

	      the democratic way of life in this country  is
	      founded."

on  the	 part  of  the	authorities  exercising	 powers	  of
detention.
</p><p id="p_107">An additional question
</p><p id="p_108">54.  Dr Ghatate, appearing for one of the petitioners raised
an  interesting	 submission  to	 the  following	 effect:  By
Constitution 44th <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_302">(Amendment) Act</a>, Parliament, acting in its
constituent  power,  has substituted clause (4) as  well  as
clause	(7)  of	 <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_303">Article  22</a>  leaving  it  to  the   Central
Government to specify the date from which the said amendment
shall come into force.	Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1677127/" id="a_304">Section 1</a> of	 the
(Amendment)  Act  empowers  the Central	 Government  to	 fix
different   dates  for	coming	into  force   of   different
provisions  of the said Act.  Though the Central  Government
has  specified the date of coming into force in	 respect  of
several	 other provisions of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_305">Amendment Act</a>, it  has	 not
chosen	to  specify the date from which	 the  Amendments  to
substitution  of   clauses (4) and (7) of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_306">Article  22</a>  shall
come  into force.  The 44th <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_307">(Amendment) Act</a> was	 enacted  as
far  back as April 1979 and even though more  than  fourteen
years have passed by, the Central Government has not thought
it fit to enforce the said Amendments.	This failure on	 the
part  of the Central Government has the effect of  virtually
nullifying  the	 said Amendments.  While enacting  the	said
Amendments,  Parliament could never have  contemplated	that
the  Central  Government  would sit on them  for  more	than
fourteen   years.   The	 Central  Government  must  act	  in
accordance  with the spirit of the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_308">Amendment Act</a>.   It	must
act  reasonably.   It cannot undo a  Constitution  Amendment
just by refusing to specify a date from which it shall	come
into  operation.   Even if the power given  to	the  Central
Government  is	characterised as a  conditional	 legislation
still  the fact remains that such power too must have to  be
exercised  reasonably and within reasonable time.   Can	 the
Central	 Government  wait for few more years and  would	 the
Court  be  powerless to command the  Central  Government  to
bring into force the said Amendment?  If no such command can
be given, would it not mean that Parliament was, in the year
1979, amending the Constitution, not for that generation but
for   the  next	 generation?   <a href="/doc/166567982/" id="a_309">Section	1(2)</a>  of  the	44th
<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_310">(Amendment)  Act</a> is indeed an instance of abdication  of  or
delegation  of essential constituent power  and,  therefore,
bad.  Such a thing has never
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">98</span>
happened  and  cannot  be allowed  to  happen;	the  Central
Government   ought  not	 to  be	 allowed  to  play  with   a
constitutional amendment  an amendment which, in particular,
tends to strengthen the safeguard contained in clause (4) of
<a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_311">Article 22</a>, says the counsel.
</p><p id="p_109">55.  We do not, however, think it necessary for the purposes
of  these  cases  to express any  opinion  on  Dr  Ghatate's
submission, for the reason that acceptance of his contention
assuming  we do	 makes no difference to the result of  these
petitions.   We	 have  already	held  that  the	 orders	  of
detention  made	 under	<a href="/doc/146959060/" id="a_312">Section 3</a> of  COFEPOSA,	 which	were
governed  by  <a href="/doc/66673733/" id="a_313">Section  12-A</a>  do	 yet  represent	 orders	  of
detention  for	the  purpose of and within  the	 meaning  of
<a href="/doc/104819381/" id="a_314">Section	 2(2)(b)</a> read with Section 2(1) of SAFEMA.  Even  if
we  assume  that  the  amendments to  clauses  (4)  and	 (7)
effected by the 44th <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_315">(Amendment) Act</a> have come into force on
the day the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_316">Amendment Act</a> received assent of the  President,
the  result  would  be no different.  In this  view  of	 the
matter,	 it is also not necessary to express any opinion  on
the respondent's submission based upon A.K. Roy v. Union  of
India25, Viz., whether the opinion in the said decision	 can
be validly applied even after a lapse of fourteen years.
</p><p id="p_110">56.  To summarise:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_38">	      (1)   Parliament	was perfectly  competent  to
	      enact both the COFEPOSA and the SAFEMA.
	      (2)   For	 the  reasons given in the  body  of
	      this judgment, we do not express	  any
	      opinion  on the validity of the 39th and	40th
	      <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_317">Amendment Act</a>s to	   the Constitution of India
	      placing  COFEPOSA	 and  SAFEMA  in  the  Ninth
	      Schedule.	  We  assume  them to  be  good	 and
	      valid.  No arguments have also been  addressed
	      with respect to the validity of 42nd <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_318">Amendment
	      Act</a> to the Constitution either.
	      (3)   (a)	 An  order of detention	 made  under
	      <a href="/doc/146959060/" id="a_319">Section  3</a> of COFEPOSA, which was governed  by
	      <a href="/doc/66673733/" id="a_320">Section  12-A</a>  thereof  is  yet  an  order  of
	      detention	 for the purpose of and	 within	 the
	      meaning  of Section 2(2)(b) of SAFEMA.   Since
	      the  President  had  issued  an  order   under
	      <a href="/doc/1760044/" id="a_321">Article 359(1)</a> suspending Articles 14, 21	 and
	      22,  it  became competent for  Parliament,  by
	      virtue of clause (]-A) of <a href="/doc/1594774/" id="a_322">Article 359</a> to enact
	      <a href="/doc/66673733/" id="a_323">Section  12-A</a> of COFEPOSA for the duration  of
	      and  limited  to	the  period  for  which	 the
	      Presidential Order was in force.	It was meant
	      to  achieve the purposes of  emergency.	Once
