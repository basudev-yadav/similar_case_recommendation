    the present Petition on 03 February 2014 and on 05 February 2014 the matter

    passed any ad-interim order. The contesting Respondent filed affidavit dated 11

    February 2014 and pointed out that Packet A &amp; B were opened on 05 February




                                                          
    2014 and on scrutiny it is observed that the Petitioner has quoted its bids for six

    numbers of groups and out of which they have fulfilled the pre-qualification




                                              
    criteria in five groups. This itself means that the Petitioner participated in the
                             
    proceedings since beginning to above extent and as recorded above fulfilled the

    pre-qualification criteria also. The submission, therefore, that the financial pre-

    estimated cost during last three years in each group and work experience of
      


    40% of quantity of pumps in each group during last five years is arbitrary,
   



    unreasonable and intended to deprive the persons like the Petitioner to

    participate in the process itself is unacceptable.

<p id="p_8">    4.       It is well-settled that the Respondent-Corporation is entitled to add or

    amend and/or put in suitable conditions for a particular contract, based on their





    experience. The eligibility criteria, therefore, so fixed by them thus cannot be

    tested at the instance of the Petitioner, at this stage of proceedings, specifically

    when such criteria so fixed cannot be stated to be contrary to any provisions of

    terms and added in the tender which intends to disentitle persons like the

    fides or arbitrariness. It is required to be supported by the material on record

    especially when the Respondents in the reply have denied even those averments
                           
    made in the Petition. These questions of fact, therefore, cannot be considered

    and/or accepted in the present Writ Petition, specifically when the facts on
      


    record, including the conditions so read and referred, cannot be stated to be
   



    arbitrary or discriminatory merely because the tender is of local authority. All

    the parties or persons who want to submit their tender based on the terms and





    conditions so announced are bound to accept the same. The concept of inviting

    tender itself is and includes that no person is forced and/or compelled to

    participate in the tender process if he does not accept the terms and conditions.
