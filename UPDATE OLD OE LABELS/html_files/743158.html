<p id="p_2">	Leave granted


	Appellants were workmen of the Respondent company.   They were 
transferred to Siwan (Bihar), Farrukhabad (U.P.) and Karimganj (Assam) by 
letters of transfer dated 3.10.1994.   According to them, the said orders of 
transfer were violative of the  Memorandum of Undertaking dated 
18.12.1989 and were issued with an ill-motive of victimizing them for their 
trade union activities.   As despite requests, the purported orders of transfer 
were not revoked, they sought intervention of the Labour Commissioner, 
West Bengal by a letter dated 1.3.1995.  Allegedly, a conciliation proceeding 
was initiated, but during the pendency thereof, their services were 
terminated by Respondent Company by letters dated 15.4.1995.   
Contending that the said orders of termination were unauthorized, arbitrary 
and illegal, as no domestic enquiry was held prior thereto, they raised an 
industrial dispute.   
</p>
<p id="p_3"> 	The State of West Bengal, in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 
10(1)(c)  read with <a href="/doc/1377486/" id="a_1">Section 2A</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 referred 
the following dispute for its adjudication to the Third Industrial Tribunal, 
West Bengal.
</p>
<p id="p_4">"Whether the termination of service of (1) Shri Bikash 
Bhusan Ghosh (2) Shri Pradip Kumar Mukherjee and (3) 
Shri Shyama Charan Mallick is justified?   What relief, if 
any, are they entitled to?"
</p>

	
<p id="p_5">	Before the said Tribunal, inter-alia a contention was raised that the 
State of West Bengal had no jurisdiction to make the reference. Parties to the 
reference, however, adduced their respective evidences on merit of the 
matter.
</p>
<p id="p_6">	The question in regard to maintainability of the said reference was 
determined by the Tribunal in terms of an order dated 30.3.1999 holding the 
same to be maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_7">	By reason of an Award dated 10.10.2002, the Tribunal opined that the 
orders of termination passed against the appellants were illegal and they 
were directed to be re-instated in service with back wages.    Aggrieved by 
and dissatisfied with the said order, Respondent filed a Writ Petition before 
the Calcutta High Court which was marked as W.P. No. 2495 of 2002.    By 
a Judgment and Order dated 11.7.2003, the said Writ Petition was dismissed.   
On an intra-court appeal filed by the Respondents under clause 15 of the 
Letters Patent of the Calcutta High Court, marked as G.A. No. 3157;   a 
Division Bench of the High Court, however, without going into the merit of 
the matter held that the State of West Bengal, being not the appropriate 
Government in respect of the dispute raised by the appellants, had no 
jurisdiction to make the reference and on that premise allowed the said 
appeal and consequently set aside the Award made by the Tribunal as also 
the judgment and order of the learned Single Judge.
</p>

<p id="p_8">	Mr. Pradip Ghosh, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the 
appellant, in support of this appeal,  inter-alia would submit that the Division 
Bench of the High Court committed a manifest error in passing the 
impugned judgment in so far as it proceeded on the basis that no document 
was brought on records to show that the appellants had raised a dispute in 
regard to the orders of transfer passed against them which in fact had been 
done and the same was pending before the conciliation officer.    Our 
attention in this connection has been drawn to a letter dated 23.3.1995 issued 
by Joint Labour Commissioner, West Bengal to the Personnel Manager of 
M/s. Sandoz (I) Ltd., pre-decessor of the respondent Company which is in 
the following terms;
</p>

<p id="p_9">"With reference to the above subject, you are requested to 
kindly make it convenient to see the undersigned in this 
office on 12.04.1995 at 3.00 p.m. for a discussion with the 
concerned representatives."
</p>

<p id="p_10">	The learned counsel would contend that in the said conciliation 
proceeding, the respondents did not participate,  which was initiated on the 
basis of a letter dated 1.3.1995 addressed to the Labour Commissioner, 
Government of West Bengal by the appellants.  It was furthermore 
submitted that the Division Bench of the High Court, in arriving at the 
aforementioned decision, failed to consider the decision of this Court in 
<a href="/doc/295771/" id="a_2">Workmen of Shri Rangavillas Motors (P) Ltd. &amp; Anr. v. Shri Rangavilas 
Motors (P) Ltd. and Ors</a>. ([1967] 2 S.C.R 528) in its proper perspective.
</p>
<p id="p_11">	Mr.  Chander Uday Singh, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf 
of the respondent, on the other hand, would contend that no conciliation 
proceeding was pending in regard to the order of transfer as alleged or at all.   
It was submitted that in fact, the appellants categorically stated before the 
Industrial Tribunal that they would not question the orders of transfer, but 
only would question the orders of termination.    Having regard to the fact 
that the orders of transfer dated 3.10.1994 were given effect to by relieving 
the workmen of the charges they had been holding at Calcutta, they would 
be deemed to have been attached to their transferred places and as they 
failed to join, their services were lawfully terminated.
</p>
<p id="p_12">	As the Division Bench of the High Court did not enter into the merit 
of the matter, we do not intend to deal with the questions as to whether any 
conciliation proceedings was, in relation to the orders of transfer passed as 
against the appellants, in fact pending before the Deputy Labour 
Commissioner, West Bengal or not.  Appellants, however, in our opinion 
could not have questioned the orders of transfer in view of the nature of the 
industrial dispute referred to by the State of West Bengal for determination 
thereof by the III Industrial Tribunal, West Bengal.  The orders of transfer 
were, thus, not in issue before the learned Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_13">	It is, however, not disputed that the orders of termination were served 
upon the appellant at Calcutta.  The orders of termination as against them, 
were passed for not obeying the orders of transfer.   The transfer of the 
appellants, therefore, had some nexus with the order of their termination 
from services.  It is, therefore, not correct to contend that the State of West 
Bengal was not the appropriate government.  
</p>
<p id="p_14">	In Shri Rangavillas Motors (P) Ltd. (supra), the concerned workman 
was engaged as a foreman. He was transferred from Bangalore to 
Krishnagiri.  He questioned the validity of the said order of transfer.  The 
company initiated disciplinary proceeding against him and he was removed 
from services.  State of Mysore made a reference.  The validity of the said 
reference was questioned.  This Court opined;
</p>
<p id="p_15">"....This takes us to the other points.  Mr. O.P. 
Malhotra strongly urges that the State Government of 
Mysore was not the appropriate Government to make 
the reference.  He says that although the dispute 
started at Bangalore, the resolution sponsoring this 
dispute was passed in Krishnagiri, and, that the proper 
test to be applied in the case of individual disputes is 
where the dispute has been sponsored.   It seems to us 
that on the facts of this case it is clear that there was a 
separate establishment at Bangalore and Mahalingam 
was working there.  There were a number of other 
workmen working in this place.  The order of transfer, 
it is true, was made in Krishnagiri at the head office, 
but the order was to operate on a workman working in 
Bangalore.   In our view the High Court was right in 
holding that the proper question to raise is : where did 
the dispute arise ?   Ordinarily, if there is a separate 
establishment and the workman is working in that 
establishment, the dispute  would arise at that place.   
As the High Court observed, there should clearly be 
some nexus between the dispute and the territory of 
the State and not necessarily between the territory of 
the State and the industry concerning which the 
dispute arose......"
</p>

<p id="p_16">	Referring to a decision of this Court in  <a href="/doc/1800089/" id="a_3">Indian Cable Co. Ltd. v. Its 
Workmen</a> [1962 Supp. 3 SCR 589], it was held that the subject matter of the 
dispute, substantially arose within the jurisdiction of the Mysore 
Government.
</p>
<p id="p_17">	We may notice that in <a href="/doc/1399404/" id="a_4">Paritosh Kumar Pal  v. State of Bihar and 
others</a> [1984 LAB. I.C. 1254], a full Bench of the Patna High Court held;
</p>
<p id="p_18">"13.   Now an incisive analysis of the aforesaid authoritative 
enunciation of law would indicate that three clearcut principles or 
tests for determining jurisdiction emerge, therefrom.   For clarity 
these may be first separately enumerated as under:
</p>
<p id="p_19">(i)	Where does the order of the termination of services 
operate?
</p>
<p id="p_20">(ii)	Is there some nexus between the industrial dispute arising 
from termination of the services of the workman and the 
territory of the State?
</p>
<p id="p_21">(iii)	That the well-known test of jurisdiction of a civil Court 
including the residence of the parties and the subject 
matter of the dispute substantially arising therein would be 
applicable."
</p>

<p id="p_22">	Referring to the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, it was held 
that the situs of the employment of the workman would be a relevant factor 
for determining the jurisdiction of the court concerned.   
</p>
<p id="p_23"> 	The High Court, however, has relied upon a decision of the said Court 
in <a href="/doc/1827037/" id="a_5">Indian Express Newspaper (Bombay) Pvt. Ltd. v. State of West Bengal</a> 
[2005-II-LLJ 333], wherein it was held;
</p>
<p id="p_24">"40.  The basis of the findings of the learned single 
Judge in the first writ application and that of the 
Tribunal thereafter on remand and the subsequent 
findings of the learned single Judge on the second 
writ application is that when Mr. Sampat's services 
were terminated he was stationed in the Calcutta 
office of the Newspaper company.  While Mr. 
Sampat was no doubt served with the order of 
termination of his service in Calcutta, we are 
constrained to say that the same would not vest the 
State Government in West Bengal with authority 
under <a href="/doc/1604812/" id="a_6">Section 2(a)(ii)</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act 
to make a reference under <a href="/doc/1669932/" id="a_7">Section 10</a> of the said 
Act.   Firstly, at the said point of time the Calcutta 
office of the Newspaper company no longer had 
control over Mr. Sampat whose services had been 
transferred to Bombay and it was the Bombay office 
which had control over his services.  That Mr. 
Sampat was in Calcutta and was served with the 
notice of the order of termination of his service in 
Calcutta is only because of the fact that he had 
chosen not to comply with the order transfer dated 
August 1, 1988, by which he had been transferred to 
Bombay with effect from August 5, 1988, and had 
not also challenged the same before any forum.   Mr. 
Sampat may have made representations to the 
Bombay office with regard to such order of transfer, 
but the same was never the subject-matter of any 
judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding and it is only 
after he was served with the order of termination of 
his service that Mr. Sampat raised a dispute in 
respect thereof.  In our view, notwithstanding the 
fact that Mr. Sampat had been served with such 
order in Calcutta, his situs of employment being 
Bombay, he ought to have raised an industrial 
dispute relating to the termination of his services in 
Bombay and the Government of Maharashtra would 
have been the appropriate Government to make a 
reference under <a href="/doc/1669932/" id="a_8">Section 10</a> of the aforesaid Act in 
respect of such dispute."
</p>

<p id="p_25">	With respect to the Division Bench, we do not think that it has posed 
unto itself a correct question of law.  It is not in dispute that the appellants 
did not join their duties at the transferred places.  According to them, as the 
orders of transfer were illegal, their services were terminated for not 
complying therewith.  The assertion of the respondent that the appellant 
were relieved from job was unilateral.  If the orders of transfer were to be set 
aside, they would be deemed to be continuing to be posted in Calcutta.  The 
legality of the orders of transfer, thus, had a direct nexus with the orders of 
termination.   What would constitute cause of action, has recently been 
considered by this Court in <a href="/doc/1382657/" id="a_9">Om Prakash Srivastava  v. Union of India and 
Another</a> [(2006) 6 SCC 207] wherein it was held;
</p>
<p id="p_26">"12. The expression "cause of action" has acquired a 
judicially settled meaning.  In the restricted sense 
"cause of action" means the circumstances forming the 
infraction of the right or the immediate occasion for the 
reaction.   In the wider sense, it means the necessary 
conditions for the maintenance of the suit, including not 
only the infraction of the right, but also the infraction 
coupled with he right itself.   Compendiously, as noted 
above, the expression means very fact, which it would 
be necessary for the plaintiff to prove, if traversed, in 
order to support his right to the judgment of the court.   
Every fact, which is necessary to be proved, as 
distinguished from every piece of evidence, which is 
necessary to prove each fact, comprises in "cause of 
action".   (See Rajasthan High Court <a href="/doc/753224/" id="a_10">Advocates' Assn. 
v. Union of India</a> [(2001) 2 SCC 294] )

</p><p id="p_27">13.  The expression "cause of action" has sometimes 
been employed to convey the restricted idea of facts or 
circumstances which constitute either the infringement 
or the basis of a right and no more.  In a wider and 
more comprehensive sense, it has been used to denote 
the whole bundle of material facts, which a plaintiff 
must prove in order to succeed.   These are all those 
essential facts without the proof of which the plaintiff 
must fail in his suit ( <a href="/doc/1475334/" id="a_11">See Gurdit Singh v. Munsha Singh</a> 
[(1977) 1 SCC 791] )

</p><p id="p_28">14.   The expression "cause of action" is generally 
understood to mean a situation or state of facts that 
entitles a party to maintain an action in a court or a 
tribunal; a group of operative facts giving rise to one or 
more bases of suing; a factual situation that entitles one 
person to obtain a remedy in court from another person 
(see Black's Law Dictionary).  In Stroud's Judicial 
Dictionary a "cause of action" is stated to be the entire 
set of facts that gives rise to an enforceable claim; the 
phrase comprises every fact, which if traversed, the 
plaintiff must prove in order to obtain judgment.  In 
Words and Phrases (4th Edn.) the meaning attributed to 
the phrase "cause of action" in common legal parlance 
is existence of those facts, which give a party a right to 
judicial interference on his behalf.  (<a href="/doc/777058/" id="a_12">See Navinchandra 
N. Majithia v. State of Maharashtra</a> [(2000) 7 SCC 640 
: 2001 SCC (Cri) 215]"
</p>

<p id="p_29">	Judged in that context also, a part of cause of  action arose in Calcutta 
in respect whereof, the State of West Bengal was the appropriate 
government.   It may be that in a given case, two States may have the 
requisite jurisdiction in terms of clause (c) of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1669932/" id="a_13">Section 10</a> 
of the Industrial Disputes Act.  Assuming that other State Governments had 
also jurisdiction, it would not mean that although a part of cause of action 
arose within the territory of the State of West Bengal, it would have no 
jurisdiction to make the reference.  
</p>
<p id="p_30">	There is another aspect of the matter which cannot be lost sight off.  If 
the provisions contained in the Code of Civil Procedure are given effect to, 
even if the Third Industrial Tribunal, West Bengal had no jurisdiction, in 
view of the provisions contained in Section 21 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, unless respondent suffered any prejudice, they could not have 
questioned the jurisdiction of the Court.  <a href="/doc/1625415/" id="a_14">In Kiran Singh and others v. 
Chaman Paswan and others</a>   [A.I.R. 1954 SC 340], this Court held; 
</p>
<p id="p_31">(6) ... If the question now under consideration fell to 
be determined only on the application of general 
principles governing the matter, there can be no 
doubt that the District Court of Monghyr was 
'coram non judice' and that its judgment and decree 
would be nullities.   The question is what is the 
effect of <a href="/doc/1757983/" id="a_15">section 11</a> of the Suits Valuation Act on 
this position.
</p>
<p id="p_32">(7) <a href="/doc/31217/" id="a_16">Section 11</a> enacts that notwithstanding anything 
in section 578 of the Code of Civil Procedure an 
objection that a Court which had no jurisdiction over 
a suit or appeal had exercised it by reason of over-
valuation or under-valuation, should not be 
entertained by an appellate Court, except as 
provided in the section.  Then follow provisions as 
to when the objections could be entertained, and 
how they are to be dealt with.   The drafting of the 
section has come in  and deservedly  for 
considerable criticism; but amidst much that is 
obscure and confused, there is one principle which 
stands out clear and conspicuous.  It is that a decree 
passed by a Court, which would have had no 
jurisdiction to hear a suit or appeal but for over-
valuation or under-valuation, is not to be treated as, 
what it would be but for the section, null and void, 
and that an objection to jurisdiction based on over-
valuation or under-valuation, should be dealt with 
under that section and not otherwise.
</p>
<p id="p_33">The reference to <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_17">section 578</a>, now <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_18">section 99</a>, C.P.C. 
in the opening words of the section is significant.  
That section, while providing that no decree shall be 
reversed or varied in appeal on account of the 
defects mentioned therein when they do not affect 
the merits of the case, excepts from its operation 
defects of jurisdiction.  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_19">Section 99</a> therefore gives no 
protection to decrees passed on merits, when the 
Courts which passed them lacked jurisdiction as a 
result of over-valuation or under-valuation.  It is 
with a view to avoid this result that <a href="/doc/31217/" id="a_20">section 11</a> was 
enacted.   It provides that objections to the 
jurisdiction of a Court based on over-valuation or 
under-valuation shall not be entertained by an 
appellate Court except in the manner and to the 
extent mentioned in the section.   It is a self-
contained provision complete in itself, and no 
objection to jurisdiction based on over-valuation or 
under-valuation can be raised otherwise than in 
accordance with it.
</p>
<p id="p_34">	With reference to objections relating to 
territorial jurisdiction, section 21 of the Civil 
Procedure Code enacts that no objection to the place 
of suing should be allowed by an appellate or 
revisional Court, unless there was a consequent 
failure of justice.  It is the same principle that has 
been adopted in <a href="/doc/1757983/" id="a_21">section 11</a> of the Suits Valuation 
Act with reference to pecuniary jurisdiction.  The 
policy underlying <a href="/doc/1306271/" id="a_22">sections 21</a> and <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_23">99</a>, C.P.C. and 
<a href="/doc/1757983/" id="a_24">section 11</a> of the Suits Valuation Act is the same, 
namely, that when a case had been tried by a Court 
on the merits and judgment rendered, it should not 
be liable to be reversed purely on technical grounds, 
unless it had resulted in failure of justice, and the 
policy of the legislature has been to treat objections 
to jurisdiction both territorial and pecuniary as 
technical and not open to consideration by an 
appellate Court, unless there has been a prejudice on 
the merits.  The contention of the appellants, 
therefore, that the decree and judgment of the 
District Court, Monghyr, should be treated as a 
nullity cannot be sustained under <a href="/doc/1757983/" id="a_25">section 11</a> of the 
Suits Valuation Act."
</p>
	
<p id="p_35">	{See also <a href="/doc/231673/" id="a_26">MD. Army Welfare Housing Organisation v. Sumangal 
Services (P) Ltd</a> [(2004) 9 SCC 619] }

	Yet again appellants being workmen, their services were protected in 
terms of the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_27">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, 1947.   If their services were protected, 
an order of termination was required to be communicated.  Communication 
of an order of termination itself may give rise to a cause of action.  An order 
of termination takes effect from the date of communication of the said order.   
<a href="/doc/1146501/" id="a_28">In State of Punjab v. Amar Singh Harika</a> [ A.I.R. 1966 SC 1313], this Court 
held;
</p>
<p id="p_36">"(11) ... It is plain that the mere passing of an order of 
dismissal would not be effective unless it is published 
and communicated to the officer concerned.    If the 
appointing authority passed an order of dismissal, but 
does not communicate it to the officer concerned, 
theoretically it is possible that unlike in the case of a 
judicial order pronounced in Court, the authority may 
change its mind and decide to modify its order.    It may 
be that in some cases, the authority may feel that the 
ends of justice would be met by demoting the officer 
concerned rather than dismissing him.  An order of 
dismissal passed by the appropriate authority and kept 
with itself, cannot be said to take effect unless the 
officer concerned knows about the said order and it is 
otherwise communicated to all the parties concerned.   
If it is held that the mere passing of the order of 
dismissal has the effect of terminating the services of 
the officer concerned, various complications may arise.   
If before receiving the order of dismissal, the officer 
has exercised his power and jurisdiction to take 
decisions or do acts within his authority and power, 
would those acts and decisions be rendered invalid after 
it is known that an order of dismissal had already been 
passed against him?   Would the officer concerned be 
entitled to his salary for the period between the date 
when the order was passed and the date when it was 
communicated to him?   These and other complications 
would inevitably arise if it is held that the order of 
dismissal takes effect as soon as it is passed, though it 
may be communicated to the officer concerned several 
days thereafter.   It is true that in the present case, the 
respondent had been suspended during the material 
period; but that does not change the position that if the 
officer concerned is not suspended during the period of 
enquiry, complications of the kind already indicated 
would definitely arise.   We are therefore, reluctant to 
hold that an order of dismissal passed by an appropriate 
authority and kept on its file without communicating it 
to the officer concerned or otherwise publishing it will 
take effect as from the date on which the order is 
actually written out by the said authority; such an order 
can only be effective after it is communicated to the 
officer concerned or is otherwise published.   When a 
public officer is removed from service, his successor 
would have to take charge of the said office; and except 
in cases where the officer concerned has already been 
suspended, difficulties would arise if it is held that an 
officer who is actually working and holding charge of 
his office, can be said to be effectively removed from 
his office by the mere passing of an order by the 
appropriate authority.  In our opinion, therefore, the 
High Court was plainly right in holding that the order of 
dismissal passed against the respondent on the 3rd June 
1949 could not be said to have taken effect until the 
respondent came to know about it on the 28th May 
1951."

	For the reasons aforementioned, the impugned judgment of the 
Division Bench of the High Court cannot be sustained.  It is set aside 
accordingly.  The matter is remitted back to the High Court for consideration 
of the Letters Patent Appeal on merit.  Appeal is allowed.  However, in the 
facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no order as to costs.
