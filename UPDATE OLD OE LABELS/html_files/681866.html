In paragraph 30 of the aforesaid decision in Smt. Alka Subhash

Gadia's case (supra) this Court observed :
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                             4</span><p id="p_10">


"30. As regards his last contention, viz., that to deny a
right to the proposed detenu to challenge the order of
detention and the grounds on which it is made before he
is taken in custody is to deny him the remedy of judicial
review of the impugned order which right is a part of the
basic structure of the Constitution, we find that this
argument is also not well merited based as it is on
absolute assumptions. Firstly, as pointed out by the
authorities discussed above, there is a difference between
the existence of power and its exercise. Neither the
Constitution including the provisions of <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_8">Article 22</a>
thereof nor the Act in question places any restriction on
the powers of the High Court and this Court to review
judicially the order of detention. The powers under
Articles 226 and 32 are wide, and are untrammeled by
any external restrictions, and can reach any executive
order resulting in civil or criminal consequences.
However, the courts have over the years evolved certain
self-restraints for exercising these powers. They have
done so in the interests of the administration of justice
and for better and more efficient and informed exercise
of the said powers. These self-imposed restraints are not
confined to the review of the orders passed under
detention law only. They extend to the orders passed and
decisions made under all laws. It is in pursuance of this
self-evolved judicial policy and in conformity with the
self-imposed internal restrictions that the courts insist
that the aggrieved person first allow the due operation
and implementation of the concerned law and exhaust
the remedies provided by it before approaching the High
Court and this Court to invoke their discretionary
extraordinary and equitable jurisdiction under Articles
226 and 32 respectively. That jurisdiction by its very
nature is to be used sparingly and in circumstances
where no other efficacious remedy is available. We have
while discussing the relevant authorities earlier dealt in
detail with the circumstances under which these
extraordinary powers are used and are declined to be
used by the courts. To accept Shri Jain's present
contention would mean that the courts should disregard
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                          5</span>


          all these time-honoured and well-tested judicial self-
          restraints and norms and exercise their said powers, in
          every case before the detention order is executed.
          Secondly, as has been rightly pointed out by Shri Sibal
          for the appellants, as far as detention orders are
          concerned if in every case a detenu is permitted to
          challenge and seek the stay of the operation of the order
          before it is executed, the very purpose of the order and of
          the law under which it is made will be frustrated since
          such orders are in operation only for a limited period.
          Thirdly, and this is more important, it is not correct to
          say that the courts have no power to entertain grievances
          against any detention order prior to its execution. The
          courts have the necessary power and they have used it in
          proper cases as has been pointed out above, although
          such cases have been few and the grounds on which the
          courts have interfered with them at the pre-execution
          stage are necessarily very limited in scope and number,
          viz., where the courts are prima facie satisfied (i) that the
          impugned order is not passed under the Act under which
          it is purported to have been passed, (ii) that it is sought
          to be executed against a wrong person, (iii) that it is
          passed for a wrong purpose, (iv) that it is passed on
          vague, extraneous and irrelevant grounds or (v) that the
          authority which passed it had no authority to do so. The
          refusal by the courts to use their extraordinary powers of
          judicial review to interfere with the detention orders
          prior to their execution on any other ground does not
          amount to the abandonment of the said power or to their
          denial to the proposed detenu, but prevents their abuse
          and the perversion of the law in question."

mechanically as a Euclid's theorem nor as if it was a statute.


</p><p id="p_15">8.   On the subject of precedents Lord Halsbury, L.C., said in

Quinn vs. Leathem, 1901 AC 495 :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">           "Now before discussing the case of Allen Vs. Flood
           (1898) AC 1 and what was decided therein, there are two
           observations of a general character which I wish to
           make, and one is to repeat what I have very often said
           before, that every judgment must be read as applicable to
           the particular facts proved or assumed to be proved,
           since the generality of the expressions which may be
           found there are not intended to be expositions of the
           whole law, but are governed and qualified by the
           particular facts of the case in which such expressions are
           to be found. The other is that a case is only an authority
           for what it actually decides. I entirely deny that it can be
           quoted for a proposition that may seem to follow
           logically from it. Such a mode of reasoning assumes that
           the law is necessarily a logical Code, whereas every
           lawyer must acknowledge that the law is not always
           logical at all."

<p id="p_16">We entirely agree with the above observations.

           background of the facts of that case. It has been said a

vs. N.R. Vairamani &amp; another</a> (AIR 2004 SC 4778), a decision

cannot be relied on without disclosing the factual situation. In the

same judgment this Court also observed :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">           "Courts should not place reliance on decisions without
           discussing as to how the factual situation fits in with the
           fact situation of the decision on which reliance is placed.
           Observations of Courts are neither to be read as Euclid's
           theorems nor as provisions of the statute and that too
           taken out of the context. These observations must be
           read in the context in which they appear to have been
           stated. Judgments of Courts are not to be construed as
           statutes. To interpret words, phrases and provisions of a
           statute, it may become necessary for judges to embark
           into lengthy discussions but the discussion is meant to

           explain and not to define. Judges interpret statutes, they

<blockquote id="blockquote_9">                 Circumstantial flexibility, one additional or
          different fact may make a world of difference between
          conclusions in two cases. Disposal of cases by blindly
          placing reliance on a decision is not proper. The
          following words of Lord Denning in the matter of
          applying precedents have become locus classicus :
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">                 Each case depends on its own facts and a close
          similarity between one case and another is not enough
          because even a single significant detail may alter the
          entire aspect. In deciding such cases, one should avoid
          the temptation to decide cases (as said by Cardozo, J.) by
          matching the colour of another. To decide, therefore, on
          which side of the line a case falls, the broad resemblance
          to another case is not at all decisive.

is not a statute, and hence cannot be construed as such. In Smt.

Alka Subhash Gadia's case (supra) this Court only wanted to lay

down the principle that entertaining a petition against a preventive

detention order at a pre- execution stage should be an exception

and not the general rule. We entirely agree with that proposition.

However, it would be an altogether different thing to say that the

five grounds for entertaining such a petition at a pre execution

relevant materials before the Detaining Authority vitiates the

detention order, and grounds (iii) &amp; (iv) of the decision of this

Court in Alka Subhash Gadia's case (supra) are attracted in such

a situation as held in <a href="/doc/1785615/" id="a_23">Rajinder Arora vs. Union of India</a> (supra)

(vide para 25 of the said decision). Hence, even if we treat the five

exceptions mentioned in Alka Subhash Gadia's case (supra) as

exhaustive, the present case is covered by the 3rd and 4th

exceptions of those five exceptions, as held in Rajinder Arora's

case (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_42">
</p><p id="p_43">28.   Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that a writ of

habeas corpus lies only when there is illegal detention, and in the

present case since the petitioner has not yet been arrested, no writ

of habeas corpus can be issued. We regret we cannot agree, and

that for two reasons. Firstly, <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_24">Article 226</a> and <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_25">Article 32</a> of the

Constitution permit the High Court and the Supreme Court to not

only issue the writs which were traditionally issued by British

Courts but these Articles give much wider powers to this Court and

the High Court. This is because <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_26">Article 32</a> and <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_27">Article 226</a> state

that the Supreme Court and High Court can issue writs in the

nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, certiorari, etc. and they can

also issue orders and directions apart from issuing writs. The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                                                    16</span>


words `in the nature of' imply that the powers of this Court or the

High Court are not subject to the traditional restrictions on the

powers of the British Courts to issue writs. Thus the powers of this

Court and the High Court are much wider than those of the British

Courts vide <a href="/doc/844819/" id="a_28">Dwarka Nath          vs.   Income-tax Officer, Special

Circle, D Ward, Kanpur &amp; Anr</a>. AIR 1966 SC 81 (vide para 4),

Suvarna Jayanti Mahotsav Smarak Trust &amp; Ors. vs. V.R.

Rudani &amp; Ors</a>. AIR 1989 SC 1607 (vide para 16 to 18), etc.

Secondly, what the petitioner really prays for is a writ in the nature

of certiorari to quash the impugned detention order and/or a writ in

the nature of mandamus for restraining the respondents from

arresting him. Hence even if the petitioner is not in detention a

writ of certiorari and/or mandamus can issue.



</p><p id="p_44">29.   The celebrated writ of habeas corpus has been described as `a

great constitutional privilege of the citizen' or `the first security of

against illegal detention and its purpose is to safeguard the liberty

of the citizen which is a precious right not to be lightly

transgressed by anyone. The imperative necessity to protect those

precious rights is a lesson taught by all history and all human

experience. Our founding fathers have lived through bitter years

of the freedom struggle and seen an alien government trample upon

the human rights of our citizens. It is for this reason that they

introduced <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_30">Article 21</a> in the Constitution and provided for the writs

are that he imported 29 consignments of goods duty free which

were meant to be used as raw material for manufacture of goods

which should have been exported, but instead, he sold them in the

local market.    It is also alleged that he obtained duty free

other allegations have also been made in the grounds of detention

<p id="p_51">
</p><p id="p_52">34.   Several submissions have been made by Shri Soli Sorabjee,

learned counsel for the petitioner, but in our opinion it is not

necessary to go into all of them since we are inclined to allow this

petition on one of these grounds namely, that the relevant material

was not placed before the Detaining Authority when he passed the

detention order.

<p id="p_53">

</p><p id="p_54">35.   These relevant materials have been stated in the writ petition

in ground `C' entitled `Non-placement of relevant material

consideration thereof by the Detaining Authority'.

we agree with Mr. Shekhar Nafade, learned counsel for the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                                              21</span>


respondent that it is not necessary for the Detaining Authority to

consider or refer to the materials which were irrelevant to the

activities mentioned in <a href="/doc/69411723/" id="a_32">Section 3(1)</a> of the Act. However, we agree

with Shri Soli Sorabjee that some of the materials were relevant

and should have been placed before the Detaining Authority and

considered by him, but they were neither placed before the

Detaining Authority nor were they considered.



</p><p id="p_56">37.   The most important of these documents which were not

placed before the Detaining Authority were the retractions given

by Kuresh Rajkotwala to the DRI dated 4.12.2006, Kuresh

Rajootwala's affidavit filed before the learned Addl. Chief

Metropolitan Magistrate, Esplanade, Mumbai, Bharat Chavhan's

retraction to DRI dated 9.5.2008, Bipin Thaker's retraction to DRI

dated 19.1.2008, Sharad Bhoite's retraction dated 24.4.2007 before

the Addl. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Esplanade Mumbai and

its affidavit filed before the same authority etc.

</p><p id="p_57">38.   Shri Nafade, learned counsel submitted that these retractions

were made before the DRI and the Additional Chief Metropolitan

Magistrate, and not before the Sponsoring Authority who was the

Additional Director of Revenue Intelligence.         Shri Nafade

submitted that the Sponsoring Authority was not aware of these

retractions and hence he could not have placed them before the

Detaining Authority. We find no merit in this submission.



</p><p id="p_58">39.   Most of the retractions were made to the DRI, and he belongs

to the same department as the Sponsoring Authority, who is the

Additional Director, Revenue Intelligence. Hence, it was the duty

of the DRI to have communicated these retractions of the alleged

witnesses to the Sponsoring Authority, as well as the Detaining

Authority. There is no dispute that these retractions were indeed

made by persons who were earlier said to have made confessions.

These confessions were taken into consideration by the Detaining

Authority when he passed the detention order. Had the retractions

of the persons who made these confessions also been placed before

the Detaining Authority it is possible that the Detaining Authority

may not have passed the impugned detention order. Hence, in our

opinion, the retractions of the confessions should certainly have

been placed before the Detaining Authority, and failure to place

them before him, in our opinion, vitiates the detention order.


</p><p id="p_59">40.   It has been repeatedly held by this Court that if a confession

is considered by the Detaining Authority while passing the

detention order the retraction of the confession must also be placed

before him and considered by him, otherwise the detention order is

vitiated. Thus in <a href="/doc/1484079/" id="a_33">Ashadevi vs. K. Shivraj &amp; another</a> 1979 (1)

SCC 222 this Court observed (vide para 7) :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_27">           "Further, in passing the detention order the detaining
           authority obviously based its decision on the detenu's
           confessional statements of December 13 and 14, 1977 and,
           therefore, it was obligatory upon the Customs Officers to
           report the retraction of those statements by the detenu on
           December 22, 1977 to the detaining authority, for, it
           cannot be disputed that the fact of retraction would have
           its own impact one way or the other on the detaining
           authority before making up its mind whether or not to
           issue the impugned order of detention. Questions whether
           the confessional statements recorded on December 13 and
           14, 1977 were voluntary statements or were statements
           which were obtained from the detenu under duress or

           whether the subsequent retraction of those statements by
           the detenu on December 22, 1977 was in the nature of an
           after-thought, were primarily for the detaining authority to
           consider before deciding to issue the impugned detention
           order but since admittedly the aforesaid vital facts which
           would have influenced the mind of the detaining authority
           one way or the other were neither placed before nor
           considered by the detaining authority it must be held that
           there was non-application of mind to the most material and
           vital facts vitiating the requisite satisfaction of the
           detaining authority thereby rendering the impugned
           detention order invalid and illegal".

<p id="p_60">41.   It may be noted that in the above decision, this Court has held

that it was the duty of the Customs Officer to have reported the

retraction of the statements to the Detaining Authority. Hence,

even if the retractions in the present case were not placed before

the Detaining Authority that will not be of any avail to the

respondents since it has been held that it was the duty of the

authorities before whom the retractions were made to have

forwarded them to the Detaining Authority and the Sponsoring

Authority. We entirely agree with the above view.
