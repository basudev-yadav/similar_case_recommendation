I.A. No.14758/2016

1\. The case at hand illustrates what is well known amongst the intellectual

enough points of similarity to confuse the public with enough points of

copies of another‟s mark or symbol."[(See: Baker V. Master Printers Union of
New Jersey, 47 USPQ 69 at 72 (D.N.J.1940)] CS (COMM) 1569/2016 Page 1 of 38

ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF

25\. Mr. Chander M. Lall, learned senior counsel for the plaintiff contended
that the defendants had copied the plaintiff‟s product. Mr. Lall placed on
record the following comparative chart highlighting the similarities between
the plaintiff and defendants‟ products:-

26\. Learned senior counsel for the plaintiff pointed out that as and when the
plaintiff made changes to its PARACHUTE label, the defendants made the same
changes immediately. He stated that the defendants had copied the earlier
PARACHUTE label as well.

27\. Mr. Lall contended that in addition to the PARACHUTE label, the
defendants had also infringed the label of the plaintiff's PARACHUTE ADVANSED
JASMINE Coconut oil. He showed the following photographs of the plaintiff‟s
and the defendants‟ product:-

CS (COMM) 1569/2016 Page 14 of 38

ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANTS

28\. Per contra, Mr. Rajat Aneja learned counsel for the defendants submitted
that this Court did not possess the territorial jurisdiction to try and
entertain the present suit inasmuch as both the plaintiff and the defendants
had their offices in Telangana and hence were admittedly carrying on business
in Telangana. He pointed out that the defendants did not have any office in
Delhi and were not carrying on business in Delhi and no product of the
defendants had ever been sold in Delhi. Therefore, according to him, no part
of cause of action had arisen in Delhi as per Section 20(c) of Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908.

29\. Learned counsel for the defendants stated the plaintiff had invoked
jurisdiction of this Court on the basis of para 51 of the plaint wherein it
had been averred that the defendants were selling their products through
departmental store BIG BIZAAR- stores which were operating in Delhi. He
contended that this was clever drafting by the plaintiff in order to invoke
jurisdiction of this Court inasmuch as the said fact was not supported by any
document.

CS (COMM) 1569/2016 Page 15 of 38

30\. Learned counsel for the defendants contended that the website
www.indiamart.com/kedia-industries/ did not belong to the defendants and the
defendants had neither posted any information on the said website nor had
www.indiamart.com taken any authorization or permission from them before
posting such information. He contended that from the information available on
the said third party website, it could not be assumed that the defendants were
carrying on business in Delhi or that any part of cause of action had arisen
in Delhi.

31\. Learned counsel for the defendants stated that the plaintiffs cannot rely
upon the defendants‟ affidavit filed in 2008, before the Trademarks Registry
stating that defendants‟ products were being sold throughout the length and
breadth of the country. He pointed out that the plaintiff in para 39 of the
plaint had in fact admitted that as of 2013, sales of the impugned product
were restricted to the State of Andhra Pradesh/Telangana and nearby markets,
from which it was clear that no part of cause of action had arisen in Delhi.

32\. Mr. Rajat Aneja further submitted that the present suit was barred by
delay, laches and acquiescence. He stated that the plaintiff had been aware of
the defendants‟ use of the mark/label SHRI LAXMI BRAND since 2001, which
included all the features such as dark blue and green colour combination; SHRI
LAXMI BRAND written in white font within a flag with green border, picture of
coconut tree etc. He emphasised that the defendants had been using various
elements of SHRI LAXMI BRAND label/packaging/trade dress continuously and
uninterruptedly since 1999, as shown below:-

CS (COMM) 1569/2016 Page 16 of 38

33\. Mr. Aneja pointed out that in response to the plaintiff‟s cease and
desist notice dated 21st January, 2002, alleging copyright infringement and
passing off, the defendants had sent a reply on 05th February, 2002 and had
also filed a suit against the plaintiff before the Court of PRL, Junior Civil
Judge, Hyderabad being Suit No.221 of 2002. He stated that no action was taken
by the plaintiff and the defendants continued to use all the elements of SHRI
LAXMI BRAND trademark/label uninterruptedly. He stated that subsequently, the
defendants adopted the EVEREST trademark/label in 2006 and had spent a huge
amount of money in its marketing and promotion.

34\. He pointed that in 2013, the plaintiff again initiated a criminal
proceeding against the defendants on account of use of the EVEREST LABEL;
however, the same was unsuccessful as it was found that the defendants had a
copyright registration in the said label.

35\. Consequently, according to him, the plaintiff had waited for fourteen
years to file the present suit against the defendants after being fully aware
about the aforesaid mark/label of the defendants. He contended that the
plaintiff had knowingly allowed the defendants to proceed and to expend money
on their mark/label which was inconsistent with the plaintiff‟s claim of
exclusivity and as such, the plaintiff had CS (COMM) 1569/2016 Page 17 of 38
acquiesced to the defendants‟ use of the aforesaid marks/labels including its
various elements.

36\. Mr. Rajat Aneja also stated that the defendants were honest and
concurrent users inasmuch as the defendants had been using SHRI LAXMI BRAND
label with its various elements i.e. blue colour bottles, dark blue colour
inside the green border window, with the green coconut tree and white
alphabets for its trademark since 1999. He stated that the defendants had also
applied for trademark registration of the said label, vide Application
No.1018670 dated 20th June, 2001, claiming user since 01st January, 1999.

37\. He stated that though the plaintiff claimed to have filed applications
for trademark registrations in the year 1997, yet its earliest applications
being Application Nos. 737894 and 737893 for PARACHUTE label had been filed on
"proposed to be used" basis. He pointed out that the plaintiff had not filed
any documents on record to show that they had been using the mark/label
PARACHUTE in the course of trade since the year 1997\. He stated that the
invoices filed by the plaintiff were from 2001 onwards and they also did not
show that the plaintiff was using the PARACHUTE label, which was the subject
matter of the present suit. The advertisement material filed by the plaintiff
did not relate to the PARACHUTE label. He contended the plaintiff‟s claim of
use or having acquired distinctiveness for its trademark/label or any element
thereof from the year 1997 was doubtful. He submitted that the plaintiff was
required to establish its case first, by supporting documents.

CS (COMM) 1569/2016 Page 18 of 38

38\. Mr. Rajat Aneja submitted that there was no monopoly over single colour
trademarks. He pointed out that Section 2(1)(m) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999
defines a „mark‟ as including a device, brand, heading, label, ticket, name,
signature, word, letter, numeral, shape of goods, packaging or „combination of
colours‟ or any combination thereof. He stated that Section 2(1)(zb) of the
Trade Marks Act, 1999 defines a trademark as "a mark capable of being
represented graphically and which is capable of distinguishing the goods or
services of one person from those of others and may include shape of goods,
their packaging and combination of colours..." Therefore according to him
under the Trade Marks Act, 1999, a single colour trademark had not been
recognized as a source identifier. He pointed out that the Bombay High Court,
in the plaintiff's case itself being Marico Industries Ltd. & Anr. Vs. Sarfraj
Trading Co. & Ors., 2002 (25) PTC 348, had held, "... in so far as colour of
the bottle, coconut tree, there can be no monopoly and have been dealt with in
earlier proceedings filed by the Plaintiff against some others."

39\. He submitted that the plaintiff cannot claim exclusivity over a colour
combination unless it prima facie established that the said colour combination
had become distinctive of the plaintiff‟s product. In support of his
submission, he relied upon a judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in
Britannia Industries Ltd. Vs. ITC Limited, 240(2017) DLT 156.

40\. Mr. Aneja, pointed out that blue colour was common to the trade and
coconut oil was being sold by a number of suppliers in similar blue colour
bottles. He emphasised that no legal action had been initiated by the
plaintiff against such third party manufacturer/suppliers.

CS (COMM) 1569/2016 Page 19 of 38

41\. Learned counsel for defendants submitted that in view of Section 17 of
the Trade Marks Act, 1999, the plaintiff being the registered owner of the
whole of its PARACHUTE label, could not file a suit for infringement of trade
mark against the defendants for using a part of the plaintiff's registered
label. In support of his submission, he relied upon the judgment of this Court
in Godfrey Phillips India Limited v. P.T.I Private Limited & Ors., 2018
SCCOnLine Del 8278.

42\. Mr. Rajat Aneja, lastly stated that during the course of several hearings
in the present matter, the defendants had given various proposals to the
plaintiff in order to amicably settle the dispute between the parties. He
stated that the defendants were still willing to carry out some minor
modifications.

COURT'S REASONING ELEMENTS OF PASSING OFF ACTION ARE PRIMA FACIE ESTABLISHED
IN THE PRESENT CASE. THIS COURT IS FURTHER OF THE PRIMA FACIE VIEW THAT THE
ADOPTION BY THE DEFENDANTS WAS IN BAD FAITH. ACCORDINGLY, THE CONTENTION OF
THE DEFENDANTS THAT THEY WERE HONEST CONCURRENT USERS IS CONTRARY TO FACTS.

43\. This Court is of the view that it is first essential to compare the
products of the plaintiff and the defendants. A comparative photograph of both
the plaintiff and the defendants‟ product is reproduced hereinbelow:-

CS (COMM) 1569/2016 Page 20 of 38

44\. Upon comparison of the aforesaid two bottles, it is evident that the
background colour (same shade of blue Pantone 285C), bottle size, cap shape,
nozzle, flag device, coconut tree, broken coconut device, indentation, print
as well as description in white font, are very similar if not identical. This
Court is of the prima facie opinion that if the two products are placed next
to each other, it would be apparent that each and every important feature of
the plaintiff‟s PARACHUTE Coconut Oil product had been copied by the
defendants for their EVEREST Coconut Oil product. In the present case, the
resemblance in get up and trade dress between the two products is so close
that it can hardly occur except by deliberate imitation. In fact, this Court
is of the prima facie view that if the two rival products were kept on a
display shelf, it may be well-nigh impossible for a reasonable consumer to
tell which product belongs to whom. Consequently, this Court is of the prima
facie opinion that the defendants have copied the most relevant, material and
essential features CS (COMM) 1569/2016 Page 21 of 38 of the plaintiff‟s
product in an attempt to pass off its products as that of the plaintiff's.

45\. Moreover, as and when the plaintiff made changes in its trade dress, the
defendants followed suit. The same is apparent from the following table:-

CS (COMM) 1569/2016 Page 22 of 38

46\. The plaintiff has also placed on record relevant print outs of its annual
reports for PARACHUTE Coconut oil, flag device and broken coconut device. The
said reports indicate the market share of the plaintiff‟s product on the date
it carried out the changes in its trade dress. The relevant portion of the
said reports are reproduced hereunder:-

    
    
      S.No.      Year       Product        Trade Dress         Market Share
      1.      1992-93      Parachute                                50%
                           Coconut
                           Oil
    
    
    
      2.      1999-        Parachute                                53%
              2000         Coconut
                           Oil and
                           Flag
                           Device
    
    
    
    
      3.      2003-04      Parachute                                57%
                           Coconut
                           Oil, Flag
                           Device,
                           Broken
                           coconut
                           device
    
    
    
    
    

47\. In fact, in the 1997-98 annual report, the plaintiff had not only
mentioned its total revenue, post tax profit, but also the special features of
CS (COMM) 1569/2016 Page 23 of 38 its new logo and the name of its designer.
In the said annual report, it was specifically stated that the "consumers had
responded to the new look with enthusiasm, assured of the eternal goodness of
the product."

48\. Keeping in view the aforesaid contemporaneous documents, this Court is
prima facie of the opinion that on the dates the defendants carried out
changes in their trade dress and label, the plaintiff was the market leader in
the category of edible oil and the plaintiff's mark and trade dress had become
distinctive of its goods. Consequently, it made sense for competitors such as
the defendants to copy the plaintiff.

49\. In fact, this Court is of the prima facie view that not only are the
three elements of a passing off action namely, the reputation of goods,
possibility of deception and likelihood of damages established in the present
case, but that the adoption by the defendants of the said trade mark and trade
dress was in bad faith. Accordingly, the contention of the defendants that
they were honest concurrent users is contrary to facts.

A PRIMA FACIE CASE OF INFRINGEMENT IS MADE OUT INASMUCH AS THE DEFENDANTS HAVE
COPIED THE PLAINTIFF‟S REGISTRATIONS. IN FACT, NOT ONLY HAS THE BOTTLE SHAPE,
COLOUR AND LABELING BEEN COPIED BY THE DEFENDANTS, BUT ALSO THE INDIVIDUAL
ELEMENTS WHICH ARE SUBJECT MATTER OF INDEPENDENT REGISTRATION. SECTION 17 OF
THE TRADE MARKS ACT, 1999, APPLIES TO THE PRESENT CASE AND GODFREY PHILLIPS
INDIA LIMITED (SUPRA) JUDGMENT, IS INAPPLICABLE TO THE FACTS OF THE PRESENT
CASE.

50\. This Court is of the view that a prima facie case of infringement is made
out inasmuch as the defendants have copied the plaintiff‟s registrations. In
fact, not only has the bottle shape, colour and labeling CS (COMM) 1569/2016
Page 24 of 38 been copied by the defendants, but also the individual elements
which are subject matter of independent registrations. The said fact would be
apparent from the following chart:-

> Plaintiff‟s Registration Use by the Defendant R.No.363235 Dt.-27/06/1980
> R.No.737894 Dt.20/03/1997 R.No.737893 Dt.20/03/1997 R.No.2423238
> Dt-06/11/2012 CS (COMM) 1569/2016 Page 25 of 38 R.No.2423236 Dt-06/11/2012
> R.No.1033844 Dt-02/08/2001 R.No.2425320 Dt.08/11/2012 R.No.2425321
> Dt-08/11/2012 R.No.2425322 Dt-08/11/2012 CS (COMM) 1569/2016 Page 26 of 38
> R.No.3481083 Dt-13/02/2017

51\. Consequently, Section 17 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, is satisfied in
the present case and Godfrey Phillips India Limited (supra) judgment, is
inapplicable.

THE PLAINTIFF IS NOT CLAIMING EXCLUSIVITY IN BLUE COLOUR AS A STAND ALONE
FACTOR, BUT IN A COMBINATION OF PARTS, WHICH INCLUDES THE BLUE COLOUR. IN ANY
EVENT, THE BLUE COLOUR HAS BEEN HELD TO BE A SOURCE IDENTIFIER IN ANNAMALAYAR
AGENCIES VS. VVS & SONS PVT. LTD. & ORS., 2008 (38) PTC 37 (MAD.)

52\. With regard to the issue of infringement and passing off in colour
combination, this Court is of the view that the plaintiff is not claiming
monopoly over a single colour inasmuch as the plaintiff‟s bottle is not only
blue in colour but it also contains amongst others a coconut tree, a broken
coconut device, a flag which has a dark blue background and certain
descriptions written in white font. Consequently, the plaintiff is not
claiming exclusivity in blue colour as a stand alone factor, but in a
combination of factors, which includes the blue colour.

53\. In the present case, the get-up is not only novel, but distinctive and
acts as a source identifier, even though it consists of a combination of
commonly used parts. From the huge turnover certified by the Chartered
Accountant in Annual Accounts as well as due to continuous use over a CS
(COMM) 1569/2016 Page 27 of 38 long period of time, it seems prima facie that
plaintiff‟s packaging is exclusively associated with the plaintiff and the
products bearing the plaintiff‟s trade dress are recognized by the public as
being sourced from the plaintiff and from no one else.

54\. As far as the defendants‟ argument that the colour blue is common to the
trade and/or the plaintiff has not taken legal action against such similar
infringers, this Court is of the view that the defendants have not been able
to prima facie prove that the said „infringers‟ had significant business
turnover or they posed a threat to plaintiff‟s distinctiveness. No sale
figures of third parties using the blue colour bottles have been placed on
record by the defendant. Consequently, this Court at this stage cannot presume
extensive use of the blue colour by third parties.

55\. This Court is of the view that the plaintiff is not expected to sue all
small type infringers who may not be affecting the plaintiff‟s business. The
Supreme Court in National Bell Vs. Metal Goods reported in AIR 1971 SC 898 has
held that a proprietor of a trademark need not take action against an
infringer who does not cause prejudice to its distinctiveness. In Express
Bottlers Services Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Pepsi Inc. & Others reported in 1989 (7) PTC
14 it has been held as under:-

> "....To establish the plea of common use, the use by other persons should be
> shown to be substantial. In the present case, there is no evidence regarding
> the extent of the trade carried on by the alleged infringers or their
> respective position in the trade. If the proprietor of the mark is expected
> to pursue each and every insignificant infringer to save his mark, the
> business will come to a standstill. Because there may be occasion when the
> malicious persons, just to harass the proprietor may use his mark by way of
> pinpricks.... The mere use of the name is irrelevant because a registered
> proprietor is not expected to go on filing suits or proceedings against
> infringers who are of CS (COMM) 1569/2016 Page 28 of 38 no consequence....
> Mere delay in taking action against the infringers is not sufficient to hold
> that the registered proprietor has lost the mark intentionally unless it is
> positively proved that delay was due to intentional abandonment of the right
> over the registered mark. This Court is inclined to accept the submissions
> of the respondent No. 1 on this point....The respondent No. 1 did not lose
> its mark by not proceeding against insignificant infringers..."

56\. In Dr. Reddy Laboratories Vs. Reddy Pharmaceuticals reported in 2004 (29)
PTC 435 a coordinate Bench of this Court has held as under :-

> "..., the owners of trade marks or copy rights are not expected to run after
> every infringer and thereby remain involved in litigation at the cost of
> their business time. If the impugned infringement is too trivial or
> insignificant and is not capable of harming their business interests, they
> may overlook and ignore petty violations till they assume alarming
> proportions. If a road side Dhaba puts up a board of "Taj Hotel", the owners
> of Taj Group are not expected to swing into action and raise objections
> forthwith. They can wait till the time the user of their name starts harming
> their business interest and starts misleading and confusing their
> customers."

57\. In any event, in Colgate Palmolive Company and Anr. Vs. Anchor Health and
Beauty Care Pvt. Ltd., 2003 SCC OnLine Del 1005 another Coordinate Bench of
this Court has held that colour in a trade dress can be so significant that in
some cases even single colour can be taken to be a trademark to be protected
in passing off action. The relevant portion of the said judgment reads as
under:-

> "60. In the case of passing off and for that purpose infringement of
> trademark which are already in existence, the second or for that purpose the
> subsequent comer has certain obligation to avoid unfair competition and
> become unjustly rich by encashing CS (COMM) 1569/2016 Page 29 of 38 on the
> goodwill or reputation of the prior comer. They have to establish and bank
> upon on their own trade dress or distinctive features so as to establish
> their own merit and reputation and attract the attention of the purchasing
> public and if there are no substantial dissimilarities of marks, colour
> combination, getup or layout on the container or packing or covering of the
> goods of the prior comer these are likely to create confusion in the minds
> of customers between his goods and the goods of the prior comer in the
> market as underlying and hidden intention of the second comer is to encash
> upon the successful rival.

> xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx

> 62\. Significance of trade dress and colour combination is so immense that
> in some cases even single colour has been taken to be a trademark to be
> protected from passing off action. Colour combination is a trademark within
> the definition of the TMM Act as there is no exclusion in the definition.
> Even a single colour has been held to be a trade mark. There may be
> exception also. Exception is that where the colour cannot be protected as
> the blue colour is for the ink and red colour is for the lipstick. Red and
> white has nothing to do with the pink. Teeth as white line and gum as pink
> colour alone at least sometimes can meet the basic requirements as a
> trademark. Colour depletion theory is unpursuasive only in cases where a
> blanket prohibition is being sought."

58\. In fact, the blue bottle has been held to be a source identifier of
plaintiff‟s product in Annamalayar Agencies Vs. VVS & Sons Pvt. Ltd. & Ors.,
2008 (38) PTC 37 (Mad.). In the said case, it was held that the showing of the
blue coloured bottle in an advertisement disparaged the plaintiff‟s product
PARACHUTE coconut oil. The relevant portion of the said judgment is reproduced
hereinbelow:-

> "33. Insofar as advertisements 2 and 3 are concerned. they definitely refer
> to a plain unnamed blue bottle and drives home a message that the blue
> bottle does not contain 100% pure and natural coconut oil whereas the 1st
> defendant's product alone CS (COMM) 1569/2016 Page 30 of 38 contain 100%
> pure and natural coconut oil. It is one thing to say that the 1st
> defendant's product alone is 100% pure which is not actionable and it is
> another thing to say that the plaintiff's product is not 100% pure which is
> actionable.

> 34\. Even though it was denied by the 1st defendant that they did not mean
> to run down the product of the plaintiff, it was admitted by them that it
> was aimed at all the blue bottles including that of the plaintiff. It is
> also not in dispute that only the plaintiff and the 1st defendant are
> holding the majority market share in the State of Tamil Nadu and in such
> circumstances it cannot be said that no attempt was made by the 1st
> defendant to disparage the product of the plaintiff namely Parachute.

> xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx

> 36\. If it is an innocuous advertisement without any intent to malign,
> defame and disparage the product of the plaintiff, then there was no
> necessity of showing a blue bottle and comparing its purity by more than one
> in action.

> 37\. The 3rd advertisement also goes to show that the general public not
> picking the blue bottles stacked in the shelf whereas the 1st defendant's
> product are being grabbed with enthusiasm and swiftness. This definitely
> would send a wrong message to television viewers and the buyer of the
> coconut oil that the blue bottle products are inferior to that of green
> bottle products of the 1st defendant, which is nothing but openly
> disparaging the product of the plaintiff."

59\. Consequently, the judgment of the Bombay High Court in Marico Industries
Ltd. & Anr. (Supra) offers no assistance to the defendants.

FOR ACQUIESCENCE, THERE SHOULD NOT ONLY BE A TACIT OR AN EXPRESS ASSENT BY THE
PLAINTIFF TO THE DEFENDANT‟S USE OF THE MARK, BUT ALSO ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE
DEFENDANT TO CONTINUE WITH THE BUSINESS.

ACQUIESCENCE CANNOT BE INFERRED MERELY ON ACCOUNT CS (COMM) 1569/2016 Page 31
of 38 OF THE FACT THAT THE PLAINTIFF HAD NOT TAKEN ANY ACTION FOR INFRINGEMENT
OF ITS RIGHTS.

60\. Acquiescence means an encouragement by the plaintiff to the defendant to
use the infringing mark. It implies positive acts; not merely silence or
inaction. For acquiescence, there should not only be a tacit or an express
assent by the plaintiff to the defendant‟s use of the mark, but also
encouragement of the defendant to continue with the business. Acquiescence may
be a good defence even to the grant of a permanent injunction because the
defendant may legitimately contend that the encouragement of the plaintiff to
the defendant‟s use of the mark in effect amounted to the abandonment by the
plaintiff of his right in favour of the defendant and, over a period of time,
the general public had accepted the goods of the defendant. However,
acquiescence cannot be inferred merely on account of the fact that the
plaintiff had not taken any action for infringement of its rights. [See:
Messrs Hindustan Pencils Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Messrs India Stationery Product Co. &
Anr., (1989 SCCOnLine Del

34)].

61\. In the present case, at no point of time did the plaintiff permit the
defendant to use the impugned mark or trade dress and/or promote the
defendants' mark or trade dress.

62\. In 2002, the plaintiff objected to the use of the earlier packaging of
defendants under the brand SHRI LAXMI. Further, in 2013 plaintiff filed a
criminal complaint against defendants for the use of the impugned trade dress.
In 2016, the plaintiff sent a cease and desist notice against the use of the
impugned trade dress and in November, 2016, the plaintiff initiated CS (COMM)
1569/2016 Page 32 of 38 the present proceedings against the defendants for use
of the impugned trade dress.

63\. Consequently, in the present case, the defence of delay and acquiescence
is contrary to facts and untenable in law.

IN CASES OF INFRINGEMENT EITHER OF TRADE MARK OR OF COPYRIGHT NORMALLY AN
INJUNCTION MUST FOLLOW. MERE DELAY IN BRINGING ACTION IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO
DEFEAT GRANT OF INJUNCTION IN SUCH CASES.

64\. The defence of laches or inordinate delay is a defence in equity. Such a
defence cannot be put up by a party who has acted unfairly and dishonestly.
Further, if the Court is of the view that prejudice is likely to be caused to
the general public who may be misled into buying the goods manufactured by the
defendants thinking them to be the goods of the plaintiff, then an injunction
must be issued.

65\. In any event, it is settled law that in cases of infringement either of
Trade Mark or of Copyright normally an injunction must follow. Mere delay in
bringing action is not sufficient to defeat grant of injunction in such cases.
[See: Midas Hygiene Industries Pvt. Ltd Vs. Sudhir Bhatia, 2004 (28) PTC (121)
SC].

PRIMA FACIE THIS COURT HAS THE TERRITORIAL JURISDICTION TO ENTERTAIN AND
DECIDE THE PRESENT SUIT.

66\. This Court finds that the plaintiff has positively asserted in its plaint
that the defendants are selling their products within the jurisdiction of this
Court through the departmental store „Big Bazar‟. The plaintiff has also
placed on record a printout of the defendants‟ website, which specifically
states that the defendants‟ products are available on various e-commerce CS
(COMM) 1569/2016 Page 33 of 38 websites including „Big Bazar‟. It is an
admitted position that „Big Bazar‟ has outlets in Delhi. The Supreme Court in
Saleem Bhai and Others Vs. State of Maharashtra and Others, AIR 2003 SC 759
and Kamala and Others Vs. K.T. Eshwara SA and Others, (2008) 12 SCC 661 has
held that averments in the plaint have to be believed at this stage.

67\. The plaintiff has further asserted in its plaint that the defendants are
indulging in online sale of the impugned product in Delhi through another
website „Indiamart‟. Printouts of the „Indiamart‟ website showing the
defendants products range have been filed. A perusal of the „Indiamart‟
website prima facie shows that it is an interactive website inasmuch as it
permits the viewers to ask for price and specifically states "before
dispatching the product, they are firmly tested and checked by the team of
quality controllers". Accordingly, in the present case the "purposeful
availment" as well as "sliding scale" and "effects" tests as stipulated in
Banyan Tree Holding (P) Limited Vs. A. Murali Krishna Reddy and Anr., 2010
(42) PTC 361 (Del) are satisfied.

68\. Even defendant no.2 in its own affidavit dated August, 2008 filed before
the Trademark Registry, has admitted that it is selling its goods "through the
entire length and breadth of the country".

69\. A perusal of the order sheets reveals that on 29 th November, 2016, the
counsel for the defendants had even admitted before the learned predecessor of
this Court that they were previously selling their goods in Delhi. Though
subsequently on 08th December, 2016, the counsel for the defendants had tried
to withdraw the said statement by stating that he had never told the Court on
29th November, 2016 that the defendants had ever sold the impugned products in
Delhi, yet the learned predecessor of this CS (COMM) 1569/2016 Page 34 of 38
Court had reiterated that what was recorded in the order sheet on 29 th
November, 2016 was correct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the
superior Courts in India are the Courts of Record and what is recorded in the
Court‟s order is correct and cannot be contradicted by the counsel for the
parties (See: State of Maharashtra Vs. Ramdas Shrinivas Nayak and Another,
(1982) 2 SCC463 and Apar (P) Ltd. and Another Vs. Union of India and Others,
1992 Suppl. (1) SCC 1). In view of the aforesaid, this Court is of the prima
facie opinion that it has the territorial jurisdiction to entertain and decide
the present suit.

DEFENDANTS' OFFER TO MAKE CHANGES WHILE RETAINING THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THE
TRADE DRESS IS NOTHING BUT 'AN ATTEMPT TO SAIL NEAR THE WIND'.

70\. As far as the defendants' contention that it has made some changes in its
packaging/trade dress and is willing to modify its get up/trade dress, this
Court is of the prima facie view that the defendants have time and again made
minor changes in their packaging in an attempt to continue to mislead the
purchasers and make it more difficult for the plaintiff to protect its
mark/trade dress. It is pertinent to mention that throughout these proceedings
the defendants persisted in retaining the following elements:-

    
    
    a)     Blue colour similar to that of plaintiff.
    b)     Bottle shape identical to plaintiff with almost identical indentations.
    c)     A flag device with the brand EVEREST written in a script almost
    

identical to the plaintiff‟s PARACHUTE. In most suggestions, the Flag Device
has a green outline and a dark blue interior, though in CS (COMM) 1569/2016
Page 35 of 38 two of the proposals the defendant did agree to change to the
colour Orange/Red.

d) Almost identical device of broken coconut with a splash of coconut water.

    
    
    e)     Almost identical coconut tree.
    f)     All descriptive and other written material in white on the blue
           background.
    
    

71\. In a similar situation, the Bombay High Court in R.R. Oomerbhoy Private
Limited Vs. Court Receiver, High Court, Bombay and Anr., 2003 (27) PTC 580 had
aptly referred to the following observations of the Master of the Rolls, Lord
Greene in Wright, Layman & Umney Ltd. Vs. Wright, 1949 (46) RPC 149:-

> "It has been said many times that it is no part of the function of this
> Court to examine imaginary cases of what the defendant could or could not do
> under this form of injunction. The best guide, if he is an honest man, is
> his own conscience; and it is certainly not the business of this Court to
> give him instructions or hints as to how near the wind he can sail. Honest
> men do not attempt to sail near the wind."

DEFENDANTS HAVE NOT EVEN DEFENDED THE USE OF SIMILAR MARK FOR THEIR EVERSTAR
JASMINE HAIR OIL

72\. It is pertinent to mention that the defendants have not defended the use
of similar mark for their EVERSTAR JASMINE Hair Oil. The said act prima facie
shows that the intent of the defendants has always been to deceive the public
and to pass of its goods as that of the plaintiff. It has been wisely said
that „what is worth copying is worth protecting‟.

CS (COMM) 1569/2016 Page 36 of 38

TRADING BY THE DEFENDANTS IN THE PRESENT CASE IS NEITHER HONEST NOR FAIR.

73\. To conclude, this Court refers to the statement of law laid down by the
Division Bench in B.K. Engineering Co. Vs. UBHI Enterprises (Regd.) & Anr.,
AIR 1985 Delhi 210 that "it is essential that trading must not only be honest
but must not even unintentionally be unfair. If it is shown that a product or
a business of a trade has acquired a distinctive character the law will
restrain a competitor from using that other's name. A line must be drawn
somewhere between honest and dishonest trading, between fair and unfair
competition."

74\. In this case there can be no doubt that the defendants intend to trade
upon the plaintiff's reputation as well as goodwill and wants to bring its
bottles, trade dress, label and shape as close to the plaintiff as possible.

RELIEF

75\. Consequently, the defendants, their partners, principals, directors,
officers, employees, agents, distributors, suppliers, affiliates,
subsidiaries, franchisees, licensees, representatives, group companies and
assigns are restrained from manufacturing, distributing, exporting, selling,
offering for sale, advertising, promoting, displaying and/or using, in any
manner whatsoever, the impugned products namely EVEREST COCONUT OIL and/or
EVEREST JASMINE HAIR OIL and/or any other product bearing any other
label/trade dress/packaging/mark/bottle shapes/shape of jars deceptively
and/or confusingly similar to the plaintiff‟s trade
marks/labels/packaging/bottle shapes for the PARACHUTE (labels), FLAG DEVICE,
BROKEN COCONUT DEVICE, PARACHUTE CS (COMM) 1569/2016 Page 37 of 38 BOTTLE,
PARACHUTE JAR and/or PARACHUTE ADVANSED JASMINE (labels) and/or variants and
the unique/distinctive trade dress/bottle shapes/shape of jars relating
thereto as a trade mark/label or part of a trade mark/label, trade name or a
part of trade name, domain name or a part of domain name or in any other
manner whatsoever.

76\. Accordingly, I.A. No.14758/2016 stands disposed of. CS(COMM) 1569/2016

77\. List the matter before the Joint Registrar for admission/denial of
documents on 10th October, 2018.
