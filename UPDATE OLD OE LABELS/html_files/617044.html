CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.311 OF 2002

S.B. Sinha, J.
</p>

<p id="p_2">1.	Interpretation of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_1">Sections 42</a> and <a href="/doc/1374738/" id="a_2">43</a> of the Narcotic 
Drugs and <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_3">Psychotropic Substances Act</a>, 1985 <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_4">(NDPS Act</a>) calls for our 
consideration in this appeal which has been filed by the Directorate of 
Revenue against the respondent herein aggrieved by and dissatisfied with a 
judgment and order dated 19 and 20 December, 2000 passed by a learned 
Single Judge of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in Criminal Appeal 
No.462 of 1999 whereby and whereunder the judgment of conviction and 
sentence passed by a Special Judge at Mumbai in NDPS Special Case 
No.221 of 1997 was reversed.
</p><p id="p_3">2.	An information was received in the office of the appellant on 
23.1.1997 that one person staying in Room No.305 or 306 at Hotel Kalpana 
Palace, Grant Road, Mumbai was in possession of a fax copy of 
consignment note under which Mandrex tablets were being transported from 
Delhi to Mumbai.  The said information was passed on to PW-1, Parmar.  
He reduced the same in writing.  He in turn passed it placing same by 
reducing it to writing before A.D. Patekar,  Senior Intelligence Officer (PW-
</p><p id="p_4">10) allegedly as advised by Assistant Director, Atul Dixit, Assistant 
Director.  PW-1 along with two other officers, namely, Dhani and Petkar 
visited the said hotel.  They came to know that the accused was staying in 
Room No.306.  Two of the employees of the said hotel were asked to be 
panch witnesses.  The door of the said room was knocked;  Appellant 
opened it.  He allegedly was given an option to get himself searched in 
presence of a Gazetted Officer or a Magistrate.  He opted for the former.  He 
was searched by the said officers.  A sum of Rs.4,25,000/- in cash and a fax 
copy of a receipt of Green Carriers from Delhi showing the consignment of 
medicine was found in the said room.  A xeroxed copy of the said fax 
message was retained.  
</p><p id="p_5">3.	It appears that the statement of the accused was also recorded in terms 
of <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_5">Section 67</a> of the Act.  The consignment arrived as per the said receipt 
within a couple of days.  Respondent herein was arrested on 27th January, 
1997, inter alia, relying on or on the basis of recovery of the said fax 
message which was marked as Exhibit-8 and the purported xerox copy 
thereof which was marked as Exhibit-8A.  
</p><p id="p_6">4.	The learned Trial Judge relying on the provisions of <a href="/doc/1926081/" id="a_6">Section 66</a> of the 
NDPS Act held the respondent guilty of commission of an offence under 
<a href="/doc/1330288/" id="a_7">Section 8(c)</a>, <a href="/doc/263398/" id="a_8">22</a> and <a href="/doc/1252855/" id="a_9">29</a> of the NDPS Act.  He was not provided any 
opportunity to be heard on the quantum of sentence.  The minimum sentence 
of 10 years and a fine of Rs.1,00,000/- was imposed on him.  
</p><p id="p_7">5.	On an appeal having been preferred against the said judgment of 
conviction and sentence, the High Court, however, without going into the 
other question, opined that as the statutory requirements of <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_10">Section 42</a> of the 
Act had not been complied with, the judgment of the Trial Court could not 
be sustained, holding :
</p><p id="p_8">"As observed earlier though the information seems 
to have been received by the office of DRI, it was 
not reduced to writing by the officer who received 
it but by the PW-1, Parmar who was later on 
conveyed the message by the office.  Thus, there 
was no compliance to <a href="/doc/855593/" id="a_11">Section 42(1)</a> of the Act."
</p>

<p id="p_9">6.	The High Court, in arriving at the said finding, principally relied upon 
the decisions of this Court in <a href="/doc/795643/" id="a_12">State of Punjab v. Balbir Singh</a> [AIR 1994 SC 
1872]; <a href="/doc/106968/" id="a_13">Karnail Singh v. State of Rajasthan</a> [(2000) 7 SCC 632]; and <a href="/doc/173350/" id="a_14">Abdul 
Rashid Ibrahim Mansuri v. State of Gujarat</a> [2000 AIR SCW 375] where the 
provisions of <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_15">Section 42</a> were held to be mandatory in nature.
</p><p id="p_10">7.	Mr. Ashok Bhan, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the 
appellant, in support of this appeal, inter alia, would submit that as a hotel is 
a public place within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1374738/" id="a_16">Section 43</a> of the Act, it was not 
necessary to comply with the provisions of <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_17">Section 42</a> thereof.
</p><p id="p_11">8.	Mr. Harinder Mohan Singh, learned amicus appearing on behalf of the 
Respondent, however, would support the judgment.  
</p><p id="p_12">9.	<a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_18">NDPS Act</a> is a penal statute.  It invades the rights of an accused to a 
large extent.  It raises a presumption of a culpable mental state.  Ordinarily, 
even an accused may not be released on bail having regard to <a href="/doc/496325/" id="a_19">Section 37</a> of 
the Act.  The Court has the power to publish names, address and business 
etc. of the offenders.  Any document produced in evidence becomes 
admissible.  A vast power of calling for information upon the authorities has 
been conferred by reason of <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_20">Section 67</a> of the Act.  
</p><p id="p_13">10.	Interpretation and/or validity in regard to the power of search and 
seizure provided for under the said Act came up for consideration in Balbir 
Singh's case (supra), wherein it was held :
</p><p id="p_14">"11. 	It is thus clear that by a combined reading of 
<a href="/doc/1439062/" id="a_21">Sections 41</a>, <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_22">42</a>, <a href="/doc/1374738/" id="a_23">43</a> and <a href="/doc/1609866/" id="a_24">51</a> of the NDPS Act and 
Section 4 Cr. PC regarding arrest and search under 
<a href="/doc/1439062/" id="a_25">Sections 41</a>, <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_26">42</a> and <a href="/doc/1374738/" id="a_27">43</a>, the provisions of Cr. PC 
namely <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_28">Sections 100</a> and <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_29">165</a> would be applicable 
to such arrest and search. Consequently the 
Principles laid down by various courts as discussed 
above regarding the irregularities and illegalities in 
respect of arrest and search would equally be 
applicable to the arrest and search under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_30">NDPS 
Act</a> also depending upon the facts and 
circumstances of each case. 
</p><p id="p_15">12. But there are certain other embargos envisaged 
under <a href="/doc/1439062/" id="a_31">Sections 41</a> and <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_32">42</a> of the NDPS Act. Only a 
magistrate so empowered under <a href="/doc/1439062/" id="a_33">Section 41</a> can 
issue a warrant for arrest and search where he has 
reason to believe that an offence under Chapter IV 
has been committed so on and so forth as 
mentioned therein. Under Sub-section (2) only a 
Gazetted Officer or other officers mentioned and 
empowered therein can give an authorization to a 
subordinate to arrest and search if such officer has 
reason to believe about the commission of an 
offence and after reducing the information, if any 
into writing. Under <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_34">Section 42</a> only officers 
mentioned therein and so empowered can make the 
arrest or search as provided if they have reason to 
believe from personal knowledge or information. 
In both these provisions there are two important 
requirments. One is that the Magistrate or the 
Officers mentioned therein firstly be empowered 
and they must have reason to believe that an 
offence under Chapter IV has been committed or 
that such arrest or search was necessary for other 
purposes mentioned in the provision. So far as the 
first requirement is concerned, it can be seen that 
the Legislature intends to only certain Magistrates 
and certain Officers of higher rank and empowered 
can act to effect the arrest or search. This is a 
safeguard provided having regard to the deterrent 
sentences contemplated and with a view that 
innocent persons are not harassed. Therefore if an 
arrest or search contemplated under these 
provisions of <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_35">NDPS Act</a> has to be carried out, the 
same can be done only by competent and 
empowered Magistrates or Officers mentioned 
thereunder."
</p>
<p id="p_16">11.	Power to make search and seizure as also to arrest an accused is 
founded upon and subject to satisfaction of the officer as the terms "reason 
to believe" have been used.  Such belief may be founded upon secret 
information that may be orally conveyed by the informant.  Draconian 
provision which may lead to a harsh sentence having regard to the doctrine 
of 'due process' as adumbrated under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_36">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India 
require striking of balance between the need of law and enforcement thereof, 
on the one hand, and protection of citizen from oppression and injustice on 
the other.  
</p><p id="p_17">12.	This Court in Balbir Singh (supra) referring to Miranda v. Arizona 
[(1966) 384 US 436] while interpreting the provisions of the Act held that 
not only the provisions of <a href="/doc/996365/" id="a_37">Section 165</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure 
would be attracted in the matter of search and seizure but the same must 
comply with right of the accused to be informed about the requirement to 
comply with the statutory provisions.
</p><p id="p_18">13.	Requirements of <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_38">Section 42</a> was read into <a href="/doc/1374738/" id="a_39">Section 43</a> of the NDPS 
Act.  A somewhat different view, however, was taken subsequently.  
Decisions were rendered opining that in conducting search and seizure in 
public place or a moving vehicle, provisions appended to sub-section (1) of 
<a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_40">Section 42</a> would not be attracted.  Decisions were also rendered that in such 
a case even sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_41">Section 42</a> need not be complied with.  
</p><p id="p_19">14.	<a href="/doc/1374738/" id="a_42">Section 43</a>, on plain reading of the Act, may not attract the rigours of 
<a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_43">Section 42</a> thereof.  That means that even subjective satisfaction on the part 
of the authority, as is required under sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_44">Section 42</a>, need not 
be complied with, only because the place whereat search is to be made is a 
public place.  If <a href="/doc/1374738/" id="a_45">Section 43</a> is to be treated as an exception to <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_46">Section 42</a>, it is 
required to be strictly complied with.  An interpretation which strikes a 
balance between the enforcement of law and protection of the valuable 
human right of an accused must be resorted to.  A declaration to the effect 
that the minimum requirement, namely, compliance of <a href="/doc/996365/" id="a_47">Section 165</a> of the 
Code of Criminal Procedure would serve the purpose may not suffice as 
non-compliance of the said provision would not render the search a nullity.  
A distinction therefor must be borne in mind that a search conducted on the 
basis of a prior information and a case where the authority comes across a 
case of commission of an offence under the Act accidentally or per chance.  
It is also possible to hold that rigours of the law need not be complied with 
in a case where the purpose for making search and seizure would be 
defeated, if strict compliance thereof is insisted upon.  It is also possible to 
contend that where a search is required to be made at a public place which is 
open to the general public, <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_48">Section 42</a> would have no application but it may 
be another thing to contend that search is being made on prior information 
and there would be enough time for compliance of reducing the information 
to writing, informing the same to the superior officer and obtain his 
permission as also recording the reasons therefor coupled with the fact that 
the place which is required to be searched is not open to public although 
situated in a public place as, for example, room of a hotel, whereas hotel is a 
public place, a room occupied by a guest may not be.  He is entitled to his 
right of privacy.  Nobody, even the staff of the hotel, can walk into his room 
without his permission.  Subject to the ordinary activities in regard to 
maintenance and/or house keeping of the room, the guest is entitled to 
maintain his privacy.  The very fact that the Act contemplated different 
measures to be taken in respect of search to be conducted between sunrise 
and sunset, between sunset and sunrise as also the private place and public 
place is of some significance.  An authority cannot be given an untrammeled 
power to infringe the right of privacy of any person.  Even if a statute 
confers such power upon an authority to make search and seizure of a person 
at all hours and at all places, the same may be held to be ultra vires unless 
the restrictions imposed are reasonable ones.  What would be reasonable 
restrictions would depend upon the nature of the statute and the extent of the 
right sought to be protected.  Although a statutory power to make a search 
and seizure by itself may not offend the right of privacy but in a case of this 
nature, the least that a court can do is to see that such a right is not 
unnecessarily infringed.  Right of privacy deals with persons and not places.
</p><p id="p_20">15.	A person, if he does not break a law would be entitled to enjoy his life 
and liberty which would include the right not to be disturbed.  A right to be 
let alone is recognized to be a right which would fall under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_49">Article 21</a> of the 
Constitution of India.  This Court in <a href="/doc/149969440/" id="a_50">Sharda v. Dharampal</a> [(2003) 4 SCC 
493] dealt with right of privacy to a certain extent.  The question came up 
for consideration in <a href="/doc/1068532/" id="a_51">District Registrar and Collector, Hyderabad &amp; Anr. v. 
Canara Bank &amp; Ors</a>. [(2005) 1 SCC 496] wherein the provisions of <a href="/doc/138782685/" id="a_52">Section 
73</a> of the Stamp Act, as amended by the State of Andhra Pradesh, was struck 
down holding :
</p><p id="p_21">"Once we have accepted in Gobind and in later 
cases that the right to privacy deals with "persons 
and not places", the documents or copies of 
documents of the customer which are in a bank, 
must continue to remain confidential vis-a-vis the 
person, even if they are no longer at the customer's 
house and have been voluntarily sent to a bank. If 
that be the correct view of the law, we cannot 
accept the line of Miller 30 in which the Court 
proceeded on the basis that the right to privacy is 
referable to the right of "property" theory. Once 
that is so, then unless there is some probable or 
reasonable cause or reasonable basis or material 
before the Collector for reaching an opinion that 
the documents in the possession of the bank tend 
to secure any duty or to prove or to lead to the 
discovery of any fraud or omission in relation to 
any duty, the search or taking notes or extracts 
therefore, cannot be valid. The above safeguards 
must necessarily be read into the provision relating 
to search and inspection and seizure so as to save it 
from any unconstitutionality."
</p>
<p id="p_22">16.	It is not in dispute that the said Act prescribes stringent punishment.  
A balance, thus, must be struck in regard to the mode and manner in which 
the statutory requirements are to be complied with vis-`-vis the place of 
search and seizure.  
</p><p id="p_23">17.	This Court times without number has laid great emphasis on recording 
of reasons before search is conducted on the premise that the same would the 
earliest version which would be available to a court of law and the accused 
while defending his prosecution.  The provisions contained in Chapter IV of 
the Act are a group of sections providing for certain checks on exercise of 
the powers of the concerned authority which otherwise would have been 
arbitrarily or indiscriminately exercised.  The statute mandates that the 
prosecution must prove compliance of the said provisions.  If no evidence is 
led by the prosecution, the Court will be entitled to draw the presumption 
that the procedure had not been complied with.  For the said purpose, we are 
of the opinion that there may not be any distinction between a person's place 
of ordinary residence and a room of a hotel.
</p><p id="p_24">18.	It may be placed on record that applying a sophisticated sense 
enhancing technology called thermal imaging, which when kept outside the 
residential house of a person to ascertain as to whether the inmate has kept 
any narcotic substance or not has been held to be infringement of right of 
privacy of the said person in the United States Supreme Court decision of 
Danny Lee Kyllo v. United States [533 U.S. 27, 121 S.Ct. 2038, 150 
L.Ed.2d 94, 01 Cal. Daily Op. Serv. 4749, 2001 Daily Journal D.A.R. 5879, 
14 Fla. L. Weekly Fed. S 329, 2001 DJCAR 2926].  The court opined that :
"(1) use of sense-enhancing technology to gather 
any information regarding interior of home that 
could not otherwise have been obtained without 
physical intrusion into constitutionally protected 
area constitutes a  Fourth amendment "search," 
and (2) use of thermal imaging to measure heat 
emanating from home was search."
</p>
<p id="p_25">19.	In the instant case, the statutory requirements had not been complied 
with as the person who had received the first information did not reduce the 
same in writing.  An officer who received such information was bound to 
reduce the same in writing and not for the person who hears thereabout.  
Furthermore, in this case, apart from proving the fax and the copy of a 
challan nothing else has been proved.  The fax was illegible.  It allegedly 
was received in the PCO run by PW-17.  He could not prove the contents of 
the fax.  He also could not show when the same was received and from 
whom.  It has not been shown that the accused was the person who obtained 
the said fax from PW-17.  Furthermore, contents of the said documents had 
not been proved.  In absence of the aforementioned details, the fax being 
illegible and its contents being not known, the question of the same being 
admissible in evidence in terms of <a href="/doc/1752792/" id="a_53">Section 67</a> of the Act would not arise.  
The xeroxed copy of the said fax had not been proved in the strict sense of 
the term.  No secondary evidence could have been led to prove another 
secondary evidence.  Contents of document are required to be proved.  The 
contents of a document could be held to have been proved in terms of 
<a href="/doc/1926081/" id="a_54">section 66</a> only when the contents are decipherable and not otherwise.
</p><p id="p_26">20.	<a href="/doc/309307/" id="a_55">In R.V.F. Venkatachala Gounder v. Arulmigu Viswesaraswami &amp; 
V.P. Temple [JT</a> 2005 (11) SC 574], this Court stated :
"The learned counsel for the defendant-respondent 
has relied on <a href="/doc/1615015/" id="a_56">The Roman Catholic Mission v. The 
State of Madras and Anr</a>. in support of his 
submission that a document not admissible in 
evidence, though-brought on record, has to be 
excluded from consideration. We do not have any 
dispute with the proposition of law so laid down in 
the abovesaid case. However, the present one is a 
case which calls for the correct position of law 
being made precise. Ordinarily an objection to the 
admissibility of evidence should be taken when it 
is tendered and not subsequently. The objections as 
to admissibility of documents in evidence may be 
classified into two classes:- (i) an objection that the 
document which is sought to be proved is itself 
inadmissible in evidence; and (ii) where the 
objection does not dispute the admissibility of the 
document in evidence but is directed towards the 
mode of proof alleging the same to be irregular or 
insufficient. In the first case, merely because a 
document has been marked as 'an exhibit', an 
objection as to its admissibility is not excluded and 
is available to be raised even at a later stage or 
even in appeal or revision. In the latter case, the 
objection should be taken before the evidence is 
tendered and once the document has been admitted 
in evidence and marked as an exhibit, the objection 
that it should not have been admitted in evidence 
or that the mode adopted for proving the document 
is irregular cannot be allowed to be raised at any 
stage subsequent to the marking of the document 
as an exhibit. The later proposition is a rule of fair 
play. The crucial test is whether an objection, if 
taken at the appropriate point of time, would have 
enabled the party tendering the evidence to cure 
the defect and resort to such mode of proof as 
would be regular. The omission to object becomes 
fatal because by his failure the party entitled to 
object allows the party tendering the evidence to 
act on an assumption that the opposite party is not 
serious about the made of proof. On the other 
hand, a prompt objection does not prejudice the 
party tendering the evidence, for two reasons; 
firstly, it enables the Court to apply its mind and 
pronounce its decision on the question of 
admissibility then and there; and secondly, in the 
event of finding of the Court on the mode of proof 
sought to be adopted going against the party 
tendering the evidence the opportunity of seeking 
indulgence of the Court for permitting a regular 
mode or method of proof and thereby removing the 
objection raised by the opposite party, is available 
to the party leading the evidence. Such practice 
and procedure is fair to both the parties. Out of the 
two types of objections, referred to hereinabove in 
the later case, failure to raise a prompt and timely 
objection amounts to waiver of the necessity for 
insisting on formal proof of a document, the 
document itself which is sought to be proved being 
admissible in evidence. In the first case, 
acquiescence would be no bar to raising the 
objection in superior Court."

<p id="p_27">21.	<a href="/doc/976161/" id="a_57">In Narayanaswamy Ravishankar v. Asstt</a>. Director, Directorate of 
Revenue Intelligence [(2002) 8 SCC 7], while dealing with search and 
seizure at a public place, this Court opined :
"In the instant case, according to the documents on 
record and the evidence of the witnesses, the 
search and seizure took place at the airport which 
is a public place. This being so, it is the provisions 
of <a href="/doc/1374738/" id="a_58">Section 43</a> of the NDPS Act which would be 
applicable. Further, as <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_59">Section 42</a> of the NDPS Act 
was not applicable in the present case, the seizure 
having been effected in a public place, the question 
of non-compliance, if any, of the provisions of 
<a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_60">Section 42</a> of the NDPS Act is wholly irrelevant. 
Furthermore, in the mahazar which was prepared, 
it is clearly stated that the seizure was made by PW 
</p><p id="p_28">1. The mahazar was no doubt drawn by one S. 
</p><p id="p_29">Jayanth. But, the contention of the learned Senior 
Counsel that the prosecution version is vulnerable, 
because Jayanth has not been examined, is of no 
consequence because it is PW 1 who has 
conducted the seizure. With regard to the alleged 
non-compliance of <a href="/doc/669884/" id="a_61">Section 57</a> of the NDPS Act, 
the High Court has rightly noted that PW 3 has 
stated that the arrest of the accused was revealed to 
his immediate superior officer, namely, the Deputy 
Director."

<p id="p_30">22.	<a href="/doc/173350/" id="a_62">In Abdul Rashid Ibrahim Mansuri v. State of Gujarat</a> [(2000) 2 SCC 
513], this Court stated :
</p><p id="p_31">"18. When the same decision considered the 
impact of non-compliance with <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_63">Section 50</a> it was 
held that "it would affect the prosecution case and 
vitiate the trial". But the Constitution Bench has 
settled the legal position concerning that aspect in 
<a href="/doc/1438183/" id="a_64">State of Punjab v. Baldev Singh</a> the relevant 
portion of which has been extracted by us earlier. 
We do not think that a different approach is 
warranted regarding non-compliance with <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_65">Section 
42</a> also. If that be so, the position must be the 
following : 
</p><p id="p_32">If the officer has reason to believe from personal 
knowledge or prior information received from any 
person that any narcotic drug or psychotropic 
substance (in respect of which an offence has been 
committed) is kept or concealed in any building, 
conveyance or enclosed place, it is imperative that 
the officer should take it down in writing and he 
shall forthwith send a copy thereof to his 
immediate official superior. The action of the 
officer, who claims to have exercised it on the 
strength of such unrecorded information, would 
become suspect, though the trial may not vitiate on 
that score alone. Nonetheless the resultant position 
would be one of causing prejudice to the accused."

<p id="p_36">24.	This Court in <a href="/doc/1129696/" id="a_72">Union of India v. Major Singh &amp; Ors</a>. [(2006) 9 SCC 
170], whereupon reliance has been placed by thelearned counsel, held :
"Turning now to <a href="/doc/1158106/" id="a_73">Section 42(2)</a> of the Act, in this 
regard, it may be stated that from the prosecution 
case and evidence it would be clear that the search 
and seizure was made of a public carrier at a public 
place and 127 bags of poppy straw (opium) were 
seized from a public carrier.

<p id="p_37">	The said decision has no application in the instant case.
</p>	
<p id="p_38">25.	For the foregoing reasons, we are of the opinion that the impugned 
judgment does not suffer from any legal infirmity.  There is no merit in the 
appeal.  It is dismissed accordingly.
