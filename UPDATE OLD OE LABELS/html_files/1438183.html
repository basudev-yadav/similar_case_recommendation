DR. A.S.ANAND, CJI :
</p>

<p id="p_3">      On  15.7.1997 when this batch of appeals/special leave
petitions  was	placed	before	a two-Judge  Bench,  it	 was
noticed	 that  there  was   divergence	of  opinion  between
different Benches of this Court with regard to the ambit and
scope  of  <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_1">Section 50</a> of Narcotic Drugs and  -	<a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_2">Psychotropic
Substances  Act</a>,  1985	(hereinafter   <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_3">NDPS  Act</a>)  and	in
particular  with regard to the admissibility of the evidence
collected  by  an  investigating officer during	 search	 and
seizure	 conducted in violation of the provisions of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_4">Section
50</a>  of NDPS Act.  In the cases of <a href="/doc/795643/" id="a_5">State of Punjab v.  Balbir
Singh</a>,	1994 (3) SCC 299, <a href="/doc/1293291/" id="a_6">Ali Mustaffa Abdul Rahman Moosa v.
State of Kerala</a>, 1994 (6) SCC 569, <a href="/doc/893066/" id="a_7">Saiyad Mohd.	 Saiyad Umar
Saiyad and others v.  State of Gujarat</a>, 1995 (3) SCC 610 and
a  number  of other cases, it was laid down that failure  to
observe the safeguards, while conducting search and seizure,
as  provided  by <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_8">Section 50</a> would render the conviction	 and
sentence  of  an  accused illegal.  In Ali  Mustaffas  case
(supra),  the  judgment	 in <a href="/doc/558753/" id="a_9">Pooran Mal v.  The	Director  of
Inspection  (Investigation), New Delhi &amp; Ors</a>., 1974 (1)	 SCC
345, was also considered and it was opined that the judgment
in  Pooran Mals case could not be interpreted to have  laid
down  that a contraband seized as a result of illegal search
or  seizure  could  by	itself be  treated  as	evidence  of
possession  of	the contraband to fasten liability,  arising
out  of unlawful possession of the contraband, on the person
from  whom the alleged contraband had been seized during  an
illegal	 search conducted in violation of the provisions  of
<a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_10">Section	 50</a>  of	 NDPS Act.  However, in	 <a href="/doc/190560007/" id="a_11">State	of  Himachal
Pradesh	 v.   Pirthi  Chand and Anr</a>., 1996 (2) SCC  37,	 and
<a href="/doc/1556629/" id="a_12">State  of  Punjab v.  Labh Singh</a>, 1996 (5) SCC 520,  relying
upon  a judgment of this Court in Pooran Mals case (supra),
a  discordant  note was stuck and it was held that  evidence
collected  in a search conducted in violation of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_13">Section  50</a>
of  NDPS  Act did not become inadmissible in evidence  under
the   <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_14">Evidence	Act</a>  The   two-Judge  Bench,  therefore,  on
15.7.1997,  by	the following order, referred the  batch  of
cases  to  a larger bench :  One of the questions that	has
been  raised  in  these appeals/special leave  petitions  is
whether	 compliance  with Section 50 of the Narcotics  Drugs
and  <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_15">Psychotropic Substances Act</a>, 1985 is mandatory and,  if
so, what is the effect of the breach thereof.  This question
has  had  been	engaging  the attention of  this  Court	 and
answered  in  a	 number	 of cases.  <a href="/doc/795643/" id="a_16">In State  of  Punjab  v.
Balbir	Singh</a> (1994 (3) SCC 299), a two-Judge Bench of	this
Court  held  that the above section is mandatory and  it  is
obligatory  on	the part of the officer concerned to  inform
the  person  to be searched of his right to demand that	 the
search be conducted in the presence of a Gazetted Officer or
a  Magistrate.	It was further held that non-compliance with
the  above  section  would affect the prosecution  case	 and
vitiate	 the  trial.   This  Judgment	was  affirmed  by  a
three-Judge  Bench  in <a href="/doc/893066/" id="a_17">Saiyad Mohd.  Saiyad Umar  Saiyad  v.
State  of Gujarat</a> (1995 (3) SCC 610).  <a href="/doc/1293291/" id="a_18">In Ali Mustaffa Abdul
Rahman	Moosa  v.   State  of Kerala</a> (1994 (6)	SCC  569)  a
submission  was	 made  on behalf of the State of  Kerala  to
reconsider  the	 judgment  in Balbir  Singhs  case  (supra)
keeping	 in view the judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/558753/" id="a_19">Puran Mal  v.
Director of Inspection</a> (1974 (1) SCC 345).  It was contended
that  even  if the search and seizure of the contraband	 was
held to be illegal and contrary to the provisions of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_20">Section
50</a>,  it	 would not affect the conviction because the  seized
articles could be used as evidence of unlawful possession of
the  contraband.   In  repelling the contention,  the  Court
observed  :  The judgment in Pooran Mal case only lays	down
that the evidence collected as a result of illegal search or
seizure,  could	 be used as evidence in proceedings  against
the  party under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_21">Income Tax Act</a>.  The judgment cannot be
interpreted to lay down that a contraband seized as a result
of  illegal  search  or seizure, can be used to	 fasten	 the
liability  of  unlawful possession of the contraband on	 the
person from whom the contraband had allegedly been seized in
an  illegal manner.  Unlawful possession of the contraband
is  the	 sine qua non for conviction under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_22">NDPS Act</a>	 and
that  factor has to be established by the prosecution beyond
a  reasonable  doubt.	Indeed	 the  seized  contraband  is
evidence  but  in the absence of proof of possession of	 the
same, an accused cannot be held guilty under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_23">NDPS Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      In  view of the law laid down in Balbir Singh case  we
hold  that  there  has been violation of the  provisions  of
<a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_24">Section	 50</a> of the NDPS Act and consequently the  conviction
of the appellant cannot be sustained.  (Emphasis supplied)

      It,  however, appears that while dealing with  <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_25">Section
50</a>  in	<a href="/doc/190560007/" id="a_26">State of Himachal Pradesh v.  Pirthi Chand and	Anr</a>.
(1996  (2)  SCC 37), another two-Judge Bench of	 this  Court
referred  to  and relied upon the judgment in  Pooran  Mals
case  (supra)  and  held that the evidence  collected  in  a
search	in violation of law does not become inadmissible  in
evidence under the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_27">Evidence Act</a>.  The Court further observed
that  even  if search was found to be in violation  of	law,
what  weight should be given to the evidence collected was a
question  to  be  gone into during trial.   With  the  above
observations, the Bench recorded a finding that the Sessions
Judge  was  not justified in discharging the  accused  after
filing	 of   the  charge   sheet  holding  that   mandatory
requirements  of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_28">Section 50</a> had not been complied with.	 It,
however, appears that the Courts attention was not drawn to
Ali  Mustaffa  (supra).	 The view expressed in Pirthi  Chand
(supra	)  was reiterated in <a href="/doc/1556629/" id="a_29">State of Punjab v.	 Labh  Singh</a>
(1996 (5) SCC 520) wherein this Court considered the case of
Balbir	Singh  (supra),	 besides  other cases  and  held  as
follows	 :- <a href="/doc/190560007/" id="a_30">In State of H.P.  v.  Pirthi Chand</a>, this  Court
further	 elaborately considered the effect of the  violation
of  <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_31">Section  50</a>	 and  held that any  evidence  recorded	 and
recovered  in  violation  of the search and  the  contraband
seized	in  violation of the mandatory requirement does	 not
ipso facto invalidate the trial.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      From  the	 above	resume, it would  thus	appear	that
though	a  two-Judge  Bench  of this  Court  considered	 the
earlier	 judgments  of	this Court, it held in the  case  of
Pirthi	Chand,	[  and affirmed in the case  of	 Labh  Singh
(supra)],  that	 breach	 of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_32">Section 50</a> does not	 affect	 the
trial  while  in the case of Ali Mustaffa  (supra),  another
Bench  categorically  laid  down that breach of	 <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_33">Section  50</a>
makes  the  conviction	illegal.  In view of  the  divergent
opinions so expressed, we deem it fit to refer these matters
to a larger Bench.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      Let the records be placed before the Chief Justice for
necessary orders.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      The  batch  of  cases was thereafter listed  before  a
three-Judge Bench.  However, when the three-Judge Bench took
up  the matter, it was of the opinion that the judgment of a
three-Judge  Bench  in <a href="/doc/893066/" id="a_34">Saiyad Mohd.  Saiyad Umar Saiyad	 and
ors.	 v.    State   of    Gujarat</a>,	(supra),    required
reconsideration	 and, therefore, the cases were required  to
be considered still by a larger bench and on 19.11.1997, the
three-Judge  Bench made the following order :  1.  In  this
bunch  of  appeals/special  leave  petitions  the  following
questions  of law (besides other questions of law and facts)
fall for determination:
</p>
<p id="p_8">      (i)  Is it the mandatory requirement of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_35">Section 50</a>  of
the  Narcotic  Drugs and <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_36">Psychotropic Substances Act</a>,  1985,
(Act  for  short)  that when an officer,  duly	authorised
under  <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_37">Section 42</a> of the Act, is about to search a person he
must  inform him of his right under sub- section (1) thereof
of  being  taken to the nearest Gazetted Officer or  nearest
Magistrate for making the search?
</p>
<p id="p_9">      (ii)  If	any  search is made  without  informing	 the
person of his such right would the search be illegal even if
he  does  not  of his own exercise his right  under  <a href="/doc/1288137/" id="a_38">Section
50(1)</a>?	And

</p><p id="p_10">      (iii)  Whether a trial held in respect of any recovery
of  contraband	articles pursuant to such a search would  be
void ab initio?
</p>
<p id="p_11">      2.   The	above  questions came up  for  consideration
before a two-Judge Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/795643/" id="a_39">State of Punjab v.
Balbir	Singh</a>  (1994)  3 SCC 299, and it  answered  them  as
under:	 (SCC  p.322,  para 25) On  prior  information	the
empowered  officer or authorised officer while acting  under
<a href="/doc/1223622/" id="a_40">Sections  41(2)</a>	 or 42 should comply with the provisions  of
<a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_41">Section	 50</a> before the search of the person is made and such
person	should be informed that if he so requires, he  shall
be  produced  before a Gazetted Officer or a  Magistrate  as
provided  thereunder.  It is obligatory on the part of	such
officer	 to  inform the person to be searched.	 Failure  to
inform	the  person  to be searched and if  such  person  so
requires, failure to take him to the Gazetted Officer or the
Magistrate,  would  amount to non-compliance of	 <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_42">Section  50</a>
which  is mandatory and thus it would affect the prosecution
case and vitiate the trial. (Emphasis supplied)

</p><p id="p_12">      3.   <a href="/doc/1293291/" id="a_43">In  Ali Mustaffa Abdul Rahman Moosa v.  State  of
Kerala</a>	(1994) 6 SCC 569, a submission was made on behalf of
the  State  of Kerala to reconsider the judgment  in  Balbir
Singhs	case  (supra)  in  view	 of  the  judgment  of	the
Constitution  Bench  of	 this Court in <a href="/doc/558753/" id="a_44">Pooran  Mal  v.	 The
Director  of Inspection (Investigation), New Delhi &amp; others</a>,
(1974) 1 SCC 345 wherein it was observed that where the test
of  admissibility of evidence lay on relevancy (as in  India
and  England),	unless there was an express  or	 necessarily
implied	 prohibition  in  the  Constitution  or	 other	law,
evidence  obtained as a result of illegal search or  seizure
was  not  liable  to be shut out.  Relying  upon  the  above
observation  it	 was contended that even if the	 search	 and
seizure	 of  the  contraband  were held to  be	illegal	 and
contrary to the provisions of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_45">Section 50</a> it would not affect
the  conviction because the seized articles could be used as
evidence   of  unlawful	 possession.	In  repelling	this
contention  the	 two-Judge Bench of this Court	observed  as
under:
</p>
<p id="p_13">      The  judgment in Pooran Mals case (supra) only  lays
down  that  the	 evidence collected as a result	 of  illegal
search	or seizure, could be used as evidence in proceedings
against	 the  party under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_46">Income Tax Act</a>.  The  judgment
cannot	be interpreted to lay down that a contraband  seized
as  a  result of illegal search or seizure, can be  used  to
fasten	 that  liability  of   unlawful	 possession  of	 the
contraband  on	the  person  from whom	the  contraband	 had
allegedly  been	 seized	 in an	illegal	 manner.   Unlawful
possession  of	the  contraband	 is the sine  qua  non	for
conviction  under  the	<a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_47">NDPS Act</a> and that factor has  to  be
established  by	 the prosecution beyond a reasonable  doubt.
Indeed	the seized contraband is evidence but in the absence
of  proof  of possession of the same, an accused  cannot  be
held guilty under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_48">NDPS Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_14">      In  view	of the law laid down in Balbir Singhs  case
(supra)	 we  hold  that	 there has  been  violation  of	 the
provisions  of	<a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_49">Section 50</a> of NDPS Act and consequently	 the
conviction of the appellant cannot be sustained.
</p>
<p id="p_15">      4.   The	judgment in Balbir Singhs case (supra)	was
affirmed by a three-Judge Bench in <a href="/doc/893066/" id="a_50">Saiyad Mohd.	 Saiyad Umar
Saiyad v.  State of Gujarat</a>, (1995) 3 SCC 610.
</p>
<p id="p_16">      5.   A  discordant  note	was   however  struck  by  a
two-Judge  Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/190560007/" id="a_51">State of H.P.	 v.   Pirthi
Chand  &amp; another</a>, (1996) 2 SCC 37, relying upon the judgment
of  this  Court in Pooran Mals case (supra), when  it  held
that  the evidence collected in a search in violation of law
did  not become inadmissible in evidence under the  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_52">Evidence
Act</a>.  The Court further observed that even if the search was
found to be in violation of law, what weight should be given
to  the	 evidence collected was a question to be  gone	into
during	trial.	The same view was reiterated by a  two-Judge
Bench  in <a href="/doc/1556629/" id="a_53">State of Punjab v.  Labh Singh</a>, (1996) 5 SCC	520,
with   the  observation	 that	any  evidence  recorded	 and
recovered  in  violation  of the search and  the  contraband
seized	in  violation of the mandatory requirement  did	 not
ipso facto invalidate the trial.  (Emphasis supplied) 6.  In
our  considered opinion the judgment of this Court in Saiyad
Mohd.	 Saiyad	 Umar  Saiyads	 case  (supra)	(which	was
delivered  by a three-Judge Bench) requires re-consideration
and  the  questions  formulated above answered by  a  larger
Bench,	not only in view of the subsequent judgments of this
Court  (delivered by a two- Judge Bench) referred to  above,
but  also  in  view of the Constitution	 Bench	judgment  in
Pooran Mals case (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_17">      7.  Let these matters be, therefore, placed before the
Honble Chief Justice for necessary orders.
</p>

<p id="p_18">      That  is	how this batch of  Criminal  Appeals/Special
Leave  Petitions  has been placed before  this	Constitution
Bench.	Drug abuse is a social malady.	While drug addiction
eats  into  the vitals of the society, drug trafficking	 not
only  eats into the vitals of the economy of a country,	 but
illicit	 money	generated by drug trafficking is often	used
for illicit activities including encouragement of terrorism.
There  is  no doubt that drug trafficking, trading  and	 its
use,  which  is	 a  global phenomena and  has  acquired	 the
dimensions  of an epidemic, affects the economic policies of
the  State,  corrupts the system and is detrimental  to	 the
future	of a country.  It has the effect of producing a sick
society	 and  harmful  culture.	   Anti-drug  justice  is  a
criminal  dimension  of social justice.	 The United  Nations
Conventions  Against Illicit Trafficking In Narcotic Drugs &amp;
Psychotropic Substances which was held in Vienna, Austria in
1988   was  perhaps  one  of   the  first  efforts,  at	  an
international	level,	 to  tackle   the  menace  of	drug
trafficking   throughout  the  comity	of   nations.	 The
Government  of India has ratified this convention.  Prior to
the  passing  of  the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_54">NDPS Act</a>, 1985 control  over  Narcotic
drugs  was being generally exercised through certain Central
enactments  though  some  of  the States  also	had  enacted
certain statutes with a view to deal with illicit traffic in
drugs.	 <a href="/doc/912591/" id="a_55">The  Opium Act</a>, 1857 related mainly  to  preventing
illicit	 cultivation  of  poppy, regulating  cultivation  of
poppy	and   manufacture  of	opium.	 <a href="/doc/912591/" id="a_56">Opium	Act</a>,   1878,
supplemented   <a href="/doc/912591/" id="a_57">Opium   Act</a>,  1875   and	  made	 possession,
transportation, import, export, sale, etc.  of opium also an
offence.   The Dangerous Drug Act, 1930, was enacted with  a
view  to  suppress  traffic  in	  contraband  and  abuse  of
dangerous  drugs,  particularly derived from  opium,  Indian
hemp  and  coca	 leaf  etc.    <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_58">The  Act</a>	 prescribed  maximum
punishment  of imprisonment for three years with or  without
fine,  insofar	as  first offence is concerned and  for	 the
second	or  the subsequent offence the punishment  could  go
upto  four years RI.  These Acts, however, failed to control
illicit	 drug  traffic	and  drug abuse on  the	 other	hand
exhibited  an upward trend.  New drugs of addiction known as
Psychotropic  Substances  also appeared on the scene  posing
serious	 problems.  It was noticed that there was an absence
of  comprehensive  law	to  enable  effective  control	over
psychotropic  substances  in  the manner  envisaged  by	 the
International  Convention of Psychotropic Substances,  1971.
The need for the enactment of some comprehensive legislation
on   Narcotics	Drug  and   Psychotropic   Substances	was,
therefore,  felt.   The	 Parliament with a view	 to  meet  a
social	challenge of great dimensions, enacted the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_59">NDPS Act</a>,
1985  to consolidate and amend existing provisions  relating
to control over drug abuse etc.	 and to provide for enhanced
penalties  particularly	 for trafficking and  various  other
offences.   <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_60">The NDPS Act</a>, 1985 provides stringent  penalties
for various offences.  Enhanced penalties are prescribed for
second	and  subsequent	 offences.  The NDPS, Act  1985	 was
amended	 in 1988 w.e.f.	 29th May, 1989.  Minimum punishment
of 10 years imprisonment which may extend upto 20 years and
a  minimum fine of Rs.1 lakh which may extend upto Rs.2 lakh
have  been provided for most of the offences under the	<a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_61">NDPS
Act</a>,  1985.   For  second and subsequent  offences,  minimum
punishment  of imprisonment is 15 years which may extend  to
30  years while minimum fine is Rs.1.5 lakh which may extend
to Rs.3 lakhs.	<a href="/doc/1736438/" id="a_62">Section 31(a)</a> of the Act, which was inserted
by  the	 <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_63">Amendment Act</a> of 1988, has even provided  that	 for
certain	 offences, after previous convictions, death penalty
shall  be  imposed,  without leaving any discretion  in	 the
Court  to award imprisonment for life in appropriate  cases.
Another	 amendment of considerable importance introduced  by
the  <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_64">Amendment Act</a>, 1988 was that all the offences under the
Act were made triable by a special court.  <a href="/doc/1182815/" id="a_65">Section 36</a> of the
Act  provides for constitution of special courts manned by a
person	who  is a Sessions Judge or an	Additional  Sessions
Judge.	 Appeal from the orders of the special courts lie to
the High Court.	 <a href="/doc/496325/" id="a_66">Section 37</a> makes all the offences under the
Act  to	 be cognizable and non-bailable and also  lays	down
stringent  conditions  for grant of bail.  However,  despite
the stringent provisions of the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_67">NDPS Act</a>, 1985 as amended in
1988  drug business is booming;	 addicts are rapidly rising;
crime  with  its  role to narcotics is	galloping  and	drug
trafficking  network  is ever growing.	 While	interpreting
various	 provisions  of	 the  statute,	the  object  of	 the
legislation  has to be kept in view but at the same time the
interpretation	has to be reasonable and fair.	With a	view
to  answer  the questions framed by the referring Bench	 and
resolve	 the  divergence of opinion expressed  by  different
benches	 particularly  on the applicability of the law	laid
down  in  Pooran Mals case (supra) to the admissibility	 of
evidence  collected  as	 a  result of  search  conducted  in
violation  of the provisions of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_68">Section 50</a> of the NDPS	Act,
to  offences under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_69">NDPS Act</a>, it would be appropriate  to
first notice some of the relevant statutory provisions.	 For
the  purpose  of  this	batch  of  cases  we  are  primarily
concerned with Chapter V in general and <a href="/doc/852142/" id="a_70">Sections 35</a>, <a href="/doc/1439062/" id="a_71">41</a>, <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_72">42</a>,

lays down :
</p>
<p id="p_19">      35.   Presumption of culpable mental state.   (1) In
any prosecution for an offence under this Act which requires
a  culpable  mental  state of the accused, the	court  shall
presume the existence of such mental state but it shall be a
defence	 for  the accused to prove the fact that he  had  no
such  mental  state  with respect to the act charged  as  an
offence in that prosecution.

Magistrate,  Delhi  and	 others</a>, [1954]	 S.C.R.	  1077,	 the
challenge  to  the power of issuing a search  warrant  under
<a href="/doc/1160228/" id="a_109">Section	 96(1)</a>	Cr.P.C.	  as violative	of  the	 fundamental
rights	was repelled by the Constitution Bench on the ground
that  the  power  of  search and seizure in  any  system  of
jurisprudence  is  an overriding power of the State for	 the
protection  of	social	security.  It was also held  that  a
search	by itself is not a restriction on the right to	hold
and enjoy property, though a seizure may be a restriction on
the  right  of	possession  and	  enjoyment  of	 the  seized
property,  but	it  is only temporary and  for	the  limited
purpose	 of an investigation.  The Court opined :  A  power
of  search and seizure is in any system of jurisprudence  an
overriding  power of the State for the protection of  social
security  and  that power is necessarily regulated  by	law.
When the Constitution makers have thought fit not to subject
such regulation to constitutional limitations by recognition
of a fundamental right to privacy, analogous to the American
Fourth	Amendment,  we have no justification to	 import	 it,
into  a totally different fundamental right, by some process
of  strained  construction.  Nor is it legitimate to  assume
that the constitutional protection under <a href="/doc/366712/" id="a_110">Article 20(3)</a> would
be defeated by the statutory provisions for searches.
</p>
<p id="p_57">      The  Court  also opined :	 A search and  seizure	is,
therefore,  only a temporary interference with the right  to
hold   the  premises  searched	 and  the  articles  seized.
Statutory  regulation  in  this	  behalf  is  necessary	 and
reasonable  restriction	 cannot per se be considered  to  be
unconstitutional.   The	 damage,  if  any,  caused  by	such
temporary  interference	 if found to be in excess  of  legal
authority  is a matter for redress in other proceedings.  We

etc.   and  arrest  of	a  person who  is  found  to  be  in

in a public place where such possession appears to him to be
unlawful.   <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_122">Section 50</a> of the Act prescribes the  conditions
under	which  search  of  a  person  shall  be	  conducted.
Sub-section  (1) provides that when the empowered officer is
about  to  search  any suspected person, he  shall,  if	 the
person	to be searched so requires, take him to the  nearest
Gazetted  Officer or the Magistrate for the purpose.   Under
sub-section (2) it is laid down that if such request is made
by  the	 suspected  person, the officer who is to  take	 the
search,	 may  detain  the suspect until he  can	 be  brought
before such Gazetted Officer or the Magistrate.	 Sub-section
(3) lays down that when the person to be searched is brought
before	such  a Gazetted Officer or the Magistrate and	such
Gazetted  Officer or the Magistrate finds that there are  no
reasonable  grounds for search, he shall forthwith discharge
the  person  to be searched, otherwise he shall direct	that
the  search be made.  On its plain reading, <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_123">Section 50</a> would
come  into play only in the case of a search of a person  as
distinguished  from search of any premises etc.	 However, if
the  empowered	officer,  without any prior  information  as
contemplated  by  <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_124">Section  42</a> of the Act makes a  search  or
causes	arrest	of  person  during   the  normal  course  of
investigation  into  an offence or suspected offence and  on
completion  of that search, a contraband under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_125">NDPS	 Act</a>
is also recovered, the requirements of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_126">Section 50</a> of the Act
are  not attracted.  Vide <a href="/doc/1609866/" id="a_127">Section 51</a>, the provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_128"> of	 the

after  incorporating the broad principles regarding  search,
seizure	 and arrest etc.  in <a href="/doc/1439062/" id="a_132">Sections 41</a>, <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_133">42</a>, <a href="/doc/1374738/" id="a_134">43</a>, <a href="/doc/1798309/" id="a_135">49</a> and  <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_136">50</a>
has  laid down in <a href="/doc/1609866/" id="a_137">Section 51</a> that the provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_138"> of the Code</a>
of  Criminal  Procedure shall apply insofar as they are	 not

expression  insofar  as they are not inconsistent with	the
provisions  of this Act occurring in <a href="/doc/1609866/" id="a_140">Section 51</a> of the NDPS
Act  is	 of significance.  This expression implies that	 the
provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_141">  of	the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure	relating  to
search,	 seizure  or  arrest apply to  search,	seizure	 and
arrest	under  <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_142">NDPS Act</a> also except to the extent  they	 are
inconsistent  with the provisions of the Act.  Thus, while
conducting search and seizure, in addition to the safeguards
provided   under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_143">  the  Code</a>  of	 Criminal   Procedure,	 the
safeguards  provided under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_144">NDPS Act</a> are also required to
be  followed.  <a href="/doc/1830223/" id="a_145">Section 50(4)</a> of the NDPS Act lays down	that
no  female  shall be searched by anyone excepting a  female.
This provision is similar to the one contained in <a href="/doc/1601812/" id="a_146">Section 52</a>
of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 and <a href="/doc/1753338/" id="a_147">Section 51(2)</a> of

females.   <a href="/doc/1753338/" id="a_148">Section 51(2)</a> of the Code of Criminal  Procedure,
1973  lays  down  that whenever it is necessary to  cause  a
female	to be searched, the search shall be made by  another
female with strict regard to decency.  The empowered officer
must, therefore, act in the manner provided by <a href="/doc/1830223/" id="a_149">Section 50(4)</a>
of  the	 NDPS  Act read with <a href="/doc/1753338/" id="a_150">Section 51(2)</a> of  the  Code  of
Criminal  Procedure, 1973 whenever it is found necessary  to
cause a female to be searched.	The document prepared by the
Investigating  Officer at the spot must invariably  disclose
that  the  search was conducted in the aforesaid manner	 and
the name of the female official who carried out the personal
search	of  the concerned female should also  be  disclosed.
The  personal  search  memo of the female  concerned  should
indicate  compliance with the aforesaid provisions.  Failure
to  do	so  may	 not  only affect  the	credibility  of	 the
prosecution  case but may also be found as violative of	 the
basic  right  of  a female to be treated  with	decency	 and
proper	dignity.   The	provisions of <a href="/doc/1137396/" id="a_151">Sections 100</a>  and	 <a href="/doc/996365/" id="a_152">165</a>
Cr.P.C.	  are  not inconsistent with the provisions  of	 the
<a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_153">NDPS Act</a> and are applicable for affecting search, seizure or
arrest	under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_154">NDPS Act</a> also.  However, when an empowered
officer	 carrying  on  the investigation  including  search,
seizure	 or  arrest  under  the provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_155"> of  the  Code</a>  of
Criminal   Procedure,  comes  across  a	 person	  being	  in
possession  of	the  narcotic	drugs  or  the	psychotropic
substance,  then he must follow from that stage onwards	 the
provisions of the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_156">NDPS Act</a> and continue the investigation as
provided thereunder.  If the investigating officer is not an
empowered  officer  then it is expected of him that he	must
inform	the empowered officer under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_157">NDPS Act</a>, who should
thereafter  proceed  from that stage in accordance with	 the
provisions  of	the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_158">NDPS Act</a>.  In Balbir Singhs case  after
referring  to  a number of judgments, the Bench opined	that
failure to comply with the provisions of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_159">Cr.P.C</a>.  in respect
of  search  and seizure and particularly those	of  <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_160">Sections
100</a>,  <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_161">102</a>,  <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_162">103</a>	 and  <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_163">165</a>  per	 se  does  not	vitiate	 the
prosecution  case.   If there is such a violation, what	 the
courts	have  to see is whether any prejudice was caused  to
the  accused.	While  appreciating the evidence  and  other
relevant  factors, the courts should bear in mind that there
was  such  a violation and evaluate the evidence  on  record
keeping	 that in view.	What is the import of the expression
if  such  person  so  requires he shall be  taken  to  the
nearest	 Gazetted Officer or Magistrate and his search shall
be  made  before such Officer or Magistrate as occurring  in
<a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_164">Section	 50</a>.   Does  the expression not	 visualise  that  to
enable	the  concerned	person to require his search  to  be
conducted  before  a Gazetted Officer or a  Magistrate,	 the
empowered  officer is under an obligation to inform him that
he  has	 such a right ?	 Learned counsel appearing  for	 the
State  of  Punjab as also the learned counsel appearing	 for
the  State of Gujarat argued that it would not be proper  to
read  into  the	 provisions of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_165">Section 50</a>,  any	 legislative
intent	of  prescribing a duty on the part of the  empowered
Officer	 to  inform the suspect that if he so requires,	 the
search	would  be conducted before a Gazetted Officer  or  a
Magistrate,  as	 the case may be.  According to the  learned
counsel,  the  view expressed in <a href="/doc/795643/" id="a_166">State of Punjab v.   Balbir
Singh</a> (supra), laying down that it is obligatory on the part
of such an officer to so inform the person to be searched or
if  such  person  requires, failure to take him	 for  search
before	the Gazetted Officer or the Magistrate, would amount
to  non-  compliance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_167">Section  50</a>	 and
would  affect  the  prosecution case and vitiate  the  trial
requires reconsideration.  As a matter of fact, the order of
the  referring bench itself, centers around whether there is
any requirement of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_168">Section 50</a>, making, it obligatory for the
empowered  officer,  who  is about to search  a	 person,  to
inform	him  of	 his  right of being taken  to	the  nearest
Gazetted Officer or nearest Magistrate for making the search
if  he	so  requires.	Learned	 counsel  for  the  parties,
however,  agree	 that in case the obligation to	 inform	 the
suspect	 of  his  right	 to be searched	 before	 a  Gazetted
Officer	 or  a	Magistrate  is read as a duty  cast  on	 the
empowered   officer,  then  failure   to  give	 information
regarding  that	 right	to the suspect would  be  a  serious
infirmity  amounting  to  denial of a valuable right  to  an
accused and would render his conviction for an offence under
the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_169">NDPS Act</a> bad and unsustainable.  The question as to what
is  the	 effect	 of non-compliance with	 the  provisions  of
<a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_170">Section 50</a> on the recovery of the contraband was answered in
<a href="/doc/795643/" id="a_171">State  of  Punjab  v.	Balbir Singh</a>  (supra).	 The  common
question which arose for consideration in a batch of appeals
filed  by  the	State of Punjab was whether any	 arrest	 or
search	of  a person or search of a place conducted  without
conforming  to	the  provisions	 of the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_172">NDPS  Act</a>  would  be
rendered  illegal and consequently vitiate the	conviction?
The  Trial Court in those cases had acquitted the accused on
the  ground  that  the	arrest,	  search  and  seizure	were
conducted  in  violation  of  some   of	 the  relevant	and
mandatory  provisions  of  the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_173">NDPS Act</a>.   The	High  Court
declined  to  grant appeal against the order  of  acquittal.
The State of Punjab thereupon filed appeals by special leave
in  this Court.	 In some other cases, where the accused	 had
been  convicted,  they also filed appeals by  special  leave
questioning their conviction and sentence on the ground that
their trials were illegal because of non-compliance with the
safeguards  provided  under <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_174">Section 50</a> of the NDPS  Act.   A
two-Judge  Bench speaking through K.  Jayachandra Reddy,  J.
considered  several  provisions	 of the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_175">NDPS  Act</a>  governing
arrest,	  search  and  seizure	 and,  in  particular,	 the
provisions of <a href="/doc/1439062/" id="a_176">Sections 41</a>, <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_177">42</a>, <a href="/doc/1374738/" id="a_178">43</a>, <a href="/doc/109977/" id="a_179">44</a>, <a href="/doc/1798309/" id="a_180">49</a>, <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_181">50</a>, <a href="/doc/1609866/" id="a_182">51</a>, <a href="/doc/1294540/" id="a_183">52</a> and <a href="/doc/669884/" id="a_184">57</a>
of  the	 NDPS Act as well as the provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_185"> of the  Code</a>  of
Criminal  Procedure relating to search and seizure  effected
during	investigation  of  a criminal  case.   Dealing	with
<a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_186">Section	 50</a>,  it was held that in the context in  which	 the
right had been conferred, it must naturally be presumed that
it  is	imperative on the part of the officer to inform	 the
person to be searched of his right that if he so requires he
shall  be  searched before a Gazetted Officer or  Magistrate
and  on	 such request being made by him, to be taken  before
the  Gazetted Officer or Magistrate for further proceedings.
The  reasoning	given  in Balbir Singhs case  was  that	 to
afford an opportunity to the person to be searched if he so
requires  to  be  searched before a Gazetted  Officer  or  a
Magistrate  he	must be made aware of that right  and  that
could be done only by the empowered officer by informing him
of  the existence of that right.  The Court went on to	hold
that  failure  to inform the person to be searched  of	that
right  and  if	he so requires, failure to take him  to	 the
Gazetted   Officer   or	   the	  Magistrate,	would	mean
non-compliance	with  the provisions of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_187">Section 50</a> which  in
turn  would  affect  the prosecution case and  vitiate	the
Trial.	The  following conclusions were arrived at  by	the
two-Judge  Bench in <a href="/doc/795643/" id="a_188">State of Punjab v.	Balbir Singh</a> (supra)
:   The questions considered above arise frequently  before
the trial courts.  Therefore we find it necessary to set out
our conclusions which are as follows :
</p>
<p id="p_60">      (1)  If a police officer without any prior information
as contemplated under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_189">NDPS Act</a> makes a
search	or  arrests  a	person	in  the	 normal	 course	  of
investigation  into  an	 offence or  suspected	offences  as
provided  under the provisions of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_190">CrPC</a> and when such  search
is  completed at that stage <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_191">Section 50</a> of the NDPS Act would
not  be	 attracted  and the question of complying  with	 the
requirements  thereunder  would not arise.  If	during	such
search	or arrest there is a chance recovery of any narcotic
drug  or psychotropic substance then the police officer, who
is  not	 empowered, should inform the empowered officer	 who
should	thereafter proceed in accordance with the provisions
of  the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_192">NDPS Act</a>.  If he happens to be an empowered  officer
also,  then from that stage onwards, he should carry out the
investigation in accordance with the other provisions of the
<a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_193">NDPS Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_61">      (2-A) Under <a href="/doc/1200558/" id="a_194">Section 41(1)</a> only an empowered Magistrate
can  issue  warrant  for  the arrest or for  the  search  in
respect	 of offences punishable under Chapter IV of the	 Act
etc.   when he has reason to believe that such offences have
been  committed or such substances are kept or concealed  in
any  building,	conveyance or place.  When such warrant	 for
arrest	or  for search is issued by a Magistrate who is	 not
empowered,  then such search or arrest if carried out  would
be  illegal.   Likewise	 only  empowered  officers  or	duly
authorized  officers  as  enumerated in <a href="/doc/1223622/" id="a_195">Sections  41(2)</a>	 and
<a href="/doc/855593/" id="a_196">42(1)</a> can act under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_197">NDPS Act</a>.  If such
arrest	or  search is made under the provisions of the	<a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_198">NDPS
Act</a>  by	 anyone other than such officers, the same would  be
illegal.
</p>
<p id="p_62">      (2-B)  Under <a href="/doc/1223622/" id="a_199">Section 41(2)</a> only the empowered  officer
can  give  the authorisation to his subordinate	 officer  to
carry  out  the	 arrest of a person or search  as  mentioned
therein.  If there is a contravention, that would affect the
prosecution case and vitiate the conviction.
</p>
<p id="p_63">      (2-C) Under <a href="/doc/855593/" id="a_200">Section 42(1)</a> the empowered officer if has
a  prior  information  given  by  any  person,	that  should
necessarily  be taken down in writing.	But if he has reason
to  believe  from  personal knowledge  that  offences  under
Chapter	 IV  have  been	 committed or  materials  which	 may
furnish	  evidence  of	commission  of	such  offences	 are
concealed  in any building etc.	 he may carry out the arrest
or  search without a warrant between sunrise and sunset	 and
this  provision	 does not mandate that he should record	 his
reasons	 of belief.  But under the proviso to <a href="/doc/855593/" id="a_201">Section  42(1)</a>
if  such officer has to carry out such search between sunset
and sunrise, he must record the grounds of his belief.
</p>
<p id="p_64">      To  this	extent	these provisions are  mandatory	 and
contravention  of the same would affect the prosecution case
and vitiate the trial.
</p>
<p id="p_65">      (3)  Under  <a href="/doc/1158106/" id="a_202">Section 42(2)</a> such empowered	officer	 who
takes down any information in writing or records the grounds
under  proviso to <a href="/doc/855593/" id="a_203">Section 42(1)</a> should forthwith send a copy
thereof	 to  his immediate official superior.  If  there  is
total  non-compliance of this provision the same affects the
prosecution  case.  To that extent it is mandatory.  But  if
there  is delay whether it was undue or whether the same has
been  explained	 or not, will be a question of fact in	each
case.
</p>
<p id="p_66">      (4-A) If a police officer, even if he happens to be an
empowered  officer  while  effecting an arrest	or  search
during	normal investigation into offences purely under	 the
provisions  of	<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_204">CrPC</a>  fails  to	 strictly  comply  with	 the
provisions  of	<a href="/doc/1137396/" id="a_205">Sections  100</a>  and <a href="/doc/996365/" id="a_206">165</a>	CrPC  including	 the
requirement  to	 record	 reasons, such	failure	 would	only
amount to an irregularity.
</p>
<p id="p_67">      (4-B) If an empowered officer or an authorised officer
under  <a href="/doc/1223622/" id="a_207">Section	41(2)</a>  of the Act carries out a	 search,  he
would  be  doing  so  under the provisions  of	<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_208">CrPC</a>  namely
<a href="/doc/1137396/" id="a_209">Sections  100</a>  and  <a href="/doc/996365/" id="a_210">165</a>	 CrPC  and if  there  is  no  strict
compliance  with  the  provisions of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_211">CrPC</a> then	such  search
would not per se be illegal and would not vitiate the trial.
</p>
<p id="p_68">      The  effect of such failure has to be borne in mind by
the  courts while appreciating the evidence in the facts and
circumstances of each case.
</p>
<p id="p_69">      (5)  On  prior  information the empowered	 officer  or
authorised  officer while acting under <a href="/doc/1223622/" id="a_212">Sections 41(2)</a> or  42
should	comply with the provisions of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_213">Section 50</a> before	 the
search	of  the	 person is made and such  person  should  be
informed that if he so requires, he shall be produced before
a  Gazetted Officer or a Magistrate as provided	 thereunder.
It  is obligatory on the part of such officer to inform	 the
person	to be searched.	 Failure to inform the person to  be
searched and if such person so requires, failure to take him
to  the Gazetted Officer or the Magistrate, would amount  to
non-compliance	of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_214">Section 50</a> which is mandatory and thus it
would  affect  the prosecution case and vitiate	 the  trial.
After being so informed whether such person opted for such a
course or not would be a question of fact.  (Emphasis ours)

      (6)  The	provisions of <a href="/doc/1294540/" id="a_215">Sections 52</a> and <a href="/doc/669884/" id="a_216">57</a> which	deal
with  the  steps  to be taken by the officers  after  making
arrest	or seizure under <a href="/doc/1439062/" id="a_217">Sections 41</a> to <a href="/doc/109977/" id="a_218">44</a> are by themselves
not  mandatory.	 If there is non-compliance or if there	 are
lapses	like delay etc.	 then the same has to be examined to
see whether any prejudice has been caused to the accused and
such  failure  will  have a bearing on the  appreciation  of
evidence regarding arrest or seizure as well as on merits of
the case.
</p>
<p id="p_70">      A	 three-Judge  Bench  in <a href="/doc/893066/" id="a_219">Saiyad	Mohd.	Saiyad	Umar
Saiyad	and others v.  State of Gujarat</a> (supra), upheld	 the
view  taken  in Balbir Singhs case (supra) on the point	 of
duty  of  the empowered officer to inform the suspect  about
his  right  to	be searched before a Gazetted Officer  or  a
Magistrate.   It considered the provisions of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_220">Section 50</a> and
opined	:  8.  We are unable to share the High Courts view
that in cases under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_221">NDPS Act</a> it is the duty of the court
to  raise a presumption, when the officer concerned has	 not
deposed	 that  he  had followed the  procedure	mandated  by
<a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_222">Section	 50</a>, that he had in fact done so.  When the  officer
concerned has not deposed that he had followed the procedure
mandated by <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_223">Section 50</a>, the court is duty- bound to conclude
that  the accused had not had the benefit of the  protection
that <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_224">Section 50</a> affords;  that, therefore, his possession of
articles  which	 are  illicit  under the  <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_225">NDPS	Act</a>  is	 not
established;	that  the  precondition	  for	his   having
satisfactorily	accounted  for such possession has not	been
met;  and to acquit the accused." (Emphasis ours)

      <a href="/doc/190560007/" id="a_226">In  State of Himachal Pradesh v.	Shri Pirthi Chand  &amp;
Anr</a>.,  (supra),	 the  Bench agreed with the view  in  Balbir
Singhs case regarding the duty to inform the suspect of his
right  as  emanating from <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_227">Section 50</a> of the NDPS  Act.	 The
Court opined :	Compliance of the safeguards in <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_228">Section 50</a>
is  mandatory  obliging the officer concerned to inform	 the
person	to  be searched of his right to demand	that  search
could  be conducted in the presence of a Gazetted Officer or
a  Magistrate.	The possession of illicit articles has to be
satisfactorily	established  before the court.	The  officer
who  conducts search must state in his evidence that he	 had
informed  the  accused of his right to demand, while  he  is
searched,  in  the  presence  of a  Gazetted  Officer  or  a
Magistrate and that the accused had not chosen to so demand.
If  no	evidence  to that effect is given,  the	 court	must
presume	 that  the person searched was not informed  of	 the
protection  the law gives him and must find that  possession
of  illicit  articles was not established.  The	 presumption
under <a href="/doc/1004075/" id="a_229">Article 114</a> Illustration (e) of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_230">Evidence Act</a>, that
the  official  duty was properly performed, therefore,	does
not apply...
</p>
<p id="p_71">      <a href="/doc/1556629/" id="a_231">In  State	 of Punjab v.  Labh Singh</a>, (supra) again  it
was  reiterated	 that the accused has been provided  with  a
protection  of being informed of his right to be searched in
presence  of a Gazetted Officer or a Magistrate and  failure
to  give an opportunity to the concerned person to avail  of
the   protection   would  render    the	  prosecution	case
unsustainable.	 <a href="/doc/212201/" id="a_232">In  State  of	Punjab v.   Jasbir  Singh  &amp;
others</a>,	 (1996)	 1  SCC	 288,  it  was	opined	:    Having
considered  the	 evidence we find it difficult to set  aside
the  order of acquittal recorded by the Additional  Sessions
Judge.	 Though	 the offence involved is of  a	considerable
magnitude of 70 bags containing 34 kgs.	 Of poppy husk, each
without	 any  permit/licence, this Court is  constrained  to
confirm	 the  acquittal for the reasons that  the  mandatory
requirements   of   <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_233">Section  50</a>	 of   Narcotic	 Drugs	 and
<a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_234">Psychotropic  Substances  Act</a>,	1985 has not  been  complied
with.  Protection given by <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_235">Section 50</a> is a valuable right to
the   offender	and  compliance	  thereof  intended  to	  be
mandatory.   In case the police officers had prior knowledge
that  illegal transport of the contraband is in movement and
persons	 are in unlawful possession and intends to intercept
it,   conduct  search  and   consequentially  to  seize	 the
contraband, they are required to inform the offender that he
has  the  right	 that the search will be  conducted  in	 the
presence  of a gazetted officer or a Magistrate.  Thereafter
on their agreeing to be searched by the police officers, the
search	and  seizure of the contraband from  their  unlawful
possession  would  become  legal and  valid.   However,	 the
evidence  collected in breach of mandatory requirement	does
not  become  inadmissible.  It is settled law that  evidence
collected during investigation in violation of the statutory
provisions does not become inadmissible and the trial on the
basis  thereof	does not get vitiated.	Each case is  to  be
considered  on	its own backdrop. (Emphasis added)  <a href="/doc/1293291/" id="a_236">In	Ali
Mustaffa  Abdul	 Rahman Moosa v.  State of Kerala</a>,  (supra),
two-Judge Bench of this Court, (to which one of us (CJI) was
a  party) it had been found that the appellant had not	been
given  any choice as to whether he desired to be searched in
the  presence  of  a  Gazetted Officer or  a  Magistrate  as
envisaged  under  <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_237">Section 50</a> of the NDPS Act.  The  argument
raised in that case to the effect that <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_238">Section 50</a> of the Act
could  not  be	said  to  have	been  violated	because	 the
appellant  did not require to have himself searched before
a  Gazetted  Officer or a Magistrate was rejected  following
the law laid down in Balbir Singhs case (supra).  The Court
opined	that to enable the concerned person to require	that
his  search  be	 carried out in the presence of	 a  Gazetted
Officer	 or a Magistrate makes, it is obligatory on the part
of the empowered officer to inform the concerned person that
he  has a right to require his search to be conducted in the
presence  of  a Gazetted Officer or a Magistrate.   <a href="/doc/344107/" id="a_239">Mohinder
Kumar	v.   State,  Panaji,  Goa</a>,   (1998)  8	SCC  655,  a
three-Judge  Bench (to which one of us, Sujata V.   Manohar,
J.   was a party) once again considered the requirements  of
<a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_240">Sections  42</a>  and  <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_241">50</a> of the Act.  In that case	 the  police
officer	 accidentally  reached the house while	on  patrol
duty  and  had	it not been for the conduct of	the  accused
persons in trying to run into the house on seeing the police
party,	he would perhaps not have had any occasion to  enter
the  house  and effect search.	But when the conduct of	 the
accused	 persons raised a suspicion, he went into the  house
and  effected  the search, seized the illicit  material	 and
caused	the arrest.  The Court opined that in the facts	 and
circumstances  of  the case, when the Investigating  Officer
accidentally  stumbled	upon  the   offending  articles	 and
himself	 not being the empowered officer, then on coming  to
know  that the accused persons were in possession of illicit
articles,  then	 from  that stage onwards he  was  under  an
obligation  to	proceed	 further  in   the  matter  only  in
accordance  with the provisions of the Act.  On facts it was
found  that  the  Investigating Officer did not	 record	 the
grounds	 of  his belief at any stage of	 the  investigation,
subsequent to his realising that the accused persons were in
possession of charas and since he had made no record, he did
not  forward  a copy of the grounds to his superior  officer
nor  did he comply with the provisions of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_242">Section 50</a> of	 the
Act, inasmuch as he did not inform the person to be searched
that  if he required, his search could be conducted before a
Gazetted  Officer  or a Magistrate, the Bench held that	 for
failure to comply with the provisions of <a href="/doc/1841395/" id="a_243">Sections 42</a> and <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_244">50</a>,
the  accused  was  entitled  to an order  of  acquittal	 and
consequently  the  appeal  was	allowed	 and  the  order  of
conviction  and sentence against the accused was set  aside.
It  would,  thus, be seen that none of the decisions of	 the
Supreme	 Court after Balbir Singhs case have departed  from
that opinion.  At least none has been brought to our notice.
There  is, thus, unanimity of judicial pronouncements to the
effect that it is an obligation of the empowered officer and
his  duty  before conducting the search of the person  of  a
suspect,  on  the basis of prior information, to inform	 the
suspect	 that  he has the right to require his search  being
conducted  in  the  presence  of a  Gazetted  Officer  or  a
Magistrate  and that the failure to so inform the suspect of
his  right,  would  render the search  illegal	because	 the
suspect	 would not be able to avail of the protection  which
is  inbuilt  in	 <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_245">Section 50</a>.  Similarly,  if  the  concerned
person	requires,  on  being so informed  by  the  empowered
officer	 or  otherwise, that his search be conducted in	 the
presence  of  a	 Gazetted  Officer   or	 a  Magistrate,	 the
empowered  officer  is obliged to do so and failure  on	 his
part  to do so would also render the search illegal and	 the
conviction  and sentence of the accused bad.  To be searched
before a Gazetted Officer or a Magistrate, if the suspect so
requires,   is	an  extremely	valuable  right	 which	 the
legislature  has given to the concerned person having regard
to  the grave consequences that may entail the possession of
illicit	 articles  under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_246">NDPS Act</a>.	It appears  to	have
been incorporated in the Act keeping in view the severity of
the  punishment.  The rationale behind the provision is even
otherwise manifest.  The search before a Gazetted Officer or
a  Magistrate  would  impart   much  more  authenticity	 and
creditworthiness  to the search and seizure proceeding.	  It
would  also  verily strengthen the prosecution case.   There
is,  thus,  no justification for the empowered officer,	 who
goes  to search the person, on prior information, to  effect
the  search,  of not informing the concerned person  of	 the
existence of his right to have his search conducted before a
Gazetted  Officer  or a Magistrate, so as to enable  him  to
avail  of that right.  It is, however, not necessary to give
the information to the person to be searched about his right
in  writing.   It  is  sufficient  if  such  information  is
communicated  to  the concerned person orally and as far  as
possible in the presence of some independent and respectable
persons	 witnessing the arrest and search.  The	 prosecution
must,  however,	 at the trial, establish that the  empowered
officer had conveyed the information to the concerned person
of  his	 right	of  being searched in the  presence  of	 the
Magistrate  or	a  Gazetted  Officer, at  the  time  of	 the
intended  search.  Courts have to be satisfied at the  trial
of  the	 case  about due compliance  with  the	requirements
provided  in <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_247">Section 50</a>.  No presumption under <a href="/doc/1297682/" id="a_248">Section 54</a> of
the  Act  can  be  raised against  an  accused,	 unless	 the
prosecution establishes it to the satisfaction of the court,
that the requirements of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_249">Section 50</a> were duly complied with.
The  safeguard or protection to be searched in presence of a
Gazetted  Officer  or a Magistrate has been incorporated  in
<a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_250">Section	 50</a> to ensure that persons are only searched with  a
good  cause  and  also with a view to maintain	veracity  of
evidence  derived from such search.  We have already noticed
that severe punishments have been provided under the Act for
mere  possession  of Illicit Drugs and Narcotic	 Substances.
Personal  search,  more particularly for offences under	 the
<a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_251">NDPS  Act</a>,  are	 critical  means of  obtaining	evidence  of
possession   and  it  is,   therefore,	necessary  that	 the
safeguards  provided  in <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_252">Section 50</a> of the Act are  observed
scrupulously.	The duty to inform the suspect of his  right
to  be	searched  in  presence of a Gazetted  Officer  or  a
Magistrate   is	 a  necessary	sequence  for  enabling	 the
concerned  person  to exercise that right under	 <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_253">Section  50</a>
because after <a href="/doc/1766147/" id="a_254">Maneka Gandhi v.	Union of India</a>, (1978) 1 SCC
248,  it is no longer permissible to contend that the  right
to  personal liberty can be curtailed even temporarily, by a
procedure  which is not reasonable, fair and just and when
a statute itself provides for a just procedure, it must be
honoured.   Conducting	a search under <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_255">Section	50</a>,  without
intimating to the suspect that he has a right to be searched
before	a  Gazetted  Officer  or   a  Magistrate,  would  be
violative  of the reasonable, fair and just procedure  and
the  safeguard	contained  in <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_256">Section 50</a> would	be  rendered
illusory,  otiose  and	meaningless.	Procedure  based  on
systematic  and	 unconscionable	 violation  of	law  by	 the
officials  responsible for the enforcement of law, cannot be
considered  to be fair, just or reasonable procedure.	We
are not persuaded to agree that reading into <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_257">Section 50</a>, the
existence of a duty on the part of the empowered officer, to
intimate to the suspect, about the existence of his right to
be  searched  in  presence  of	a  Gazetted  Officer  or   a
Magistrate,  if	 he so requires, would place any premium  on
ignorance  of  law.   The argument loses sight	of  a  clear
distinction  between  ignorance of the law and ignorance  of
the  right  to	a  reasonable, fair  and  just	procedure.
Requirement  to	 inform	 has been read in by this  Court  in
other	circumstances  also,  where   the  statute  did	 not
explicitly   provide   for  such   a   requirement.    While
considering  the scope of <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_258">Article 22(5)</a> of the	Constitution
of  India  and various other provisions of <a href="/doc/135830564/" id="a_259">COFEPOSA Act</a>	 and
the  <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_260">NDPS  Act</a> as amended in 1988, a Constitution  Bench  of
this  Court in <a href="/doc/564452/" id="a_261">Kamelesh Kumar Ishwardas Patel vs.  Union  of
India  &amp; Ors</a>., (1995) 4 SCC 51, concluded :  <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_262">Article  22(5)</a>
must,  therefore,  be  construed  to mean  that	 the  person
detained  has  a right to make a representation against	 the
order  of  detention  which  can be made  not  only  to	 the
Advisory  Board	 but also to the detaining authority,  i.e.,
the  authority	that has made the order of detention or	 the
order  for continuance of such detention, which is competent
to  give immediate relief by revoking the said order as well
as  to	any other authority which is competent under law  to
revoke	the  order for detention and thereby give relief  to
the  person  detained.	The right to make  a  representation
carries	  within  it  a	  corresponding	 obligation  on	 the
authority making the order of detention to inform the person
detained  of his right to make a representation against	 the
order  of  detention to the authorities who are required  to
consider such a representation. (Emphasis ours)

      This  Court cannot over-look the context in which	 the
<a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_263">NDPS  Act</a> operates and particularly the factor of widespread
illiteracy  among persons subject to investigation for	drug
offences.   It	must  be  borne in  mind  that	severer	 the
punishment, greater has to be the care taken to see that all
the  safeguards	 provided  in  a  statute  are	scrupulously
followed.   We are not able to find any reason as to why the
empowered  officer  should  shirk   from  affording  a	real
opportunity to the suspect, by intimating to him that he has
a right "that if he requires" to be searched in the presence
of  a Gazetted Officer or a Magistrate, he shall be searched
only  in  that manner.	As already observed  the  compliance
with  the procedural safeguards contained in <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_264">Section 50</a>	 are
intended to serve dual purpose	to protect a person against
false  accusation  and	frivolous charges as  also  to	lend
creditibility  to  the search and seizure conducted  by	 the
empowered  officer.   The argument that keeping in view	 the
growing	 drug  menace, an insistence on compliance with	 all
the  safeguards	 contained in <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_265">Section 50</a> may result in	more
acquittals  does not appeal to us.  If the empowered officer
fails  to comply with the requirements of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_266">Section 50</a> and  an
order  or  acquittal  is  recorded   on	 that  ground,	 the
prosecution  must  thank itself for its lapses.	  Indeed  in
every  case  the  end result is important but the  means  to
achieve	 it  must remain above board.  The remedy cannot  be
worse  than the disease itself.	 The legitimacy of  judicial
process may come under cloud if the court is seen to condone
acts  of  lawlessness conducted by the investigating  agency
during	search operations and may also undermine respect for
law  and may have the effect of unconscionably	compromising
the  administration  of justice.  That cannot be  permitted.
<a href="/doc/501198/" id="a_267">In D.K.	 Basu v.  State of West Bengal</a>, (1997) 1 SCC 416, it
was  opined :  We are conscious of the fact that the police
in  India  have	 to perform a difficult and  delicate  task,
particularly  in  view	of the deteriorating law  and  order
situation,   communal  riots,	political  turmoil,  student
unrest,	  terrorist  activities,  and	among	others	 the
increasing   number  of	 underworld   and  armed  gangs	 and
criminals.    Many  hardcore   criminals  like	 extremists,
terrorists,  drug  peddlers,  smugglers who  have  organised
gangs,	have taken strong roots in the society.	 It is being
said   in  certain  quarters  that   with  more	  and	more
liberalisation	and  enforcement of fundamental	 rights,  it
would  lead  to	 difficulties  in the  detection  of  crimes
committed  by such categories of hardened criminals by	soft
peddling  interrogation.  It is felt in those quarters	that
if  we	lay  too  much of emphasis on  protection  of  their
fundamental  rights and human rights, such criminals may  go
scot-free   without   exposing	any   element  or  iota	  of
criminality  with the result, the crime would go  unpunished
and  in the ultimate analysis the society would suffer.	 The
concern	 is  genuine and the problem is real.  To deal	with
such  a situation, a balanced approach is needed to meet the
ends  of  justice.  This is all the more so, in view of	 the
expectation  of	 the society that police must deal with	 the
criminals  in an efficient and effective manner and bring to
book  those who are involved in the crime.  The cure cannot,
however, be worst than the disease itself.

<p id="p_72">      (Emphasis ours)

      In  D.K.	Basus case (supra), the Court also  noticed
the  response  of the Supreme Court of the United States  of
America	 to such an argument in Miranda v.  Arizona, 384  US
436  :	16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966), wherein that Court had said :
The  Latin  maxim salus populi suprema lex (the safety	of
the  people is the supreme law) and salus republicae suprema
lex (safety of the State is the supreme law) coexist and are
not  only important and relevant but lie at the heart of the
doctrine  that	the welfare of an individual must  yield  to
that  of  the community.  The action of the State,  however,
must be right, just and fair (Emphasis supplied)

      There  is	 indeed,  a  need to  protect  society	from
criminals.   The  societal intent in safety will  suffer  if
persons	 who commit crimes are let off because the  evidence
against	 them is to be treated as if it does not exist.	 The
answer,	 therefore,  is that the investigating	agency	must
follow	 the   procedure  as   envisaged  by   the   statute
scrupulously  and the failure to do so must be viewed by the
higher	authorities  seriously inviting action	against	 the
concerned  official  so that the laxity on the part  of	 the
investigating  authority  is curbed.  However, the  question
whether	 the  provisions  of  <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_268">Section 50</a>  are  mandatory  or
directory   and	 if  mandatory	to   what  extent  and	 the
consequences  of  non-compliance with it does  not  strictly
speaking  arise	 in the context in which the protection	 has
been  incorporated  in	<a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_269">Section 50</a> for the  benefit  of	 the
person	 intended  to  be   searched.	Therefore,   without
expressing  any	 opinion  as to whether	 the  provisions  of
<a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_270">Section	 50</a>  are mandatory or not, but bearing in  mind	 the
purpose	 for which the safeguard has been made, we hold that
the  provisions of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_271">Section 50</a> of the Act implicitly make  it
imperative   and  obligatory  and  cast	  a  duty   on	 the
Investigating  Officer	(empowered officer) to	ensure	that
search of the concerned person (suspect) is conducted in the
manner	prescribed  by	<a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_272">Section	 50</a>, by	 intimating  to	 the
concerned  person about the existence of his right, that  if
he  so	requires,  he shall be searched	 before	 a  Gazetted
Officer	 or a Magistrate and in case he so opts, failure  to
conduct	  his	search	before	a  Gazetted  Officer  or   a
Magistrate,  would cause prejudice to an accused and  render
the  recovery of the illicit article suspect and vitiate the
conviction  and sentence of an accused, where the conviction
has been recorded only on the basis of the possession of the
illicit	 article,  recovered  during a search  conducted  in
violation  of the provisions of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_273">Section 50</a> of the Act.	 The
omission  may not vitiate the trial as such, but because  of
the  inherent prejudice which would be caused to an  accused
by  the	 omission  to be informed of the  existence  of	 his
right,	 it  would  render   his  conviction  and   sentence
unsustainable.	The protection provided in the section to an
accused	 to  be intimated that he has the right to have	 his
personal  search  conducted before a Gazetted Officer  or  a
Magistrate,   if   he  so   requires,  is   sacrosanct	 and
indefeasible   it cannot be disregarded by the	prosecution
except	at  its own peril.  The question whether or not	 the
safeguards  provided in <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_274">Section 50</a> were observed would have,
however,  to be determined by the court on the basis of	 the
evidence led at the trial and the finding on that issue, one
way  or the other, would be relevant for recording an  order
of  conviction or acquittal.  Without giving an	 opportunity
to  the	 prosecution  to  establish at the  trial  that	 the
provisions  of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_275">Section 50</a>, and particularly, the  safeguards
provided in that section were complied with, it would not be
advisable  to cut short a criminal trial.  The next question
which  arises  for  our consideration  is  whether  evidence
collected  in a search conducted in violation of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_276">Section 50</a>,
is  admissible	in  evidence?  This question arises  in	 the
context	 of the judgment of the Constitution Bench in Pooran
Mals  case (supra).  A submission was made in Ali  Mustaffa
Abdul Rahman Moosas case (supra) before the Bench on behalf
of  the State of Kerala to reconsider the judgment in Balbir
Singhs case in view of the judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/558753/" id="a_277">Pooran
Mal  v.	  The  Director of Inspection  (Investigation),	 New
Delhi  and others</a>.  It was urged in Ali Mustaffa's case that
even  if search and seizure of the contraband was held to be
illegal having been conducted in violation of the provisions
of  <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_278">Section  50</a>, it could not affect the conviction  because
the  recovered	articles could still be used as	 "admissible
evidence"  under  the  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_279">Evidence Act</a>  to	 establish  unlawful
possession  of	the contraband on the concerned person	from
whom  it  was  recovered  during that  search.	 This  Court
repelled  that	contention  and held that  the	judgment  in
Pooran	Mals  case (supra) could not be read to	 have  laid
down  that  a  contraband seized as a result of	 an  illegal
search or seizure could still be used as admissible evidence
of unlawful possession of the contraband on the person from
whom  the contraband had allegedly been seized in an illegal
manner.	  The Bench in Ali Mustaffas case (supra) observed
:   The	 last  submission of the learned  counsel  for	the
respondents  is	 that even if the search and seizure of	 the
contraband  are	 held  to  be illegal and  contrary  to	 the
provisions of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_280">Section 50</a> of the NDPS Act, it would still not
affect	the conviction because the seized articles could  be
used  as  evidence of unlawful possession of a	contraband.
Reliance  for  this submission is placed on the judgment  of
this Court in <a href="/doc/558753/" id="a_281">Pooran Mal v.  Director of Inspection</a>.  We are
afraid	the  submission	 is misconceived  and  the  reliance
placed	on the said judgment is misplaced.  The judgment  in
Pooran	Mal case only lays down that the evidence  collected
as  a result of illegal search or seizure, could be used  as
evidence  in proceedings against the party under the  <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_282">Income
Tax  Act</a>.   The judgment cannot be interpreted to  lay	down
that  a	 contraband seized as a result of illegal search  or
seizure,  can  be used to fasten that liability of  unlawful
possession  of	the contraband on the person from  whom	 the
contraband  had allegedly been seized in an illegal  manner.
Unlawful  possession of the contraband is the sine qua non
for  conviction under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_283">NDPS Act</a> and that factor has to be
established  by	 the prosecution beyond a reasonable  doubt.
Indeed	the seized contraband is evidence but in the absence
of  proof  of possession of the same, an accused  cannot  be
held guilty under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_284">NDPS Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_73">      However,	a  later two-Judge Bench in  Pirthi  Chands
case  (supra)  relying	upon   Pooran  Mals  case  (supra),
observed :  The evidence collected in a search in violation
of  law	 does not become inadmissible in evidence under	 the
<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_285">Evidence  Act</a>.	 The  consequence  would  be  that  evidence
discovered  would  be  to prove unlawful possession  of	 the
contraband  under  the Act.  It is founded in  Panchnama  to
seize	the   contraband   from	  the  possession   of	 the
suspect/accused.   Though the search may be illegal but	 the
evidence  collected, i.e., Panchnama etc., nonetheless would
be  admissible	at  the	 trial.	  At  the  stage  of  filing
charge-sheet it cannot be said that there is no evidence and
the  Magistrate	 or the Sessions Judge would  be  committing
illegality  to	discharge  the accused on  the	ground	that
<a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_286">Section	 50</a> or other provisions have not been complied with.
At  the	 trial	an  opportunity would be  available  to	 the
prosecution  to	 prove	that  the search  was  conducted  in
accordance  with  law.	 Even if search is found  to  be  in
violation  of  law,  what  weight should  be  given  to	 the
evidence collected is yet another question to be gone into
(Emphasis supplied)

      This  view was reiterated in Jasbir Singhs case also.
It  appears that the earlier judgment in Ali Mustaffas case
was not brought to the notice of their Lordships in both the
above  cases.	Let  us, therefore, first examine  the	fact
situation  and the law as laid down in Pooran Mals case and
the  question  of its applicability to cases arising out  of
offences under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_287">NDPS Act</a>, based only on proof of unlawful
possession of an illicit drug or a psychotropic substance on
the person of an accused, where the illicit article only was
seized	during	the  search  conducted	 in  breach  of	 the
provisions  of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_288">Section 50</a>.  In Pooran Mals case, the relief
claimed	 by the main appellant in his case was in respect of
action	taken under <a href="/doc/1277726/" id="a_289">Section 132</a> of the Income Tax Act,	1961
by  way	 of  search and seizure of certain premises  on	 the
ground	that  the authorisation for the search as  also	 the
search	and seizure of the materials were illegal.  In	that
case  articles	consisting  of account books  and  documents
besides	 some cash, jewelry and other valuables were  seized
by  the	 Income Tax Authorities purporting to act under	 the
authorisation  of a search and seizure issued under  <a href="/doc/1277726/" id="a_290">Section
132</a>  of	 the Income Tax Act.  The Constitution	Bench  dealt
both	with   the    challenge	   on	constitutional	 and
non-constitutional  grounds to the search and seizure.	 The
Court  opined  that the power of search and seizure  in	 any
system of jurisprudence is an overriding power of the State
for  the  protection  of social security and that  power  is
necessarily  regulated by law.	The Court then noticed	the
safeguards provided in <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_291">Section 132</a> of the Act and observed :
We  are, therefore, to see what are the inbuilt	 safeguards
in  <a href="/doc/1277726/" id="a_292">Section 132</a> of the Income-tax Act.	In the first  place,
it  must be noted that the power to order search and seizure
is  vested  in	the  highest  officers	of  the	 department.
Secondly  the  exercise	 of  this power can  only  follow  a
reasonable  belief  entertained by such officer that any  of
the three conditions mentioned in <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_293">Section 132(1)(a)</a>, (b) and
</p><p id="p_74">(c)  exists.   In this connection it may be further  pointed
out  that  under sub-rule (2) of Rule 112, the	Director  of
Inspection  or the Commissioner, as the case may be, has  to
record his reasons before the authorisation is issued to the
officers  mentioned  in	 sub-section   (1).   Thirdly,	 the
authorisation  for  the	 search cannot be in favour  of	 any
officer	 below the rank of an Income-tax Officer.  Fourthly,
the authorisation is for specific purposes enumerated in (i)
to  (v) in sub-section (1) all of which are strictly limited
to  the object of the search.  Fifthly when money,  bullion,
etc.  is seized the Income- tax Officer is to make a summary
enquiry	 with a view to determine how much of what is seized
will be retained by him to cover the estimated tax liability
and how much will have to be returned forthwith.  The object
of  the	 enquiry  under	 sub-section (5) is  to	 reduce	 the
inconvenience  to  the assessee as much as possible so	that
within	a  reasonable  time  what is estimated	due  to	 the
Government  may	 be retained and what should be returned  to
the  assessee may be immediately returned to him.  Even with
regard	to the books of account and documents, seized, their
return	is  guaranteed	after  a reasonable  time.   In	 the
meantime  the  person from whose custody they are seized  is
permitted  to make copies and take extracts.  Sixthly, where
money,	bullion, etc.  is seized, it can also be immediately
returned  to the person concerned after he makes appropriate
provision  for	the payment of the estimated tax dues  under
sub-section  (5) and lastly, and this is most important, the
provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_294"> of the Criminal Procedure Code</a> relating to search
and  seizure  apply, as far as they may be, to all  searches
and  seizures under <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_295">Section 132</a>.  Rule 112 provides for	 the
actual	search and seizure being made after observing normal
decencies  of  behaviour.   The	 person	 in  charge  of	 the
premises searched is immediately given a copy of the list of
articles  seized.  One copy is forwarded to the	 authorising
officer.   Provision  for the safe custody of  the  articles
after seizure is also made in Rule 112.	 In our opinion, the
safeguards  are adequate to render the provisions of  search
and  seizure as less onerous and restrictive as is  possible
under	the  circumstances.    The  provisions,	  therefore,
relating  to search and seizure in <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_296">Section 132</a> and Rule	 112
cannot be regarded as violative of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_297">Article 19(f)</a> and <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_298">(g).</a>
</p>
<p id="p_75">      (Emphasis	 supplied) Dealing with the effect of search
and seizure conducted in breach of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1277726/" id="a_299">Section
132</a> of the Income Tax Act,

      the  Court opined :  In that view, even assuming,	 as
was done by the High Court, that the search and seizure were
in  contravention  of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1277726/" id="a_300">Section 132</a>  of	 the
Income-tax  Act, still the material seized was liable to  be
used  subject  to  law	before	the  Income-tax	 authorities
against	 the  person from whose custody it was	seized	and,
therefore,  no Writ of Prohibition in restraint of such	 use
could be granted.  It must be, therefore, held that the High
Court  was right in dismissing the two writ petitions.	 The
appeals must also fail and are dismissed with costs.
</p>
<p id="p_76">      Now,  if	the  <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_301">Evidence  Act</a>, 1872 which	is  a  law
consolidating, defining and amending the law of evidence, no
provision   of	 which	is   challenged	 as  violating	 the
Constitution	permits	 relevancy  as	the  only  test	 of
admissibility  of  evidence (See <a href="/doc/1052372/" id="a_302">Section 5</a> of the Act)	and,
secondly,  that	 Act or any other similar law in force	does
not  exclude  relevant	evidence on the ground that  it	 was
obtained  under	 an  illegal search or seizure, it  will  be
wrong  to invoke the supposed spirit of our Constitution for
excluding such evidence

      It,  therefore, follows that neither by invoking the
spirit of our Constitution nor by a strained construction of
any of the fundamental rights can we spell out the exclusion
of  evidence  obtained	on  an	illegal	 search.  (Emphasis
supplied)

      On  facts,  the Court in Pooran Mals  case,  however,
found  :   On the whole, therefore, we are not inclined	 to
hold  that the search and seizure in this writ petition	 was
vitiated by any illegality.
</p>
<p id="p_77">      Similarly,  in the other writ petitions dealt with  in
Pooran	Mals  case, the Court opined :	.The  search  and
seizure,  therefore,  impugned	in   this  illega  l.  writ
petition  cannot  be regarded as ( Emphasis supplied  )	 The
Judgement  in Pooran Mals case (supra) has to be considered
in the context in which it was rendered.  It is well-settled
proposition  of law that a decision is an authority for what
it  decides and not that everything said therein constitutes
a   precedent.	 The  courts  are   obliged  to	 employ	  an
intelligent technique in the use of precedents bearing it in
mind  that a decision of the court takes its colour from the
questions involved in the case in which it was rendered.  <a href="/doc/1101298/" id="a_303">In
C.I.T.	 v.   Sun Engineering Works (P) Ltd</a>., (1992)  4	 SCC
363,  this  Court  rightly pointed out :   It  is  neither
desirable  nor permissible to pick out a word or a  sentence
from  the judgment of this Court, divorced from the  context
of  the question under consideration and treat it to be	 the
complete law declared by this Court.  The judgment must be
read  as a whole and the observations from the judgment have
to  be	considered in the light of the questions which	were
before	this  Court.   A decision of this  Court  takes	 its
colour	from the questions involved in the case in which  it
is rendered and while applying the decision to a later case,
the  courts  must  carefully  try   to	ascertain  the	true
principle laid down by the decision of this Court and not to
pick out words or sentences from the judgment, divorced from
the  context  of the questions under consideration  by	this
Court, to support their reasonings.

<p id="p_78">      (Emphasis supplied)

      The  judgment in Pooran Mals case (supra), therefore,
cannot	be  understood	to have laid down  that	 an  illicit
article	 seized	 during	 the  search  of  person,  on  prior
information,  conducted	 in violation of the  provisions  of
<a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_304">Section	 50</a>  of the Act can be used as evidence of  unlawful
possession  of	the illicit article on the person from	whom
that  contraband  had been seized during an illegal  search.
Apart from the position that in Pooran Mals case, on facts,
it  was	 found that the search and seizure conducted in	 the
cases  under consideration in that case were not vitiated by
any  illegality, the import of that judgment, in the present
context,  can  only  be to the effect that  material  seized
during search and seizure, conducted in contravention of the
provisions  of	<a href="/doc/1277726/" id="a_305">Section 132</a> of the Income Tax Act cannot  be
restrained  from  being	 used, subject to  law,	 before	 the
Income	Tax  Authorities in other legal proceedings  against
the  persons, from whose custody that material was seized by
issuance  of  a writ of prohibition.  It was not the  seized
material,  in  Pooran  Mals  case, which  by  itself  could
attract	 any  penal  action against the assessee.   What  is
implicit  from the judgment in Pooran Mals case is that the
seized	material  could be used in other  legal	 proceedings
against an assessee, before the Income Tax authorities under
the  <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_306">Income  Tax Act</a>, dealing with escaped income.   It	 is,
therefore,  not possible to hold that the judgment in Pooran
Mals case can be said to have laid down that the recovered
illicit article can be used as proof of unlawful possession
of  the	 contraband seized from the suspect as a  result  of
illegal	 search	 and seizure.  If Pooran Mals  judgment	 is
read  in  the manner in which it has been construed  in	 <a href="/doc/190560007/" id="a_307">The
State of Himachal Pradesh v.  Pirthi Chand and Anr</a>.  (though
that issue did not strictly speaking arise for consideration
in  that  case),  then	there would  remain  no	 distinction
between	 recovery  of  illicit drugs etc.  seized  during  a
search conducted "after" following the provisions of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_308">Section
50</a>  of	the  NDPS  Act and a seizure made  during  a  search
conducted  "in breach of" the provision of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_309">Section 50</a> of the
NDPS Act.  Prosecution cannot be permitted to take advantage
of its own wrong.  Conducting a fair trial for those who are
accused	 of  a	criminal offence is the cornerstone  of	 our
democratic  society.  A conviction resulting from an  unfair
trial  is contrary to our concept of justice.  Conducting  a
fair trial is both for the benefit of the society as well as
for  an accused and cannot be abandoned.  While	 considering
the  aspect  of	 fair  trial, the  nature  of  the  evidence
obtained  and the nature of the safeguard violated are	both
relevant factors.  Courts cannot allow admission of evidence
against	 an  accused, where the court is satisfied that	 the
evidence had been obtained by a conduct of which prosecution
ought  not to take advantage particularly when that  conduct
had  caused  prejudice	to the accused.	  If  after  careful
consideration  of the material on the record it is found  by
the court that the admission of evidence collected in search
conducted  in violation of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_310">Section 50</a> would render the trial
unfair	then  that  evidence must be excluded.	In  R.	 vs.
Collins	 :   1987  (1) SCR 265 the Supreme Court  of  Canada
speaking  through Lamer, J.  (as His Lordship, Chief Justice
of the Supreme Court of Canada then was) opined that the use
of  evidence collected in violation of the Charter rights of
an  accused  would  render a trial unfair and  the  evidence
inadmissible.	In the words of the Supreme Court of Canada:
The  situation	is  very different with	 respect  to  cases
where,	after  a  violation of the Charter, the	 accused  is
conscripted  against  himself through a confession or  other
evidence emanating from him.  The use of such evidence would
render	the trial unfair, for it did not exist prior to	 the
violation and it strikes at one of the fundamental tenets of
a fair trial. (Emphasis ours)

      The  opinion in Collins case has been relied upon	 by
the  majority  of  the	Supreme Court of Canada	 in  R.	  v.
Stillman,  [1997]  1  R.C.S.   607 also.   The	question  of
admissibility  of  evidence,  which may be relevant  to	 the
question in issue, has thus to be decided in the context and
the manner in which the evidence was collected and is sought
to be used.  In view of the provisions of Chapter IV of NDPS
Act,  mere unlawful possession of a contraband amounts to an
offence	 and  is punishable with rigorous  imprisonment	 for
terms  which shall not be less than 10 years but can  extend
to  20	years or 30 years in addition to a fine which  shall
not  be less than one lakh of rupees but which may extend to
two  lakhs  or	three  lakhs  of rupees.   On  a  charge  of
possession  of a dangerous drug or a psychotropic substance,
if  it is established that the accused had the contraband in
his  possession	 without  authority,  he  is  liable  to  be
punished.   "Unlawful  possession" of the contraband is	 the
sine qua non for recording conviction under the <a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_311">NDPS Act</a> and
the  most important ingredient of an offence under the	<a href="/doc/1727139/" id="a_312">NDPS
Act</a>.   Explaining  the concept of possession, in Bocking  v.
Roberts,  (1973)  3  All  E.R.	  962,	Lord  Widgery,	C.J.
observed  :   In  my judgment it is quite clear	 that  when
dealing	 with  a  charge of possession of a  dangerous	drug
without	 authority, the ordinary maxim of de minimis is	 not
to  be applied, in other words if it is clearly	 established
that  the  accused  had a dangerous drug in  his  possession
without authority, it is no answer to him to say :  oh, but
the quantity of the drug which I possessed was so small that
the  law  should take no account of it. The doctrine of	 de
minimis	 as  such in my judgment does not apply but, on	 the
other  hand,  since  the accused is possessing	a  dangerous
drug,  it is quite clear that the prosecution have to  prove
that there was some drug in the possession of the accused to
justify the charge ( Emphasis ours )

      In  R.  v.  Young, (1984) 2 All E.R.  164, it was held
that  if  an accused being in possession of  the  prohibited
substance  on  seeing the police party swallows the same  to
avoid  detection, he can be convicted for possession of	 the
prohibited  substance  and  not	  for  consumption  thereof.
Similarly, in Louis Beaver v.  Her Majesty The Queen, [1957]
S.C.R.	 531, the Supreme Court of Canada while dealing with
a  case	 relating to an offence of possession  of  forbidden
narcotic substance held that the element of knowledge formed
a  part	 of  the  ingredient   of  possession,	where	mere
possession of the forbidden substance amounts to an offence.
A  Constitution	 Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/1655328/" id="a_313">Sanjay Dutt v.	 The
State</a>  through C.B.I., Bombay (II), (1994) 5 SCC 410,  while
dealing	 with  Section	5 of the  Terrorist  and  Disruptive
Activities  (Prevention)  Act,	1987 (TADA), which  reads  :
<a href="/doc/74292223/" id="a_314">Section	 5</a>  Possession of certain unauthorised arms, etc.,
in  specified areas.   Where any person is in possession of
any  arms  and	ammunition specified in Columns 2 and  3  of
Category  I  or Category III (a) of Schedule I to  the	Arms
Rules,	 1962,	or  bombs,   dynamite  or  other   explosive
substances  unauthorisedly  in	a notified area,  he  shall,
notwithstanding	 anything contained in any other law for the
time  being in force, be punishable with imprisonment for  a
term  which shall not be less than five years but which	 may
extend	to imprisonment for life and shall also be liable to
fine.
</p>
<p id="p_79">      spelt  out  the ingredients of the offence created  by
Section	 5 of TADA and opined :	 The position which emerges
is this.  For constituting the offence made punishable under
Section	 5 of the TADA Act, the prosecution has to prove the
aforesaid  three  ingredients.	 Once  the  prosecution	 has
proved	unauthorised conscious possession of any of  the
specified  arms and ammunition etc.  in a notified area by
the  accused, the conviction would follow on the strength of
the  presumption unless the accused proves the non-existence
of  a fact essential to constitute any of the ingredients of
the  offence.  Undoubtedly, the accused can set up a defence
of  non-existence  of a fact which is an ingredient  of	 the
offence to be proved by the prosecution.
</p>
<p id="p_80">      (Emphasis ours)

      The  Constitution	 Bench in Sanjay Dutt's	 case,	thus
clearly	  held	 that  once   the  prosecution	has   proved
unauthorised  conscious	 possession of any of the  specified
arms and ammunition etc.  in a notified area by the accused,
the  offence  is complete and the conviction must follow  on
the  strength  of  the	statutory  presumption,	 unless	 the
accused	 proves	 the  non-existence of a fact  essential  to
constitute  any of the ingredient of that offence.   Indeed,
the  presumption, even though statutory in nature, was	held
to be rebuttable.  Thus, even if, it be assumed for the sake
of  argument that all the material seized during an  illegal
search,	 may  be  admissible as relevant evidence  in  other
proceedings,  the  illicit  drug or  psychotropic  substance
seized	in  an	illegal search cannot by itself be  used  as
proof  of unlawful conscious possession of the contraband by
the  accused.	An  illegal search cannot also	entitle	 the
prosecution  to raise a presumption under <a href="/doc/1297682/" id="a_315">Section 54</a> of	 the
Act  because presumption, is an inference of fact drawn from
the  facts  which are known as proved.	A presumption  under
<a href="/doc/1297682/" id="a_316">Section	 54</a>  of	 the  Act  can	only  be  raised  after	 the
prosecution has established that the accused was found to be
in  possession	of the contraband in a search  conducted  in
accordance  with the mandate of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_317">Section 50</a>.  We,  therefore,
hold  that  an illicit article seized from the person of  an
accused,  during  search  conducted  in	 violation  of	 the
safeguards  provided  in  <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_318">Section 50</a> of the Act,  cannot  by
itself	be used as admissible evidence of proof of  unlawful
possession  of	the  contraband on the accused.	  Any  other
material/article  recovered during that search may, however,
be  relied  upon  by the  prosecution  in  other/independent
proceedings  against an accused notwithstanding the recovery
of   that  material  during  an	  illegal  search  and	 its
admissibility  would  depend  upon  the	 relevancy  of	that
material  and  the  facts and circumstances  of	 that  case.
Thus,  considered we are of the opinion that the judgment in
Ali  Mustaffas case correctly interprets and  distinguishes
the judgment in Pooran Mals case and the broad observations
made  in Pirthi Chands case and Jasbir Singhs case are not
in  tune with the correct exposition of law, as laid down in
Pooran	Mal's  case.   On  the basis of	 the  reasoning	 and
discussion  above,  the following conclusions arise  :	 (1)
That  when an empowered officer or a duly authorised officer
acting	on prior information is about to search a person, it
is  imperative for him to inform the concerned person of his
right  under Sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_319">Section 50</a> of being taken to
the  nearest Gazetted Officer or the nearest Magistrate	 for
making	the  search.   However,	 such  information  may	 not
necessarily  be in writing;  (2) That failure to inform	 the
concerned  person  about  the existence of his right  to  be
searched  before  a Gazetted Officer or a  Magistrate  would
cause  prejudice to an accused;	 (3) That a search made,  by
an   empowered	officer,  on   prior  information,   without
informing  the person of his right that, if he so  requires,
he  shall be taken before a Gazetted Officer or a Magistrate
for  search  and in case he so opts, failure to conduct	 his
search	before	a Gazetted Officer or a Magistrate, may	 not
vitiate	 the  trial  but would render the  recovery  of	 the
illicit	 article  suspect  and vitiate	the  conviction	 and
sentence  of  an  accused,  where the  conviction  has	been
recorded  only on the basis of the possession of the illicit
article,   recovered  from  his	  person,  during  a  search
conducted  in  violation of the provisions of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_320">Section 50</a>  of
the  Act;  (4) That there is indeed need to protect  society
from  criminals.  The societal intent in safety will  suffer
if  persons  who  commit  crimes are  let  off	because	 the
evidence  against  them is to be treated as if it  does	 not
exist.	 The  answer, therefore, is that  the  investigating
agency must follow the procedure as envisaged by the statute
scrupulously  and the failure to do so must be viewed by the
higher	authorities  seriously inviting action	against	 the
concerned  official  so that the laxity on the part  of	 the
investigating  authority  is curbed.  In every case the	 end
result	is important but the means to achieve it must remain
above  board.	The remedy cannot be worse than the  disease
itself.	  The legitimacy of judicial process may come  under
cloud  if  the court is seen to condone acts of	 lawlessness
conducted   by	the  investigating   agency  during   search
operations  and	 may also undermine respect for law and	 may
have   the  effect  of	 unconscionably	  compromising	 the
administration	of  justice.  That cannot be permitted.	  An
accused is entitled to a fair trial.  A conviction resulting
from  an unfair trial is contrary to our concept of justice.
The  use  of evidence collected in breach of the  safeguards
50  have  by <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_321">Section 50</a> at the trial, would render the trial
unfair.	  (5) That whether or not the safeguards provided in
<a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_322">Section	 50</a>  have  been	 duly  observed	 would	have  to  be
determined  by the Court on the basis of evidence led at the
trial.	 Finding on that issue, one way or the other,  would
be  relevant  for  recording  an   order  of  conviction  or
acquittal.  Without giving an opportunity to the prosecution
to  establish, at the trial, that the provisions of  <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_323">Section
50</a>,  and  particularly the safeguards provided therein	were
duly  complied with, it would not be permissible to cut- sho
rt  a criminal trial;  (6) That in the context in which	 the
protection  has	 been  incorporated in <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_324">Section	50</a>  for	 the
benefit	 of  the person intended to be searched, we  do	 not
express any opinion whether the provisions of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_325">Section 50</a> are
mandatory or directory, but, hold that failure to inform the
concerned  person of his right as emanating from Sub-section
(1) of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_326">Section 50</a>, may render the recovery of the contraband
suspect	 and  the conviction and sentence of an accused	 bad
and  unsustainable  in	law;  (7) That	an  illicit  article
seized from the person of an accused during search conducted
in violation of the safeguards provided in <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_327">Section 50</a> of the
Act  cannot  be	 used  as  evidence  of	 proof	of  unlawful
possession of the contraband on the accused though any other
material  recovered during that search may be relied upon by
the  prosecution, in other proceedings, against an  accused,
notwithstanding	 the  recovery	of that material  during  an
illegal	 search;  (8) A presumption under <a href="/doc/1297682/" id="a_328">Section 54</a> of	 the
Act can only be raised after the prosecution has established
that  the  accused  was	 found to be in	 possession  of	 the
contraband  in	a  search conducted in accordance  with	 the
mandate of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_329">Section 50</a>.	An illegal search cannot entitle the
prosecution  to raise a presumption under <a href="/doc/1297682/" id="a_330">Section 54</a> of	 the
Act  (9)  That the judgment in Pooran Mal's case  cannot  be
understood  to have laid down that an illicit article seized
during a search of a person, on prior information, conducted
in violation of the provisions of <a href="/doc/961083/" id="a_331">Section 50</a> of the Act, can
by  itself be used as evidence of unlawful possession of the
illicit	 article on the person from whom the contraband	 has
been  seized  during  the  illegal search;   (10)  That	 the
judgment  in  Ali Mustaffa's case correctly  interprets	 and
distinguishes  the  judgment  in Pooran Mal's case  and	 the
broad  observations  made in Pirthi Chand's case and  Jasbir
Singh's	 case are not in tune with the correct exposition of
law   as  laid	down  in   Pooran  Mal's  case.	  The  above
conclusions are not a summary of our judgment and have to be
read  and  considered in the light of the entire  discussion
contained in the earlier part.
