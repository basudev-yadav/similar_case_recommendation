HEADNOTE:
Section	 5 of the East Punjab Sales Tax	 Act,	   1948,  as
originally  enacted,  conferred on the Government  power  to
levy  tax  at such rates as the Government might  fix.	 The
section	 was amended by Act 18 of 1952,	 with  retrospective
effect,	 fixing the rate of tax at "not exceeding two  piece
in a rupee".  <a href="/doc/218839/" id="a_4">Section 2(ff)</a> of the Act as amended by Act  13
of  1959,  define-, "purchase" as the "acquisition"  of	 the
goods  "for  use in the manufacture of goods for  sale,	 for
cash  or deferred payment or other   valuable  consideration
otherwise  than	 under a mortgage hypothecation,  charge  or
pledge".   The	appellants'  petition  in  the	High   Court
challenging  the  imposition of purchase tax for  the  years
1958-59	 and  1959-60 on the purchase of  oil  seeds,  steel
scrap  and  cotton for manufacture of goods for	 sale,	were
dismissed, and they appealed to this Court. Mean while,	 the
High Court had considered the validity of the Act in a Sales
Tax  Reference	and declared<a href="/doc/256155/" id="a_5"> s. 5</a>, as it  originally  stood,
void.  In  this Court it was contended : (i) since<a href="/doc/256155/" id="a_6"> s.  5</a>  as
originally   enacted,  was  declared  void,that	 being	 the
charging  section, the entire act was void and the  <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_7">Amending
Act</a>  of 1952 could not revive an Act which was non est,	 and
(ii)  <a href="/doc/218839/" id="a_8">section  2(ff)</a>  was invalid for  want  of	 legislative
competence.
     HELD  : (i) <a href="/doc/256155/" id="a_9">Section 5</a> as it stood before the  amendment
was void, but the section as amended by the <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_10">Amending Act</a>  of
1952 is valid.
     <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_11">An Act</a> conferring a power to fix rates of taxation must
lay down  clear	 legislative policy or guide-lines  in	that
regard and the doctrine of    constitutional  and  statutory
needs  would  not  afford  -reasonable	guidelines  in	 the
fixation of such rates. There was nothing in the  provisions
of the Act, including the preamble disclosing any policy  or
guidance  to  the State for fixing rates. <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_12">Section  5</a>  as  it
stood  before the Amendment conferred on the  Government  an
uncontrolled  power in the matter of fixation of  rates	 and
was therefore void. [565 G-566 B; 569 <a href="/doc/1231443/" id="a_13">F]

context must be given a restricted meaning.  The  expression
"acquisition"  in the definition means only  "transfer"	 and
the  expression "valuable consideration" takes	colour	from
the preceding expression "cash or deferred payment" and	 can
only mean some other monetary payment in the nature of	cash
or deferred payment. [571 F-G; 572 <a href="/doc/1425329/" id="a_30">B]

Purchase  tax, under the Act is leviable on the purchase  of

<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_33">The  Act</a>  does not enable levy of tax on the same  goods  at

the identity and the goods purchased and the goods sold	 are
not identical and therefore the same goods are not taxed  at
two  stages.  Further, cl. (ff) of<a href="/doc/218839/" id="a_35"> s. 2</a> of the	Act  during.

amended	   by  <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_39">Punjab  Act</a>  7 of  1958,	 relating  to  three
categories of goods, namely, oil-seeds, iron and cotton.
The facts may be briefly stated.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">560</span>
<p id="p_13">The  assessees in.  Civil Appeals Nos. 526, 527 and  529  of
1964  carry on business at Moga in Punjab and each  owns  an
oil-mill  They	purchase oil-seeds and, after  crushing	 the
same in their oil mills, sell the oil and the residual	oil-
cake.	They  are  registered dealers under  the  Act.	 <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_40">The
Amending Act</a> imposed a purchase tax of 2% on the purchase of
oil-seeds  "for	 the  use in the manufacture  of  goods	 for
sale." This was in addition to the sales-tax leviable on the
sales of oil and oil-cake.  On June 23, 1959, the Excise and
Taxation  Officer,  Ferozepore, the 3rd respondent  ill	 the
said  appeals, issued notices to the 3	appellants-assessees
to the effect that they did not submit their returns for the
year  ending  1958-59  and failed  to  pay  purchase-tax  in
respect thereof and asked them to show cause why they should
not  be	 prosecuted for the said  default.   The  appellants
filed 3 petitions under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_41">Art. 226</a> of the Constitution in	 the
High  Court  of	 Punjab	 questioning  the  validity  of	 the
relevant provisions of the Act and for appropriate  reliefs.
A  Division  Bench of the High Court  heard  the  petitions,
along  with  other connected petitions,	 and  dismissed	 the
petitions  of  the  appellants so far  as  they	 related  to
purchase-tax on oil-seeds.  Hence the appeals.
Civil  Appeals Nos. 39 to 43 of 1965 relate to	purchase-tax
on iron.  The appellants carry on business in rolling  steel
at  Gobindgarh.	 They purchase steel scrap and steel  ingots
and convert them into rolled steel sections.  <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_42">Under the Act</a>,
the assessing authority imposed purchase-tax at the rate  of
2%  on the purchase of steel scrap and steel ingots made  by
them  during the period April 1, 1958 to March 31, 1959	 for
making	rolled	steel  section and selling  the	 same.	 The
appellants   filed   petitions	under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_43">Art.   226</a>   of	 the
Constitution  in  the High Court for appropriate  writs	 for
quashing  the  orders of the assessing authorities  and	 for
prohibiting  them  from levying purchase-tax  on  the  goods
purchased and for refund of the tax illegally collected from
them.	A  Division Bench of the High  Court  dismissed	 the
petitions.  Hence the appeals.
</p><p id="p_14">Appeals Nos. 81 of 1965 and 540 of 1965 relate to  purchase-
tax  on	 cotton.  The appellants in Civil Appeal No.  81  of
1965 are the trustees of Birla Education Trust.	 They own  a
cotton and textile mill, Bhiwani.  They purchase cotton from
various dealers in Punjab and outside for the manufacture of
yarn  and  cloth.  By ,in order dated March  11,  1962,	 the
District  Taxation Officer, Hissar, imposed purchase-tax  on
the  appellants in respect of the cotton purchased  by	them
for the assessment years 1958-59 and 1959-60.  The appellant
in  Civil  Appeal  No.	540 of 1965  is	 a  limited  company
carrying on the business of producing and selling yarn.	 For
the  purpose  of  its  business	 it  acquires  cotton	from
commission agents.  It is a registered dealer under the Act.
The Excise and Taxation Officer, Hissar, by his order  dated
November
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">561</span>
29,  1961,  assessed the appellant to purchase-tax  for	 the
assessment  year 1958-59 in respect of the cotton  purchased
by  it	and  so	 too  on January  27,  1962,  he  had  taken
proceedings  for making assessment to purchase-tax  for	 the
assessment  year 1959-60 in respect of the  same  commodity.
The  appellants	 in both the appeals filed  petitions  under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_44">Art.  226</a> of the Constitution in the High Court	 questioning
the  validity of the said orders.  The said  writ  petitions
were dismissed by a Division Bench of the High Court.  Hence
the appeals.
</p><p id="p_15">We shall at first take the points raised which are common to
all  the  appeals and then proceed to  consider	 the  points
peculiar to some of the appeals.
</p><p id="p_16">Mr. M. C. Setalvad, learned counsel appearing for the appel-
lants in the batch of appeals relating to tax on purchase of
oil  seeds, raised before us the following points which	 are
common	to other appeals : (1) Section 5 of the East  Punjab
General	 Sales	Tax Act, 1948, was held to be, void  on	 the
ground	that it conferred essentially legislative  power  on
the  provincial Government and, therefore, the said  section
was  stillborn	and  that,,  as the  said  section  was	 the
charging  section, the entire Act was void, with the  result
Act 19 of 1952, which amended<a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_45"> s. 5</a> with retrospective effect
could not breathe a new life into the said Act.	 A void	 Act
was non est and, therefore, could not be brought into  force
by an amending Act. (2) Clause (ff) of <a href="/doc/678464/" id="a_46">section 2</a>  introduced
by  Act	 7  of	1958 defining  "purchase",  subject  to	 the
conditions  mentioned  therein as a taxing event  was  ultra
vires  the  State Legislature inasmuch	as  the	 transaction
defined	 therein was not a sale" within the meaning of	that
expression  in entry 52 of List 11 of the 7th.	Schedule  to
the  Constitution and was in fact an "excise" duty  inasmuch
as  it was imposed on the production of oil in the  garb  of
purchase tax. (3) The said amendment was also bad in that it
made  an  unreasonable	discrimination	in  the	 matter	  of
taxation  between  the same classes of goods  based  on	 the
character of the purchaser.  If the goods were purchased  by
a manufacturer, they were liable to purchase tax; and if the
same  goods were purchased by an ordinary dealer, they	were
not  liable  to the said tax. (4)  The	amended	 'provision,
<a href="/doc/678464/" id="a_47">section	 2(ff)</a>, was also void because it contravened<a href="/doc/450196/" id="a_48"> ss.  14</a>
and <a href="/doc/1116546/" id="a_49">15</a> of the Central Sales-tax Act, 1956, whereunder sales-
tax  was prohibited to be imposed on the declared  goods  at
more  than  one	 stage, whereas under the Act  it  could  be
imposed both at the purchase point and at the sale point  of
the  transactions  entered  into by  the  manufacturer.	 (5)
Purchase-tax was not leviable on oil-seeds, as the assessees
did  not manufacture oil out of the seeds but only  produced
the oil.
</p><p id="p_17">We  shall now proceed to consider the points seriatim.	 The
provisions relevant to the first two points read thus:
 C1167-6
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">562</span>
	      East Punjab General Sales Tax Act (46 of 1948)
	      <a href="/doc/256155/" id="a_50">Section  5</a>. Subject to the provisions of	this
	      Act,  there  shall be levied  on	the  taxable

</p><p id="p_21">The High Court of Punjab held that<a href="/doc/256155/" id="a_53"> s. 5</a> of the Act was	void
as  it	gave  an unlimited power to the	 executive  to	levy
sales-tax at a rate which it thought lit.  But it held	that
the  amendment	of <a href="/doc/256155/" id="a_54">section 5</a> by the <a href="/doc/975999/" id="a_55">Punjab Act</a>	19  of	1952
cured  the  defect  in the said Act and had  the  effect  of
giving a new life to it.
</p><p id="p_22">The  first question, therefore, is whether section 5 of	 the
East Punjab General Sales Tax Act, 1948 (46 of 1948), as  it
originally  stood, was void, and the second question is,  if
the said section was void, whether the amendment could	give
life to it.
</p><p id="p_23">The  law  on  the subject is  fairly  well  settled,  though
difficulties  are met in its application to each  case.	  <a href="/doc/1231443/" id="a_56">In
Corporation  of Calcutta, v. Liberty Cinema</a>(1) on which	 Mr.
Ganapati  Iyer	relied relates to a levy imposed  on  cinema
houses	under  the  Calcutta Municipal	Act  (33  of  1951).
There,	the majority held that the levy therein was  a	tax,
that  the fixing of a rate of tax was not of the essence  of
legislative power, that the fixing of rates might be left to
a nonlegislative body and that when it was so left to such a
body,  the  Legislature	 must  provide	guidance  for	such
fixation.   The	 majority  he-Id in that case  that  such  a
guidance was found in the monetary needs of the Municipality
for discharging the functions entrusted to it under the Act.
Sarkar I., speaking for the majority &amp;aid thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	      "It (the Municipal Corporation) has to perform
	      various  statutory  functions.   It  is  often
	      given power to decide when and in what  manner

	      this  it needs money and its needs  will	very
	      from time to time, with the prevailing exigen-

	      necessarily
	      (1)   [1965]2 S.C.R.4 7
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">	      563</span>
	      limited by the expenses required to  discharge
	      those  functions.	  It has,  therefore,  where
	      rates have not been specified in the  statute,
	      to fix such rates as may be necessary to	meet
	      its   needs.    That,  we	 think,	  would	  be
	      sufficient  guidance to make the	exercise  of
	      its power to fix the rates valid."
</blockquote><p id="p_24">If  this decision is an authority for the position that	 the
Legislature can delegate its power to a statutory  authority
to  levy  taxes and fix the rates in regard thereto,  it  is
equally an authority for the position that the said  statute
to  be valid must give a guidance to the said authority	 for
fixing the said rates and that guidance cannot be judged  by
stero typed rules but would depend upon the provisions of  a
particular Act.	 To that extent this judgment is binding  on
us.   But  we  cannot go further and hold,  as	the  learned
counsel for the respondents asked us to do, that whenever  a
statute	 define-,  the	purpose	 or  purposes  for  which  a
statutory  authority constituted and empowers it to  levy  a
tax that statute necessarily contains a guidance to fix	 the
rates it depends upon the provisions of each statute.
Learned counsel for the State argued that under <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_57">Art. 162</a>  of
the  Constitution  the executive power of  the	State  shall
extend to: matters with respect to which the Legislature  of
a  State  has  power  to make laws : that  is  to  say,	 the
executive  power of a State extends to matters mentioned  in
List  11 of the Seventh Schedule to, the Constitution,	that
under  <a href="/doc/1910937/" id="a_58">Art.  266(1)</a>  of	 the  Constitution  all	 the   taxes
collected  will go to the Consolidated Funds of	 the  State,
that  the  State has an unlimited power to  raise  funds  by
taxation  to  discharge its vast constitutional	 duties	 and
that  necessarily  the amount of tax required  would  depend
upon  its needs which can only be known to it.	In the	said
circumstances,	the  argument proceeds'..  the	doctrine  of
constitutional	and statutory needs would afford  reasonable
guidelines  for the Government to fix the rate and that	 the
principle laid down by this Court in the aforesaid  decision
would  equally	apply  to this case.  If  this	argument  be
accepted,  it  would mean that every  statute  conferring  a
naked power on the Government to impose taxes would be good,
for in every case the discharge of the constitutional duties
by  the Government would be deemed to be a sufficient  guide
for  fixing  the rate.	We cannot accept this  argument	 for
three  reasons,	 namely, (1) the decision of this  Court  in
<a href="/doc/1231443/" id="a_59">Calcutta Corporation v. Liberty Cinema</a>(1) should he confined
only to the provisions of the Calcutta Municipal Act Wherein
this  Court  found  a guidance; (2) the	 provisions  of	 the
Sale,; <a href="/doc/6749/" id="a_60">Tax Act</a>, including the preamble, do not disclose	 any
policy	or guidance to the, State for fixing the rates:	 and
(3) the general
(1)  [1965]2 S.C.R. 477,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">564</span>
constitutional	power to impose taxes has no  relevance	 for
discovering a statutory policy under a particular Act.
Nor  does the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1425329/" id="a_61">The State of  Madras
v. Gannon Dunkerley &amp; Co., (Madras) Ltd</a>.(1) lend support  to
the  argument  so widely advanced by  the  learned  counsel.
That  case has nothing to do with the fixation of  rates  of
taxes.	 There section 6(1) of the Madras General Sales	 Tax
Act,  1939,  as amended by Madras Act 25 of  1947,  provided
that  no tax will be payable on any sale of goods  specified
in the schedule to it.	<a href="/doc/331124/" id="a_62">Section 6(2)</a> ,of that Act authorised
the State Government to amend the schedule by  notification.
The  amendment of the Schedule by the State  Government	 was
challenged on the ground that <a href="/doc/331124/" id="a_63">section 6(2)</a> was invalid as it
was  a delegation of the essential power of legislation	 ,of
the  State Government.	Venkatarama Ayyar, J., speaking	 for
the Court, in rejecting that contention, observed thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	      "Now, the authorities are clear that it is not
	      unconstitutional for the legislature to  leave
	      it  to  the  executive  to  determine  details
	      relating to the working of taxation laws, such
	      as the selection of persons on whom the tax is
	      to  be  laid, the rates at which it is  to  be
	      charged  in  respect of different	 classes  of
	      goods, and the like."
</blockquote><p id="p_25">It  is not necessary to scrutinize the correctness  of	this
statement,  having regard to the decisions relied upon,	 for
this  Court in <a href="/doc/1231443/" id="a_64">Corporation of Calcutta v. Liberty  Cinema</a>(2)
accepted it, but made it clear that such a power to fix	 the
rates  must be supported by some reasonable  guidance  given
under the Act whereunder the said power was conferred.	 Nor
the  observations  of Rajagopala Ayyangar, J., in  the	said
decision  speaking  for the minority, lend  support  to	 the
contentions of the respondents.

was  valid.  When it was argued that it was bad	 because  of

<p id="p_30">Further	 citation  is  unnecessary,  for  the  principle  of
excessive delegation is well settled and the cases are	only
illustrations of the application of the said principle.	 The
law on the subject may briefly be stated thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	      "The Constitution confers a power and  imposes
	      a	 duty on the legislature to make laws.	 The
	      essential	  legislative	function   is	 the
	      determination  of the legislative	 policy	 and
	      its  formulation as a rule of conduct.   Obvi-
	      ously  it	 cannot abdicate  its  functions  in
	      favour   of  another.  But  in  view  of	 the
	      multifarious activities of a welfare State, it
	      cannot presumably work out all the details  to
	      suit   the  varying  aspects  of	 a   complex
	      situation.It  must  necessarily  delegate	 the
	      working out of details to the executive or any
	      other agency.  But there is a danger  inherent
	      in such a process of delegation.	An  overbur-
	      dened  legislature  or  one  controlled  by  a
	      powerful	executive  may unduly  overstep	 the
	      limits of delegation.  It may not lay down any
	      policy  at all; it may declare its  policy  in
	      vague  and general terms; it may not set	down
	      any   standard   for  the	 guidance   of	 the
	      executive; it may confer an arbitrary power on
	      the  executive to change or modify the  policy
	      laid  down by it without reserving for  itself
	      any  control  over  subordinate	legislation.
	      This  self effacement of legislative power  in
	      favour of another agency either in whole or in
	      part  is	beyond	the  permissible  limits  of
	      delegation.   It is for a Court to hold  on  a
	      fair, generous and liberal construction of  an
	      impugned statute whether the legislature
	      exceeded such limits.  But the said liberal on
	      struction should not be carried by the  Courts
	      to  the extent of always trying to discover  a
	      dormaint	or  latent  legislative	 policy	  to
	      sustain	an  arbitrary  power  conferred	  on
	      executive authorities.  It is the duty of	 the
	      Court  to strike down without  any  hesitation
	      any arbitrary power conferred on the executive
	      by the legislature.

accepted,  for, if accepted,. it would destroy the  doctrine
of excessive delegation.  It would also sanction  conferment

</p><p id="p_42">The  only difference between <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_105">Income-tax Act</a> and the  present

does  not  expressly  make, the	 liability  subject  to	 the

a   clear   distinction	 between   chargeability   and	 the
quantification	of  tax.   While, it is true  that  the	 tax
cannot	be, realised without it being quantified,  the	non-
quantification	of  the	 liability  will  not  destroy	 the
liability tinder the clearing section.	The liability has to
be  distinguished  from its enforceability.   It  cannot  be
said, and indeed it Is not said, that the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_112">Income-tax Act</a> has

on  <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_114">section  67B</a>  of the Income-tax Act in  support  of	 the
contention that its existence in the statute book keeps	 the

it  will be noticed that the Court's decision was not  based
on  the existence of the said provision but on that  of	 the
charging  section  itself.   It follows	 that  striking	 out
<a href="/doc/65305/" id="a_117">section	 5</a>  does  not make <a href="/doc/339978/" id="a_118">section 4</a> void,  though  till  an

The  decision  of this Court in <a href="/doc/679175/" id="a_119">B. Shama Rao  v.  The  Union

that there was a total surrender in the matter of  sales-tax
legislation  by	 the Pondicherry Assembly in favour  of	 the
Madras	legislature  and for that reason the  said  sections

</p><p id="p_45">It  was argued that the Act could not be said to  be  still-

core  of the taxing statute was in the charging section	 and
that  the remaining sections bad no  independent  existence.
In the present case the charging section was intact and what
was struck out was only the section providing for rates.  It
cannot,	 therefore, be said that when <a href="/doc/65305/" id="a_121">section 5</a>	 was  struck
out, <a href="/doc/339978/" id="a_122">section 4</a> or other sections fell with it.

that  would  be	 an amendment of an existing  Act.   But  in
substance  the amendment brings about the same effect.	 The
words  "shall  be deemed always to have	 been  so  inserted"
indicate  that	in  substance  <a href="/doc/65305/" id="a_130">section	5</a>,  as	amended,  is
Inserted in the Act with retrospective effect.
Even  so it wits contended that <a href="/doc/65305/" id="a_131">section 5</a>, as amended,	only
gave the maximum rate and did not disclose any policy giving
guidance  to the executive for fixing any rate	within	that
maximum.  Here we are concerned with sales-tax.	 <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_132">If the	 Act</a>
had  said "2 pice In a rupee" it would be manifest  that  it
was  a clear guidance.	But as the Act applies to  sales  or
purchases  of different commodities it had become  necessary
to  give  some discretion to the Government  in	 fixing	 the
rate.	Conferment  of reasonable area of  discretion  by  a
fiscal statute has been approved by this Court in more	than
(me  decision : see <a href="/doc/1048632/" id="a_133">Khandige Sham Bhat v.  The	Agricultural
Income-tax Officer</a>(1).	At the same time a larger  statutory
discretion  placing a wide gap between the minimum  and	 the
maximum	 rates	and thus enabling the Government to  fix  an
arbitrary  rate	 may  not be  sustained.   In  the  ultimate
analysis, the permissible discretion depends upon the  facts
of each case.  The discretion to fix the rate between I pice
and  2	pice in a rupee is so insignificant that it  is	 not
possible to hold that it exceeds the permissible limits.  It
follows that <a href="/doc/65305/" id="a_134">section 5</a> of the Act as amended is valid.
The  next  argument is that <a href="/doc/545792/" id="a_135">section 2(ff)</a>  inserted  in	 the
Punjab	General	 Sales	Tax Act, 1948, by  the	East  Punjab
General Sales Tax (Amendment) Act, 1958 (Act No. 7 of  1958)
Lind  amended by <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_136">Amending Act</a> 13 of 1959 is void.  The	said
clause (ff) as amended by Act 13 of 1959 reads
	      "	 'Purchase',  with all	its  grammatical  or
			    cognate  expressions, means the acquis
ition  of

	      deferred payment or other valuable  considera-
	      tion   otherwise	 than  under   a   mortgage,
	      hypothecation, charge or- pledge."
</p><p id="p_49">The  first  limb of the argument is that the  definition  of
"purchase"  is	more comprehensive than	 the  definition  of
"sale"	under the <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_137">Indian Sale of Goods Act</a>  and,  therefore,

<p id="p_50">incompetent to make a law under entry "sale or purchase"  in

	      presupposes capacity to contract, that it must
	      be supported by money consideration, and	that
	      as  a result of the transaction property	must
	      actually	pass  in the  goods.   Unless  these
	      elements	are present, there can be  no  sale.
	      Thus, if merely title to the goods passes	 but

</blockquote><p id="p_52">This  Court  also  held	 that  the  State  Legislature,	  by
enlarging  the	,definition  of "sale",	 could	not  include
transactions  which  were not sales according  to  the	well
established  concepts of law tinder the Law of	Contract  or
the <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_139">Sale of Goods Act</a>; see <a href="/doc/127667/" id="a_140">Sales-tax Officer v. Budh Prakash</a>
(2 ) and <a href="/doc/509289/" id="a_141">George Oakes v. State of Madras</a>(3).
Bearing that in mind let us look at clause (ff) in section 2
of the Principal Act in which the said clause was  inserted.
The  ingredients  of  the definition of	 "purchase"  are  as
follows : (i) there shall be acquisition of goods; (ii)	 the
acquisition shall be for cash ,or deferred payment or  other
valuable consideration; (ii) the said valuable consideration
shall  not  be other than under a  mortgage,  hypothecation,
charge or pledge.  Clause (h) of' <a href="/doc/545792/" id="a_142">section 2</a> defines thus
	      "sale" means an transfer of property in  goods
	      other  than goods specified in Schedule C	 for
	      cash  or	deferred payment or  other  valuable
	      consideration but does not include a mortgage,
	      hypothecation, charge or pledge.
</p><p id="p_53">If  we	turn  to the <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_143">Sale of Goods Act</a>,	 <a href="/doc/339978/" id="a_144">section  4</a>  thereof
define contract of sale of goods.  It reads :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">	      "Contract	 of  sale  of goods  is	 a  contract
	      whereby  the  seller transfers  or  agrees  to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">	      571</span>
</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_10">The  essential	requisite of sale are (i) there shall  be  a
transfer  of property or agreement to transfer	property  by
one party to another; and (ii) it shall be for consideration
of  money payment or promise thereof by the buyer.   A	sale
and   a	  purchase  are	 different  aspects  of	  the	same
transaction.   If  we look at it from the  standpoint  of  a
purchaser  it  is  purchase and if we look at  it  from	 the
standpoint of the seller it is a sale.	Whether purchase  or
sale  it shall have the said ingredients both in common	 law
and under the <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_145">Indian Contract Act</a>.  'Price' has been defined
in the <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_146">Sale of Goods Act</a> to mean money consideration for the
sale  of  goods : see<a href="/doc/238183/" id="a_147"> s. 2(10)</a> of the Indian Sale  of  Goods
Act.   It  will, therefore, be seen that the  definition  of
'purchase'  in	the Act prima facie appears to be  wider  in
scope than 'sale'.  While transfer of goods from one  person
to  another  is	 the ingredient of 'sale'  in  general	law,
acquisition  ion  of goods, which may in  its  comprehensive
sense take in voluntary as well as involuntary transfers, is
an  ingredient of 'purchase' in clause (ff). While  'price',
i.e.,  money  consideration, is the  ingredient	 of  'sale',
cash,  deferred payment or any valuable consideration is  an
ingredient of 'Purchase'.  But a closer scrutiny compels  us
to give a restricted meaning to the expression "acquisition"
</blockquote><p id="p_54">and  "price".  Acquisition is the act by which a person	 ac-
quires	property  in a thin-.  "Acquire" is  to	 become	 the
owner  of  the	property.  One	can,  therefore,  acquire  a
property  either by voluntary or involuntary transfer.	 <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_148">But
the  Sales Tax Act</a> applies only to "sale" as defined in	 the
Act.  Under clause (h) of <a href="/doc/218839/" id="a_149">section 2</a> of the Act it is  defied
as a transfer of property.  As purchase is only a  differed,
aspect	of  sale,  looked at from the  stand  point  of	 the
purchaser, and as the Act imposes tax at different points in
respect of sales, having regard to the purpose of the  ,ale,
it   is	  unreasonable	to  assume  that   the	 Legislature
contemplated  different categories of transactions when	 the
taxable event is it the purchase point.	 Whether it is	sale
or  purchase  the  transaction is the same.   If  it  was  a
transfer inter vivos, in the case of a sale it must  equally
be  so in the case of a purchase.  Context, consistency	 and
avoidance  of anomaly demand a restricted meaning.  That  it
must only mean transfer is also made clear by the nature  of
the  transactions  excluded from  the  acquisition,  namely,
mortgage, hypothecation,charge or pledge-all of them  belong
to the species of transfer. We must, therefore,hold that the
expression	   "acquisition" in clause (ff) of  section2
of the Act means only "transfer".
</p><p id="p_55">Now.  coming  to  the expression "price".  it  is  no  doubt
defined	 in the <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_150">Sale of Goods Act</a> as "money  consideration".
Cash or deferred payment in clause (ff) of <a href="/doc/1993798/" id="a_151">section 2</a> of	 the
Act satisfied the said definition.  The expression "valuable
consideration"	has  a	wider  connotation,  but  the	said
expression  is	also  used in the same	collocation  in	 the
definition  of "sale" in <a href="/doc/1993798/" id="a_152">section 2(h)</a> of the Act.  The	said
expression must bear the same meaning, in clause
5 72
(ff) and clause (h) of <a href="/doc/1993798/" id="a_153">section 2</a> of the Act.  It may also be
noticed	 that in most of the <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_154">Sales Tax Act</a>s the	 same  three
expressions  are used.	It has never been argued or  decided
that   the  said  expression  means  other   than   monetary
consideration.	This consistent legislative practice  cannot
be  ignored.  The expression "valuable consideration"  takes
colour	from  the  preceding expression	 "cash	or  deferred
payment".   If	so,  it can only mean  some  other  monetary
payment	 in  the nature of cash or  deferred  payment.	 We,
therefore, hold that clause (ff) of <a href="/doc/218839/" id="a_155">section 2</a> of the Act  is
not void for legislative incompetence.
</p><p id="p_56"> Another argument to invalidate clause (ff) of <a href="/doc/218839/" id="a_156">section 2</a>  of
the principal Act may also be noticed.	It is said that that
clause	offends	 <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_157">Art. 14</a> of the Constitution on	 the  ground
that  by  reason of the said definition the  same  goods  if
purchased  by a manufacturer would be taxed but	 they  would
not  be	 taxed	if  purchased  by  a  person  other  than  a
manufacturer.	But  a	close scrutiny	of  clause  (ff)  of
<a href="/doc/218839/" id="a_158">section	 2</a>  discloses  that there is  a	 reasonable  classi-
fication in the said definition.  The raw goods purchased by
a  manufacturer	 are transformed on  manufacture  into	some
other goods and that is the reason why the Legislature taxes
the  goods  before they lose their identity.  But  where  no
manufacturer intervenes there is no such metamorphosis	and,
therefore,  the	 taxable  event	 is  the  sale.	  There	  is
certainly  a reasonable relation between the object  of	 the
statute	 and the differences between the two  categories  of
transactions.
</p><p id="p_57">The  next argument turns upon the interpretation  of  clause
(ff).	The  argument is, to come Linder the  definition  of
"purchase"  it is not enough that the acquisition  of  goods
shall be for cash etc. but that the acquisition shall be for
use  in the manufacture of goods for sale for cash etc.	  On
this  construction  it	is argued that the  tax	 levied	 was
excise	duty  and, therefore, beyond the competence  of	 the
State  Legislature.  The contention is that the tax  on	 the
purchase  was  in connection with the manufacture  of  goods
and,  therefore,  an  excise duty.  There  is  an  essential
distinction  between the two imposts : while excise duty  is
in  respect of manufacture of goods, the sales-tax  is	upon
the sale of the goods.	The question, therefore, is  whether
under the Act the purchase tax is imposed on the sale of the
goods  or in connection with the manufacture of goods.	 The
decisions  of this Court establish that "in order to be	 ,in
excise	duty (a) the levy must be upon 'goods' and  (b)	 the
taxable	 event	must  be the manufacture  or  production  of
goods."	 :  see	 Messrs.   <a href="/doc/1311861/" id="a_159">Shinde  Brothers  v.	 The  Deputy
Commissioner,  Raichur</a>(1)  The	tax has no  nexus  with	 the
manufacture  of goods.	The purpose for which the goods	 are
purchased is only relevant for fixing the
(1) Civil Appeals No. 1580-1586, 1588 and 1590-1600 of	1966
(decided on 26-9-1966).
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">573</span>
<p id="p_58">taxable event, but the tax is on the purchase of the  goods.
That  taxable event is fixed before the goods  are  actually
manufactured.	We, therefore, hold that the tax  under	 the
Act is a purchase tax and not an excise duty.
Then  it is contended that while <a href="/doc/1116546/" id="a_160">section 15</a> of	the  Central
Sales  Tax Act, 1956 (Act 74 of 1956) imposes a	 restriction
on the State not to tax at more than one stage, the amending
Act by introducing the definition of "purchase" enables	 the
State to tax the same goods at the purchase point and at the
sale  point.  But this argument misses the point that  goods
purchased  and	the  goods  sold  are  not  identical  ones.
Manufacture changes the identity.  Therefore, the same goods
are not taxed at two stages.
</p><p id="p_59">The last argument is that the said definition only takes  in
the  purchase of goods for use in the manufacture of  goods,
but  tax is imposed on the purchase of goods  for  producing
oil.   To state it differently, oil is not manufactured	 out
of oil seeds but only produced.	 Reliance is placed upon the
user  of  two  words  in  the  Act,  viz.  manufacturing  or
processing  in the proviso to sub-section (2) of  <a href="/doc/1036952/" id="a_161">section  4</a>
and sub-section (5) thereof and the expression "edible	oils
produced"  in entry 57 of Schedule B to the Act and  a	con-
tention	 is raised that the Act itself makes  a	 distinction
between	 manufacturing	and processing and  manufacture	 and
production and, therefore, oil is not manufactured but	only
produced  from oil seeds.  Support is sought to	 be  derived
for  this argument from the decision of this Court in  <a href="/doc/923724/" id="a_162">Union
of  India v. Delhi Cloth &amp; General Mills</a>(1).  But a  perusal
of the judgment shows that this Court only held that refined
oil produced out of seeds was only an intermediate stage  in
the  manufacture  and was, therefore, not liable  to  excise
duty.	On  the	 other	band,  the  dictionary	meaning	  of
"manufacture" is "transform or fashion raw materials into  a
changed	 form  for use".  When oil is produced	out  of	 the
seeds  the  process certainly transforms raw  material	into
different  article  for use.  We cannot,  therefore,  accept
this contention.
</p><p id="p_60">Now coming to Civil Appeals Nos. 39 to 43 of 1965, the first
additional point raised is that when iron scrap is converted
into  rolled  steel  it	 does not  involve  the	 process  of
manufacture.  It is contended that the said conversion	does
not  involve  any process of manufacture, but the  scrap  is
made  into a better marketable commodity.  Before  the	High
Court  this  contention was not pressed. That apart,  it  is
clear  that scrap iron ingots undergo a vital change in	 the
process	 of manufacture and are converted into	a  different
commodity, viz., rolled steel sections.	 During the  process
the  scrap  iron  loses	 its  identity	and  becomes  a	 new
marketable  commodity.	 The  process is  certainly  one  of
manufacture.

<p id="p_62">The  next  argument  is that the Act  is  in  conflict	with
<a href="/doc/1116546/" id="a_163">section	 15</a> of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, inasmuch  as
it enables the levy of sales-tax at more than one stage.  In

periods-the  first  period  upto October 31,  1958  and	 the
second	period from November 1, 1958 to March 31, 1960.	  It
is,  therefore, necessary to notice the relevant  provisions

13  of 1959 and Act 24 of 1959.	 Under the latter  amendment
in clause (ff) of <a href="/doc/218839/" id="a_179">section 2</a> for the words "goods for use  in
the manufacture of goods for sale" the
(1)  [1965] 1 S.C.R. 592.600.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">576</span>
<p id="p_69">words  "goods  specified  in Schedule 'C'  for	use  in	 the
manufacture of goods for sale" were substituted; that is  to
say,  the  stage  for taxation	prescribed  in	the  earlier
definition  was amended.  It may be recalled that under	 the
<a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_180">Central	 Sales Tax Act</a>, as amended, the description  of	 the
stage  was omitted, but that does not affect  the  question,
for  that description is maintained even under	the  amended
clause	(ff).  It follows from the said discussion that	 the
Punjab	General	 Sales Tax Act, during	the  crucial  period
which is the subject matter of these appeals, in terms fixed
a  stage  for  taxation, i.e., the stage of  purchase  by  a
dealer	for  use in the manufacture of	goods.	 There	are,
therefore, no merits in this contention either,.
Now coming to Civil Appeals Nos. 81 of 1965 and 540 of 1965,
three additional points are raised by Mr. Desai, namely, (i)
by   including	in  the	 term  "purchase",  read  with	 the
definition of "dealer", where there is acquisition of cotton
through	  commission  agents,  the  State  Legislature	 has
exceeded its legislative power under entry 54 of List 11, of
Schedule  7 to the Constitution; (ii) ,during  the  relevant
period	tax was leviable on cotton without fixing any  stage
and at more than one stage in violation of <a href="/doc/1116546/" id="a_181">section 15</a> of the
Central Sales Tax Act, 1956; and (iii) there is no  rational
basis  to single out the three items, namely,  cotton,	oil-
seeds  and  resin  for	imposition  of	purchase  tax	and,
therefore,  the	 relevant provisions offend <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_182">Art. 14</a>  of	 the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_70">We  have already held in another context that there  are  no
merits in the second point.
</p><p id="p_71">The first point need not detain us, as in the High Court  no
specific point was raised in that regard.
On  the third point also no adequate material was placed  in
the  court  below and, therefore, it does not call  for	 our
consideration.
</p><p id="p_72">In  the	 result the appeals are dismissed with	costs.	 One
hearing fee
R.K.P.S.					     Appeals
dismissed.
