the plaintiff company which is Triumphant Institute of Management

for providing of services of a coaching institute and training centers

India. Plaintiff offers training for national level examinations such as

CAT, Bank, GATE, IIT JEE examination etc. Plaintiff pleads that it

adopted the trademark 'T.I.M.E' in the year 1992 and thereafter has

been regularly using this trademark for coaching services. Plaintiff has

got registered the trademark as under:-

        S No.   Trademark                 Reg.no/App.No.     Class
        1.      T.I.M.E Triumphant        1343168            41

        4.      T.I.M.E                   1725338            16


3.           As per the plaint, plaintiff pleads that it came to know for

the first time in July 2016 of the existence of the defendants on

account of a newspaper advertisement inserted on 6.7.2016 in the

newspaper Dainik Bhaskar wherein the defendants were found to have



CS(COMM) No. 934/2016                                             Page 2 of 4
 adopted an identical trademark TIME and for same coaching services.

It is pleaded that the defendants have no right to use the trademark

TIME which is identical or nearly identical with the registered

trademark T.I.M.E of the plaintiff.


4.           Defendants have been served in the suit but they have not

appeared and hence they were proceeded ex-parte vide order dated

19.1.2017. Plaintiff has thereafter filed its affidavit by way of

evidence and proved its case.


5.           A reference to the affidavit by way of evidence filed on

behalf of the plaintiff shows that authorization for filing of a suit is in

terms of the Board of Resolution dated 10.7.2017 which has been

proved as Ex.PW1/1. The trademark registrations of the plaintiff have

been proved as Ex.PW1/3. Plaintiff has proved its goodwill and

reputation by filing its business turn over in terms of the Chartered

Accountant Certificate which is proved as Ex.PW1/6. The Chartered

Accountant Certificate indicating the turnover and the promotional

advertising expenditure of the plaintiff is proved as Ex.PW1/7. The

factum with respect to the defendants advertising their services under

more or less identical trademark being TIME/Time Institute is proved

 by the newspaper Dainik Bhaskar dated 6.7.2016 as Ex.PW1/8. In

view of the evidence led by the plaintiff, in my opinion, plaintiff has

made out a case that the defendants are infringing the trademark of the

plaintiff T.I.M.E and the defendants are passing off their services as

that of the plaintiff. Facts</pre><p id="p_1"> proved on record establish that the

defendants intend to trade upon the goodwill and reputation of the

plaintiff as for similar services by using identical/nearly identical

trademark TIME/Time Institute.

</p><p id="p_3">6.           Learned counsel for the plaintiff does not press the relief

with respect to the rendition of accounts/damages.


</p><p id="p_4">7.           In view of the above discussion, the suit of the plaintiff is

decreed against the defendants. Defendants are restrained from in any

manner using the trademark TIME/Time Institute or any other

trademark which is identical, nearly identical or deceptively similar to

the trademark T.I.M.E of the plaintiff. Plaintiff will be entitled to costs

of the suit. Decree sheet be drawn.
