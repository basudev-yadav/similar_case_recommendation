</p>
<p id="p_2">INTRODUCTION

 	Whether the seat of the Parliament or the Legislature 
of a State would be a relevant factor for determining the 
territorial jurisdiction of a High Court to entertain a writ 
petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India is 
the question involved in this appeal which arises out of a 
judgment and order dated 25.7.2003 passed by the High Court 
of Delhi in C.W.P. No. 4609 of 2003 holding that the said 
Court has no jurisdiction.  
</p>
<p id="p_3">BACKGROUND FACTS

 	The appellant is a company registered under the <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_2">Indian 
Companies Act</a>.  Its registered office is at Mumbai.  It 
obtained a loan from the Bhopal Branch of State Bank of 
India.  The respondent No. 2 issued a notice for repayment 
of the said loan from Bhopal purported to be in terms of the 
provisions of Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial 
Assets and <a href="/doc/198257891/" id="a_3">Enforcement of Security Interest Act</a>, 2002.
</p>
<p id="p_4">Questioning the vires of the said Act, the said writ 
petition was filed before Delhi High Court by the appellant 
herein which was dismissed on the ground of lack of 
territorial jurisdiction. 
</p>
<p id="p_5">Submissions

 	The only submission made on behalf of the appellant 
before the High Court as also before us is that as the 
constitutionality of a parliamentary act was in question, 
the High Court of Delhi had the requisite jurisdiction to 
entertain the writ petition. 
</p>
<p id="p_6">On the other hand, the contention of the learned 
counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent is that as no 
cause of action arose within the territorial jurisdiction of 
the High Court of Delhi, the writ petition has rightly not 
been entertained.	
</p>
<p id="p_7">Cause of Action:
</p>

<p id="p_8"> 	Cause of action implies a right to sue.  The material 
facts which are imperative for the suitor to allege and 
prove constitutes the cause of action.  Cause of action is 
not defined in any statute.  It has, however, been 
judicially interpreted inter alia to mean that every fact 
which would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove, if 
traversed, in order to support his right to the judgment of 
the Court.  Negatively put, it would mean that everything 
which, if not proved, gives the defendant an immediate right 
to judgment, would be part of cause of action.  Its 
importance is beyond any doubt.  For every action, there has 
to be a cause of action, if not, the plaint or the writ 
petition, as the case may be, shall be rejected summarily.  
</p>
<p id="p_9">Clause (2) of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_4">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India 
reads thus:
</p>
<p id="p_10">"(2) The power conferred by clause (1) 
to issue directions, orders or writs to 
any Government, authority or person may 
also be exercised by any High Court 
exercising jurisdiction in relation to 
the territories within which the cause 
of action, wholly or in part, arises for 
the exercise of such power, 
notwithstanding that the seat of such 
Government or authority or the residence 
of such person is not within those 
territories." 
</p>

<p id="p_11"> 	Section 20(c) of the Code of Civil Procedure reads as 
under:
</p><p id="p_12">"20 OTHER SUITS TO BE INSTITUTED WHERE 
DEFENDANT RESIDE OR CAUSE OF ACTION 
ARISES. 
</p><p id="p_13">Subject to the limitation aforesaid, 
every suit shall be instituted in a 
court within the local limits of whose 
jurisdiction - 
</p><p id="p_14">(c) the cause of action, wholly or in 
part, arises." 
</p>

<p id="p_15"> 	Although in view of Section 141 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure the provisions thereof would not apply to a writ 
proceedings, the phraseology used in Section 20(c) of the 
Code of Civil Procedure and Clause (2) of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_5">Article 226</a>,  
being in pari materia, the decisions of this Court rendered 
on interpretation of Section 20(c) of CPC shall apply to the 
writ proceedings also. Before proceeding to discuss the 
matter further it may be pointed out that the entire bundle 
of facts pleaded need not constitute a cause of action as 
what is necessary to be proved before the petitioner can 
obtain a decree is the material facts.  The expression 
material facts is also known as integral facts. 
</p>
<p id="p_16">Keeping in view the expressions used is Clause (2) of 
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_6">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, indisputably even 
if a small fraction of cause of action accrues within the 
jurisdiction of the Court, the Court will have jurisdiction 
in the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_17"> 	In Mussummat Chand Kour v. Partap Singh (15 IA 156), it 
was held:
</p><p id="p_18">"... the cause of action has no relation 
whatever to the defence which may be set 
up by the defendant, nor does it depend 
upon the character of the relief prayed 
for by the plaintiff. It refers entirely 
to the ground set forth in the plaint as 
the cause of action, or, in other words, 
to the media upon which the plaintiff 
asks the court to arrive at a con-
</p><p id="p_19">clusion in his favour."
</p>

<p id="p_20"> 	This Court in <a href="/doc/93127/" id="a_7">Oil &amp; Natural Gas Commission v. Utpal 
Kumar Basu and Ors</a>. (1994 (4) SCC 711) held that the 
question as to whether the court has a territorial 
jurisdiction to entertain a writ petition, must be arrived 
at on the basis of averments made in the petition, the truth 
or otherwise thereof being immaterial.
</p>
<p id="p_21"> 	This Court in Oil and Natural Gas Commission's case 
(supra) held that all necessary facts must form an integral 
part of the cause of action. It was observed: 
"So also the mere fact that it sent fax 
messages from Calcutta and received a 
reply thereto at Calcutta would not 
constitute an integral part of the cause 
of action..."
</p>
<p id="p_22"> 	<a href="/doc/721664/" id="a_8">In State of Rajasthan and Ors. v. M/s. Swaika 
Properties and Anr</a>. [1985 (3) SCC 217], this Court opined 
that mere service of a notice would not give rise to any 
cause of action unless service of notice was integral part 
of the cause of action.  The said decision has also been 
noticed in Oil and Natural Gas Commission (supra). This 
Court held:
</p><p id="p_23">"The answer to the question whether 
service of notice is an integral part of 
the cause of action within the meaning 
of <a href="/doc/618973/" id="a_9">Art. 226(2)</a> of the Constitution must 
depend upon the nature of the impugned 
order giving rise to a cause of action."
</p>
<p id="p_24">	In Aligarh Muslim University and Another Vs. Vinay 
Engineering Enterprises (P) Ltd. and Another [(1994) 4 SCC 
710] this Court lamented:
</p>
<p id="p_25">"2. We are surprised, not a little, 
that the High Court of Calcutta should 
have exercised jurisdiction in a case 
where it had absolutely no jurisdiction. 
The contracts in question were executed 
at Aligarh, the construction work was to 
be carried out at Aligarh, even the 
contracts provided that in the event of 
dispute the Aligarh Court alone will 
have jurisdiction. The arbitrator was 
from Aligarh and was to function there. 
Merely because the respondent was a 
Calcutta-based firm, the High Court of 
Calcutta seems to have exercised 
jurisdiction where it had none by 
adopting a queer line of reasoning. We 
are constrained to say that this is case 
of abuse of jurisdiction and we feel 
that the respondent deliberately moved 
the Calcutta High Court ignoring the 
fact that no part of the cause of action 
had arisen within the jurisdiction of 
that Court. It clearly shows that the 
litigation filed in the Calcutta High 
Court was thoroughly unsustainable." 
</p>
<p id="p_26"> 	In Union of India and Others Vs. Adani Exports Ltd. and 
Another [(2002) 1 SCC 567] it was held that in order to 
confer jurisdiction on a High Court to entertain a writ 
petition it must disclose that the integral facts pleaded in 
support of the cause of action do constitute a cause so as 
to empower the court to decide the dispute and the entire or 
a part of it arose within its jurisdiction.  
	Recently, in <a href="/doc/231341/" id="a_10">National Textile Corpn. Ltd. and Ors. vs. 
M/s Haribox Swalram and Ors. [JT</a> 2004 (4) SC 508], a 
Division Bench of this Court held :
</p><p id="p_27">"As discussed earlier, the mere fact 
that the writ petitioner carries on 
business at Calcutta or that the reply 
to the correspondence made by it was 
received at Calcutta is not an integral 
part of the cause of action and, 
therefore, the Calcutta High Court had 
no jurisdiction to entertain the writ 
petitioner and the view to the contrary 
taken by the Division Bench cannot be 
sustained.  In view of the above 
finding, the writ petition is liable to 
be dismissed..."		
</p>  
<p id="p_28">	The facts pleaded in the writ petition must have a 
nexus on the basis whereof a prayer can be granted.  Those 
facts which have nothing to do with the prayer made therein 
cannot be said to give rise to a cause of action which would 
confer jurisdiction on the court.
</p><p id="p_29">	Passing of a legislation by itself in our opinion do 
not confer any such right to file a writ petition unless a 
cause of action arises therefor.
</p>
<p id="p_30">	A distinction between a legislation and executive 
action should be borne in mind while determining the said 
question. 
</p>

<p id="p_31"> 	A parliamentary legislation when receives the assent of 
the President of India and published in an Official Gazette, 
unless specifically excluded, will apply to the entire 
territory of India.   If passing of a legislation gives rise 
to a cause of action, a writ petition questioning the 
constitutionality thereof can be filed in any High Court of 
the country.  It is not so done because a cause of action 
will arise only when the provisions of the Act or some of 
them which were implemented shall give rise to civil or evil 
consequences to the petitioner.  A writ court, it is well 
settled would not determine a constitutional question in 
vacuum. 
</p>

<p id="p_32"> 	The court must have the requisite territorial 
jurisdiction.  An order passed on writ petition questioning 
the constitutionality of a <a href="/doc/51092038/" id="a_11">Parliamentary Act</a> whether interim 
or final keeping in view the provisions contained in Clause 
(2) of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_12">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, will have 
effect throughout the territory of India subject of course 
to the applicability of the Act.
</p><p id="p_33">Situs of office of the Respondents - whether relevant?
 	A writ petition, however, questioning the 
constitutionality of a <a href="/doc/51092038/" id="a_13">Parliamentary Act</a> shall not be 
maintainable in the High Court of Delhi only because the 
seat of the Union of India is in Delhi. (See Abdul Kafi Khan 
Vs. Union of India and Others, AIR 1979 Cal 354)


Learned counsel for the appellant in support of his 
argument would contend that situs of framing law or rule 
would give jurisdiction to Delhi High Court and in support 
of the said contention relied upon the decisions of this 
Court in <a href="/doc/458532/" id="a_14">Nasiruddin vs. State Transport Appellate Tribunal</a> 
(AIR 1976 SC 331) and <a href="/doc/8878134/" id="a_15">U.P. Rashtriya Chini Mill Adhikari 
Parishad, Lucknow vs. State of U.P. and others</a> (1995) 4 SCC 
</p><p id="p_34">738.   So far as the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/458532/" id="a_16">Nasiruddin 
vs. State Transport Appellate Tribunal</a> (supra) is concerned 
it is not an authority for the proposition that the situs of 
legislature of a State or the authority in power to make 
subordinate legislation or issue a notification would  
confer power or jurisdiction on the High Court or a bench of 
the High Court to entertain petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_17">Article 226</a> of 
the Constitution.  In fact this Court while construing the 
provisions of United Provinces High Courts (Amalgamation) 
Order, 1948 stated the law thus:
</p><p id="p_35">"The conclusion as well as the 
reasoning of the High Court is 
incorrect.  It is unsound because the 
expression "cause of action" in an 
application under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_18">Article 226</a> would be 
as the expression is understood and if 
the cause of action arose because of the 
appellate order or the revisional order 
which came to be passed at Lucknow then 
Lucknow would have jurisdiction though 
the original order was passed at a place 
outside the areas in Oudh. It may be 
that the original order was in favour of 
the person applying for a writ.  In such 
case an adverse appellate order might be 
the cause of action.  The expression 
"cause of action" is well-known.  If 
the cause of action arises wholly or in 
part at a place within the specified 
Oudh areas, the Lucknow Bench will have 
jurisdiction.  If the cause of action 
arises wholly within the specified Oudh 
areas, it is indisputable that the 
Lucknow Bench would have exclusive 
jurisdiction in such a matter. If the 
cause of action arises in part within 
the specified areas in Oudh it would be 
open to the litigant who is the dominus 
litis to have his forum conveniens. The 
litigant has the right to go to a Court 
where part of his cause of action 
arises.  In such cases, it is incorrect 
to say that the litigant chooses any 
particular Court.  The choice is by 
reason of the jurisdiction of the Court 
being attracted by part of cause of 
action arising within the jurisdiction 
of the Court.  Similarly, if the cause 
of action can be said to have arisen 
partly within specified areas in arisen 
in Oudh and partly outside the specified 
Oudh areas, the litigant will have the 
choice to institute proceedings either 
at Allahabad or Lucknow. The Court will 
find out in each case whether the 
jurisdiction of the Court is rightly 
attracted by the alleged cause of 
action".
</p>
<p id="p_36">	The said decision is an authority for the proposition 
that the place from where an appellate order or a revisional 
order is passed may give rise to a part of cause of action 
although the original order was at a place outside the said 
area. When a part of the cause of action arises within one 
or the other High Court, it will be for the petitioner to 
choose his forum.	
</p>

<p id="p_37">	The view taken by this Court in U.P. Rashtriya Chini 
Mill Adhikari Parishad, Lucknow (supra) that situs of  issue 
of an order or notification by the Government would come 
within the meaning of expression 'cases arising' in clause 
14 of the (Amalgamation) Order is not a correct view of law 
for the reason hereafter stated and to that extent the said 
decision is overruled.  In fact, a legislation, it is trite, 
is not confined to a statute enacted by the Parliament or 
Legislature of a State, which would include delegated 
legislation and subordinate legislation or an executive 
order made by the Union of India, State or any other 
statutory authority.  In a case where the field is not 
covered by any statutory rule, executive instruction issued 
in this behalf shall also come with within the purview 
thereof.  situs of office of the Parliament, Legislature of 
a State or authorities empowered to make subordinate 
legislation would not by itself constitute any cause of 
action or cases arising. In other words,  framing of a 
statute, statutory rule or issue of an executive order or 
instruction would not confer jurisdiction upon a court only 
because of the situs of the office of the maker thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_38">	When an order, however, is passed by a Court or 
Tribunal or an executive authority whether under provisions 
of a statute or otherwise, a part of cause of action arises 
at that place.  Even in a given case, when the original 
authority is constituted at one place and the appellate 
authority is constituted at another, a writ petition would 
be maintainable at both the places.  In other words as order 
of the appellate authority constitutes a part of cause of 
action, a writ petition would be maintainable in the High 
Court within whose jurisdiction it is situate having regard 
to the fact that the order of the appellate authority is 
also required to be set aside and as the order of the 
original authority merges with that of the appellate 
authority.
</p>	
<p id="p_39"> 	Lt. Col. Khajoor Singh Vs. The Union of India and 
Another [(1961) 2 SCR 828] whereupon the learned counsel 
appearing on behalf of the appellant placed strong reliance 
was rendered at a point of time when clause (2) of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_19">Article 
226</a> had not been inserted.  In that case the Court held that 
the jurisdiction of the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_20">Article 226</a> of the 
Constitution of India, properly construed, depends not on 
the residence or location of the person affected by the 
order but of the person or authority passing the order and 
the place where the order has effect.  In the latter sense, 
namely, the office of the authority who is to implement the 
order would attract the territorial jurisdiction of the 
Court was considered having regard to Section 20(c) of the 
Code of Civil Procedure as <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_21">Article 226</a> of the Constitution 
thence stood stating :
</p>
<p id="p_40">"...The concept of cause of action 
cannot in our opinion be introduced in 
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_22">Art. 226</a>, for by doing so we shall be 
doing away with the express provision 
contained therein which requires that 
the person or authority to whom the writ 
is to be issued should be resident in or 
located within the territories over 
which the High Court has jurisdiction. 
It is true that this may result in some 
inconvenience to person residing far 
away from New Delhi who are aggrieved by 
some order of the Government of India as 
such, and that may be a reason for 
making a suitable constitutional 
amendment in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_23">Art. 226.</a> But the argument 
of inconvenience, in our opinion, cannot 
affect the plain language of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_24">Art. 226</a>, 
nor can the concept of the place of 
cause of action be introduced into it 
for that would do away with the two 
limitations on the powers of the High 
Court contained in it."
</p>

<p id="p_41"> 	In view of clause 2 of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_25">Article 226</a> of the Constitution 
of India now if a part of cause of action arises outside the 
jurisdiction of the High Court, it would have jurisdiction 
to issue a writ.  The decision in Khajoor Singh (supra) has, 
thus, no application.  
</p>
<p id="p_42">Forum Conveniens

 	We must, however, remind ourselves that even if a small 
part of cause of action arises within the territorial 
jurisdiction of the High Court, the same by itself may not 
be considered to be  a determinative factor compelling the 
High Court to decide the matter on merit.  In appropriate 
cases, the Court may refuse to exercise its discretionary 
jurisdiction by invoking the doctrine of forum conveniens.

Conclusion

 	For the aforementioned reasons, there is no merit in 
this appeal which is dismissed accordingly. No costs.
