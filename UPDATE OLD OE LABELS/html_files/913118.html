<p id="p_1">JUDGMENT
 

</p><p id="p_2">1. Delay condoned.
</p> 

<p id="p_3">2. Leave granted in special leave petitions.
</p> 

<p id="p_4">3. In this batch of civil appeals, the question which arises for determination is whether Section 11AC of the Centra). <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_1">Excise Act</a>, inserted by <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_2">Finance Act</a>, 1996 with the intention of imposing mandatory penalty on persons who evade payment of tax, should be read to contain mens rea as an essential requirement.
</p> 

<p id="p_5">4. According to the department, the said section should be read as penalty for statutory offences; that the executing authority had no discretion in the matter of penalty and that the adjudicating authority in such cases was duty bound to impose penalty equal to the duty so determined. On the other hand, it is the case of the assessee that mens rea was an essential requirement of the said section particularly when the section refers to intention in the matter of evading payment of duty. The assessee has also invited our attention, in this connection, to the provisions of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_3">Section 271(l)(c)</a> of the Income Tax Act which according to the assessee is identically worded to <a href="/doc/92590795/" id="a_4">Section 11AC</a> of the Central Excise Act. The assessee has also placed reliance on a recent judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1614118/" id="a_5">Dilip N. Shroff v. Jt. CIT</a> 2007 (8) SCALE 304, decided on 18th May, 2007.
</p> 

<p id="p_6">5. At this stage, we may mention that in the present cases, we are also concerned with interpretation of <a href="/doc/65714606/" id="a_6">Section 3A</a> of the Central Excise Act and Rule 96ZQ(5) of the Central Excise Rules which refers to failure on the part of an independent processor to pay duty by specified date. In this connection, it is the case of the department that Clause (5) of Rule 96ZQ specifically refers to payment of penalty equal to amount of duty outstanding from the assessee. It is the case of the department that penalty under the said rule is also for statutory offences; that it is not a case of imposition of penalty and that it is not a case where the adjudicating authority has any discretion in the matter of imposition of penalty. In this connection, reliance is placed by the department on the judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1741822/" id="a_7">Chairman, SEBI v. Shriram Mutual Fund and Anr</a>. . On the other hand, it is the case of the assessee that even Rule 96ZQ(5) should be read down so as to include the requirement of mens rea into Clause (5) of Rule 96ZQ particularly when the said clause begins with the expression "if any independent processor fails to pay the amount of duty". In this connection, the assessee once again placed reliance on the judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1614118/" id="a_8">Dilip N. Shroff v. Jt. CIT</a> (supra).
</p> 

<p id="p_7">6. We quote hereinbelow the provisions of Rule 96ZQ(5):
</p>

</p> 

<p id="p_34">7. In our view, the basic scheme for imposition of penalty under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_24">Section 271(l)(c)</a> of the Income Tax Act, <a href="/doc/92590795/" id="a_25">Section 11AC</a> of the Central Excise Act and Rule 96ZQ(5) of the Central Excise Rules is common. We have gone through the judgment of the Division Bench dated 18-5-2007 in the case of <a href="/doc/1614118/" id="a_26">Dilip N. Shroff v. Jt. CIT</a> (supra).
</p> 

<p id="p_35">8. We are of the view that there is a conflict of opinions between the judgments of the Division Bench of this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1614118/" id="a_27">Dilip N. Shroff v. Jt. CIT</a> (supra) on one hand and on the other hand we have another judgment of this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1741822/" id="a_28">Chairman, SEBI v. Shriram Mutual Fund and Anr</a>. (supra). Secondly, it may be pointed out that the object behind enactment of <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_29">Section 271(l)(c)</a> read with the Explanations quoted above indicates that the said section has been enacted to provide for a remedy for loss of revenue. The penalty under the said section is a civD liability. Wilful concealment is not an essential ingredient for attracting the civil liability as is the case in the matter of prosecution under <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_30">Section 276C</a> of the Act. While considering an appeal against an order made under <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_31">Section 271(l)(c)</a> what is required to be examined is the record which the officer imposing the penalty had before him and if that record can sustain the finding there had been concealment, that would be sufficient to sustain the penalty. Keeping in mind these two circumstances, we are of the view that the judgment of the Division Bench in the case <a href="/doc/1614118/" id="a_32">Dilip N. Shroff v. Jt. CIT</a> (supra) needs consideration. The Explanations added to <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_33">Section 271(l)(c)</a> in that entirety also indicate the element of strict Liability on the assessee for concealment or for giving inaccurate particulars while filing returns. The judgment in Dilip N. Shroff's case (supra) has also not considered the provisions of <a href="/doc/1588208/" id="a_34">Section 276C</a> of the Income Tax Act. Therefore, in our view, the; judgment in the case of <a href="/doc/1614118/" id="a_35">Dilip N. Shroff v. Jt. CIT</a> (supra) needs consideration by the larger Bench of this Court particularly when it has ramifications not only regarding provisions of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_36">Income Tax Act</a> but also with regard to the provisions of Sections 3A and 11 AC of the Central Excise Act and Rule 96ZQ(5) of the Central Excise Rules.
</p> 

<p id="p_36">9. For the aforestated reasons, we direct the Registry to place our order in this batch of civil appeals before the Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India for appropriate directions.
</p> 

<p id="p_37">10. Before concluding, we may mention that in the present cases, the assessee had challenged the vires of Rule 96ZQ(5). By the impugned judgment, the Gujarat High court has read down the said rule incorporating the mens rea requirement. It is made clear that if the larger Bench takes a view to say that the penalty under the said clause is mandatory, then it would still be open to the assessee to challenge the vires of the said Rule 96ZQ(5) and, therefore, in that event, the matter has to be kept before the Division Bench for passing appropriate orders.
