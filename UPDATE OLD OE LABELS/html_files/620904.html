sentences of fine and reducing the sentences of imprisonment
to  the	 periods  already  undergone  by  the  three  living
appellants.
^
     HELD:1 :1.	 In order  to bring  home the  offence under
<a href="/doc/1335368/" id="a_11">section 5</a>  of the  Explosive Substances Act, the prosecution
has  to	 prove:	 (i)  that  the	 substance  in	question  is
explosive  substance;	(ii)  that   the  accused  makes  or
knowingly has  in his  possession or  under his	 control any
explosive substance;  and (iii)	 that he  does so under such
circumstances as to give rise to a reasonable suspicion that
he is not doing so for a lawful object. [75D-G]
     1: 2. The burden of proof of the ingredients of <a href="/doc/1335368/" id="a_12">section
5</a> of  the Explosive  Substances Act,  is on the prosecution.
The moment prosecution has discharged that burden, it shifts
to the	accused to show that he was making or possessing the
explosive substance  for a  lawful object,  if he takes that
plea. [75F-G]
     2. On  a consideration of the evidence of the Explosive
Inspector, and	other evidence,	 the substances	 in question
which were recovered from the appe-
69
llants were  "explosive substances" within the definition of
that expression	 in <a href="/doc/644982/" id="a_13">section  2</a> of  the Explosive  Substances
Act. [76F G]
     3: 1.  The factum	of the recovery of the said articles
from the possession of appellant No. 1 and also the evidence
that his  three sons,  appellants 2  to 4, who were managing
and running  the shop  of M.  F. Maniyar and Sons from which
the incriminating  substances were  seized clearly show that
all of them were guilty. [76 G-H, 77A]
     3: 2.  The several	 substances seized, not being minute
or small in quantity, make it clear that the appellants were
in "conscious  possession" of  the substances  seized within
the meaning  of <a href="/doc/1335368/" id="a_14">section	 5</a> of  the Explosive Substances Act.
[77A-B]
     3: 3. The possession of the explosive substances by the
appellants were	 without any  authority since the appellants
had no licence or authority to make or possess the explosive
substances as  required by the Government of India. Ministry
of Works  &amp; Housing and Urban, notification dated 1st April,
1966. The licence possessed by them is dated 31-3-1956 which
was  not   in  pursuance  and  in  conformity  of  the	said
Government notification. [77G-H]
     3: 4. The knowledge that the particular substance is an
explosive substance  depends on	 different circumstances and
varies from  person to	person. Unlike	an ignorant man or a
child coming  across an	 explosive substance who picks it up
out of	curiosity  not	knowing	 that  it  is  an  explosive
substance, a  person of experience may immediately know that
it is  an explosive  substance. In  the instant case, as the
appellant had  been dealing  with the  substance in question
for long time, they certainly knew or at least they shall be
presumed to  have known	 what those  substances were and for
what purpose they were used. The said presumption is further
fortified from the fact that a half K.G. of blasting powder/
potassium cyanide  was sold  to the  decoy  witness  by	 the
appellants. [78E-F, G]
     4. For  an offence under <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_15">section 120B</a> of the Penal Code
the  prosecution   need	 not   necessarily  prove  that	 the
perpetraters expressly	agreed to do or cause to be done the
illegal act:  the  agreement  may  be  proved  by  necessary
implication. In this case, the fact that the appellants were
possessing and	selling explosive substances without a valid
licence for  a pretty  long time leads to the inference that
they agreed  to do  and/or cause to be done the said illegal
act, for,  without such	 an agreement the act could not have
been done for such a long time.[79G-H, 80A]

<p id="p_6">     The  substantive	sentences  were	  directed  to	 run
concurrently. The  first two  preferred one  appeal and	 the

Court by a common judgment dismissed both the appeals. Hence
this appeal before us
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">71</span>
by special  leave. This common judgment of ours will dispose
of both the appeals.
</p><p id="p_7">     2. During the pendency of the appeal before this Court,
appellant,  Fakhruddin,	  died	on   10.10.1978.  His  legal
representatives have  been brought  on record  as there	 are
sentences of fine against the deceased appellant.
</p><p id="p_8">     3. The  facts necessary  for the purpose of disposal of
these appeals may be stated thus:
</p><p id="p_9">     In the  year 1967	a number of murders were perpetrated
by a  gang of  murderers. During the course of investigation
into these  offences, potassium	 cyanide was  found to	have
been used  for poisoning  the victims. On 11.9.1964, P.W.17,
Bendre, P.S.I, who was attached to the local crime branch at
Sholapur received an information that the firm known as M.F.
Maniyar &amp;  Sons was  selling potassium	chlorate which	is a
highly explosive  substance. He	 then initiated	 the work of
finding out  the persons  responsible for  the supply of the
explosive to  the miscreants.  He received  information that
appellant, Fakhruddin,	was the	 owner of  the shop known as
M.F. Maniyar  &amp;	 Sons,	situated  at  house  No.  383,	East
Mangalwar Peth, Sholapur, and possessed licence for sale and
storage of  potassium chlorate	in House  No.  615  in	East
Mangalwar Peth;	 Fakhruddin with the assistance of his three
sons (appellants  2 to	4) and	his servants  stored at	 the
place mentioned	 in their  shop situated  at house  No. 383,
East Mangalwar	Peth, to persons who did not possess licence
to purchase  potassium chlorate.  P.W. 17  and Sub-inspector
Tasgaokar of  the local	 Intelligence  Branch  proceeded  to
Mangalwar Peth	Police Chowky  and called  a bogus  customer
'Basanna Pujari'  by name. He also called the local panchas.
He, then,  gave a  ten rupee  currency	note  to  P.W.4.  He
initialled the	currency note.	He also gave a bag to P.W.4.
and told him to buy half kg. of potassium chlorate from M/s.
M.F. Maniyar &amp; Sons. P.W.4 went to the shop. He found in the
shop accused  Chandra Kant  (since  acquitted),	 who  was  a
servant of Fakhruddin. P.W.5 gave him the ten rupee currency
note and  asked for half kg. of potassium chlorate. which he
said he	 needed for  blasting purpose. Chandra Kant gave him
half k.g of potassium chlorate and returned an amount of Rs.
2.50p. P.W.4  took the	powder in the bag and was returning.
Police	challenged   him  and	seized	 the   bag.   Police
interrogated him.  He told police in presence of the Panchas
that he had purchased the powder which was inside of the bag
from M.F.  Maniyar and	got back  Rs. 2.50P. P.W.17 searched
the cash box in the firm of Fakhruddin and found
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">72</span>
the ten	 rupee currency note initialled by him. The shop was
searched and  220 grams of Black gun powder was found in the
show case.  He then  alongwith the  panchas went  up to	 the
first floor.  They found  black gun  powder there also. They
found it  to be a mixture of potassium chlorate and sulphate
used for  fire arms. Samples were sealed and one of them was
given to  appellant, Fakhruddin.  A  panchnama,	 Ex.20,	 was
prepared. P.W.17, thought it necessary to send for an expert
to  identify   the  powder.   He,  therefore,	posted	some
constables  at	the  shop,  sealed  appellants'	 godowns  in
Mangalwar Peth	and  Shukrawar	Peth  and  made	 panchnamas,
Exhibits 22  and 23.  Next morning, he sealed both the shops
and  prepared	panchnamas  Exhibits  24  and  25.  On	13th
September, he  sent the samples to the Explosives Inspector.
On the	14th he	 lodged a  complaint at the Jail Road Police
Station at  Sholapur. Police registered a case and the P.S.I
started	 investigation.	  The  P.S.I   sent  for  the  Drugs
Inspector and  the Central  Excise Inspector.  All of  them,
then visited  the appellants'  godowns at  Shukarwar Peth at
Sholapur. They	found the  shops in  the sealed condition. A
search was  conducted in the presence of the appellants. The
Police officer	and others, having observed due formalities,
searched the  premises. In  course of  the search they found
and seized  some powder as per Panchnama, Ex. 27. Samples of
the powder  seized were	 also given to the appellants. After
that they  went and  searched the  appellants'	premises  in
Mangalwar Peth. Nothing incriminating was found there. They,
then, returned	to the	firm M/s.  M.F. Maniyar and searched
it. They found and seized some powders as per Panchnama, Ex.
</p><p id="p_10">28.  Samples  of  these	 powders  also	were  given  to	 the
appellants. On	the same night they found 49 percussion caps
on the roof of the adjacent shop and seized them as per Ext.
</p><p id="p_11">30. On	the same  night P.S. I., Patil, received a panchnama
made by	 P.S.I., Joshi,	 (P.W.18) under which detonators had
been seized.  Acting on an information from P.W. 17. P.W. 18
arrested appellant, Taufik on September 15, 1967. Appellant,
Taufik told the police that he had buried some detonators in
the compound  of his  bungalow and  he would  produce  them.
Accordingly, he	 led P.W.  18  to  his	bungalow  which	 was
admittedly in occupation of all the appellants, removed some
earth under  a mango tree in the premises and took out three
tins containing	 20 packets  of detonators.  It	 was  seized
under panchnama,  Ex. 33.  As the  detonators were explosive
they were  not opened.	Taufik	was  arrested  and  produced
before P.W.17.
</p><p id="p_12">     The Explosives  Inspector was  of the opinion that some
of the	explosives seized  were	 highly	 explosive.  P.W.17,
then, with the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">73</span>
permission  of	 the  District	 Superintendent	 of   Police
destroyed the  explosives as  instructed by  the  Explosives
Inspector.

submitted charge-sheet.	 Eventually the	 appellants and	 the
three other  above named  co-accused were  committed to	 the
court of Sessions for trial.
</p><p id="p_17">     6. The  allegations against the appellants in substance
were that  they agreed to do the following illegal acts; (i)
to acquire  and prepare	 explosives  unauthorisedly  and  to
possess and  supply explosives for illegal purposes; (ii) to
acquire and  possess sulphur  unauthorisedly and to sell the
same; (iii)  to acquire	 and possess and sell gun-powder and
cartridges in  breach  of  the	conditions  of	the  licence

Explosive Substances  Act, and	<a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_35">Section 120B</a>  of  the  Penal

</p><p id="p_20">     9. Let us first consider the conviction under <a href="/doc/1335368/" id="a_38">Section 5</a>
of the	Explosives Substances  Act.  The  Section  reads  as
follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">     5. "Any  person who  makes	 or  knowingly	has  in	 his
     possession	 or   under  his   control   any   explosive
     substance, under  such circumstances as to give rise to
     a reasonable suspicion that he is not making it or does
     not have  it in his possession or under his control for
     a lawful object, shall, unless he can show that he made
     it or had it in his possession or under his control for
     a lawful  object, be punishable with transportation for
     a term  which may	extend to  fourteen years,  to which
     fine may  be added,  or with  imprisonment for  a terms
     which may	extend to  five years,	to which fine may be
     added"</blockquote>
<p id="p_21">     10. In  order to bring home the offence under <a href="/doc/1335368/" id="a_39">Section 5</a>
of the	Explosive Substances  Act, the	prosecution  has  to
prove; (i)  that the  substance	 in  question  is  explosive
substance; (ii)	 that the  accused makes or knowingly has in
his possession or under his control any explosive substance;
and (iii)  that he  does so  under such	 circumstances as to
give rise  to a reasonable suspicion that he is not doing so
for a lawful object.
</p><p id="p_22">     The burden	 of proof  of these  ingredients is  on	 the
prosecution. The  moment the prosecution has discharged that
burden, it  shifts to the accused to show that he was making
or possessing  the explosive  substance for a lawful object,
if he takes that plea.
</p><p id="p_23">     11. Explosive  substance has  been defined in <a href="/doc/644982/" id="a_40">section 2</a>
of the	Explosive  Substances  Act.  The  definition  is  as
follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">	  "2.  In   this  Act	the  expression	  "explosive
     substance" shall be deemed to include any materials for
     making any	 explosive substance;  also  any  apparatus,
     machine, implement	 or material used, or intended to be
     used, or adapted for causing, or aiding in causing, any
     explosion in or with any explosive
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">76</span>
     substance; also any part of any such apparatus, machine
     or implement."</blockquote>
<p id="p_24">     "Explosive	 substance"   has   a	broader	  and	more
comprehensive meaning  than the term 'Explosive', 'Explosive
substance' includes  'Explosive'. The  term 'Explosive'	 has
not been  defined in  the Act. The dictionary meaning of the
word 'Explosive'  is 'tending  to expand  suddenly with loud
noise; 'tending	 to cause  explosion'  (The  Concise  Oxford
Dictionary). <a href="/doc/176528/" id="a_41">In	 the Explosives	 Act</a>, the  terms 'explosive'
has been defined as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_18">	  "4.  In   this  Act,	unless	there  is  something
     repugnant in the Definitions, subject or context,-
     (1) "explosive"
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">     (a)     means  gunpowder,	 nitro-glycerine,  dynamite,
	  guncotton, blasting  powders, fulminate of mercury
	  or of other metals, coloured fires and every other
	  substance,  whether	similar	 to   those   above-
	  mentioned or not, used or manufactured with a view
	  to produce  a practical  effect by explosion, or a
	  pyrotechnic effect; and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_20">     (b)   includes fog-signals,  fireworks, fuses, rockets,
	  percussion-caps,	detonators,	 cartridges,
	  ammunition  of   all	 descriptions,	 and   every
	  adaptation or preparation of an explosive as above
	  defined;"</blockquote>
<p id="p_25">     It may  be mentioned that the definition of 'explosive'
under <a href="/doc/895566/" id="a_42">Section  4</a> was amended later, but we are not concerned
with the  amendment as	the occurrence	in the	instant case
took place before the amendment.
</p><p id="p_26">     On a  consideration of  the evidence  of the Explosives
Inspector, and	other evidence.	 the Sessions  Judge and the
High Court  have found,	 in our	 opinion correctly, that the
substances in  question were explosive substances within the
definition of the expression.
</p><p id="p_27">     12. In  the instant  case, appellant I has admitted, as
stated earlier,	 that these  articles were  seized from	 his
possession. The	 evidence also	shows that  his three  sons,
appellants 2  to 4,  used to  manage and  run the shop M. F.
Maniyar &amp;  Sons from  which the incriminating substance were
seized.
</p><p id="p_28">     13. It  was argued	 by learned  counsel that possession
within the  meaning of <a href="/doc/1335368/" id="a_43">Section 5</a> of the Explosive Substances
Act means
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">77</span>
'conscious possession'.	 There can be no doubt about it. The
substances seized were not minute or small in quantity. They
were  in   large  quantities.  In  fact	 half  k.g.  of	 the
incriminating substance	 was sold  to P. W. 4 by an employee
of the firm. The detonators were produced by appellant No. 3
from the  premises of  the  Bungalow  occupied	by  all	 the
occupants. It  cannot  but,  therefore,	 be  held  that	 the
appellants were	 in 'conscious	possession' of the substance
seized.
</p><p id="p_29">     14. The notification dated 1st of April, 1966 published
by the	Government of  India, Ministry	of Works and Housing
and Urban Development (Ex. 65) reads as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">		       "NOTIFICATION"

     notification of  the Government  of India	in the later
     Department of Labour No. M-1217, dated the 9th February
     1939, the Central Government is pleased to prohibit the
     manufacture,  possession	and   importation   of	 any
     explosive	consisting   of	 or  containing	 sulphur  or
     sulphurate in  admixture with  chlorate or potassium or

<p id="p_30">     The appellants  had no  licence or authority to make or
possess the  explosive substances  as required	by the above
Government notification.  The licence  possessed by  them is
dated 31.3.1956	 (Exhibit 90) which was not in pursuance and
in conformity  of the aforesaid Government Notification. The
possession of  the 'explosive substances' by the appellants,
therefore, were without any authority.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">78</span>
<p id="p_31">     15. Learned  counsel for the appellants cited before us
1939 (2)  All E.  R. 641  in support  of his contention. The
head note of the report reads:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_28">	  "Upon	 an   indictment  against   an	accused	 for
     knowingly	 having	   in	his   possession   explosive
     substances, the  prosecution  has	to  prove  that	 the
     accused was  in possession	 of an	explosive  substance
     within the	 <a href="/doc/1568384/" id="a_45">Explosive Substances  Act</a>, 1883, <a href="/doc/1568384/" id="a_46"> s. 9</a>,  in
     circumstances giving  rise to  a reasonable presumption
     that   possession was not for a lawful object. Proof of
     knowledge by the accused of the explosive nature of the
     substance is  not	essential,  nor	 need  any  chemical
     knowledge on the part of the accused be proved."</blockquote>
<p id="p_32">     The appellants have also cited another English decision
reported in  1957 (1)  All E.R.	 665 in	 which it  has	been
observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_29">	  "We think that the clear meaning of the section is
     that the  person must  not only  knowingly have  in his
     possession the  substance but  must know  that it is an
     explosive substance. The section says he must knowingly
     have  in	his  possession	  an  explosive	  substance;
     therefore it  does seem that it is an ingredient in the
     offence that he knew it was an explosive substance."</blockquote>
<p id="p_33">     With respect, the above decisions lay the correct legal
proposition.  But  the	question  is  whether  in  his	case
appellants  knew   that	 the  substances  in  question	were
explosive substances.  The knowledge  whether  a  particular
substance is  an explosive  substance depends  on  different
circumstances and  varies from person to person. An ignorant
man or a child coming across an explosive substance may pick
it up  out of  curiosity and  not  knowing  that  it  is  an
explosive substance.  A person of experience may immediately
know that it is an explosive substance. In the instant case,
the appellants	had been  dealing  with	 the  substances  in
question for  a long  time. They  certainly knew  or atleast
they shall  be presumed	 to have known what these substances
they were and for what purpose they were used. In fact, when
P. W.  4 Basanna  asked for  half k.  g. of blasting powder,
appellants'  servant,	accused	  Chandrakant,	 immediately
supplied the requisite powder to P. W. 4 from the shop. This
evidence clearly  establishes that  the appellants  did know
the nature  and character  of the substance. In other words,
they knew  that the  substances in  question were  explosive
substances.  The  courts  below	 therefore,  were  right  in
holding that  an offence  under <a href="/doc/1335368/" id="a_47">Section	 5</a> of  the Explosive
Substances Act was committed.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">79</span>
<p id="p_34">     16. Learned  Counsel submitted  that  the	evidence  on
record shows  that appellant, Fakhruddin, alone acquired and
possessed the  substance in  question. That  was the plea of
Fakhruddin. It	also might  be true that Fakhruddin also had
acquired the  substances but  the evidence on record clearly
shows that all the appellants were in possession and control
of  the	 substances  in	 question.  The	 submission  of	 the
appellants has	no substance  and all  the four	 persons are
liable for the offence.
</p><p id="p_35">     17. Now to turn to the conviction under <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_48">Section 120B</a> of
the Penal Code. <a href="/doc/1568384/" id="a_49">Section 120B</a> provides:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_30">	  "120B. (1)  Whoever  is  a  party  to	 a  criminal
     conspiracy to commit an offence punishable........... "</blockquote>
<p id="p_36">     `Criminal conspiracy'  has been  defined under  <a href="/doc/591631/" id="a_50">Section
120A</a> of the Penal Code as follows:
</p><p id="p_37">     "120 A.  When two or more persons agree to do, or cause
to be done.-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_31">     (1)  an illegal act, or
     (2)  an act which is not illegal by illegal means, such
	  an agreement is designated a criminal conspiracy:-</blockquote>
<p id="p_38">     Provided that  no	agreement  except  an  agreement  to
commit an  offence shall  amount to  a	criminal  conspiracy
unless some  tact besides  the agreement  is done  by one or
more parties to such agreement in pursuance thereof.
</p><p id="p_39">     Explanation.-It is	 immaterial whether  the illegal act
is the	ultimate object	 of such  agreement,  or  is  merely
incidental to that object,"
</p><p id="p_40">     The contention  of learned	 counsel is that there is no
evidence of  agreement of  the appellants  to do  an illegal
act.
</p><p id="p_41">     It is  true that  there is	 no evidence  of any express
agreement between  the appellants  to do or cause to be done
the illegal  act. For  an offence  under <a href="/doc/1568384/" id="a_51">section  120B</a>,	 the
prosecution need not necessarily prove that the perpetrators
expressly agreed  to do or cause to be done the illegal act;
the agreement  may be  proved by  necessary implication.  In
this case,  the fact that the appellants were possessing and
selling explosive  substances without  a valid licence for a
pretty
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">80</span>
long time  leads to  the inference  that they  agreed to  do
and/or cause  to be  done the said illegal act, for, without
such an	 agreement the act could not have been done for such
a long time.
</p><p id="p_42">     17. Mr. Lalit additionally submitted that appellant No.
2 Rizwan  did not do any overt act. He was a mere partner of
M/s. M.F. Maniyar &amp; Sons and as such his conviction has been
bad in	law. The  submission is	 not correct. For, appellant
Rizwan himself	in his	statement under	 <a href="/doc/1568384/" id="a_52">Section 342</a>, Cr. P.
C., has	 stated "Myself	 (and) accused	Nos. 1	and 4 looked
after the  business of	the Firm.  M.F. Maniyar &amp; Sons". The
learned courts	below on  a consideration of the evidence on
record have come to the conclusion that he also occasionally
used to	 work in  the firm.  We do  not have valid reason to
differ from them.
</p><p id="p_43">     18. Now comes the question of sentence. The real man in
the entire clandestine trade was appellant no. 1, who is now
dead. The  three other appellants being his sons were merely
assisting him. We are told that appellant no. 2, Rizwan, has
already served	81/2 months of imprisonment and appellants 3
and 4, Usman and Taufik, six months of imprisonment each. In
our view  ends of  justice will	 be met	 if the sentences of
imprisonment are reduced to the periods already undergone by
the three living appellants.
</p><p id="p_44">     In addition to the sentence of imprisonment there was a
fine of	 Rs. 1000/-  each for the offence under <a href="/doc/1335368/" id="a_53">Section 5</a> of
the Explosive  Substances Act  and  also  sentence  of	fine
against	 the  appellants  under	 <a href="/doc/1335368/" id="a_54">Section  5(3)</a>	(b)  of	 the
<a href="/doc/176528/" id="a_55">Explosives Act</a>	and under <a href="/doc/541406/" id="a_56">Section 30</a> of the Arms Act. In our
opinion, ends  of justice  will be  met if  the	 fine  under
<a href="/doc/1335368/" id="a_57">Section 5</a>  of the  Explosives Substances  Act is remitted in
case of	 all the  appellants,  including  appellant  No.  1,
Fakhruddin. With  the above modification in the sentence the
appeals are dismissed.
