</p>
<p id="p_8">             The Court : Pursuant to the order dated January 29, 2016, Advocate for

the first defendant had attempted to serve a covering letter along with the copy of the

papers pertaining to this petition on the plaintiff at Esplanade Mansion, 14, Government

Place (East), a short distance from this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_9">             The plaintiff could not be found at the address and the affidavit of service

claims that there is no existence of the plaintiff at the relevant address. In terms of the

default clause contained in the order of January 29, 2016, a notice has been published

in "The Statesman" on February 6, 2016. The notice indicated that the matter would

appear on February 19, 2016.

</p><p id="p_11">              This petition duly appeared in the list on February 19, 2016 and was taken

up, but since the plaintiff was not represented, the matter was directed to stand over till

today.
</p>
<p id="p_12">              Pursuant to an order dated February 8, 2008, the first defendant made the

deposit of a sum of Rs.1.50 crore with advocate for the plaintiff. However, the plaintiff

does not appear to have taken much interest in the suit thereafter.          The relevant

interlocutory application, GA No.2030 of 2007, was dismissed for default by an order of

May 10, 2011 and the interim order subsisting thereon was vacated. The order dated

May 10, 2011 left it open to the first defendant "to take out an application for refund of

the amount deposited by the first defendant that now remains with advocate

representing the plaintiff."
</p>
<p id="p_13">              A further order of July 26, 2011 recorded the submission of advocate

formerly representing the plaintiff. Advocate for the plaintiff had been appointed receiver

for the purpose of holding the sum of Rs.1.50 crore. The amount was directed to be

invested in a short-term fixed deposit.      The order of July 26, 2011 recorded the

submission of advocate for the plaintiff that he had no instructions in the matter. The

order required the receiver to deposit the entire amount of about Rs.1.75 crore together

with the interest accrued thereon with the Registrar, Original Side and for the receiver to

stand discharged thereupon. The deposit has been made with the Registrar, Original

Side.
</p>
<p id="p_14">              The present petition is for a direction on the Registrar to make over the

entire amount held by the Registrar to the first defendant since the suit has been

dismissed by an order of September 12, 2012.
</p>
<p id="p_15">              Since the plaintiff has shown no interest in the matter despite attempts of

service at the plaintiff's recorded address and the publication of the notice in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                               3</span>


newspaper pursuant to the order dated January 29, 2016, GA No.3420 of 2015 is

allowed by directing the Registrar, Original Side to make over the deposit of about

Rs.1.75 crore together with the interest accrued thereon to the first defendant by way of

a demand draft of any nationalised bank made out in the name of the first defendant.

The entire payment will be made within four weeks from date, upon the Registrar

retaining the usual commission.
</p>
<p id="p_16">             It is made clear that this order is only for the purpose of the refund of the

amount and it will be open to the first defendant to pursue any other remedy against the

plaintiff in accordance with law.
</p>
<p id="p_17">             There will be no order as to costs.
</p>
<p id="p_18">             Urgent certified website copies of this order, if applied for, be supplied to

the parties subject to compliance with all requisite formalities.
