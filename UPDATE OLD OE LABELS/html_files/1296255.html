ACT:
Criminal  Trial--Culpable  homicide  amounting	to  murder--
Prosecution   to   Prove-Presence  and	Nature	 of   Injury
-Intention  to cause that Particular Injury, which  was	 not
accidental  or	unintentional and was  sufficient  to  cause
death  in the ordinary (course of nature--Indian<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1"> Penal	Code</a>
(Act XLII of 1860),<a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_2"> s. 300</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_3">3rdly</a>.



HEADNOTE:
The accused thrust a spear into the abdomen of ,he deceased.
This injury caused his death.  In the opinion of the  doctor
the  injury  was sufficient to cause death in  the  ordinary
course	of nature.  It was found by the Sessions judge	that
the  accused intended to cause grievous hurt only.   In	 his
opinion however the third clause Of<a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_4"> S. 300</a> Indian Penal Code
applied.  He accordingly convicted and sentenced the accused
under <a href="/doc/412767/" id="a_5"> S. 302</a> India,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_6"> Penal Code</a>.  The High Court upheld	 the
conviction,  It was argued that the third clause Of <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_7"> s.	 300</a>
Indian	Penal Code did not apply as it was not	proved	that
the accused intended to inflict a
1496
bodily	injury	that was sufficient to cause  death  in	 the
ordinary course of nature as<a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_8"> s. 300</a> Indian Penal Code  third
clause states, " If it is done with the intention of causing
bodily	injury to any person and the bodily injury  intended
to  be	inflicted is sufficient in the	ordinary  course  of
nature to cause death
Held,  that the prosecution must prove the following  before
it  can	 bring a case under<a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_9"> s. 300</a> Indian Penal	 Code  third
clause.
(1)  It	 must establish, quite objectively,  that  a  bodily
injury is present.
(2)  The  nature  of the injury must be	 proved;  these	 are
purely objective investigations.
(3)  It	 must  be  proved that there  was  an  intention  to
inflict that particular injury, that is to say, that it	 was
not accidental or unintentional, or that some other kind  of
injury was intended.
(4)  It	 must  be proved that the injury of  the  type	just
described  made up of the three elements set out  above	 was
sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of  nature.
This part of the enquiry is purely objective and inferential
and has nothing to do with the intention of the offender.
The third clause of<a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_10"> S. 300</a> Indian Penal Code consists of two
parts.	 Under the first part it must be proved	 that  there
was  an intention to inflict the injury that is found to  be
present and under the second part it must be proved that the
injury	was sufficient in the ordinary course of  nature  to
cause death.  The words " and the bodily injury intended  to
be  inflicted " are merely descriptive.	 All this means	 is,
that  it is not enough to prove that the injury found to  be
present is sufficient to cause death in the ordinary  course
of  nature  ; it must in addition be shown that	 the  injury
found to be present was the injury intended to be inflicted.
Whether	 it  was sufficient to cause death in  the  ordinary
course of nature is a matter of inference or deduction	from
the  proved  facts about the nature of the  injury  and	 has
nothing to do with the question of intention.

Appeal No. 326 of 1956 arising out of the judgment and order

</p><p id="p_3">1958.	March 11.   The Judgment of the Court was  delivered
by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">1497</span>
BOSE  J.-The  appellant Virsa Singh has	 been  sentenced  to
imprisonment for life under<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_11"> s. 302</a> of the Indian Penal	Code
for  the murder of one Khem Singh.  He was  granted  special
leave to appeal by this Court but the leave is limited to
"  the question that on the finding accepted by	 the  Punjab
High Court what offence is made out as having been committed
by the petitioner."
</p><p id="p_4">The appellant was tried with five others under sss.  302/49,
324/149 and 323/149<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_12"> Indian Penal Code</a>.	He was also  charged
individually under<a href="/doc/412767/" id="a_13"> s. 302</a>.
</p><p id="p_5">The other, were acquitted of the murder charge by the  first
Court  but  were convicted under<a href="/doc/1620503/" id="a_14"> ss. 326</a>, <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_15">324</a> and  <a href="/doc/1254475/" id="a_16">323</a>	read

they were all acquitted.
</p><p id="p_6">The appellant was convicted by the first Court under<a href="/doc/412767/" id="a_19"> s.	 302</a>
and  his  conviction and sentence were upheld  by  the	High
Court.
</p><p id="p_7">There was only one injury on Khem Singh and both Courts	 are
agreed	that the appellant caused it.  It was caused as	 the
result	of a spear thrust and the doctor who  examined	Khem
Singh, while he was still alive, said that it was
"  a punctured wound 2" x 1/2"	transverse in  direction  on
the left side of the abdominal wall in the lower part of the
iliac region just above the inguinal canal.
He also said that
" Three coils of intestines were coming out of the wound."
The incident occurred about 8 p. m. on July 13, 1955.	Khem
Singh died about 5 p. m. the following day.
The doctor who conducted the postmortem described the injury
as-
</p><p id="p_8">" an oblique incised stitched wound 21/2" on the lower	part
of left side of belly, 13" above the left inguinal ligament.
The injury was through the whole thickness of the  abdominal
wall.	Peritonitis was present and there was digested	food
in that cavity.	 Flakes of pus were sticking round the small
intestines
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">1498</span>
and  there  were six cuts......... at  various	places,	 and
digested food was flowing out from three cuts."
The  doctor  said that the injury was  sufficient  to  cause
death in the ordinary course of nature.
</p><p id="p_9">The  learned Sessions Judge found that the appellant was  21
or 22 years old and said-
</p><p id="p_10">" When the common object of the assembly seems to have	been
to  cause grievous hurts only, I do not suppose Virsa  Singh
actually had the intention to cause the death of Khem Singh,
but by a rash and silly act he gave a rather forceful  blow,
which	ultimately  caused  his	 death.	  Peritonitis	also
supervened  and that hastened the death of Khem Singh.	 But
for  that Khem Singh may perhaps not have died or  may	have
lived a little longer."
</p><p id="p_11">Basing	on those facts, he said that the case fell under <a href="/doc/1415462/" id="a_20"> s.
300</a>,  <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_21">3rdly</a> and so he convicted under<a href="/doc/412767/" id="a_22"> s. 302</a>,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_23">  Indian  Penal
Code</a>.
</p><p id="p_12">The  learned  High Court Judges considered  that  the  whole
affair	was sudden and occurred on a chance meeting  ".	 But
they  accepted the finding that the appellant inflicted	 the
injury on Khem Singh and accepted the medical testimony that
the blow was a fatal one.
</p><p id="p_13">It  was argued with much circumlocution that the  facts	 set
out  above do not disclose an offence of murder because	 the
prosecution  has not proved that there was an  intention  to
inflict	 a bodily injury that was sufficient to cause  death
in  the ordinary course of nature.  <a href="/doc/1415462/" id="a_24">Section 300</a>,  <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_25">3rdly</a>	 was
quoted:
</p><p id="p_14">" If it is done with the intention of causing bodily  injury
to any person and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted
is  sufficient	in the ordinary course of  nature  to  cause
death."
</p><p id="p_15">It  was	 said that the intention that the  section  requires
must  be related, not only to the bodily  injury  inflicted,
but  also to the clause, "and the bodily injury intended  to
be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of  nature
to cause death."
</p><p id="p_16">This  is  a favourite argument in this kind of case  but  is
fallacious.   If there is an intention to inflict an  injury
that is sufficient to cause death in the ordinary
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">1499</span>
course of nature, then the intention is to kill and in	that
event,	the "thirdly " would be unnecessary because the	 act
would fall under the first part of the section, namely-
"  If the act by which the death is caused is done with	 the
intention of causing death."
</p><p id="p_17">In  our	 opinion,  the	two  clauses  are  disjunctive	 and
separate.  The first is subjective to the offender:
"If  it is done with the intention of causing bodily  injury
to any person."
</p><p id="p_18">It  must, of course, first be found that bodily	 injury	 was
caused	and  the nature of the injury must  be	established,
that is to say, whether the injury is on the leg or the	 arm
or  the stomach, how deep it penetrated, whether  any  vital
organs	were cut and so forth.	These are  purely  objective
facts and leave no room for inference or deduction: to	that
extent	the enquiry is objective; but when it comes  to	 the
question  of intention, that is subjective to  the  offender
and it must be proved that he had an intention to cause	 the
bodily injury that is found to be present.
Once that is found, the enquiry shifts to the next clause-
"  and	the  bodily  injury  intended  to  be  inflicted  is
sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death."
The first part of this is descriptive of the earlier part of
the  section, namely, the infliction of bodily	injury	with
the  intention	to  inflict  it, that  is  to  say,  if	 the
circumstances  justify an inference that a  man's  intention
was only to inflict a blow on the lower part of the leg,  or
some  lesser blow, and it can be shown that the blow  landed
in  the	 region of the heart by accident, then,	 though	 all
injury to the heart is shown to be present, the intention to
inflict ail injury in that region, or of that nature, is not
proved.	 In that case, the first part of the clause does not
come  into  play.  But once it is proved that there  was  an
intention to inflict the injury that is found to be present,
then the earlier part of the clause we are now examining
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">190</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">1500</span>
" and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted " is merely
descriptive.  All it means is that it is not enough to prove
that  the injury found to be present is sufficient to  cause
death in the ordinary course of nature; it must in  addition
be  shown that the injury is of the kind that  falls  within
the  earlier  clause, namely, that the injury  found  to  be
present	 was the injury that was intended to  be  inflicted.
Whether	 it  was sufficient to cause death in  the  ordinary
course of nature is a matter of inference or deduction	from
the  proved  facts about the nature of the  injury  and	 has
nothing to do with the question of intention.
In  considering	 whether the intention was  to	inflict	 the
injury found to have been inflicted, the enquiry  necessarly
proceeds  on broad lines as, for example, whether there	 was
an  intention to strike at a vital or a dangerous spot,	 and
whether	 with sufficient force to cause the kind  of  injury
found  to  have	 been  inflicted.  It  is,  of	course,	 not
necessary  to  enquire	into  every  last  detail  as,	 for
instance,  whether the prisoner intended to have the  bowels
fall  out, or whether he intended to penetrate the liver  or
the  kidneys  or  the heart.  Otherwise, a man	who  has  no
knowledge  of anatomy could never be convicted, for,  if  he
does  not know that there is a heart or a kidney or  bowels,
be  cannot  be	said to have intended to  injure  them.	  Of
course,	 that is not the kind of enquiry.  It is  broadbased
and  simple and based on common sense: the kind	 of  enquiry
that " twelve good men and true could readily appreciate and
understand.
</p><p id="p_19">To put it shortly, the prosecution must prove the  following
facts before it can bring a case under<a href="/doc/1415462/" id="a_26"> s. 300</a>, <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_27">3rdly</a> " ;
First,	it must establish, quite objectively, that a  bodily
injury is present ;
</p><p id="p_20">Secondly, the nature of the injury must be proved; These are
purely objective investigations.
</p><p id="p_21">Thirdly,  it must be proved that there was an  intention  to
inflict that particular bodily injury, that is to say,	that
it  was not accidental or unintentional, or that some  other
kind of injury was intended.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">1501</span>
<p id="p_22">Once  these  three elements are proved to  be  present,	 the
enquiry proceeds further and,
Fourthly, it must be proved that the injury of the type just
described  made	 up of the three elements set out  above  is
sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of  nature.
This part of the enquiry is purely objective and inferential
and has nothing to do with the intention of the offender.
Once these four elements are established by the	 prosecution
(and,	of  course,  the  burden  is  on   the	 prosecution
throughout)  the offence is murder under<a href="/doc/1415462/" id="a_28"> s. 300</a>, <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_29">3rdly</a>.	  It
does not matter that there was no intention to cause  death.
It does not matter that there was Do intention even to cause
an injury of a kind that is sufficient to cause death in the
ordinary  course  of  nature (not that	there  is  any	real
distinction between the two).  It does not even matter	that
there  is  no  knowledge that an act of that  kind  will  be
likely	to  cause death.  Once the intention  to  cause	 the
bodily	injury actually found to be present is	proved,	 the
rest  of  the  enquiry	is purely  objective  and  the	only
question  is  whether,	as  a  matter  of  purely  objective
inference,  the injury is sufficient in the ordinary  course
of  nature  to	cause death.  No one has a  licence  to	 run
around	inflicting  injuries that are  sufficient  to  cause
death  in the ordinary course of nature and claim that	they
are not guilty of murder.  If they inflict injuries of	that
kind,  they  must face the consequences; and they  can	only
escape	if it can be shown, or reasonably deduced  that	 the
injury was accidental or otherwise unintentional.
We  were  referred  to a decision of Lord Goddard  in  R  v.
Steane (1) where the learned Chief Justice says that where a
particular intent must be laid and charged, that  particular
intent must be proved.	Of course it must, and of course  it
must  be proved by the prosecution.  The only question	here
is, what is the extent and nature of the intent that<a href="/doc/1415462/" id="a_30"> s.	 300</a>
<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_31">3rdly</a> requires, and how is it to be proved ?
The  learned  counsel  for the appellant next  relied  on  a
passage where the learned Chief Justice says that:
(1)  [1947] 1 All E. R. 813, 816.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">1502</span>
<p id="p_23">"if, on the totality of the evidence, there is room for more
than  one  view as to the intent of the prisoner,  the	jury
should	be directed that it is for the prosecution to  prove
the  intent to the jury's satisfaction, and if, on a  review
of the whole evidence, they either think that the intent did
not  exist or they are left in doubt as to the	intent,	 the
prisoner is entitled to be acquitted."
</p><p id="p_24">We  agree  that that is also the law in India.	 But  so  is
this.	We  quote  a few sentences  earlier  from  the	same
learned judgment:
</p><p id="p_25">"No  doubt,  if	 the prosecution prove an  act	the  natural
consequences  of  which	 would be a certain  result  and  no
evidence  or  explanation is given, then a jury	 may,  on  a
proper direction, find that the prisoner is guilty of  doing
the act with the intent alleged."
</p><p id="p_26">That   is  exactly  the	 position  here.   No  evidence	  or
explanation is given about why the appellant thrust a  spear
into  the  abdomen of the deceased with such force  that  it
penetrated the bowels and three coils of the intestines came
out of the wound and that digested food oozed out from	cuts
in three places.  In the absence of evidence, or  reasonable
explanation, that the prisoner did not intend to stab in the
stomach with a degree of force sufficient to penetrate	that
far  into  the	body,  or to indicate that  his	 act  was  a
regrettable  accident  and that he  intended  otherwise,  it
would  be  perverse to conclude that he did  not  intend  to
inflict	 the  injury  that  he did.   Once  that  intent  is
established (and no other conclusion is reasonably  possible
in this case, and in any case it is a question of fact), the
rest  is  a  matter for	 objective  determination  from	 the
medical and other evidence about the nature and	 seriousness
of the injury.
</p><p id="p_27">The learned counsel for the appellant referred us to <a href="/doc/772354/" id="a_32">Emperor
v. Sardarkhan Jaridkhan</a> (1) where Beaman J. says that-
" where death is caused by a single blow, it is always	much
more  difficult	 to  be absolutely certain  what  degree  of
bodily injury the offender intended."
</p><p id="p_28">With due respect to the learned Judge he has linked
(1)  (1917) I. L. R. 41 Bom. 27,29.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">1503</span>
<p id="p_29">up  the intent required with the seriousness of the  injury,
and  that,  as	we  have shown,	 is  not  what	the  section
requires.  The two matters are quite separate and  distinct,
though	the evidence about them may sometimes  overlap.	 The
question  is not whether the prisoner intended to inflict  a
serious	 injury or a trivial one but whether he intended  to
inflict the injury that is proved to be present.  If be	 can
show   that  he	 did  not,  or	if  the	 totality   of	 the
circumstances  justify such an inference, then,	 of  course,
the intent that the section requires is not proved.  But  if
there  is  nothing beyond the injury and the fact  that	 the
appellant inflicted it, the only possible inference is	that
he  intended  to  inflict  it.	 Whether  he  knew  of	 its
seriousness,  or intended serious consequences,	 is  neither
here  nor there.  The question, so far as the  intention  is
concerned, is not whether he intended to kill, or to inflict
an injury of a particular degree of seriousness, but whether
he intended to inflict the injury in question; and once	 the
existence of the injury is proved the intention to cause  it
will  be presumed unless the evidence or  the  circumstances
warrant	 an opposite conclusion.- But whether the  intention
is there or not is one of fact and not one of law.   Whether
the  wound  is	serious or otherwise, and  if  serious,	 how
serious, is a totally separate and distinct question and has
nothing	 to  do	 with  the  question  whether  the  prisoner
intended to inflict the injury in question.
It is true that in a given case the enquiry may be linked up
with the seriousness of the injury.  For example, if it	 can
be  proved, or if the totality of the circumstances  justify
an inference, that the prisoner only intended a	 superficial
scratch and that by accident his victim stumbled and fell on
the sword or spear that was used, then of course the offence
is not murder.	But that is not because the prisoner did not
intend	the  injury  that he intended to inflict  to  be  as
serious as it turned out to be but because he did not intend
to inflict the injury in question at all.  His intention  in
such a case would be to inflict a totally different  injury.
The difference is not One of law but
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">1504</span>
one of fact; and whether the conclusion should be one way or
the other is a matter of proof, where necessary, by  calling
in  aid all reasonable inferences of fact in the absence  of
direct testimony.  It is not one for guess-work and fanciful
conjecture.
