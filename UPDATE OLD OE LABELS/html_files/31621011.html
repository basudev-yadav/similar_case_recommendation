</p>


<p id="p_2">1.    Leave granted.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.    The appellant herein was awarded a certain construction work  contract
by the DDA vide a letter of award dated 14th May, 1992.  DDA was building  a
colony consisting of 7,000 houses in Trilok Puri in the  trans-Yamuna  area.
168 Middle Income Group houses and 56 Lower  Income  Group  houses,  Grade-A
Pocket-  B  (balance  work)  was  awarded  for  the   tendered   amount   of
Rs.87,66,678/-. The contract was to be completed in  9  months.  Admittedly,
it was ultimately completed only in 34  months,  the  contractor  completing
166 Middle Income Group houses and 36 Lower Income Group houses.  The  total
value of work that was done  amounted  to  Rs.62,84,845/-.  As  many  as  15
claims were made by the contractor and the High  Court  of  Delhi  appointed
one Shri K.D. Bali to arbitrate the present dispute.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.    We are concerned here with claims 9, 10, 11 and 15, for  these  claims
have been allowed by the Arbitrator  and  the  DDA's  objections  have  been
dismissed by the learned Single Judge  of  the  High  Court  of  Delhi.  The
Division Bench in an appeal under <a href="/doc/1656413/" id="a_1">Section 37</a> of the  Arbitration  Act,  1996
has stepped in to set aside the judgment of the Single  Judge  and  negative
these claims.  We are also concerned with claims 12 and 13 which  have  been
scaled down by the Division Bench.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.    Claims 9, 10, 11 and 15 read as follows:

respondents vide claimant's letter dated 30.10.92 followed by reminders  and
also found place in hindrance register.
</p>
<p id="p_8">b) That this is the actual expenditure incurred and  thus  the  claimant  is

20.7.93 and it continued up to 26.2.94.  During  this  period  no  work  was
allowed to be  executed  in  these  two  blocks  resulting  in  blockade  or
centering and shuttering in the said two blocks.
</p>
<p id="p_12">b) That by stoppage of work in these two blocks the claimants  had  suffered
hire charges of shuttering due to respondent's lapses and defaults.

</p>
<p id="p_18">Claim  No.  15:  Claimants  claim  damages  Rs.6,25,979/-  on   account   of
establishment due to prolongation of the contract.

delays and defaults on the part of the respondents.

</p>
<p id="p_28">d) That the claim of 20% is also lent support from the cost index as  issued

</p>
<p id="p_29">e) That as per cost index it comes to more than 30%  whereas  the  claimants

of facts."
</p>
<p id="p_36">5.    Though the challenge to claims 2, 3 and 4 were given up before the
Division Bench, they are also relevant and read as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_37">"Claim No.2:  Claimants  claim  Rs.1,62,387/-  being  the  reimbursement  of
statutory increase in labour under clause 10-C

</p><p id="p_38">a)  That the claimants submitted the tender on 6.2.92  and  said  offer  was
accepted on 14.5.92. The date  of  commencement  was  to  be  reckoned  from
24.5.92. The date of stipulated completion was 9  months  i.e.  23.2.93  but
the work could be completed on 28.3.95.
</p>
<p id="p_39">b) It is further stated that the claimants had submitted the  bill  for  the

Court.
</p>
<p id="p_46">a)  That it is stated that the claimants had submitted  the  tender  on  the
basis of the rate prevailing but due to the Hon'ble Court's  directions  for

<p id="p_51">f)  That the claimant is entitled for recovery of the said increase.

</p>


<p id="p_55">6.    The Arbitrator by a reasoned award dated 23rd May, 2005 held that  the
entire delay of 25 months in the execution of the project was thanks to  the
DDA, none of this delay being attributable to the  contractor.  The  learned
Arbitrator found:
</p>
<p id="p_56">"That all the above four claims  are  inter  linked  being  related  to  the
overhead expenses and therefore dealt together.
</p>
<p id="p_57">That the date of commencement  of  work  was  24.5.92  and  the  period  for
completion was 9 months and therefore, the disputed date of  completion  was
23.2.93 but the work could be actually completed on 28.3.95.
</p>
<p id="p_58">That there was delay of 25 months in  completion  of  the  work  beyond  the
stipulated date of completion.
</p>
<p id="p_59">That the  Claimants  urged  that  there  had  been  various  delays  in  the
execution of work due to the lapses and defaults  of  the  Respondents  from
the very commencement of work. The progress was held up time and  again  and
the claimants therefore, as back as 17.2.93  advised  the  Respondents  (C-9
page 167) that the Claimants are not interested to execute the  work  beyond
the  stipulated  date  of  completion  and  therefore,  their  contract   be
finalized on the stipulated date of completion as the  Claimants   shall  be
exposed  to  incur  heavy   expenditure   in   overheads   for   maintaining
establishment watch and ward and  tools  and  plants  and  other  shuttering
material but the Respondents did not refute. The  chief  reasons  for  delay
are highlighted below:-
</p>
<p id="p_60">I)  Delay in supply of structural and architectural drawings.
</p>
<p id="p_61">II) That out of 9 Blocks 2 blocks are abnormally delayed as the site of  the
said 21 blocks was made available in piecemeal which stretched till  26.2.94
whereas the stipulated completion was 23.2.93.
</p>
<p id="p_62">III) Delay in laying the conduit  by  the  electrical  agency  resulting  in
delay in casting of RCC slab and plastering work besides  development  work.
The said hindrance was removed lastly on 28.3.95.
</p>
<p id="p_63">IV) Abnormal delay in  making  availability  of  the  alignment  sketch  for
electrical cables.
</p>
<p id="p_64">V) Inordinate delay in supply of stipulated material such as  cement,  steel
and pipes.
</p>
<p id="p_65">VI) Delay in decision of finishing work in kitchen and bath rooms.
</p>
<p id="p_66">VII) There was inordinate delay in making availability of colour scheme.
</p>
<p id="p_67">VIII) That the Respondents  also  abnormally  delayed  the  supply  of  door
shutters which were to  be  supplied  by  the  Respondents.  The  same  were
supplied as late as 8.11.94.
</p>
<p id="p_68">IX) Inordinate delay in writing in  the  electrical  conduits  resulting  in
delay in completion of finishing work.
</p>
<p id="p_69">X) Suspension of work by the Respondents for the period 17.1.94  to  25.2.94
and from 7.8.94 to 22.3.95 because of non-removal of hindrances.
</p>
<p id="p_70">XI) Delayed payment due  to  non-sanction  of  Administrative  Approval  and
Expenditure Sanction.
</p>
<p id="p_71">That all the delays as set out had been duly recorded 733 to 739 and  M.A.S.
register pages from  747  to  768  as  highlighted  by  the  Claimants.  The
Claimants also relied upon certain documents of  MAS  Register  supplied  by
the Respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_72">That the Claimants further stated that the Claimants had also filed  reasons
for delay and hold up of the work various defaults  of  the  Respondents  in
Annexure  pages  740  to   746.   The   Claimants   also   highlighted   the
correspondence made by the Claimants with Respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_73">That the Claimants further stated that the said  hindrances  were  avoidable
but the Respondents did not take timely steps.
</p>
<p id="p_74">That the Claimants also referred the contents of the  letter  dated  10.7.95
(page  885)  wherein  it  was  observed  that  the  Superintending  Engineer
appreciated the working of the Claimants and also observed  that  there  was
no fault of the contractor and they have successfully  completed  the  work.
The Claimants further stated that, they had incurred  heavy  expenditure  on
overheads of the lapses and default of the Respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_75">As against this the Respondents stated that there was poor planning  of  the
claimants and also contended that since the  compensation  has  been  levied
under Clause 2 of the agreement therefore, claim of the  claimants  deserves
to be rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_76">That on record it is conclusively  proved  that  the  Respondents  committed
breach of contract as they failed to discharge  their  obligations  in  time
resulting in prolongations did not deny the  deployment  of  the  tools  and
plants  and  machinery  at  site  besides  watch   and   ward   during   the
prolongation."
</p>


<p id="p_77">7.    It is important to note that before the Division  Bench,  the  learned
counsel for the DDA conceded that this being a  pure  finding  of  fact,  he
would not be challenging it before the Division Bench.
</p>
<p id="p_78">8.    Of the total claim of Rs.37.28 lakhs, the learned  Arbitrator  awarded
an  amount  of  Rs.23.39  lakhs.   Further,  the  learned   Arbitrator   has
laboriously gone through all the evidence and  answered  each  claim  giving
reasons for the same.
</p>
<p id="p_79">9.    By a judgment dated 3rd April, 2006, the learned Single Judge  of  the
High Court of Delhi dismissed the objections  of  the  DDA  and  upheld  the
award. In an appeal filed under <a href="/doc/1656413/" id="a_2">Section 37</a> of the Arbitration Act, vide  the
impugned judgment dated 8th February, 2012, a Division  Bench  of  the  High
Court of Delhi set aside the judgment of the Single Judge on claims  9,  10,
11 and 15, and negatived these claims in toto.  Further, claims  12  and  13
were scaled down doing "rough and ready justice".  Resultantly, the  awarded
amount of Rs.7,20,000/- was scaled down to Rs. 5,57,137.50/-.
</p>
<p id="p_80">10.   We have heard learned counsel for  the  parties.  Shri  M.  L.  Verma,
learned Senior Advocate appearing on  behalf  of  the  appellant,  submitted
that the Division Bench has lost sight of the law laid down by this  Hon'ble
Court when it comes to challenges made to arbitral awards under  <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_3">Section  34</a>
of the Act. He has submitted that the Division Bench has acted  as  if  this
was a first appeal from  the  award  and  has  further  submitted  that  the
Division Bench has taken into account facts which were neither  pleaded  nor
proved before the learned Arbitrator in order to  negative  certain  claims.
He further submitted that  it  is  not  possible  for  a  Bench  hearing  an
objection against an arbitral award to do "rough and ready justice" - it  is
bound by the law laid down by this Hon'ble Court. In particular,  he  argued
that the conceded position is that 25  months  delay  was  due  to  the  DDA
alone.  The award read as a whole is  just,  fair  and  reasonable  as  only
certain claims have been granted and every claim granted has been  supported
with reasons. The Arbitrator is the sole judge of the quality  and  quantity
of evidence before him and he has decided on that evidence.   No  errors  of
law arise from the award and the award  has,  therefore,  been  wrongly  set
aside.
</p>
<p id="p_81">11.   Mr. Amarendra Sharan, learned Senior Advocate appearing on  behalf  of
the DDA has relied strongly on clause 10C  and  clause  22  to  support  the
judgment of the Division bench and has further argued that  there  has  been
duplication so far as certain claims are concerned. He argued that an  award
in the teeth of clause 10C and clause 22 would  be  a  jurisdictional  error
which would vitiate the award.
</p>
<p id="p_82">12.   In as much as serious objections  have  been  taken  to  the  Division
Bench judgment on the ground that it has ignored the  parameters  laid  down
in a series of judgments by this Court as to the limitations which  a  Judge
hearing objections to an arbitral award under <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_4">Section 34</a> is subject  to,  we
deem it necessary to state the law on the subject.
</p>
<p id="p_83"><a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_5">Section 34</a> of the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_6">Conciliation Act</a> reads as follows-
</p>
<p id="p_84">"Application for setting aside  arbitral  award.-(1)  Recourse  to  a  Court
against an arbitral award may be made only by  an  application  for  setting
aside such award in accordance with sub-section (2) and sub-section (3).
</p>
<p id="p_85">(2) An arbitral award may be set aside by the Court only if-
</p>
<p id="p_86">(a) the party making the application furnishes proof that-

</p>
<p id="p_91">Provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration  can  be
separated from those not so submitted, only that part of the arbitral  award
which contains decisions on matters not submitted to arbitration may be  set
aside; or

</p><p id="p_92">(v) the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral  procedure  was
not in accordance with the agreement of the parties, unless  such  agreement
was in conflict with a provision of this Part from which the parties  cannot
derogate, or, failing such agreement, was not in accordance with this  Part;
or

</p><p id="p_93">(b) the Court finds that-

</p><p id="p_95">(ii) the arbitral award is in conflict with the public policy of India.
</p>
<p id="p_96">Explanation.-Without prejudice to the generality of sub-clause (ii),  it  is
hereby declared, for the avoidance  of  any  doubt,  that  an  award  is  in
conflict with the public policy of India if the  making  of  the  award  was
induced or affected by fraud or corruption or was in  violation  of  <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_7">Section
75</a> or <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_8">Section 81</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_97">(3) An application for setting aside may not  be  made  after  three  months
have elapsed from the date on which the party making  that  application  had
received the arbitral award or, if a request had  been  made  under  <a href="/doc/1154891/" id="a_9">Section

sufficient cause from making the  application  within  the  said  period  of
three months it may entertain the application within  a  further  period  of
thirty days, but not thereafter.
</p>
<p id="p_99">(4) On receipt of an application  under  sub-section  (1),  the  Court  may,
where it is appropriate and it is so  requested  by  a  party,  adjourn  the
proceedings for a period of time determined by  it  in  order  to  give  the
arbitral tribunal an opportunity to resume the arbitral  proceedings  or  to
take such  other  action  as  in  the  opinion  of  arbitral  tribunal  will
eliminate the grounds for setting aside the arbitral award."
</p>


<p id="p_100">           This Section in conjunction with <a href="/doc/1091250/" id="a_10">Section 5</a> makes  it  clear  that
an arbitration award that is governed by  part  I  of  the  Arbitration  and
<a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_11">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996 can be set aside  only  on  grounds  mentioned  under
<a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_12">Section 34</a> (2) and (3), and not otherwise. <a href="/doc/1091250/" id="a_13">Section 5</a> reads as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_101">       "5.  Extent  of   judicial   intervention.-Notwithstanding   anything
contained in any other law for the time being in force, in matters  governed
by this  Part,  no  judicial  authority  shall  intervene  except  where  so
provided in this Part."
</p>


<p id="p_102">            It is important to  note  that  the  1996  Act  was  enacted  to
replace the 1940 <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_14">Arbitration  Act</a>  in  order  to  provide  for  an  arbitral
procedure which is fair, efficient and  capable  of  meeting  the  needs  of
arbitration; also  to  provide  that  the  tribunal  gives  reasons  for  an
arbitral award; to ensure that the tribunal remains  within  the  limits  of
its jurisdiction; and to minimize the supervisory roles  of  courts  in  the
arbitral process.

public policy of India that the merits  of  an  arbitral  award  are  to  be
looked into under certain specified circumstances.

the provisions of the <a href="/doc/27905/" id="a_18">Foreign Exchange Regulation Act</a> would be  contrary  to
the public policy of India in that the statute is enacted for  the  national
economic interest to ensure that the nation does not lose  foreign  exchange
which is essential for the economic survival of the nation  (see  para  75).
Equally, disregarding orders passed by the superior courts  in  India  could
also be a contravention of the fundamental policy of  Indian  law,  but  the
recovery of compound interest on interest, being contrary to  statute  only,
would not contravene  any  fundamental  policy  of  Indian  law  (see  paras
85,95).

this Court in ONGC v. Saw Pipes, 2003 (5) SCC 705, held-
</p>
<p id="p_113">      "31. Therefore, in our view, the phrase "public policy of India"  used
in <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_21">Section 34</a> in context is required to be given a wider meaning. It can  be
stated that  the  concept  of  public  policy  connotes  some  matter  which
concerns public good and the public interest. What is for public good or  in
public interest or what would be injurious or harmful to the public good  or
public interest has varied from time to time. However, the award  which  is,
on the face of it, patently in violation of statutory provisions  cannot  be
said to be in public interest. Such  award/judgment/decision  is  likely  to
adversely affect the administration  of  justice.  Hence,  in  our  view  in
addition to narrower meaning given to the term "public policy"  in Renusagar
case [1994 Supp (1) SCC 644] it is required to be held that the award  could
be set aside if it is patently illegal. The result would be  -  award  could
be set aside if it is contrary to:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      (a) Fundamental policy of Indian law; or

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">      (d) in addition, if it is patently illegal.</blockquote>

<p id="p_114">      Illegality must go to the root of the matter and if the illegality  is
of trivial nature it cannot  be  held  that  award  is  against  the  public
policy. Award could also be set aside if it is so  unfair  and  unreasonable
that it shocks the conscience of the court. Such award is opposed to  public
policy and is required to be adjudged void.

<p id="p_136">      (vi) there is nothing  on  record  to  suggest  that  stipulation  for

can, however, be noticed from the decision of this Court in ONGC  Ltd.v. Saw

and <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_32">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India  came  to  be  considered.  This
Court therein was dealing with unequal bargaining power of the  workmen  and

which is patently arbitrary and/or  otherwise  arrived  at  because  of  the
unequal bargaining power would not only be ultra vires  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_33">Article  14</a>  of  the
Constitution of India but also hit by <a href="/doc/1625889/" id="a_34">Section  23</a>  of  the  Indian  Contract
Act. In ONGC [(2003) 5 SCC 705] this Court, apart  from  the  three  grounds

</p>
<p id="p_168">Fundamental Policy of Indian Law

      Coming to each of the heads contained in the Saw  Pipes  judgment,  we
will first deal with the head "fundamental policy of  Indian  Law".  It  has
already been seen from the Renusagar judgment that violation of the  <a href="/doc/27905/" id="a_49">Foreign
Exchange Act</a> and disregarding orders of superior courts in  India  would  be
regarded as being contrary to the fundamental policy of Indian law. To  this
it could be added that the binding effect of  the  judgment  of  a  superior
court being disregarded  would  be  equally  violative  of  the  fundamental
policy of Indian law.
</p>
<p id="p_169">      In a recent judgment, ONGC Ltd. v. Western  Geco  International  Ltd.,
2014 (9) SCC 263, this Court added  three  other  distinct  and  fundamental
juristic principles which must be understood as a part  and  parcel  of  the
fundamental policy of Indian law. The Court held-
</p>
<p id="p_170">"35. What then would constitute the "fundamental policy of  Indian  law"  is
the question. The decision in ONGC [ONGC Ltd. v. Saw Pipes  Ltd.,  (2003)  5
SCC 705] does not elaborate that aspect. Even so, the  expression  must,  in
our opinion, include all such fundamental principles as  providing  a  basis
for administration of justice  and  enforcement  of  law  in  this  country.
Without meaning to exhaustively enumerate  the  purport  of  the  expression
"fundamental policy of Indian law", we  may  refer  to  three  distinct  and
fundamental juristic principles that must necessarily  be  understood  as  a
part and parcel of the fundamental  policy  of  Indian  law.  The first  and
foremost is the principle that in every determination whether by a court  or
other authority that affects the rights of a citizen or leads to  any  civil
consequences, the court or authority concerned is bound to adopt what is  in
legal parlance called a "judicial approach"  in  the  matter.  The  duty  to
adopt a  judicial  approach  arises  from  the  very  nature  of  the  power
exercised by the court or the authority does not have to  be  separately  or
additionally enjoined upon the fora concerned. What must  be  remembered  is
that the importance of a judicial approach in  judicial  and  quasi-judicial
determination lies in the fact that so long as the court,  tribunal  or  the
authority exercising powers that affect the rights  or  obligations  of  the
parties before them shows fidelity to judicial approach, they cannot act  in
an arbitrary, capricious or  whimsical  manner.  Judicial  approach  ensures
that the authority acts bona fide and deals with  the  subject  in  a  fair,
reasonable and objective manner and that its decision  is  not  actuated  by
any extraneous consideration. Judicial approach in  that  sense  acts  as  a
check against flaws and faults that can render  the  decision  of  a  court,
tribunal or authority vulnerable to challenge.
</p>
<p id="p_171">38. Equally important and indeed fundamental to the policy of Indian law  is
the principle that a court and so  also  a  quasi-judicial  authority  must,
while determining the rights and obligations of parties before it, do so  in
accordance  with  the   principles   of   natural   justice.   Besides   the
celebrated audi alteram partem rule one of the facets of the  principles  of
natural justice is that the court/authority deciding the matter  must  apply
its mind to the attendant facts and circumstances while taking  a  view  one
way or the other. Non-application of mind is a defect that is fatal  to  any
adjudication. Application of mind is best demonstrated by disclosure of  the
mind and disclosure of mind is best done by recording reasons in support  of
the decision which the court or authority is taking.  The  requirement  that
an adjudicatory authority must apply its mind is, in that  view,  so  deeply
embedded in our jurisprudence that it can  be  described  as  a  fundamental
policy of Indian law.
</p>
<p id="p_172">39. No less  important  is  the  principle  now  recognised  as  a  salutary
juristic  fundamental  in  administrative  law  that  a  decision  which  is
perverse or so irrational that no reasonable person would  have  arrived  at
the  same  will  not  be  sustained  in  a  court  of  law.  Perversity   or
irrationality of  decisions  is  tested  on  the  touchstone  of  Wednesbury
principle [Associated Provincial Picture Houses  Ltd. v. Wednesbury  Corpn.,
(1948) 1 KB 223: (1947) 2 All ER  680  (CA)]  of  reasonableness.  Decisions
that fall short of the standards of reasonableness are open to challenge  in
a court of law often in writ jurisdiction of  the  superior  courts  but  no
less in statutory processes wherever the same are available.
</p>
<p id="p_173">40. It is neither necessary nor proper  for  us  to  attempt  an  exhaustive
enumeration of what would constitute the fundamental policy  of  Indian  law
nor is it possible  to  place  the  expression  in  the  straitjacket  of  a
definition. What is important in the context of the case at hand is that  if
on facts proved before them the arbitrators fail to draw an inference  which
ought to have been drawn or if they have drawn an inference which is on  the
face of it, untenable resulting in miscarriage of justice, the  adjudication
even when made by an Arbitral Tribunal  that  enjoys  considerable  latitude
and play at the joints in making awards will be open to  challenge  and  may
be cast away or modified depending upon whether the offending part is or  is
not severable from the rest."
</p>


<p id="p_174">      It is clear that the  juristic  principle  of  a  "judicial  approach"
demands that a decision be fair, reasonable and objective.  On  the  obverse
side,  anything  arbitrary  and  whimsical  would   obviously   not   be   a
determination which would either be fair, reasonable or objective.
</p>
<p id="p_175">            The  Audi  Alteram  Partem  principle  which  undoubtedly  is  a
fundamental juristic principle in Indian law is also contained  in  <a href="/doc/1633982/" id="a_50">Sections
18</a> and <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_51">34</a> (2) (a) (iii) of  the  Arbitration  and  <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_52">Conciliation  Act</a>.  These
Sections read as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_176">"18. Equal  treatment  of  parties.-  The  parties  shall  be  treated  with
equality and each party shall be given a full  opportunity  to  present  his
case.
</p>
<p id="p_177">34. Application for setting aside arbitral award.-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">      (2) An arbitral award may be set aside by the Court only if-

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">      (a) the party making the application furnishes proof that-</blockquote>

<p id="p_178">       (iii) the party making the application was not  given  proper  notice
of the appointment of an arbitrator or of the arbitral  proceedings  or  was
otherwise unable to present his case; "
</p>


<p id="p_179">      The third juristic principle is that a decision which is  perverse  or
so irrational that no reasonable person would have arrived at  the  same  is
important and requires some degree of explanation. It is  settled  law  that
where-
</p>
<p id="p_180">a finding is based on no evidence, or

an  arbitral  tribunal  takes  into  account  something  irrelevant  to  the
decision which it arrives at; or

ignores vital evidence in arriving at its decision,

such decision  would  necessarily  be  perverse.  A  good  working  test  of
perversity is contained  in  two  judgments.  In  H.B.  Gandhi,  Excise  and
Taxation Officer-cum-Assessing Authority v. Gopi Nath &amp; Sons, 1992 Supp  (2)
SCC 312 at p. 317, it was held:
</p><p id="p_181">"7. ...................It is, no doubt, true that if a finding  of  fact  is
arrived at by ignoring or excluding relevant  material  or  by  taking  into
consideration irrelevant material or if the finding so  outrageously  defies
logic as to suffer from the vice of irrationality  incurring  the  blame  of
being perverse, then, the finding is rendered infirm in law."
</p>


<p id="p_182"><a href="/doc/136341809/" id="a_53">In Kuldeep Singh v. Commr. of Police</a>, (1999) 2 SCC 10 at  para  10,  it  was
held:
</p>
<p id="p_183">"10. A broad distinction  has,  therefore,  to  be  maintained  between  the
decisions which are perverse and those which  are  not.  If  a  decision  is
arrived at on no evidence or evidence which is thoroughly unreliable and  no
reasonable person would act upon it, the order would  be  perverse.  But  if
there is some evidence on record which is  acceptable  and  which  could  be
relied upon, howsoever compendious it may be, the conclusions would  not  be
treated as perverse and the findings would not be interfered with."
</p>


<p id="p_184">      It must clearly be understood  that  when  a  court  is  applying  the
"public policy" test to an arbitration award, it does not act as a court  of
appeal and consequently errors of fact cannot be corrected. A possible  view
by the arbitrator on facts has necessarily to pass muster as the  arbitrator
is the ultimate master of the quantity and quality of evidence to be  relied
upon when he delivers his arbitral award. Thus  an  award  based  on  little
evidence or on evidence which does not measure up in quality  to  a  trained
legal mind would not be held to be invalid on  this  score[1].  Once  it  is
found that the arbitrators approach is not arbitrary or capricious, then  he
is the last word on facts. <a href="/doc/478091/" id="a_54">In P.R. Shah, Shares &amp; Stock Brokers (P) Ltd.  v.
B.H.H. Securities (P) Ltd</a>., (2012) 1 SCC 594, this Court held:
</p>
<p id="p_185">"21. A court does not sit in appeal over the award of an  Arbitral  Tribunal
by reassessing or reappreciating the evidence. An award  can  be  challenged
only under the grounds mentioned in <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_55">Section 34(2)</a> of the Act.  The  Arbitral
Tribunal has examined the facts and held that  both  the  second  respondent
and the appellant  are  liable.  The  case  as  put  forward  by  the  first
respondent has been accepted. Even the minority view  was  that  the  second
respondent was liable as claimed by the first respondent, but the  appellant
was not liable only on the ground that  the  arbitrators  appointed  by  the
Stock Exchange under Bye-law 248, in a claim against a  non-member,  had  no
jurisdiction to decide a claim against another member. The  finding  of  the
majority is that the appellant did  the  transaction  in  the  name  of  the
second  respondent  and  is  therefore,  liable  along   with   the   second
respondent. Therefore, in the absence of any ground under <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_56">Section  34(2)</a>  of
the Act, it is not possible to re-examine the facts to find  out  whether  a
different decision can be arrived at."
</p>
<p id="p_186">      It is with  this  very  important  caveat  that  the  two  fundamental
principles which form part of the fundamental policy  of  Indian  law  (that
the arbitrator must have a judicial  approach  and  that  he  must  not  act
perversely) are to be understood.
</p>
<p id="p_187">      Interest of India

            The next ground on which an award may be set aside  is  that  it
is contrary to the interest of India. Obviously, this concerns  itself  with
India as a member of the world  community  in  its  relations  with  foreign
powers. As at present advised, we need not dilate on  this  aspect  as  this
ground may need to evolve on a case by case basis.
</p><p id="p_188">      Justice
      The third ground of public policy is, if an award is  against  justice
or morality. These are two different concepts in law. An award can  be  said
to be against justice only when it shocks the conscience of  the  court.  An
illustration of this can be given. A claimant is  content  with  restricting
his claim, let us say to Rs. 30 lakhs in a statement  of  claim  before  the
arbitrator and at no  point  does  he  seek  to  claim  anything  more.  The
arbitral award ultimately awards him 45 lakhs without any acceptable  reason
or justification. Obviously, this would shock the conscience  of  the  court
and the arbitral award would be liable to be set aside on  the  ground  that
it is contrary to "justice".
</p><p id="p_189">      Morality

      The other ground is of "morality".  Just  as  the  expression  "public
policy" also occurs in <a href="/doc/1625889/" id="a_57">Section 23</a> of the Indian Contract Act,  so  does  the
expression  "morality".  Two  illustrations  to   the   said   section   are
interesting for they explain to us the scope of the expression "morality".
</p>
<p id="p_190">"(j) A, who is B's Mukhtar, promises to exercise  his  influence,  as  such,
with B in  favour  of C,  and C promises  to  pay  1,000  rupees   to A. The
agreement is void, because it is immoral.
</p>
<p id="p_191">(k) A agrees  to  let  her  daughter  to  hire  to B for  concubinage.   The
agreement is void, because it is immoral, though  the  letting  may  not  be
punishable under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_58"> the Indian Penal Code</a> (XLV of 1860)."
</p>


<p id="p_192">      In Gherulal Parekh v. Mahadeo Dass Maiya, 1959 Supp (2) SCR 406,  this
Court explained the concept of "morality" thus-
</p>
<p id="p_193">"Re. Point 3 - Immorality: The argument under this head  is  rather  broadly
stated by the  learned  Counsel  for  the  appellant.  The  learned  counsel
attempts to draw an analogy from the Hindu Law relating to the  doctrine  of
pious obligation of sons to discharge  their  father's  debts  and  contends
that what the Hindu  Law  considers  to  be  immoral  in  that  context  may
appropriately be applied to a case under<a href="/doc/1625889/" id="a_59"> s. 23</a> of the Contract Act.  Neither
any authority is cited nor any legal basis is suggested  for  importing  the
doctrine of Hindu Law  into  the  domain  of  contracts.  <a href="/doc/1625889/" id="a_60">Section 23</a> of  the
Contract Act is inspired by the common law of England and it would  be  more
useful to refer to the English Law than to the Hindu Law texts dealing  with
a different matter. Anson in his Law of Contracts states at p. 222 thus:
</p>
<p id="p_194">      "The only aspect of immorality with which Courts of Law have dealt  is
sexual immorality........... ."
</p>
<p id="p_195">      Halsbury in his Laws of England, 3rd Edn., Vol.  8,  makes  a  similar
statement, at p. 138 :
</p>
<p id="p_196">      "A contract which is made upon an  immoral  consideration  or  for  an
immoral purpose is unenforceable,  and  there  is  no  distinction  in  this
respect between immoral and illegal contracts. The immorality  here  alluded
to is sexual immorality."
</p>
<p id="p_197">      In the Law of Contract by Cheshire and Fifoot, 3rd Edn., it is  stated
at p. 279:
</p>
<p id="p_198">      "Although Lord Mansfield laid it down that  a  contract  contra  bonos
mores is illegal, the law in this connection gives no  extended  meaning  to
morality, but concerns itself only with what is sexually reprehensible."
</p>
<p id="p_199">      In the book on the <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_61">Indian Contract Act</a> by  Pollock  and  Mulla  it  is
stated at p. 157:
</p>
<p id="p_200">      "The epithet "immoral" points, in legal usage, to conduct or  purposes
which the State, though disapproving them, is unable,  or  not  advised,  to
visit with direct punishment."
</p>
<p id="p_201">       The  learned  authors  confined  its  operation  to  acts  which  are
considered to be immoral according to the standards of  immorality  approved
by Courts. The case law both in England and India confines the operation  of
the doctrine to sexual immorality. To cite only some instances:  settlements
in consideration of concubinage, contracts of sale or hire of things  to  be
used in a brothel  or  by  a  prostitute  for  purposes  incidental  to  her
profession,  agreements  to  pay  money  for  future  illicit  cohabitation,
promises in regard to marriage for consideration, or contracts  facilitating
divorce are all held to be void on the ground that the object is immoral.
</p>
<p id="p_202">      The word "immoral" is a very comprehensive word. Ordinarily  it  takes
in every aspect of personal conduct deviating from  the  standard  norms  of
life. It may also be said that what  is  repugnant  to  good  conscience  is
immoral. Its varying content depends upon  time,  place  and  the  stage  of
civilization of a particular society. In short, no  universal  standard  can
be laid down and any law  based  on  such  fluid  concept  defeats  its  own
purpose.  The  provisions  of <a href="/doc/1625889/" id="a_62"> S. 23</a>  of  the  Contract  Act  indicate   the
legislative intention to give it a  restricted  meaning.  Its  juxtaposition
with an equally illusive concept, public policy, indicates that it  is  used
in a restricted sense; otherwise there  would  be  overlapping  of  the  two
concepts. In its wide sense what is immoral may be  against  public  policy,
for  public  policy  covers  political,  social  and  economic   ground   of
objection. Decided cases and  authoritative  text-book  writers,  therefore,
confined it, with every justification, only to sexual immorality. The  other
limitation imposed on the word by the statute, namely,  "the  court  regards
it as immoral", brings out the idea that it is also a branch of  the  common
law like the doctrine of public policy, and, therefore, should  be  confined
to the principles recognized and settled by Courts. Precedents  confine  the
said concept only to sexual immorality and no case has been brought  to  our
notice where it has been applied to any head other than  sexual  immorality.
In the circumstances, we cannot evolve a new head so as to bring  in  wagers
within its fold."
</p>


<p id="p_203">      This Court has confined morality to sexual morality so far as  <a href="/doc/1625889/" id="a_63">section
23</a> of the Contract Act is concerned, which in the  context  of  an  arbitral
award would mean the enforcement of an award say  for  specific  performance
of a contract involving prostitution. "Morality"  would,  if  it  is  to  go
beyond sexual morality necessarily cover such agreements as are not  illegal
but would not be enforced given the prevailing mores of the  day.   However,
interference on this ground would also  be  only  if  something  shocks  the
court's conscience.
</p><p id="p_204">      Patent Illegality
            We now come to the fourth head of public policy  namely,  patent
illegality. It must be remembered that under the explanation to  <a href="/doc/1219022/" id="a_64">section  34</a>
(2) (b), an award is said to be in conflict with the public policy of  India
if the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud  or  corruption.
This ground is perhaps the earliest ground on which courts  in  England  set
aside awards under English law. Added  to  this  ground  (in  1802)  is  the
ground that an arbitral award would be set aside if there were an  error  of
law by the arbitrator. This is explained by Lord Justice  Denning  in  <a href="/doc/567147/" id="a_65">R  v.
Northumberland Compensation Appeal Tribunal</a>. Ex Parte Shaw., 1952 1  All  ER
122 at page 130:
</p><p id="p_205">"Leaving  now  the  statutory  tribunals,  I  turn  to  the  awards  of  the
arbitrators. The Court of King's Bench never interfered by  certiorari  with
the award of an arbitrator, because  it  was  a  private  tribunal  and  not
subject to the prerogative writs. If the  award  was  not  made  a  rule  of
court, the only course available to an aggrieved  party  was  to  resist  an
action on the award or to file a bill in equity. If the  award  was  made  a
rule of court, a motion could be made to the  court  to  set  it  aside  for
misconduct of  the  arbitrator  on  the  ground  that  it  was  procured  by
corruption or other undue means: see the statute 9 and 10 Will. III, c.  15.
At one time an award could not be upset on the ground of  error  of  law  by
the arbitrator because that could not be said  to  be  misconduct  or  undue
means, but ultimately it was held in Kent v.  Elstob,   (1802)  3  East  18,
that an award could be set aside for error of law on the face  of  it.  This
was regretted by Williams, J., in Hodgkinson v. Fernie,  (1857)  3  C.B.N.S.
189, but is now well established."
</p>


<p id="p_206">            This, in  turn,  led  to  the  famous  principle  laid  down  in
<a href="/doc/525017/" id="a_66">Champsey Bhara Company v. The Jivraj Balloo  Spinning  and  Weaving  Company
Ltd</a>., AIR 1923 PC 66, where the Privy Council  referred  to  Hodgkinson  and
then laid down:
</p>
<p id="p_207">"The law on  the  subject  has  never  been  more  clearly  stated  than  by
Williams, J. in the case of Hodgkinson v. Fernie (1857) 3 C.B.N.S. 189.
</p>
<p id="p_208">"The law has for many years been settled, and remains so at this day,  that,
where a cause or matters in difference  are  referred  to  an  arbitrator  a
lawyer or a layman, he is constituted  the  sole  and  final  judge  of  all
questions both of law and of fact ...... The only exceptions  to  that  rule
are cases where the award is the result of  corruption  or  fraud,  and  one
other, which  though  it  is  to  be  regretted,  is  now,  I  think  firmly
established viz., where the question of law necessarily arises on  the  face
of the award or upon some paper accompanying and forming part of the  award.
 Though the propriety of this latter may very well be doubted,  I  think  it
may be considered as established."
</p>
<p id="p_209">"Now the regret expressed by Williams, J. in Hodgkinson v. Fernie  has  been
repeated by more than one learned Judge, and  it  is  certainly  not  to  be
desired that the exception should be in any way extended.  An error  in  law
on the face of the award means, in their Lordships' view, that you can  find
in the award or a document actually incorporated thereto, as  for  instance,
a note appended by the arbitrator stating  the  reasons  for  his  judgment,
some legal proposition which is the basis of the award  and  which  you  can
then say is erroneous.  It does not mean that if in a narrative a  reference
is made to a contention of one party that opens the  door  to  seeing  first
what that contention is, and  then  going  to  the  contract  on  which  the
parties' rights depend to see if that  contention  is  sound.   Here  it  is
impossible to say, from what is  shown  on  the  face  of  the  award,  what
mistake the arbitrators made.  The only way that  the  learned  judges  have
arrived at finding what the mistake was  is  by  saying:  "Inasmuch  as  the
Arbitrators awarded so and so, and inasmuch as the letter  shows  that  then
buyer rejected the cotton, the arbitrators can only  have  arrived  at  that
result by totally misinterpreting Cl.52." But they  were  entitled  to  give
their own interpretation to Cl. 52 or any other article, and the award  will
stand unless, on the face of it they  have  tied  themselves  down  to  some
special legal proposition which then, when examined, appears to be  unsound.
 Upon this point, therefore, their Lordships  think  that  the  judgment  of
Pratt, J was right and the conclusion of the learned Judges of the Court  of
Appeal erroneous."
</p>


<p id="p_210">      This judgment has been consistently followed in India to  test  awards
under <a href="/doc/1503578/" id="a_67">Section 30</a> of the Arbitration Act, 1940.
</p>
<p id="p_211">      In the  1996  Act,  this  principle  is  substituted  by  the  'patent
illegality' principle which, in turn, contains three sub heads -
</p>
<p id="p_212">      (a) a contravention of the substantive law of India  would  result  in
the death knell of an arbitral award. This must be understood in  the  sense
that such illegality must go to the root of the matter and cannot  be  of  a
trivial nature. This again is a really a contravention of  <a href="/doc/1224074/" id="a_68">Section  28(1)(a)</a>
of the Act, which reads as under:
</p>
<p id="p_213">"28. Rules applicable to  substance  of  dispute.-(1)  Where  the  place  of
arbitration is situated in India,-
</p>
<p id="p_214">(a) in an arbitration other than an  international  commercial  arbitration,
the arbitral tribunal shall decide the dispute submitted to  arbitration  in
accordance with the substantive law for the time being in force in India;"
</p>
<p id="p_215">(b) a contravention of the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_69">Arbitration Act</a> itself would  be  regarded  as  a
patent illegality- for example if an arbitrator  gives  no  reasons  for  an
award in contravention of <a href="/doc/463976/" id="a_70">section 31(3)</a> of  the  Act,  such  award  will  be
liable to be set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_216">(c)  Equally,  the  third  sub-head  of  patent  illegality  is   really   a
contravention of <a href="/doc/1224074/" id="a_71">Section 28</a> (3) of  the  <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_72">Arbitration  Act</a>,  which  reads  as
under:
</p>
<p id="p_217">"28. Rules applicable to substance  of  dispute.-  (3)  In  all  cases,  the
arbitral tribunal shall decide in accordance with the terms of the  contract
and shall take into account the  usages  of  the  trade  applicable  to  the
transaction."
</p>
<p id="p_218">      This last contravention must be understood with a caveat. An  arbitral
tribunal must decide in accordance with the terms of the  contract,  but  if
an arbitrator construes a term of the contract in a  reasonable  manner,  it
will not mean that the award can be set aside on this  ground.  Construction
of the terms of a contract is primarily for an arbitrator to  decide  unless
the arbitrator construes the contract in such a way that it  could  be  said
to be something that no fair minded or reasonable person could do.
</p>
<p id="p_219">            <a href="/doc/996348/" id="a_73">In McDermott International  Inc.  v.  Burn  Standard  Co.  Ltd</a>.,
(2006) 11 SCC 181, this Court held as under: 
</p>
<p id="p_220">"112. It is trite that the terms of the contract can be express or  implied.
The conduct of the parties would also be a relevant factor in the matter  of
construction of a contract. The construction of the  contract  agreement  is
within the jurisdiction  of  the  arbitrators  having  regard  to  the  wide
nature, scope and ambit of the arbitration  agreement  and  they  cannot  be
said to have misdirected themselves in passing  the  award  by  taking  into
consideration  the  conduct  of  the  parties.  It  is   also   trite   that
correspondences exchanged by the parties  are  required  to  be  taken  into
consideration for the purpose of construction of a contract.  Interpretation
of a contract is a matter for the arbitrator to determine, even if it  gives
rise to determination of a question  of  law.  (See Pure  Helium  India  (P)
Ltd. v. ONGC [(2003) 8 SCC 593] and <a href="/doc/80804/" id="a_74">D.D. Sharma v. Union of India</a> [(2004)  5
SCC 325]).
</p>
<p id="p_221">113. Once, thus, it is held that the arbitrator  had  the  jurisdiction,  no
further question shall be  raised  and  the  court  will  not  exercise  its
jurisdiction unless it is found that there exists any bar  on  the  face  of
the award."
</p>


<p id="p_222">            <a href="/doc/1082846/" id="a_75">In MSK Projects (I) (JV) Ltd. v. State of Rajasthan</a>,  (2011)  10
SCC 573, the Court held:
</p>
<p id="p_223">"17. If  the  arbitrator  commits  an  error  in  the  construction  of  the
contract, that is an error  within  his  jurisdiction.  But  if  he  wanders
outside the contract and deals with matters not allotted to him, he  commits
a jurisdictional error. Extrinsic  evidence  is  admissible  in  such  cases
because the dispute is not something which arises under or  in  relation  to
the contract or dependent on the construction  of  the  contract  or  to  be
determined within the award. The ambiguity of the award can, in such  cases,
be resolved by admitting extrinsic evidence. The rationale of this  rule  is
that the nature of the dispute is  something  which  has  to  be  determined
outside and independent of what appears in the award. Such a  jurisdictional
error needs to be proved by evidence extrinsic to the award.  (<a href="/doc/1395399/" id="a_76">See Gobardhan

<p id="p_225">"43. In  any  case,  assuming  that  Clause   9.3   was   capable   of   two
interpretations, the view taken by the arbitrator was clearly a possible  if
not a plausible one. It is not possible  to  say  that  the  arbitrator  had
travelled outside his jurisdiction, or  that  the  view  taken  by  him  was
against the terms of contract. That being the position, the High  Court  had
no reason to interfere with the award and substitute its view  in  place  of
the interpretation accepted by the arbitrator.
</p>
<p id="p_226">44. The legal position in this behalf has been summarised in para 18 of  the
judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/24858865/" id="a_83">SAIL v. Gupta Brother Steel Tubes Ltd</a>. [(2009)  10
SCC 63: (2009) 4 SCC (Civ)  16]  and  which  has  been  referred  to  above.
Similar view has been taken later in <a href="/doc/216597/" id="a_84">Sumitomo Heavy Industries  Ltd. v. ONGC
Ltd</a>. [(2010) 11 SCC 296: (2010)  4  SCC  (Civ)  459]  to  which  one  of  us
(Gokhale, J.)  was  a  party.  The  observations  in  para  43  thereof  are
instructive in this behalf.
</p>
<p id="p_227">45. This para 43 reads as follows:  (Sumitomo  case [(2010)  11  SCC  296  :
(2010) 4 SCC (Civ) 459] , SCC p. 313)

"43. ...  The  umpire  has  considered  the  fact  situation  and  placed  a
construction on the clauses of the agreement which according to him was  the
correct one. One may at the  highest  say  that  one  would  have  preferred
another construction of Clause 17.3 but that cannot make the  award  in  any
way perverse. Nor can one substitute one's own view in such a situation,  in
place of the one taken by the umpire,  which  would  amount  to  sitting  in
appeal. As held by this Court in <a href="/doc/1738256/" id="a_85">Kwality Mfg. Corpn. v. Central  Warehousing
Corpn</a>. [(2009) 5 SCC  142  :  (2009)  2  SCC  (Civ)  406]  the  Court  while
considering challenge to arbitral award does not  sit  in  appeal  over  the
findings and decision of the arbitrator, which is what the  High  Court  has
practically done in this matter. The  umpire  is  legitimately  entitled  to
take the view which he holds to be the correct  one  after  considering  the
material before him and after interpreting the provisions of the  agreement.
If he does so, the decision of the umpire has to be accepted  as  final  and
binding."
</p>


<p id="p_228">13.   Applying the tests laid  down  by  this  Court,  we  have  to  examine
whether the Division Bench has exceeded its jurisdiction  in  setting  aside
the arbitral award impugned before it.
</p>
<p id="p_229">14.   A large part of the judgment is an extract from  the  arbitral  award.
It is important to note that the Division Bench held:
</p>
<p id="p_230">"9. A perusal of the award would reveal, from the portions extracted  herein
above,  that  with  reference  to  evidence  led  before  him  the   learned
Arbitrator has held delay attributable to DDA, a finding of  fact  which  is
based on evidence and rightly conceded to by Sh.  Bhupesh  Narula,  Advocate
who appears for DDA as being beyond judicial  review  power  of  this  Court
pertaining to a  reasoned  award.  But,  while  awarding  Rs.8,27,960/-  the
reasoning adopted by the learned  Arbitrator  is  questioned  as  being  the
result of ignoring the well-recognized  legal  principles  on  the  subject,
Learned counsel argued that the reasoning is the ipse dixit of  the  learned
Arbitrator."
</p>


<p id="p_231">15.   The Division Bench while considering claims 9, 10,  11  and  15  found
fault with the application of Hudson's formula which  was  set  out  by  the
learned Arbitrator in order to arrive at the claim made under  these  heads.
The Division Bench said that it  was  not  possible  for  an  Arbitrator  to
mechanically apply a certain formula however well understood in  the  trade.
This itself is going outside the jurisdiction to set aside  an  award  under
<a href="/doc/1219022/" id="a_86">Section 34</a> in as much as in McDermott's case (supra), it was held:
</p>
<p id="p_232">"104. It is not in dispute that MII had  examined  one  Mr  D.J.  Parson  to
prove the said claim. The said witness calculated  the  increased  overheads
and loss of profit on the basis  of  the  formula  laid  down  in  a  manual
published by the Mechanical  Contractors  Association  of  America  entitled
"Change  Orders,  Overtime,  Productivity"  commonly  known  as  the   Emden
Formula. The said formula is said to  be  widely  accepted  in  construction
contracts for computing increased overheads and  loss  of  profit.  Mr  D.J.
Parson is said to have brought out the additional  project  management  cost
at US$ 1,109,500. We may at this  juncture  notice  the  different  formulas
applicable in this behalf.
</p>


<p id="p_233">(a) Hudson Formula: In Hudson's Building and Engineering  Contracts,  Hudson
Formula is stated in the following terms:
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">|"Contract head office      |        |      |Period of    |
|overhead and profit        |       |Contract period|       |delay"       |
|percentage                 |       |               |       |             |


</pre><p id="p_234">In the Hudson Formula, the head office overhead  percentage  is  taken  from
the contract. Although the Hudson Formula has received judicial  support  in
many cases, it has been criticised principally because it  adopts  the  head
office overhead percentage from the contract as the factor  for  calculating
the costs, and this may bear little  or  no  relation  to  the  actual  head
office costs of the contractor.
</p>
<p id="p_235">(b) Emden Formula: In Emden's Building Contracts  and  Practice,  the  Emden
Formula is stated in the following terms:</p><pre id="pre_3">

|"Head office overhead and |      |Contract sum   |      |Period of     |
|profit                    |       |               |       |delay"        |
|100                       |       |Contract period|       |              |


</pre><p id="p_236">Using the Emden Formula, the head office overhead percentage is  arrived  at
by  dividing  the  total  overhead  cost  and  profit  of  the  contractor's
organisation as a  whole  by  the  total  turnover.  This  formula  has  the
advantage of using the contractor's actual head office overhead  and  profit
percentage rather than those contained in the  contract.  This  formula  has
been widely applied and has received judicial support in a number  of  cases
including Norwest  Holst  Construction   Ltd. v. Coop.   Wholesale   Society
Ltd. [Decided  on  17-2-1998,   [1998]   EWHC   Technology   339], Beechwood
Development Co. (Scotland) Ltd. v. Mitchell [ Decided on  21-2-2001,  (2001)
CILL 1727] and Harvey Shopfitters Ltd. v. Adi Ltd. [  Decided  on  6-3-2003,
(2004) 2 All ER 982 : [2003] EWCA Civ 1757].
</p>
<p id="p_237">(c) Eichleay Formula: The  Eichleay  Formula  was  evolved  in  America  and
derives its name from a case heard by the Armed Services Board  of  Contract
Appeals, Eichleay Corporation. It is applied in the following manner:</p><pre id="pre_4">

Step 1

|Contract billings   |       |Total overhead |=      |Overhead allocable to|
|                    |        |for contract   |       |the contract         |
|                    |        |period         |       |                     |
|Total billings for  |        |               |                             |
|contract period     |        |               |                             |


     Step 2

|Allocable overhead                |=        |Daily overhead rate          |
|Total days of contract            |                                       |


      Step 3

|Daily contract    |      |Number of days|=      |Amount of unabsorbed   |
|overhead rate     |       |of delay      |       |overhead"              |


</pre><p id="p_238">This formula is used where it is not possible to prove loss  of  opportunity
and the claim is based on actual cost. It can be seen from the formula  that
the  total  head  office  overhead  during  the  contract  period  is  first
determined by comparing the value  of  work  carried  out  in  the  contract
period for the project with the value of work carried out by the  contractor
as a whole for the contract period. A share of  head  office  overheads  for
the contractor is allocated in the same ratio and expressed as  a  lump  sum
to the particular contract. The amount of head office overhead allocated  to
the particular contract is then expressed as a weekly amount by dividing  it
by the contract period. The period  of  delay  is  then  multiplied  by  the
weekly amount to give  the  total  sum  claimed.  The  Eichleay  Formula  is
regarded by the Federal Circuit Courts of America  as  the  exclusive  means
for compensating a contractor for overhead expenses.
</p>
<p id="p_239">105. Before us several American decisions  have  been  referred  to  by  Mr.
Dipankar Gupta in aid of his submission that the  Emden  Formula  has  since
been widely accepted  by  the  American  courts  being Nicon  Inc. v. United
States [ Decided on 10-6-2003 (USCA Fed Cir),  331  F.  3d  878  (Fed.  Cir.
2003)], Gladwynne   Construction   Co. v. Mayor   and   City   Council    of
Baltimore [Decided on 25-9-2002, 807 A. 2d 1141 (2002) : 147 Md.  App.  149]
and Charles G. William Construction Inc. v. White [271 F 3d 1055 (Fed.  Cir.
2001)].
</p>
<p id="p_240">106. We do not intend to delve deep into the matter as  it  is  an  accepted
position that different formulae can be applied in  different  circumstances
and the question  as  to  whether  damages  should  be  computed  by  taking
recourse to one or the  other  formula,  having  regard  to  the  facts  and
circumstances of a particular case, would eminently fall within  the  domain
of the arbitrator."
</p>


<p id="p_241">16.   Obviously,  the  Division  Bench  has  exceeded  its  jurisdiction  in
interfering with a possible view of the Arbitrator on facts.
</p>
<p id="p_242">17.   The Division Bench then went on to hold:
</p>
<p id="p_243">"17.  There  is  admittedly  no  evidence  that  the  contractor  i.e.   the
respondent had a central establishment. It appears to be a  case  where  the
contractor is petty contractor and the only expenses  incurred  are  at  the
site.  The claim is towards hire charges paid for centering and  shuttering,
hiring tools, plants  and  scaffoldings  i.e.  the  claim  is  not  for  the
contractor's own equipment lying idle. There is just no  evidence  that  the
contractor paid charges as claimed by him. Not a single bill raised  by  the
alleged person who let on hire the equipment  to  the  contractor  has  been
filed nor any evidence adduced for the payment made. Except  for  listing  a
10 HP Water Pump, 4 number 1  HP  water  pump,  3  mixers,  250  scaffolding
bamboos, 150 ballis and 2  vibrators  in  Annexure-J  to  the  Statement  of
Claim, no document proving hiring the same and brought at the site has  been
led.  We highlight that the claim is on account of  hire  Charges  paid  and
there is no evidence of said payment. It does happen that where  a  work  is
stopped, the person who taken an equipment on hire returns the same and  re-
hires the same when work recommences. Thus, Claim No. 9, 10  and  11  cannot
be allowed because there is no evidence to support the claims.   Damages  on
account of  establishment  expenses  incurred  during  period  contract  got
prolonged have certainly to be recompensed, but we find no evidence  in  the
form of books of accounts, vouchers etc. to show payments to  the  staff  or
expenses incurred in maintaining an establishment at site in the form  of  a
site office. The wages register, photocopy  whereof  was  filed  before  the
Arbitrator, pertains to  wages  paid  to  the  unskilled,  semi-skilled  and
skilled labour deployed to execute the works. The  pleadings  pertaining  to
the claim would show  that  as  per  the  contractor  he  had  deployed  one
Executive  Officer,  one  Graduate  Engineer,  one  Junior   Engineer,   one
Accountant, one Storekeeper and Supervisor and one Mechanic at the site  and
had also deployed watch and ward. Details of the persons employed have  been
listed in Annexure-N to the Statement of Claim and the  documents  filed  to
establish the same would evidence that the contractor has filed  photocopies
of the salary register, which are available from pages No.1255 to 1322,  but
unfortunately for the contractor, the cat is out of the bag when we look  at
the documents.  They pertain to payments made for a site at Mayur Vihar.  We
highlight that the contract in question pertains  to  flats  and  houses  at
Trilokpuri and not Mayur Vihar. It  is  apparent  that  the  contractor  has
tried to pull the wool on the eyes of the primary adjudicator of the  claim.
It is not the case of the contractor that these persons were  simultaneously
supervising the work at two sites. Assuming this was the  case,  the  matter
would then have been adjudicated with reference to same  number  of  persons
supervising two sites and the time spent at each site by them.
</p>
<p id="p_244">18.  Thus, the award pertaining to Claim Nos. 9, 10, 11 and 15 is liable  to
be sent aside and it is so set aside. We need not therefore take  corrective
action on the apparent error i.e. the learned Arbitrator has worked out  the
claim on the original contract value  of   Rs.  87,66,678/-,  of  course  by
reducing it by 15%, but ignoring that final work executed was  only  in  sum
of Rs.62,84,845/-."
</p>


<p id="p_245">18.   Mr. Verma argued correctly that there is nothing  on  record  to  show
that the contractor is  a  petty  contractor  and  that  the  only  expenses
incurred are at the  site.   He  has  shown  us  that  the  contract  itself
required execution of the work by  a  Class-I  contractor  and  has  further
shown us  that  Class-I  contractors  require  to  have  certain  stipulated
numbers of works worth large amounts before they can apply  for  the  tender
and that their financial soundness  has  to  be  attested  too  by  banker's
certificate  showing  that  their  worth  is  over  10  crores  of   rupees.
Further, he has  pointed  out  from  the  statement  of  claims  before  the
Arbitrator that there was evidence for claims 9, 10 and 11 laid  before  the
Arbitrator which the Arbitrator has in fact  accepted.   Also  establishment
expenses were set out in great detail before the Arbitrator and it  is  only
on this evidence that the Arbitrator ultimately has  awarded  these  claims.
Mr. Verma is also right in saying that the  Division  Bench  was  completely
wrong in stating that the establishment expenses pertained to  payments  for
a site at Mayur Vihar as  opposed  to  Trilok  Puri  which  were  where  the
aforesaid houses were to  be  constructed.   He  pointed  out  that  in  the
completion certificate dated  30th  May,  1997  given  by  the  DDA  to  the
appellant,  it  is  clear  that  the  houses  that  were,  in  fact,  to  be
constructed were in Mayur Vihar, Phase-II, which is part of the Trilok  Puri
trans-Yamuna area.
</p>
<p id="p_246">It is most unfortunate that the  Division  Bench  did  not  advert  to  this
crucial document at all.  This document shows not  only  that  the  Division
Bench was wholly incorrect in its conclusion that the contractor  has  tried
to pull the wool over the  eyes  over  the  DDA  but  it  should  also  have
realized that the DDA itself has stated that the work has been  carried  out
generally to its satisfaction barring some  extremely  minor  defects  which
are capable of rectification. It is  clear,  therefore,  that  the  Division
Bench obviously  exceeded  its  jurisdiction  in  interfering  with  a  pure
finding of fact forgetting that the Arbitrator is  the  sole  Judge  of  the
quantity and quality of evidence before him and  unnecessarily  bringing  in
facts  which  were  neither  pleaded  nor  proved  and  ignoring  the  vital
completion certificate granted by the DDA itself. The  Division  Bench  also
went wrong in stating that as the work completed was only to the  extent  of
Rs. 62,84,845/-, Hudson's formula  should  have  been  applied  taking  this
figure into account and not the  entire  contract  value  of  Rs.87,66,678/-
into account.
</p>
<p id="p_247">19.   Here again, the Division Bench has committed a grave  error.  Hudson's
formula as is quoted in McDermott's case is as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_248">"(a) Hudson Formula: In Hudson's Building and Engineering Contracts,  Hudson
Formula is stated in the following terms:
</p>
<pre id="pre_5">|"Contract head office      |        |      |Period of    |
|overhead and profit        |       |Contract period|       |delay"       |
|percentage                 |       |               |       |             |


</pre><p id="p_249">In the Hudson Formula, the head office overhead  percentage  is  taken  from
the contract. Although the Hudson Formula has received judicial  support  in
many cases, it has been criticised principally because it  adopts  the  head
office overhead percentage from the contract as the factor  for  calculating
the costs, and this may bear little  or  no  relation  to  the  actual  head
office costs of the contractor."
</p>


<p id="p_250">20.   It is clear that to apply this formula one has to  take  into  account
the contract value that is awarded and not  the  work  completed.   On  this
score again, the Division Bench is to be faulted.
</p>
<p id="p_251">21.   In dealing with claims 12 and 13, the Division Bench stated:
</p>
<p id="p_252">"19.  Pertaining  to  Claim  No.12  and  13,  the  learned  Arbitrator   has
recompensed the contractor 20% price  hike  in  the  cost  of  material  and
labour noting, that there was a steep hike in the period  in  question  when
the contract got prolonged by  25  months.  We  highlight  that  though  the
Arbitrator has found  the  delay  to  be  25  months,  recompense  has  been
restricted to only 20 months.
</p>
<p id="p_253">20. As noted herein above, partial recompense under  Clause  10C,  has  been
granted to the  contractor,  but  the  same  i.e.  the  Clause  in  question
requiring applicability during contract stipulated period,  it  is  apparent
that the contractor would be entitled to  full  recompense  for  price  hike
during the extended 25 months period and not the  20  months  to  which  the
learned Arbitrator has restricted the recompense to.
</p>
<p id="p_254">21.   But, for the benefit granted under Clause 10C wherein Rs.  1,62,387/-,
Rs.46,184/- and Rs.12,922/- have  been awarded under Claim Nos. 2, 3 and  4,
said amounts have to be adjusted, but not in  full,  for  the  reason  these
include the amounts payable during the contract stipulated period.
</p>
<p id="p_255">22.  The total of the three sums comes to Rs, 2, 21,493/-. We  have  another
problem. Neither counsel could help us identify the components thereof  i.e.
the component relatable to the 9 months during which  the  work  had  to  be
completed and the 25 months during which the contract got  prolonged.  Thus,
we apply the Rule of 'Rough and Ready Justice'. We divide the sum by  34  to
work out the proportionate increase per month.  Rs.  2,21,493/-  divided  by
34 = Rs.6,514.50 and multiplying  the  same  by  25,  the  figure  comes  to
Rs.1,62,862.50.
</p>
<p id="p_256">23. Adopting, for the reasons given by the Arbitrator, that 20% hike in  the
balance work done after the contract stipulated period i.e.  benefit  to  be
granted under  this  head  for  work  done  in  sum  of  Rs.37,02,066/-  and
accepting the sum of Rs.7,20,000/- being the resultant  figure,  subtracting
Rs.1,62,862.50, the figure arrived at is Rs.5,57,137.50."
</p>


<p id="p_257">22.   Here again,  the  Division  Bench  has  interfered  wrongly  with  the
arbitral award on several counts.  It had no business to enter into  a  pure
question of fact to set aside the Arbitrator for having  applied  a  formula
of 20 months instead of 25 months. Though this would inure in favour of  the
appellant, it is clear that the appellant did not file any  cross  objection
on this score.  Also, it is extremely curious that the Division Bench  found
that an adjustment would have to be made with claims  awarded  under  claims
2, 3 and 4 which are entirely  separate  and  independent  claims  and  have
nothing to do with claims 12 and  13.   The  formula  then  applied  by  the
Division Bench was that it would itself do "rough and  ready  justice".   We
are at a complete loss to understand how this  can  be  done  by  any  court
under the jurisdiction exercised under <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_87">Section 34</a> of  the  Arbitration  Act.
As has been held above, the expression "justice" when it  comes  to  setting
aside an award under the public policy ground can only mean  that  an  award
shocks the conscience of the court.  It cannot  possibly  include  what  the
court thinks is unjust on the facts of a case for which  it  then  seeks  to
substitute its view for the Arbitrator's view and does what it considers  to
be "justice".  With great respect to the Division Bench, the whole  approach
to setting aside arbitral awards is incorrect. The Division Bench  has  lost
sight of the fact that  it  is  not  a  first  appellate  court  and  cannot
interfere with errors of fact.
</p>
<p id="p_258">23.   We come now to the arguments of Mr. Sharan in support of the  Division
Bench judgment. The learned  counsel  strongly  relied  on  clause  10C  and
clause 22.  These two clauses are set out as below:
</p>
<p id="p_259">Clause 10C of the agreement reads as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_260">"If  during  the  progress  of  the  works,  the  price  of   any   material
incorporated in the works, (not being a material supplied from the Engineer-
in-Charge's stores in accordance with  Clause  10  hereof  and/or  wages  of
labour increases as direct result of the coming  into  force  of  any  fresh
law, or statutory rule or order (but not due to any changes  in  sales  tax)
and such increase exceed ten per cent of the price and/or  wages  prevailing
at the time of receipt of the tender for the work, and contractor  thereupon
necessarily and properly pays in respect of the  material  (incorporated  in
the work) such increased price and/or in respect of labour  engaged  on  the
execution of the work such increased wages, then the amount of the  contract
shall accordingly be varied provided always that any increase so payable  is
not, in the opinion of the Superintending Engineer (whose decision shall  be
final and binding) attributable  to  delay  in  execution  of  the  contract
within the control of the contractor. Provided, however,  no  reimbursements
shall be made if the increase is not more than 10% of the said  prices/wages
and if so the reimbursements shall be made only on the excess over  10%  and
provided further that any  such  increase  shall  not  be  payable  if  such
increase has become  operative  after  the  contract  or  extended  date  of
completion of the work in question.
</p>
<p id="p_261">      If during the progress  of  the  works,  the  price  of  any  material
incorporated in the works (not being a material supplied from the  Engineer-
in-Charge's stores in accordance with Clause  10  hereof)  and/or  wages  of
labour is decreased as a direct result of  the  coming  into  force  of  any
fresh law or statutory rule or order (but not due to any  changes  in  sales
tax) and such decrease exceeds ten per  cent  of  the  prices  and/or  wages
prevailing at the time  of  receipt  of  the  tender  for  the  work,  Delhi
Development Authority shall in respect  of  materials  incorporated  in  the
work (not being materials supplied from the Engineer-in-Charge's  stores  in
accordance with Clause 10 hereof) and/or labour engaged on the execution  of
the work after the date of coming into force of such law, statutory rule  or
order be entitled to deduct from the dues of the contractor such  amount  as
shall be equivalent of difference between the prices of  materials  and/  or
wages as they prevailed at the time of receipt of tender for the work  minus
ten per cent thereof and the prices of materials and/ or wages of labour  on
the coming into force of such law, statutory rule or order.
</p>
<p id="p_262">The contractor shall for the purpose of this condition keep  such  books  of
account and other documents as are necessary  to  show  the  amount  of  any
increase claimed or reduction available and shall allow  inspection  of  the
same by a duly authorised representative of Delhi Development Authority  and
further shall, at the request of the  Engineer-in-Charge  furnish,  verified
in such a manner as the Engineer-in-Charge may  require.  Any  document,  so
kept and such other information as the Engineer-in-Charge may require.
</p>
<p id="p_263">The contractor shall, within a reasonable time of his becoming aware of  any
alteration in the prices of any such materials and/ or wages of labour  give
notice thereof to the Engineer-in- Charge stating that the same is given  in
pursuance to the condition together with all  information  relating  thereto
which he may be in a position to supply."
</p>
<p id="p_264">Clause 22 reads as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_265">"All sums payable by way of compensations  under  any  of  these  conditions
shall be, considered as reasonable compensation to be applied  to  this  use
of Delhi Development Authority without  reference  to  the  actual  loss  or
damage sustained, and whether or not any damage shall have been sustained.
</p>
<p id="p_266">Specifications and Conditions:
</p>
<p id="p_267">1. The contractor must get acquainted with the proposed site for  the  works
and study specifications and  conditions  carefully  before  tendering.  The
work shall be executed as per programme approved by the  Engineer-in-Charge.
If part of  site  is  not  available  for  any  reasons  or  there  is  some
unavoidable delay in supply of materials stipulated by the Departments,  the
programme of construction shall be modified accordingly and  the  contractor
shall have no claim for any extras or compensation on this account."
</p>


<p id="p_268">24.   Clause 10C concerns itself with the price of material incorporated  in
the works or wage or labour increases.  It has been seen that claims  9,  10
and 11 have nothing to  do  with  either  of  the  aforesaid  subjects.   In
seeking to apply this clause to claim 15, the simple  answer  is  that  this
clause will not apply when a  claim  for  damages  is  made.   Further,  the
Arbitrator considered this clause in detail and only awarded  amounts  under
this clause in excess of 10 percent as required by the clause when  it  came
to awarding amounts under claims 2, 3 and 4, which fell within the ambit  of
clause 10C.  The DDA in the appeal before the Division Bench correctly  gave
up any challenge to these claims as has been recorded in paragraph 4 of  the
order under appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_269">25.   The Arbitrator has dealt with this clause in detail and has  construed
and applied the same correctly while dealing with claims 2, 3 and 4 and  has
obviously not applied the said clause to claims 9,  10,  11  and  15  as  no
occasion for applying the same arose. The award cannot be  faulted  on  this
ground.
</p>
<p id="p_270">26.   Also, so far as clause 22 is concerned, the  DDA  did  not  raise  any
argument based on this clause before the  learned  Arbitrator.  However,  it
must in fairness be stated that it was  argued  before  the  learned  Single
Judge.  In para 15 of his judgment, the learned Judge sets  the  clause  out
and then  follows  a  judgment  of  the  High  Court  of  Delhi  in  <a href="/doc/1818965/" id="a_88">Kochhar
Construction Works v. DDA &amp; Anr</a>.,  (1998) 2 Arb. LR  209.   Apart  from  the
fact that a learned Single Judge of the same court is bound  by  a  previous
judgment of a Single Judge, the conclusion of the learned Single Judge  that
if the  appellant  is  at  fault  and  the  contract  is  prolonged  for  an
inordinate period of time, it cannot be said that the respondents cannot  be
compensated for the same is correct.  Besides,  this  point  was  not  urged
before the Division Bench and must be taken to  be  given  up.   Mr.  Sharan
cited <a href="/doc/148704680/" id="a_89">Harsha Constructions v. Union of India &amp; Ors</a>., (2014)  9  SCC  246  to
say that in respect of excepted matters, no  arbitration  is  possible,  and
that this being a jurisdictional point, he should be  allowed  to  raise  it
before us.   Unfortunately for Mr.  Sharan,  the  clause  does  not  operate
automatically. It only operates if an objection is taken stating  that  part
of the site is not available for any reason.  Nowhere  has  the  DDA  stated
which part of the site is  not  available  for  any  reason.   Further,  the
learned Single Judge's reason  for  rejecting  an  argument  based  on  this
clause also commends itself to us as the object of this clause  is  that  no
claim for extras should be granted only if there is  an  unavoidable  delay.
We have seen that the delay was entirely avoidable and caused solely by  the
DDA itself.
</p>
<p id="p_271">27.   One more point needs to be noted. An  argument  was  made  before  the
learned Single Judge that there has been a duplication  of  claims  awarded.
The learned Judge dealt with this argument as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_272">"18. Learned counsel for the petitioner in respect of ground P,  once  again
makes a reference to the issue that there is overlapping of the claim. I  am
unable  to  accept  the  submission  made  by  the  learned  counsel.    The
consequence of delay may have more  than  one  ramifications  including  the
cost of material the supervision required at the site, the inability of  the
contractor to utilise the manpower at some other  place,  the  inability  of
the contractor to make, profits from some other contract by  utilisation  of
the same resources. All these aspects  are  liable  to  be  considered.  The
Arbitrator has considered the claims separately and has dealt  with,  claims
9, 10, 11 &amp; 15 together. Claims 12 &amp; 13 have been thereafter dealt  with  on
the same principles since it was found that it was not the  respondent,  who
was responsible for  the  delay  for  a  period  of  25  months  beyond  the
stipulated condition of 9 months.
</p>
<p id="p_273">19. There is thus no question of overlapping  in  different  heads  and  the
grievance of the petitioner is rejected."
</p>


<p id="p_274">28.   The Single Judge is clearly right.  We have gone through  all  the  15
claims supplied to us and we find that none of  these  claims  are  in  fact
overlapping. They are all contained under separate  heads.   This  argument,
therefore, must also fail.
</p>
<p id="p_275">29.    The appeal is, therefore, allowed and the judgment  of  the  Division
Bench is set aside.   The  judgment  of  the  Single  Judge  is  upheld  and
consequently, the Arbitral award dated 23rd May, 2005 is as a whole  upheld.
 There will be no order as to costs.

      [2]Very often an arbitrator is a lay person  not  necessarily  trained
in law. Lord  Mansfield,  a  famous  English  Judge,  once  advised  a  high
military officer in Jamaica who needed to act as a Judge as follows:
</p><p id="p_281">      "General, you have a sound head, and a good heart;  take  courage  and
you will do very well, in your occupation, in a court of equity.  My  advice
is, to make your decrees as your head and your heart dictate, to  hear  both
sides patiently, to decide with firmness in the best manner you can; but  be
careful not  to  assign  your  reasons,  since  your  determination  may  be
substantially right, although your reasons may be very bad,  or  essentially
wrong".
</p><p id="p_282">      It is very  important  to  bear  this  in  mind  when  awards  of  lay
arbitrators are challenged.
