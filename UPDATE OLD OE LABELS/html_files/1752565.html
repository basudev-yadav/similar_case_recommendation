<p id="p_2">      In  this	batch of cases an important question  arises
for   consideration  of	 this	Court,	namely,	 under	 the
provisions  of Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_1">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996,	what
should	be the correct approach of the Chief Justice or	 his
nominee	 in  relation  to the matter of	 appointment  of  an
arbitrator  under <a href="/doc/605764/" id="a_2">Section 11(6)</a> of the Act, and what is	 the
true  nature  of the said order and further if a  person  is
aggrieved  by such order, can he file application in a Court
and  whether such an application could be entertained and if
so,  in	 which forum?  <a href="/doc/507484/" id="a_3">In Sundaram Finance Ltd.	  vs.	NEPC
India  Ltd</a>.	(1999)	2 Supreme Court	 Cases	479,  while
deciding  the question as to whether under <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_4">Section 9</a> of	 the
Arbitration  and  <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_5">Conciliation	Act</a>,  1996,  the  Court	 has
jurisdiction   to   pass  an   interim	order  even   before
commencement  of  arbitration  proceeding   and	 before	  an
Arbitrator   is	  appointed,   after   analysing   different
provisions  of <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_6">Arbitration Act</a>, 1940 and the present Act  of
1996  an observation has been made to the effect under	the
1996  Act,  appointment	 of Arbitrator is made	as  per	 the
provisions of <a href="/doc/596725/" id="a_7">Section 11</a> which does not require the Court to
pass  a judicial order appointing Arbitrator. <a href="/doc/78969/" id="a_8">In Ador Samia
Private	 Ltd.	vs.   Peekay Holdings Limited and  others</a>  -
(1999)	8  Supreme Court Cases, 572, this Court came to	 the
conclusion  that the Chief Justice of the High Court or	 his
designate  under  <a href="/doc/596725/" id="a_9">Section  11(6)</a>  of   1996  Act,  acts	  in
administrative	capacity,  and such, an order of  the  Chief
Justice	 is not passed by any court exercising any  judicial
function  nor  is  it a tribunal having the trappings  of  a
judicial  authority  and  it must, therefore, be  held	that
against	 such  order,  which  is  administrative  in  nature
application  under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_10">Article 136</a> of the Constitution would not
lie.   Notwithstanding the aforesaid decision of this  Court
in  Ador  Samia	 Pvt.  Ltd.  (supra) case when	the  present
batch  of  cases came up for consideration before the  Bench
presided over by Majmudar, J.  who was the author of Samias
case  (supra)  it was contended that the aforesaid  decision
requires  consideration and having acceded to the request of
the  petitioner,  the Bench passed the order to	 place	this
batch  of  cases before a Three Judge Bench and that is	 how
these  cases have come before us.  Two basic questions which
really	arise for consideration are, (1) what is the  nature
of  the	 order	that is passed by the Chief Justice  or	 his
nominee	 in  exercise  of  power under	sub-section  (6)  of
<a href="/doc/596725/" id="a_11">Section	 11</a> of the Act?	 and, (2) even if said order is held
to  be	administrative in nature what is the remedy open  to
the  person  concerned if his request for appointment of  an
Arbitrator  is	turned down by the learned Chief Justice  or
his  nominee,  for  some reason or other?  In  deciding	 the
latter	question it would be necessary to find out the	true
intention of the legislature in substituting 1940 Act by the
present	 Act and bearing in mind the object of enactment  of
the new Act what should be the approach of the learned Chief
Justice	 or his nominee when an application for	 appointment
of  an	Arbitrator is made invoking the	 jurisdiction  under
<a href="/doc/596725/" id="a_12">Section 11(6)</a> of the 1996 Act.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      At  the outset, it must be borne in mind that prior to
the  1996  Act,	 the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_13">Arbitration Act</a> of 1940, which  was  in
force  in  India  provided for domestic arbitration  and  no
provision was there to deal with the foreign awards.  So far
as  the	 Foreign Awards are concerned, the same	 were  being
dealt with by the Arbitration (Protocol and Convention) Act,
1937,  and the Foreign Awards (Recognition and	<a href="/doc/631834/" id="a_14">Enforcement)
Act</a>,  1961.   The increasing growth of global trade and	 the
delay in disposal of cases in Courts under the normal system
in  several  countries	made  it   imperative  to  have	 the
perception of an alternative Dispute Resolution System, more
particularly,  in  the matter of commercial disputes.	When
the entire world was moving in favour of a speedy resolution
of  commercial	disputes, the United Nations  Commission  on
International  Trade  Law  way	back  in  1985	adopted	 the
Uncitral  Model Law of International Commercial	 Arbitration
and  since then, number of countries have given	 recognition
to  that Model in their respective legislative system.	With
the  said Uncitral Model Law in view the present Arbitration
and  <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_15">Conciliation  Act</a>	of 1996 has been  enacted  in  India
replacing  the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_16">Indian Arbitration Act</a>, 1940 , which was	 the
principal legislation on Arbitration in the country that had
been  enacted during the British Rule.	<a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_17">The Arbitration	 Act</a>
of  1996  provides  not only for  domestic  arbitration	 but
spreads	 its  sweep to International Commercial	 Arbitration
too.   The Indian law relating to the enforcement of Foreign
Arbitration  Awards  provides  for greater autonomy  in	 the
arbitral  process  and	limits judicial	 intervention  to  a
narrower  circumference	 than  under the previous  law.	  To
attract the confidence of International Mercantile community
and  the  growing  volume of Indias  trade  and	 commercial
relationship  with  the	 rest  of the world  after  the	 new
liberalisation	policy of the Government, Indian  Parliament
was  persuaded to enact the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_18">Conciliation Act</a>
of  1996  in Uncitral model and, therefore, in	interpreting
any  provisions	 of the 1996 Act Courts must not ignore	 the
objects	 and  purpose  of  the enactment of  1996.   A	bare
comparison of different provisions of the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_19">Arbitration Act</a> of
1940 with the provisions of the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_20">Conciliation
Act</a>  1996 would unequivocally indicate that 1996 Act  limits
intervention  of  Court	 with  an arbitral  process  to	 the
minimum	 and it is certainly not the legislative intent that
each  and  every order passed by an authority under the	 Act
would be a subject matter of judicial scrutiny of a Court of
Law.   Under the new law the grounds on which an award of an
arbitrator  could  be challenged before the Court have	been
severely cut down and such challenge is now permitted on the
basis  of invalidity of the agreement, want of	jurisdiction
on  the part of the arbitrator or want of proper notice to a
party  of  the appointment of the arbitrator or of  atbitral
proceedings.   The  powers  of	 the  arbitrator  have	been
amplified  by  insertion of specific provisions	 of  several
matters.   Obstructive	tactics	 adopted by the	 parties  in
arbitration  proceedings  are  sought to be thwarted  by  an
express	 provision  inasmuch as if a party  knowingly  keeps
silent	and then suddenly raises a procedural objection will
not  be	 allowed  to  do so.  The role	of  institutions  in
promoting  and	organising arbitration has been	 recognised.
The  power  to	nominate arbitrators has been given  to	 the
Chief  Justice or to an institution or person designated  by
him.   The  time limit for making awards has  been  deleted.
The  existing provisions in 1940 Act relating to arbitration
through intervention of Court, when there is no suit pending
or  by order of the court when there is a suit pending, have
been  removed.	 The importance of transnational  commercial
arbitration has been recognised and it has been specifically
provided  that even where the arbitration is held in  India,
the  parties to the contract would be free to designate	 the
law  applicable to the substance of the dispute.  Under	 the
new  law  unless  the	agreement  provides  otherwise,	 the
arbitrators are required to give reasons for the award.	 The
award  itself  has now been vested with status of a  decree,
inasmuch  as the award itself is made executable as a decree
and it will no longer be necessary to apply to the court for
a  decree in terms of the award.  All these aim at achieving
the  sole object to resolve the dispute as expeditiously  as
possible  with the minimum intervention of a Court of Law so
that  the  trade and commerce is not affected on account  of
litigations before a court.  When United Nations established
the  Commission on International Trade Law it is on  account
of  the	 fact  that  the General  Assembly  recognised	that
disparities  in national laws governing international  trade
created	 obstacles  to	the  flow  of  trade.	The  General
Assembly  regarded the Commission on International Trade Law
as  a medium which could play a more active role in reducing
or  removing the obstacles.  Such Commission, therefore, was
given	a   mandate  for   progressive	 harmonization	 and
unification  of	 the law of International Trade.  With	that
objective  when	 Uncitral  Model has been prepared  and	 the
Parliament  in	our  country  enacted  the  Arbitration	 and
<a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_21">Conciliation  Act</a> of 1996 adopting Uncitral Model, it  would
be  appropriate	 to  bear the said objective in	 mind  while
interpreting  any  provision of the Act.  The  Statement  of
Objects	 and Reasons of the Act clearly enunciates that	 the
main  objective	 of  the  legislation was  to  minimise	 the
supervisory  role  of Courts in the arbitral process.  If  a
comparison is made between the language of <a href="/doc/596725/" id="a_22">Section 11</a> of the
Act  and  <a href="/doc/1678224/" id="a_23">Article 11</a> of the Model Law it would	be  apparent
that  the  Act	has designated the Chief Justice of  a	High
Court in cases of domestic arbitration and the Chief Justice
of  India in cases of international commercial	arbitration,
to  be the authority to perform the function of	 appointment
of arbitrator whereas under the Model Law the said power has
been  vested  with  the Court.	When the  matter  is  placed
before	the Chief Justice or his nominee under <a href="/doc/596725/" id="a_24">Section 11</a> of
the  Act it is imperative for the said Chief Justice or	 his
nominee	 to  bear  in mind the legislative intent  that	 the
arbitral  process should be set in motion without any  delay
whatsoever  and all contentious issues are left to be raised
before the arbitral tribunal itself.  At that stage it would
not  be appropriate for the Chief Justice or his nominee  to
entertain  any	contentious  issue between the	parties	 and
decide	the  same.  A bare reading of <a href="/doc/862520/" id="a_25">Sections 13</a> and <a href="/doc/109140/" id="a_26">16</a>  of
the Act makes it crystal clear that questions with regard to
the  qualifications,  independence and impartiality  of	 the
arbitrator,  and  in  respect  of the  jurisdiction  of	 the
arbitrator  could be raised before the arbitrator who  would
decide the same.  <a href="/doc/862520/" id="a_27">Section 13(1)</a> provides that party would be
free  to agree on a procedure for challenging an arbitrator.
Sub-section  (2)  of said Section provides that failing	 any
such   agreement,   a  party   intending  to  challenge	  an
arbitrator,   either   on  grounds    of   independence	  or
impartiality  or  on  the  grounds   of	 lack  of  requisite
qualifications,	 shall	within 15 days of becoming aware  of
the  constitution  of the Tribunal send a written  statement
for  the  challenge to the Tribunal itself.   <a href="/doc/862520/" id="a_28">Section  13(3)</a>
provides  that unless the arbitrator withdraws or the  other
party  agrees to the challenge, the Tribunal shall decide on
the  challenge	itself.	  Sub-section	(4)  of	 <a href="/doc/862520/" id="a_29">Section  13</a>
mandates  an arbitrator to continue the arbitral proceedings
and  to	 make  an award.  <a href="/doc/109140/" id="a_30">Section 16</a> empowers  the  arbitral
tribunal  to  rule on its own as well as on objections	with
respect	 to  the  existence or validity of  the	 arbitration
agreement.  Conferment of such power on the arbitrator under
1996  Act indicates the intention of the legislature and its
anxiety	 to see that the arbitral process is set in  motion.
This  being  the legislative intent, it would be proper	 for
the  Chief  Justice  or	 his  nominee  just  to	 appoint  an
arbitrator  without wasting any time or without entertaining
any  contentious issues at that stage, by a party  objecting
to  the	 appointment of an arbitrator.	If this approach  is
adhered	 to,  then there would be no grievance of any  party
and  in	 the arbitral proceeding, it would be open to  raise
any  objection,	 as  provided under the	 Act.	But  certain
contingencies  may  arise  where the Chief  Justice  or	 his
nominee	 refuses to make an appointment of an arbitrator and
in  such  a case a party seeking appointment  of  arbitrator
cannot	be  said to be without any remedy.  Bearing in	mind
the  purpose  of legislation, the language used	 in  <a href="/doc/596725/" id="a_31">Section
11(6)</a>  conferring power on the Chief Justice or his  nominee
to  appoint an arbitrator, the curtailment of the powers  of
the  Court  in	the matter of  interference,  the  expanding
jurisdiction  of  the arbitrator in course of  the  arbitral
proceeding,  and  above all the main objective, namely,	 the
confidence  of the international market for speedy  disposal
of  their  disputes,  the character and status of  an  order
appointing  arbitrator	by the Chief Justice or his  nominee
under  <a href="/doc/596725/" id="a_32">Section 11(6)</a> has to be decided upon.  If it is	held
that  an  order	 under	<a href="/doc/596725/" id="a_33">Section	  11(6)</a>	 is  a	judicial  or
quasi-judicial	order then the said order would be  amenable
for  judicial  intervention  and  any  reluctant  party	 may
frustrate the entire purpose of the Act by adopting dilatory
tactics	 in approaching a court of law even against an order
of appointment of an arbitrator.  Such an interpretation has
to  be	avoided in order to achieve the basic objective	 for
which  the  country  has enacted the Act  of  1996  adopting
Uncitral  Model.  If on the other hand, it is held that	 the
order  passed  by the Chief Justice under <a href="/doc/596725/" id="a_34">Section  11(6)</a>  is
administrative	in  nature, then in such an event in a	case
where  the  learned  Chief Justice or  his  nominee  refuses
erroneously  to	 make  an appointment then  an	intervention
could  be  possible  by	 a  court in  the  same	 way  as  an
intervention  is possible against an administrative order of
the  executive.	 In other words, it would be a case of	non-
performance of the duty by the Chief Justice or his nominee,
and   therefore,  a  mandamus  would   lie.   If   such	  an
interpretation	is given with regard to the character of the
order  that has been passed under <a href="/doc/596725/" id="a_35">Section 11(6)</a> then in	 the
event  an order of refusal is passed under <a href="/doc/596725/" id="a_36">Section 11(6)</a>  it
could  be  remedied  by	 issuance of  a	 mandamus.   We	 are
persuaded  to  accept the second alternative inasmuch as  in
such an event there would not be inordinate delay in setting
the  arbitral process in motion.  But, as has been explained
earlier	 in  the earlier part of this judgment, the duty  of
the  Chief Justice or his nominee being to set the  arbitral
process	 in motion it is expected that invariably the  Chief
Justice	 or  his  nominee  would   make	 an  appointment  of
arbitrator  so	that the arbitral proceeding would start  as
expeditiously  as  possible and the dispute itself could  be
resolved  and the objective of the Act can be achieved.	  In
fact  a Bench of this Court in Sundaram Finance case (supra)
while  considering  the	 scope of <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_37">Section 9</a> of the  Act	 has
approached  the problem from this perspective and incidental
observation  has been made that <a href="/doc/596725/" id="a_38">Section 11</a> does not  require
the  Court  to pass a judicial order appointing	 arbitrator.
The  nature  and function performed by the Chief Justice  or
his  nominee  under  sub- section (6) of  <a href="/doc/596725/" id="a_39">Section  11</a>  being
essentially to aid the constitution of the arbitral tribunal
cannot	be  held to be a judicial function as otherwise	 the
legislature  could  have  used	the  expression	 court	or
judicial authority instead of choosing the expression the
Chief Justice or his nominee.  If a comparison is made with
the  English Arbitration Act 1996 it would appear that under
the  <a href="/doc/1003813/" id="a_40">English Act</a> it is the Court which has been vested	with
the function of appointment of an arbitrator upon failure of
the  agreed  appointment procedure and an order made by	 the
Court  becomes appealable under <a href="/doc/596725/" id="a_41">Section 11(5)</a> whereas  under
the  Arbitration  and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_42">Conciliation Act</a> of 1996 in India	 the
power of appointment is vested with the Chief Justice or his
nominee.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      An  analysis  of different sub-sections of <a href="/doc/1841764/" id="a_43">Section  11</a>
would  indicate the character of the order, which the  Chief
Justice	 or  his  nominee passes under	Sub-section  (6)  of
<a href="/doc/1841764/" id="a_44">Section	 11</a>.  Sub-section (3) and sub-section (4) deals with
cases,	in  which a party fails to appoint an arbitrator  or
the  arbitrators  fail to agree on the third arbitrator	 and
thus seeks to avoid frustration or unreasonable delay in the
matter	of  constitution  of   the  arbitral  tribunal.	  It
authorises  the Chief Justice of India or the Chief  Justice
of  a  High  Court concerned, or any person  or	 institution
designated  by him to make the appointment upon request of a
party,	if  the	 other	party	has  failed  to	 appoint  an
arbitrator  within thirty days from the receipt of a request
to  that  end.	Sub-<a href="/doc/354344/" id="a_45">sections 4</a>, <a href="/doc/310829/" id="a_46">5</a> and <a href="/doc/1660061/" id="a_47">6</a> designedly  use	 the
expression Chief Justice in preference to a Court or other
authority  as in paragraphs (3) and (4) of <a href="/doc/1678224/" id="a_48">Article 11</a> of the
Model  Law, obviously for the reason that the Chief  Justice
acting	in  his administrative capacity, is expected to	 act
quickly	 without  encroaching on the requirements that	only
competent persons are appointed as arbitrators.	 Sub-section
(4)  does not lay down any time limit within which the Chief
Justice	 or his nominee, designated by him, has to make	 the
appointment.   It  however expects that these  functionaries
would  act  promptly.  While sub-sections (4) and  (5)	deal
with  removal  of  obstacles  arising	in  the	 absence  of
agreement  between the parties on a procedure for appointing
the  arbitrator	 or arbitrators, sub- section (6)  seeks  to
remove obstacles arising when there is an agreed appointment
procedure.   These obstacles are identified in Clauses	(a),
</p><p id="p_5">(b)  and (c) of sub-section(6).	 Sub- section(6) provides  a
cure  to these problems by permitting the aggrieved party to
request	 the  Chief  Justice or any  person  or	 institution
designated  by	him to take the necessary measure  i.e.	  to
make   the   appointment,  unless   the	 agreement  on	 the
appointment  procedure provides other means for securing the
appointment.   Sub-section(6),	therefore, aims at  removing
any  dead-lock	or undue delay in the  appointment  process.
This being the position, it is reasonable to hold that while
discharging  the  functions under sub-section(6), the  Chief
Justice	 or his nominee will be acting in his administrative
capacity  and  such a construction would subserve  the	very
object of the new Arbitration Law.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      The  nature  of  the function performed by  the  Chief
Justice	 being	essentially to aid the Constitution  of	 the
Arbitration  Tribunal immediately and the legislature having
consciously  chosen to confer the power on the Chief Justice
and not a Court, it is apparent that the order passed by the
Chief  Justice or his nominee is an administrative order, as
has  been  held by this Court in Ador Samias case  and	the
observations  of  this Court in Sundaram Finance Ltd.	case
also  is  quite appropriate and neither of  those  decisions
require	 any re-consideration.	This being the position even
an  order  refusing  to appoint an arbitrator  will  not  be
amenable to the jurisdiction of this Court under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_49">Article 136</a>
of  the	 Constitution.	 Needless to mention such  an  order
refusing  to  appoint  an   arbitrator	after  deciding	 the
contentious  issues  would be an act of	 non-performance  of
duty  and  in  view  of what has  been	stated	earlier	 the
concerned authority could be directed by mandamus to perform
its duty.
</p>


<p id="p_7">      Having  answered	the two basic questions	 raised,  as
above,	let  us	 now  examine the  impugned  orders  in	 the
different  cases, which are before us.	In S.L.P.(Civil) No.
11522-11526  of 1999, the order of the learned Chief Justice
of  Bombay  High  Court in appointing an arbitrator  is	 the
subject matter of challenge.  Since the order of appointment
passed	by  the learned Chief Justice, is administrative  in
nature	and the learned Chief Justice does not function as a
Court  or a tribunal, the said order is not amenable to	 the
jurisdiction  of  this	Court  under   <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_50">Article	136</a>  of	 the
Constitution.	The special leave petitions, are accordingly
dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      Special  Leave Petition(Civil) No.19549/99 is directed
against	 the  order of the learned Chief Justice of  Gauhati
High  Court,  refusing	to   appoint  an  arbitrator,  after
entertaining contentious issues and deciding the said issues
by  elaborate  consideration, on a finding that there is  no
valid  agreement for arbitration.  Even if, it was not	open
for  the learned Chief Justice to entertain the	 contentious
issues	and deciding the same, but since the ultimate  order
is  administrative  in	nature, as has been held by  us	 and
since the learned Chief Justice does not function as a Court
or  Tribunal,  the  order,  cannot be  subject	to  judicial
scrutiny   of	this  Court  under   <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_51">Article  136</a>   of	 the
Constitution.	The aggrieved party however, has a remedy to
approach  the High Court for issuance of a writ of mandamus,
if so advised, in accordance with law.	It is clarified that
the  learned Chief Justice not having functioned as a  Court
or  Tribunal  and the order being administrative in  nature,
the  observations and findings are not binding and will	 not
be  taken into consideration by the Arbitral Tribunal, if an
objection  to validity or existence of Arbitration Agreement
is  taken  before  it.	Such objection, if taken,  shall  be
decided	 on  its  own merits.  The  special  leave  petition
stands rejected.
